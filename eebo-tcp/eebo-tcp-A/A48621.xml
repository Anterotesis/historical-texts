            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his very Worthy Friend
IOHN HAREWELL
In the Middle Temple Esquire.</head>
            <p>AS soon as my spare
houres were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of this birth;
I resolved it should be
yours. Not that you
cannot converse with
<hi>Lipsius</hi> when you please,
without the help of an
Interpreter: Nor that I
pretend by so slight
a present as this, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with him; who
<pb facs="tcp:66431:3"/>
ha's ever been ready to
perform me all the best
Offices that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from a generous
and disinterested friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
But, to speak
truth, I have done it in
a kind of tenderness to
my self: I know you
will look upon my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing
your name to this
Essay with other Eyes
than some others would;
and will interpret that
to be the Fruit of a
well-meaning affection;
which perhaps they
<pb facs="tcp:66431:3"/>
would have called the
bold effects of an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
presumption. Being also conscious to
my self, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
I have humbled that
mighty Genius, which
moves it self (with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and happy ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
as well as reason)
throughout almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
page of our Authour,
by the cheap and base
allay I have brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it: I determined to
appease his Manes, and
make him some amends
<pb facs="tcp:66431:4"/>
at least by the choice of
such a patronage as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
himself would not
have refused: I am sure
I do not flatter you,
when I say you are none
of those degenerate <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
whom <hi>Gildas</hi> their
own Country-man calls
<hi>aetatis atramentum;</hi> but such
a one as <hi>Lipsius</hi> himself
dothelse where describe.</p>
            <l>—In quo, veteris vestigia recti</l>
            <l>Et mores, video, ductos meliore metallo.</l>
            <l>In whom the prints of ancient worth
appear,</l>
            <l>And the choice draughts of manners
are as clear.</l>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66431:4"/>Go on Sir, and as
you have hither to very
happily avoided those
Rocks, whereupon
some others (in an Age
like yours, and through
the dangerous allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a fortune at
command) have fatally
split themselves: So let
every new accession of
years, bring along with
it such improvements,
as may force us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that you have more than acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
your self of all that
<pb facs="tcp:66431:5"/>
your youth had so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
promised. These
are such wishes as he
shall ever be prone to;

            <p>THese Books of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which I both began
and finished in the midst
of the troubles of my Country,
I thought meet to dedicate, and
devote to you; the great Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
of so great a City. Your
Dignity, Prudence, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
were the motives to it; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with that humanity of
<pb facs="tcp:66431:6"/>
yours which I have often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced,
and which is peculiar
to you; towards all that are
good and learned. You will
not I suppose disdain the gift;
which though small in it self,
will derive a kind of value from
the mind of the Donour: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I have given you the very
best, and greatest of such things,
as my Scholastical stores would
at this time afford. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
possibly the novelty of it
may some way recommend it.
For (if I am not mistaken) I
am the first, who have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the opening, and clearing of
<pb facs="tcp:66431:6"/>
this way of Wisdom, so long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and overgrown with
thorns; which certainly is such,
as (inconjunction with the holy
Scriptures) will lead us to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
and peace. For my
own part, I wanted not a desire,
to render my thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
to you; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the profit of others; if
I have not had the ability, it is
but reasonable, that you should
be as equal to me, as I am to the
great God; who I know hath
not given all things to any one.
Farewell.</p>

To the
READER,
Touching the design and End of this
TREATISE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am not ignorant of those new judgments
and censures I am likely to undergo in this
new way of writing: Partly, from such as
will be surprized with the unexpected pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of wisdom from him, whom they believed
had only been conversant in the more pleasing
and delightful studies; and partly from such as
will despise and undervalue all that can be said
in these matters, after what the ancients have
written. To both these; it is for my concern,
and no less for thine, that I should briefly reply.
The first sort of persons seem to me to miscarry
in two most different respects: in their care, and
their carelesness. In the former that they assume
to themselves a liberty of enquiring into the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and studies of others: In the latter, that
their enquiries are yet so overly and superficial.
For (that I may give them an account of me)
the Hills and Springs of the Muses did never so
<pb facs="tcp:66431:8"/>
intirely possess me; as that I should not find fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
opportunities to turn back my Eyes and
Mind upon that severer deity: I mean Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
The studies of which (even from my
Childhood) were so pleasing to me, that in this
youthful kind of ardour I seemed to offend, and
to stand in need of the bridle of restraint My
Tutors at <hi>Ubich</hi> know how all those kind of books,
were as it were forced out of my hands together
with those writings and commentaries which I
had laboriously composed out of all the best ranks
of interpreters. Nor certainly did I after ward
degenerate; for I know that in all the course of
my studies; if not in an exact and straight line,
yet at least in the flexure, I have tended towards
this mark of wisdom. Not after the rate of
most here that deal in Philosophy: who doting
upon some thorny subtilties, or snares of questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
do nothing else but weave and unweave
them with a kind of subtile thread of disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They rest in words, and some little falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
and wear away their dayes in the Porch
of Philosophy, but never visit its more retired
apartments. They use it as a divertisement,
not as a remedy, and turn the most serious instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life, into a sportage with trifles: Who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them seeks after the improvement of his
manners, the moderation of his affections; or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
a just end and measure for his fears or hopes.
<pb facs="tcp:66431:8"/>
Yes, they suppose that wisdome is so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in these things, that they think they do
nothing, or nothing to the purpose that look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, And therefore if you consider of their
life, and sentiments, amongst the vulgar them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
you shall find nothing more foul than the
one, nor more foolish than the other. For as
wine (though nothing is more wholsome) is yet to
some no better than poyson: So is Phylosophy to
them that abuse it. But my Mind was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
who always steering my Ship, from these
quick sands of subtilties, have directed all my
endeavours to attain that one Haven of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and quiet mind. Of which study of mine;
I mean these books as the first and undeceivable
instance. But say some others, these things have
been more fully and better treated of by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.
As to some of them I eonfess it: As to
all I deny it. Should I write any thing of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
or the affections after <hi>Seneca</hi> and the divine
<hi>Epictetus:</hi> I should have (my self being judge)
as little discretion as modesty: But if such things
as they have not so much as touched upon, nor
any other of the ancients (for I dare confidently
affirm it) then why do they despise it, or why do
they carp at it? I have sought out consolations
against publick evils: Who has done it before
me? Whether they look upon the matter, or the
method; they must confess they are indebted to
<pb facs="tcp:66431:9"/>
me for both: And for the words themselves (let
me say it) we have no such penury, as to oblige
us to become suppliants to any Man. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
let them understand I have written many
other things for others; but this book chiefly for
my self; the former for fame, but this for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
That which one heretofore said bravely and
acutely; the same I now truly proclaim. To
me a few Readers are enough, one is enough,
none is enough. All that I desire is, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
opens this book, may bring with him a
disposition to profit, and also to pardon. That
if possibly I have any where slipt (especially when
I endeavour to climb those steep places of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
Iustice and Fate) they would pardon me.
For certainly, I have no where erredout of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and obstinacy: But rather through humane
ignorance and infirmity. To conclude, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be informed by them, and I promise that
no Man shall be so ready to convince; as I to
correct. The other frailties of my nature, I
neither dissemble nor extenuate; but obstinacy
and the study of contention, I do heartily pray
I may never be guilty of, and I do detest it.
God send thee good health, my Reader; which I
wish may be in part to thee through this book.</p>

as I shall doubtless find ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to me, during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of my life. This, this I

of some Mists of Vulgar O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,

my Eyes; and shew'd me the vvay,
vvhereby without intricacy I might

                  <p>For one hot Afternoon (as being
towards the end of <hi>Iune</hi>) vvhile vve
vvalk'd in the Court before his House:
In very obliging Termes he ask'd me
concerning my Journey, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that had mov'd me to it. After
I had spoken many things vvith equal
Freedom and Truth, concerning the
troubles of <hi>Belgia:</hi> I told him at last,
that howsoever I had pretended an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
yet this vvas the very Reason
of my departure. For vvho, O <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
said I, is there to be found of so
flinty and hard a heart; as longer to
endure these evils? We are toss'd as
you see, for so many Years together
in the stormes of a Civil War: and
are vvhirl'd up and down in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous
Sea vvith the different Winds
of Trouble and Sedition. Doth my
temper incline me to ease and quiet?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66431:11"/>
The hoarce accents of Trumpets, and
the clashings of Armes, do speedily
interrupt me. Do I seek my Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements
in the Country or Gardens?
The Souldier and Swash-buckler soon
fright me into the City. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
O <hi>Langius,</hi> leaving this infested
and unfortunate <hi>Belgia</hi> (pardon me O
thou Genius of my Country) I am
resolv'd (as he saies) to shift my Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation;
and to fly into any part of
the Earth, where I may neither hear
of the name or actions of this Race of
<hi>Pelops. Langius</hi> admiring and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
mov'd; Is it true then <hi>Lipsius,</hi>
saies he, that you will needs depart
from us? Either from you or most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
from this Life, reply'd I.
For what Sanctuary is there from these
Evils, but only in the flight of them?
For to behold them and endure them
daily I am not able <hi>Langius,</hi> as being
one whose heart you may be sure is
not composed of Adamant. <hi>Langius</hi>
sigh'd at this discourse; and feeble
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66431:11"/>
Young Man said he, what kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy
is this? Or what may be thy
meaning to seek for safety by flight?
I acknowledge your Country is full
of Trouble and Turmoile; but vvhat
part of <hi>Europe</hi> is that which is at this
day free? Insomuch as you may truly
praesage according to that of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi>

                  <l>Things that are high with awfull frown</l>
                  <l>High-thundring <hi>Jove</hi> will tumble down.</l>
                  <p>And therefore not so much our
Country (<hi>Lipsius</hi>) as our Passions are
to be fled: and this Mind of ours is to
be so fram'd and establish'd, as that vve
may find repose in the midst of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and peace in the midst of Warrs.
They are rather to be fled, <hi>Langius,</hi>
(reply'd I with an ardour Youthfull
enough) for certainly those evils that
vve hear of, do more lightly affect us,
than those vve behold: and withall
our selves (as they say) are out of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot

                  <argument>
                     <p>That Travaile availes not against those
Diseases which are within us. It
is rather a Symptome than a Cure: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in some first and light motion of
the Affections.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>YEs I hear him, said <hi>Langius,</hi> vvith
a kind of Nod: but I had rather
you would hear the Voice of Wisdom
and Reason. For those Clouds and
Mists vvhich enwrap you <hi>Lipsius,</hi> are
ingendered by the Vapours of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And therefore in this Case (as
<hi>Diogenes</hi> saies) you have more need of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66431:12"/>
Reason than a Rope: I mean such a
ray as may enlighten the darkness of
your understanding. You are about
to leave your Country, but tell me se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,
vvhen you forsake it, can you
also forsake your self? Take heed lest
you experience the contrary; and
carry with you even in that bosome of
yours, the source and fountain of all
your evils. As those who are sick of
a Feaver do continually toss and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and shift their Beds, with a vain
hope of finding some ease thereby: In
the same manner it is vvith us, who
do in vain pass from one Climate to
another; vvhile the sickness is in our
Minds. For this is to manifest, not
to remove the disease: to make a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of this Internal heat; but not
at all to asswage it. The wise Roman
speaks excellently vvell. 'Tis the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the sick not to endure any
thing long: and to make use of change
it self, instead of a Remedy. Hence
are those straggling peregrinations, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66431:13"/>
those wandring Voyages upon the
Shores undertaken: Now by Land,
and anon by Sea; vvith a levity that
is ever disgusted vvith vvhatsoever is
present. You do therefore rather fly
than escape troubles, after the manner
of that Hind in <hi>Virgil</hi>

                  <l>VVhich (while unwary she at distance feeds</l>

                  <l>And through <hi>Dictaean</hi> woods and groves
she flies:</l>
                  <p>But all in vain; for as the same Poet
addes.
<q>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis thus with you, who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardly
smitten vvith this dart of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
do not by travell shake it out:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66431:13"/>
but rather carry it elsewhere. He that
ha's broke an Arm or Leg does not
use to call for a Horse or Coach, but
for a Chirurgion: What kind of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
then is that of yours; that causes
you to seek the Cure of an inward
vvound, by motion and gadding up
and down? For certainly it is the mind
vvhich is sick; and all this outward
vveakness, despair and langour, arises
from this one Fountain, that it lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
and is cast down. That
Princely and Diviner part hath cast
away the Scepter; and hath humbled
it self to that Degree of baseness; as
to become a voluntary slave to its own
Vassailes.</p>
                  <p>Tell me now in this Case; vvhat
advantage is to be hop'd for, from
Place or Motion? Unless possibly there
is any such Region, vvhich can tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
our Fears, or bridle our hopes; or
make us discharge our selves again of
that filthy matter of Vices, vvhich we
have so liberally taken down. But
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66431:14"/>
there is alass no such, no not in the
Fortunate Islands themselves; or if
there be, be so kind as to shew us it,
and vve vvill all embody and forthvvith
march thither. You vvill say that
very Motion, and change of place it
self hath that force; and that those
daily sights, that variety of Customes
men and places, vvhich vve meet vvith
in travell; doth recreate and rouse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
the dejected Mind.</p>
                  <p>You are deceiv'd <hi>Lipsius,</hi> for (to
speak seriously and as the matter doth
require) I do not so far forth depress
travail as to grant it no kind of povver
over Man, and his Affections. Yes,
let it be yielded that it hath, but
hitherto only, that it may possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
some lighter taedium; or as it
vvere loathings of the Mind: but as
for the Diseases of it, they have lodg'd
themselves so deep therein, as to
mock the Virtues of any external Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.
Musick, Wine, Sleep have
frequently cur'd those first and lesser
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66431:14"/>
Motions of Anger, Grief, or Love:
But never the Disease, vvhen once it
hath been fix'd and hath fastned its
Roots deep. The case is the same
here; Travail vvill possibly heal some
lighter languors, but it can never cure
the true ones. For those First Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vvhich do arise from the Body,
do after a sort still remain in the Body;
or at most (if I may say so) in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of the Mind: and therefore
it is no marvail, if some lesser spunge
be able to vvipe them out. But it is
not so vvith those inveterate Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
vvhich have their Seat, yea
throne in the very Soul of the Mind.
When therefore you have gone far,
and spent much time in travail, vvhen
you have circled both Sea and Land:
Yet no Seas vvill suffice to vvash them
out, nor any Earth to overvvhelme
them. They vvill follovv you, and
vvhether on Foot or on Horse-back,
that I may use the Phrase of the Poet;
these black cares vvill sit behind you.

When <hi>Socrates</hi> vvas ask'd by one vvhat
might be the Reason that he had no

he answer'd him pertinently;

                  <argument>
                     <p>That the true Diseases of the Mind
are not removed by travail; but are
thereby the more exasperated. That
it is the Mind which is sick; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for which is to be sought for
from VVisdom and Constancy.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>YOu vvill say then: doth not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
call us away from those tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
evils? vvill not the prospect of
Fields, Rivers, and Mountains place
us beyond the sense of our Grief?
They may possibly call you off; and
place you beyond: but neither for any
time not vvith any firmness. As the
eye is not long delighted with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
how excellent soever: So all that
varietic of Men and places, may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
us vvith the Novelty; but it vvill
not last long. This is indeed a kind
of vvandring from Evils; but not the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66431:16"/>
flight of them: Nor is it in the power
of travail to break; all it can do is to
lengthen, this Chain of our Griefs.
What advantage is it to me for a vvhile
to behold the Light, and then forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith
to pass into some comfortless
Dungeon? Such is the case; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
the vvhole Body of these outward
pleasures do lie in ambush for the
Soul; and hurt us the more securely,
vvhile they pretend to assist us. As
the vveaker sort of Medicines do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exasperate than draw forth the
peccant humour: So this vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencie
doth encrease and svvell the
Tide of these desires in us. For the
Mind doth not long vvander from it
self; but by and by how unvvilling
soever is compell'd to return home,
unto its old familiaritie vvith Evils.
Those very Cities and Mountains
vvhich you go to see; vvill reduce to
your thoughts the Memory of your
Country: And in the midst of all your
delights; you vvill either see or hear
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66431:16"/>
of something, vvhich vvill unclose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
the vvounds of your Griefes: Or
if possibly you may rest avvhile; it
vvill prove but like to one of those
shorter slumbers; that leave the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaked
party, in the same or a greater
Feaver. For there are a sort of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
which being interrupted do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the more: And are sensibly
the stronger for having had Vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Away then <hi>Lipsius</hi> vvith these vain
yea dangerous experiments; more like
to poysons than remedies: And betake
your self to those, vvhich how severe
soever, are yet the true ones. Are
you about to change your Soile and
Climb? O rather let it be your Mind:
vvhich you have unhappily withdrawn
from the Obedience of Right Reason:
for no other purpose than to make it
a Slave to your Affections. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound
temper of that is the Root of
this despair; and thence are your
languors because that is corrupted.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66431:17"/>
It behoves you then rather to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
a change of that, than of the
place; and to strive not so much to
be else where, as to be another. You
long now to see the fruitfull <hi>Austria,</hi>
the Loyal and Stout <hi>Vienna,</hi> that King
of Rivers the <hi>Danubius,</hi> and those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rare and strange things vvhich
Men so delightfully listen to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of.</p>
                  <p>But hovv much better were it
for you, if you had the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and eagerness after Wisdome?
If you vvould foot it in those fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Fields; if you would search out
the springs of Humane perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
in fine, if you vvould erect such
Bulvvarks and Forts; as might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you impregnable to all the
storms and assaults of such desires
as are Illegitimate? For these are the
grand Remedies for your Disease;
and every thing besides are but
as Lint and Lavatory. Your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
vvill nothing help you; It vvill
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66431:17"/>
be small advantage to you that you
have</p>
                  <l>Escap'd to many Graecian Cities, and</l>

                  <p>You vvill find an Enemy vvithin
your self; and Claying his hand on my

What matter is it how peaceable
those places are to which you shall
arrive: So long as you carry a War
along vvith you? Or how quiet?
When troubles not only surround you;
but are got vvithin you. For this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
Mind of ours, vvill ever be
piquering vvith it self: Desiring and
flying; hoping and desparing. And
as those flying Cowards do most of

did never maintain a fight vvith their

Affections but alwayes fled before

Do you only attend and consider. I
did before invite you to Constancy, <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
and it is in that I have placed the
Hope and Sanctuary of all your Safety.
This therefore in the first place is to
be understood by us. Now by Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
I here understand; AN UPRIGHT
UNMOVED STRENGTH OF
THE MIND; NEITHER E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEVATED
NOR DEPRESS'D
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66431:19"/>
BY EXTERNAL OR ACCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENTAL
OCCURREN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CES.
I said a STRENGTH, and
I thereby understand such a firmness
as is begot in the Mind, not by O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
but by Judgement and right
Reason. For above all things I would
exclude from hence Pervicaciousness
(or vvhether I may better call it Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciousness)
vvhich it self is the
strength of an Obedient Mind, but
such only as is engender'd by the
vvind of Pride and vain Glory; and
is but in one part of it only. For
those Pervicacious Persons though
they are not (swollen as they are) easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be depress'd: Yet a light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth lift them up. Not unlike
unto a bladder vvhich being fill'd vvith
vvind vvill not sink vvithout difficulty;
but appears aloft, and bounds upon
the Water of its own accord. Such
is the flatulent hardness of these Men;
vvhich as I said arises from Pride, and
too high an estimate of self, and by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66431:19"/>
consequence from Opinion. But the
true Mother of Constancy, is Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and lowliness of the Mind;
vvhich I define; A VOLUNTARY
AND COMPLAINTLESSE EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DURANCE
OF ALL THOSE
THINGS WHATSOEVER THEY
BE, THAT FALL OUT TO,
OR FALL UPON A MAN FROM
ELSEWHERE. Which being
taken up, upon the actount of right
Reason, is that only Root, from
vvhence the height of this excellent
Oak-like strength doth vvear it self.
For here also it is requisite that you
should be heedfull, lest Opinion
should impose upon you, vvhich fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in the room of Patience doth
subrogate a kind of abject and stupid
temper of the Mind; a very Vice, and
vvhich arises from too low an estimate
of our selves. As for Virtue she ever
marches in the middle path, and is
cautiously heedfull lest there should
be any thing of Excess or Defect in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66431:20"/>
any of her Actions. For still she di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
her self by the Ballance of right
Reason, and hath that alone for the

every of those things for vvhich vve
are accounted praise-worthy, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable
amongst Men: I suppose I
shall not do amiss, if I go about a little
more copiously to Discourse of the
Original and Nature of them both.
For as Wools must have a previous
tincture and preparation by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
juices; before they are capable
of receiving as they should that last
and more excellent colour they are
intended for: After the same manner,
<hi>Lipsius,</hi> your Mind is to be prepared
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66431:21"/>
by a preceding Discourse; before I
shall be able (as I vvould) to dye it
in the last purple of Constancy. There
are therefore (as you vvell know) two
parts in Man, Soul and Body: the
one more Noble as resembling Spirit
and Office; the other is more Base
as it respects the earth: These two
are joyn'd together, yet vvith a kind
of disagreeing Concord, nor do they
easily accord vvith one another, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in those matters wherein Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
or subserviency is concern'd.
For both have a desire to sway;
but that especially that ought not.
Earth strives to advance it self above
its own fire; and Clodds are ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to get above the Clouds. From
hence are those broils and troubles
in a Man; and as it vvere a continual
fight, betwixt two parties that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes
Skirmishing vvith each other.
The chief Leaders, and as it vvere
Generalls unto these are Reason and
Opinion. The one is for the Soul
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66431:21"/>
and Warres therein; the other is for
the Body, and in the Body it fights.
Reason derives its Pedigree from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
yea from God himself, and very
highly doth <hi>Seneca</hi> extoll it, as a part
of the Divine Spirit infused into Man.
For this is that most excellent faculty
of understanding and judging, vvhich
is no less the perfection of the Soul,
than the Soul it self is the perfection
of the Man. The Greeks call it the
Mind, and so the Latines, or else the
Mind of the Soul. For (that you be
not mistaken) the vvhole Soul is not
right Reason; but that only therein
vvhich is simple, Uniform, unmixed,
sever'd from all Lees and Dreggs, and
(in a vvord) that vvhich is in it of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and coelestial. For the Soul it
self (howsoever it is lamentably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and infected, vvith the stain
of the Body, and the contagion of
the Senses) doth yet invvardly retain
some certain Footsteps of its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:
and there are in it (very clearly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66431:22"/>
discernible) some sparkling remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of that first and purer fire. Hence
are those stings of Conscience even
in the vvorst and most profligate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
Hence are those invvard scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and gnawings; and hence is that
approbation of a better Life, vvhich
is frequently extorted from them,
though not vvithout a reluctancy in
themselves. For that sound and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer
part vvithin us, may possibly for
a time be suppressed, oppressed it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.
And that burning Flame may
be cover'd; but cannot be extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For those little Fires do alwayes
shine forth, and sparkle out, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
us amongst these shades, cleanse
us from these stains; guide us in our
vvandrings; and to shew us the vvay
to Constancy and Virtue. As the
<hi>Heliotrope</hi> and some other Flowers
do by a natural instinct bend towards
the Sun: So doth Reason turn it self
to God and the Original of its self.
Firm and immoveable in vvhat is good,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66431:22"/>
one and the same in its Censures; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
desiring or flying one and the
same thing, the very source and
Fountain of right Councel and sound
Judgement. To obey this is no less
than to command, and to be subject
here is to svvay the Scepter of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse.
Who ever hearkens unto
this hath already subjugated the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
desires and motions of the
Mind: And he shall never be wildred
in the Labyrinths of this Life, vvho
remits himself to the guideance of
this <hi>Theseian</hi> Clevv. God himself by
this his Image comes unto us (nay
vvhich is yet more) into us. But that
baser and unsounder part (I mean
Opinion) it owes its Original to the
Body (that is to say) to Earth, and
therefore savours nothing besides it.
For the Body howsoever it is immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and senseless of it self; yet it
derives both Life and Motion from the
Soul; and on the other side presents
to the Soul, the Images of things
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66431:23"/>
through the Windowes of the senses.
Thus there is a kind of Communion
and Society Cemented betwixt the
Soul and the Body: but such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
as if vve attend the Event,
proves unfortunate to the Soul. For
through this it is that the Soul, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
insensible degrees, is led from
the Nobler place of its residence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
addicted to and is mingled
vvith the Senses, and from this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
mixture, is the birth of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
vvhich is no other than a vain
shaddow, and resemblance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The true seat of it is Sense, the
Parent, Earth; and therefore abject
and base as it is, it advances not it
self, it aspires not, nor so much as
regards any thing that is lofty and AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therial.
It is ever vain, uncertain,
deceitfull, ill-advising, and as perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly
judging: and that vvhich it chiefly
aimes at, is at once to deprive the
Soul of Constancy and Truth. It
languishes for this thing to day, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66431:23"/>
on the Morrow despises it, this it
approves and this it condemnes; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vvith judgement, but gratifying
the Body and indulging the Senses
in every thing. As the Eye makes
but a false measure of those things
vvhich it beholds through some Cloud
or in the Water: So doth the Mind
but perversly judge of vvhat it beholds
through the misty Mediums of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
This (if you consider vvell)
is to Man the Mother of his Evils;
and this is the Author of that confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and perturbed Life vvithin us.
That cares do disquiet us, it is from
hence; that the Passions do distract
us, it is from hence; and if Vices do
Reign over us, it is also from hence.
And therefore as those vvho are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to abolish Tyranny in any City,
do first of all demolish the Castle: So
if vve are Serious in the prosecution
of a good Mind, vve must subvert
this Citadel of Opinions. For vve
shall fluctuate vvith them for ever: Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

Plaintfull, Discompos'd, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
(as vve ought) assigning vvhat is
equall either to God or Man. As a
void and empty Ship, is tossed in the
Sea, vvith every wind: So vvill that
Vagrant Mind of ours be, vvhich the
vveight, and (as it vvere) the ballast of
Reason hath not established.</p>

                  <p>WHen <hi>Langius</hi> had spoken these

this desirable fire did seise on me also.
And my Father said I (for I call you

and direct me. You have a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
prepared for any method of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
vvhether you shall determine
to make use of the Caustick, or shall
proceed to Amputation. Both these
reply'd <hi>Langius,</hi> in as much as in some
places the stubble of idle Opinions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66431:26"/>
is to be set on fire, and elsewhere the
shrubs of Passions are to be grubb'd
up by the very Roots. But shall vve
continue our vvalk; or whether is it not
better and most convenient for us to
sit? To sit reply'd I, for I begin to be
hot, and that upon divers accounts:
So assoon as <hi>Langius</hi> had caus'd
Chairs to be brought into the same
Court, and that vve vvere both sate;
turning himself towards me, he again
thus began.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto <hi>Lipsius</hi> I have been laying
the Foundations vvhereupon I might
safely erect my discourse: Now if you
vvill I shall draw a little nearer to you,
enquire out the causes of your Grief,
and as they say, lay my Finger upon
they very sore. There are two things
that lay Battery to this fort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
vvithin us. False Goods and
false Ills. Both vvhich I thus define.
THINGS NOT WITHIN BUT
ABOUT US and WHICH PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERLY
DO NEITHER DAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AGE
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66431:26"/>
NOR ADVANTAGE THIS
OUR INWARD MAN THAT
IS OUR SOUL. And therefore
I vvill not call them Good or Evil;
as if they were so absolutely and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply:
But only from Opinion and the
common mistake of the Vulgar. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the First they Ranke Riches,
Honours, Power, Health, Long-life.
Amongst the Last Poverty, Infamy,
vvant of Power, Diseases and Deaths;
and in a vvord vvhatsoever is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and external. From these two
stocks those four chief Affections grow
up in us vvhich compass and perplex
the vvhole life of Man. Desire and Joy,
Fear and Grief. The two former of
these respect some imagined good;
and thence are bred: the two last
respect supposed evils. Each of them
do equally hurt and molest the Mind:
and unless care be taken to dethrone
it; though not after one and the same
manner. For vvhereas the repose and
Constancy of the Mind is placed in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66431:27"/>
a kind of even and equall ballance;
they force it from this poise, the one
by hoisting, and the other by depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it. But these false goods together
vvith the Elation of the Mind by
them, I shall purposely pass over (as
not concerning your Disease) and
hasten to those I call false evils; The
Brigade of vvhich is also twofold:
Publick and Private. The Publick
I thus define; SUCH AS THE
SENSE OF WHICH, DOTH
AT ONE AND THE SAME
TIME EXTEND TO MANY.
The Private; SUCH AS REACH
BUT TO SINGLE PERSONS.
Amongst the former I reckon Warrs,
Pestilence, Famine, Tyranny, Slaught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and such other things as spread
abroad; and do respect the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
Amongst the latter I put Grief,
Poverty, Disgrace, Death; and what
ever is enclos'd within private vvalls,
and is the concernment of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
person. It is not upon any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66431:27"/>
frivolous account that I thus distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish.
Forasmuch, as indeed that Man
mourns otherwise and in a different
Fashion vvho laments the Calamity
of his Country, the Exile and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of many; than he vvho only
sighs for his own misfortunes. Add
to this, that from each of these
do arise different Distempers, and
if I mistake not, the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and durable from the former.
For most of us are concern'd in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Calamities; vvhether it is that
they rush upon us vvith an impetuous
vehemence: Or as it vvere in a form'd
Battalia do overwhelm the Opposer,
or rather that they flatter us vvith a
kind of Ambition, that keeps us ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and insensible, that through
them a sickness is bred in our Minds.
For vvhoever he is that bows under
a private Grief, he must of necessity
acknowledge his vice and vveakness;
although he amend it not, for vvhat
excuse hath he? But he vvho falls
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66431:28"/>
under this other; so farr is he many
times from the acknowledgement of
his fall and fault, that he often makes
it his boast, and esteems it a praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
thing. For it is styl'd Piety
and Commiseration, and there vvants
but little; that this publick Feaver is
not consecrated not only amongst the
Virtues; but the very Deities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The Poets and Oratours
do everyvvhere extoll and inculcate
the servent Love of our Country:
Nor do I my self desire altogether to
erase it, but to temper and moderate
it; this is all that I contend for. For
assuredly it is a very vice, a Disease,
the very fall of the Mind, and the
casting of it down from its seat. But
vvithall on the other side, it is a very
grievous Disease, inasmuch as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is not a single Grief only,
but your own and anothers confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that other is also double,
respecting the Men, or the Country.</p>
                  <p>That you may the better apprehend
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66431:28"/>
what I have more obscurely deliver'd
take this instance. You see your <hi>Belgia</hi> is at
this time press'd vvith more than a single
Calamity; the Flames of this Civil vvar
doth enwrap it on every side: You
see on all hands that Fields are vvasted
and spoiled, Towns are burnt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned;
men are taken and slain; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
are defiled; Virgins ravished, and
vvhatsoever inhumanities use to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
vvarr. Is not here matter of Grief
to you? Grief indeed; but a various and
divided one (if you consider it vvell; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as at one and the same time, you
lament your self, and your Countrymen,
and your Country besides. In your self
your losses, in your Countrymen their
various Fortune and Death, in your
Country, the change and overthrow of
its State. Here you have cause to cry
out; O miserable man that I am! there
<q>
                        <l>So many of my Countrymen must stand,</l>
                        <l>The shock of Plagues brought by a hostile

and lastly elsewhere: My Father! My
Country! So that he vvho is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
vvith these things: he on whom

out your vvhole Forces into the

these are Simulation, Piety and Pitty:
I'le begin vvith Simulation.</p>
                  <p>You are not able you say to endure

self. Are you in good earnest, or
vvhether is not there here some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture

little heated: Nay said I do you ask
this in earnest, or vvhether is it mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
of my Grief, and on purpose to
provoke me? I am serious reply'd he,
for there are not a few of this Spittle
of yours that impose upon their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
and Counterfeit a publick
Grief vvhich yet in reality is but a
private one. I demand therefore
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66431:30"/>

<q>
                        <l>VVhich deeply rooted in your brest</l>

                     </q>
be taken up by you, upon your
Countryes account, or only upon your

I mourn solely upon the account of
my Country, my Country <hi>Langius.</hi>
He shaking his head as unsatisfyed;
consider of it again and again Young
Man said he; I shall vvonder to find
in you so excellent and sincere a Piety,
for certainly it is to be met vvith, but
in a very few. I acknowledge it is
usuall for Men to complain of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
evils; nor is there any Grief so
common, and (as I may so say) that
doth sooner shew it self in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:
But if you examine it a little
more nearly; you shall soon discover
some disagreement betwixt the heart
and the tongue. The Calamity of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66431:30"/>
my Country doth affect me; are
vvords more ambitious than true:
born in the Lips rather than in the
Reines. That vvhich is reported of
<hi>Polus</hi> the Famous Actour, that vvhen
he was to play such a part at <hi>Athens</hi>
as required to be presented vvith a
remarkable passion; he privily brought
in the Urne and Bones of his dead
Son, and so fill'd the vvhole Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
vvith unfeigned Lamentations
and Tears; the same may be said of
most of you. You play your parts
in a Comedy (my Friends) and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised
in the masking Face of your
Country; you lament your private
losses vvith the truest and most live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Tears; The vvhole World saies
<hi>Arbiter</hi> are employ'd in a Stage-play:
I am sure it is so here. This Civil
Warr (say they) torments us, the
shedding of innocent blood, and the
decease of Liberty and the Laws. Say
ye so? I perceive indeed your Grief,
I now ask and enquire of the cause
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66431:31"/>
of it. Is it because Publick matters
are but in an Evil case? Away vvith
thy vizzard thou Stage-player; for
it is because thy own concernments
are so. We have often seen the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks
tremble and throng together
unto the Temples, upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of some sudden and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Calamity; but so soon as it is
over, call aside those very men; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
them apart, and you vvill find
that each of these vvas in fear only
for his Corn, and some little Close
of his own. Let them cry Fire, Fire,
in this City, and I may almost affirm
that the very Blind and the Lame
vvill run to quench it. But vvhat
think you? Is it for the Love of their
Country? Inquire of themselves I
pray, and the answer vvill be because
the loss, or at least the fear of it doth
extend to every Man in particular.
It is in this case, after the very same
manner: Publick evils do generally
afflict and disquiet Men; not because
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66431:31"/>
many are concern'd in those losses:
but because themselves are amongst
those many.</p>

Do you indeed feare this Warre?
You do feare it. Upon what account?
Because Pestilence and Slaughter are
the companions of Warre. To whom
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66431:32"/>
comes that Pestilence? To others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for the present, but it may also
in time reach unto you. Behold
there the true source of your Grief;
and (if without the rack you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
the truth) it hath no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
For as when the lightning hath
strook down some one; even those
also tremble who are near: so in those
great and Common Calamities, the
losse arrives unto few; but the fear
unto all. Now take but that away,
and together with it this grief also is
removed. If Warre be amongst the
<hi>AEthiopians</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> you are not
mov'd at all (for you are in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)
but if in <hi>Belgia,</hi> then you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and take on, and deliver up
your self to all the expressions of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
But if you bewaile Publick
evills as such; where lyes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence?
you will say that is not my
Country. Thou Fool! Are not they
also men? of the same stock and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
with they self? under the same
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66431:32"/>
Canopy of heaven; and on the same
Globe of Earth? suppose you that
this little Horizon which these moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
terminate, and these Rivers
bound, is your Country? you are
mistaken; It is the whole World,
wheresoever there are men sprung
from that celestial seed. <hi>Socrates</hi> of
old reply'd excellently to one that
ask'd him of what Country he was:
of the World said he. For a great
and lofty mind includes not it self
within the narrow limits of opinion:
but in its apprehension and thought
embraces this whole universe as its
own. We have seen and derided the
folly of such; whose keepers have tyed
them in a nooz of stravv only; or
some slender thread: and yet they
have stood as if they vvere shackl'd in
fetters of iron: such a kind of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is this of ours: vvho by the vain
bond of opinion are restrain'd to a
certain part of earth. But to omit
these stronger vvayes of reasoning
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66431:33"/>
(in regard I fear you are not yet able
to concoct them) I shall adde this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Suppose that some god should
promise you, that during this vvar,
your fields should be untouch'd; your
house and mony safe, and your self
set on some mountains top, folded
in one of <hi>Homers</hi> clouds: vvould you
grieve still? I vvill not say it of you, but
there are a sort of men, that vvould
even rejoice, and greedily feed their
eyes vvith the confused slaughter of
dying men. What do you deny
this, or seem to vvonder at it? I tell
you there is a kind of inbred malice
in the disposition of mankind; vvhich
as the old Poet speakes
<q>Ioyes at another mans calamities.</q>
And as there are a sort of Apples,
vvhich to the tast are svveetly sovvre:
such are other mens perplexities
vvhen our selves are secure. Set me
but a man on such a shore of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66431:33"/>
Ocean vvhere he may behold a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvrack,
he vvill possibly be affected,
but not vvithout a certain pleasing ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillation
of the Mind; as one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
other Mens extremities vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his ovvn: But place the same
Man in the same endangered Ship,
and then hee'l grieve (I'le vvarrant
ye) after another fashion. It is the
same here vvhen vve have said and
done all that vve can: And vve do
bevvaile our ovvn Miseries truly and
unfeignedly; vvhile vve lament those
that are publick only to be talk'd of,
or because it is a custom. Excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <hi>Langius</hi> smiling, and what said he
do you then expect at my hands, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
or Muscadell? It is not long
since you call'd for the sharpest Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Chirurgery; And rightly,
for you hear a Philosopher <hi>Lipsius</hi>
and not a Minstrel; vvhose design is
to teach, not to entertain, to profit,
and not to please. I had rather you
should blush and be asham'd, than
laugh: and that you should repent
rather than triumph. The School
of a Philosopher, O yea Men (said
<hi>Rufus</hi> of old) is the shop of a physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
vvhereunto Men hasten for health
and not for Divertisement. This Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
neither flatters nor smooths up
any, but pierces, tents, and searches
the vvound, and vvith a kind of sharp
Salt of Speech, fcoures away that
Scurfe that cleaves to our Minds.
And therefore <hi>Lipsius</hi> dream not (no
not hereafter) of Roses, Pulse, and
Poppyes, but of Thorns and Poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
of Worme-wood and Vinegar.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66431:35"/>
But said I <hi>Langius</hi> (if I may say it) you
deal with me in an ill and malicious
manner: Nor do you as a skilfull
vvrastler cast me upon a right lock;
but supplant me by a cheat. In a
counterfeit manner (say you) vve la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
our Country. Do I? It is not
so. For to grant you this (as one that
means ingeniously) that I have therein
a respect unto my self, yet not unto
my self alone. For I do lament <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi>
I do lament my Country in the
First place, and I vvill lament it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the midst of its hazzards,
there should be no danger to me. And
that upon the justest grounds, for this
is she vvhich hath entertain'd, foster'd,
and nourish'd me; and is according
to the common sence of Nations our
most Reverend and Venerable Parent.
But in the mean time you assign me
the whole Universe as my Country.
Who doubts it? But yet even your
self vvill confess, that besides this vast
and common one, I have another
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66431:35"/>
more limited and peculiar Country;
unto vvhich by a certain secret bond
of Nature I have a nearer Obligation.
Unless you do imagine that there is
no force in our being swath'd and
suckl'd in that our Native soil, vvhich
vve have first greeted vvith this Body
of ours; and first set foot upon,
vvhose Air vve have breath'd; in which
our Infancy hath cri'd, our Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
play'd, and in vvhich our youth
hath been educated and trained up.
Where the Skies and Rivers, and
Fields are familiar with our eyes:
wherein in a continued order, are
our Kindred and Friends, and Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates:
and so many other invitations
unto Joy; as vve in vain hope to meet
vvith in any other place of the Earth.
Nor are these tyes (as you seem to
assert) from the slender threads of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
but from the strong Chains
of Nature it self. Go to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
themselves and behold the vvild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
among them do love and own the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66431:36"/>
places vvhere they lodge, and the
Birds their Nests. The very Fishes
themselves, in that vast and boundless
Ocean, do yet delight in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of some certain part of it. For
what should I speak of Men? Who
vvhether they are civiliz'd or still in
Barbarisme; are yet so glew'd to their
Native Earth, that whosoever is a Man
will never doubt to dye for, and in it.
And therefore <hi>Langius</hi> this new and
rigid Wisdom of yours, (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)

I am rather the Disciple of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LAngius</hi> smiling at this discourse;
Young Man (said he) your Piety
is vvonderful, and now it concernes
the Brother of <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> to
look after his Sir-name. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it falls out vvell, that this
Affection doth so readily present it self
and advance before its colours, vvhich
I had before determin'd to charge and
to overthrow with some light endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
But in the first place I must
seize upon as spoil that very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Garment wherewith it hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
attyr'd it self: For this Love
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66431:37"/>
unto our Country is commonly call'd
Piety; vvhich for my part as I do not
understand, so neither am I able to
endure. For how comes it to be
Piety? Which I acknowledge to be
an excellent Virtue, and properly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but A LAWFUL, DUE,
HONOUR AND LOVE TO
GOD, AND OUR PARENTS.
With vvhat Fore-head now doth our
Country seat it self in the midst of
these? Because say they it is that
vvhich is our most Ancient and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Parent. Ah silly Souls! And
herein injurious not only to Reason
but also unto Nature it self. Is that
a Parent? Upon vvhat account, or
in vvhat respect? For I profess I see
not, if you <hi>Lipsius</hi> are any sharper
sighted, help to enlighten me. Is it
because it hath entertain'd us (for
that you seem'd to insinuate but now)
the like hath been done to us often
by an Host or Inkeeper. Hath it
cherish'd us? So have our Nurses, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66431:37"/>
those Women that, vvhen time vvas,
bare us too and fro, vvith a farre
greater tenderness. Hath it nourish'd
us? This Office it performs daily to
Beasts and Trees, and all sorts of
Grain, and so do also those great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes;
Heaven, Air and VVater, as
vvell as the Earth. To conclude,
transport your self, and any other
soil vvill performe the same. These
are frothy light vvords, from vvhich
nothing can be extracted besides a
certain vulgar and unprofitable juice
of Opinion. Those are indeed our
Parents, vvho have conceiv'd, begot,
and gone vvith us; to vvhom vve are
seed of their seed, blood of their
blood, and flesh of their flesh. Of all
vvhich if there is any thing vvhich in
any degree of comparison, may be
fitly spoken of our Country: I am
willing that all my attempts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this kind of Piety, should prove
but lost labour. But (say you) there
are many learned and great Men, who
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66431:38"/>
every vvhere have spoken after this
fashion. I acknowledge it, but
it vvas then vvhen they had respect
to Fame only, not to truth; vvhich
if you vvill follow, you shall restore
back that Sacred and August Name
unto God; or (if you please) to your
Parents, and command this Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(vvhen it is corrected) to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
vvith the honest name of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
But thus far concerning the
name only, let us now consider the
thing; vvhich truly I shall not vvholly
remove, but moderate, and pare (as
it vvere) vvith the Pen-knife of Right
Reason. For as the Vine unless you
prune it, vvill very vvidely extend it
self: So vvill those Affections more
especially, vvhose Sails are swell'd vvith
any gust of popularity. And I readily
confess to you <hi>Lipsius</hi> (for I have not
so put off at once, both the Man and
the Citizen) that there is in every
one of us, a kind of inclination and
Love to this lesser country of ours:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66431:38"/>
the causes and Original of vvhich I
perceive are not so clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by you. For you vvill have it
to be from Nature, vvhereas it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
from a kind of usage and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.
For after that Men from that
rude and solitary life, vvere forc'd
from the Fields into Towns, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to build Houses and Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to grow into Societies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Bodies, to make or repell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions:
From that time there did
of necessity commence amongst them,
a kind of Communion and Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
as to divers things. They toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
possess'd such a part of Earth
vvith such and such limits: They had
their Temples, Market-places, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries
and Courts of Judicature in
Common; and (vvhich is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
bond) their Rites, Statutes, and
Lawes. Which things yet our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes,
did so begin to love and care
for (nor did it therein altogether erre)
as its own peculiar, For there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66431:39"/>
unto every particular Citizen, a
true right as to those things, nor do
they farther differ from private poses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
than in this, that they are not
the propriety of any Person alone.
Now that Community doth express
(as it vvere) a kind of forme and face
of a new State, vvhich vve call a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and the same thing (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly)
our Country. In vvhich vvhen
Men did understand how much of
moment there vvas in reference to
the safety of every particular Person,
there vvere then also Lawes made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the improvement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of it, or at least a Custome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from our Ancestours, vvhich
hath the force of a Law. Hence it
comes to pass, that vve rejoyce in
its advantages, and grieve in its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities:
Forasmuch as in very deed
our private substance is safe, in the
safety of it, and perishes in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastations
of it. Hence is charity
or Love towards it, vvhich our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66431:39"/>
(upon the account of the
publick good, vvhereunto also a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
secret providence of God doth
attract us) have encreased, vvhile they
endeavour'd in every of their vvords
and deeds to advance the Majesty of
their Country. This Affection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in my Opinion is from Custom,
but if from Nature (as you did lately
insinuate) vvhat is the reason that it
diffuseth not it self into all alike, and
in equal measure? Why do the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and vvealthier sort love and
care for their Country more, and the
vulgar and meaner sort less? Whom
you may behold (for the most part)
full of their own cares vvith a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
neglect of the publick, vvhich yet
doth most certainly fall out otherwise
in every such Affection as proceeds
from the peremptory injunctions of
Nature. To conclude, vvhat reason vvill
you assigne why so light an occasion
should oftentimes diminish or remove
it? See how this man Revenge, a second
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66431:40"/>
Love, and others Ambition hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lur'd
from their Country; and in our
dayes how many hath the God <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
in the same manner seduced?
How many <hi>Italians</hi> are there, vvho
quitting <hi>Italy</hi> the Queen of Countrys
for gain alone have transported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into <hi>France, Germany,</hi> yea into
<hi>Sarmatia</hi> and there fixed their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?
How many thousand <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
doth Avarice and Ambition
yearly draw into remote Lands and
of a different Climate? Certainly a
great and strong proof, that this
vvhole Obligation is but external and
Opinionative; seeing some one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lust can vvith that facility dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
or break it. But you erre also
to purpose <hi>Lipsius,</hi> in the bounding of
that Country, for you restrain it to
that Native soil of ours vvherein vve
have settled, and whereupon we have
walk'd, and such other things as you
tinckle with a vain sound of Words.
For you will seek in vain from thence
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66431:40"/>
the Natural causes of this Love. For
if only our Native soil may challenge
that name, then only <hi>Bruxells</hi> is my
Country, <hi>Isca</hi> thine, a Cottage or a
Hut vvill be some other Mans: Yes
there are many that vvill not have so
much as a Cottage for theirs, but
must seek it in the Woods or open
Fields. Shall then my love and care
be shut up vvithin such narrow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits?
Shall I embrace and defend
this Village or that House as my
Country? You are sensible of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities;
and Oh how happy (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your determination in these
matters) are those Wood-men and
Rusticks, vvhose Native soile is ever
in its flourish, and almost beyond all
the hazzards of Calamity or Ruine!
But certainly that is not our Country;
No, but (as I said before) some one
State, and as it vvere a common Ship
under one Lord, or under one Law;
VVhich if you vvill have (of right)
to be beloved by its Natives; I shall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66431:41"/>
confess it: If to be defended I shall
acknovvledge it, If death to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
for its sake, I shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; but shall never yield to that
that vve should also grieve, be cast
dovvn, lament,
<q>
                        <l>If once our Country for it cry</l>
                        <l>'Tis sweet and glorious then to dye.</l>

                  <p>Said the Poet of <hi>Venusia</hi> vvith the
loud applause of the vvhole Theatre;
but then he said to dye, not to vveep.
For vve ought so to be good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
as that vve may also be good
Men; vvhich vve cease to be, as
oft as vve decline to the ejulations
and laments of Children or Women. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
<hi>Lipsius,</hi> I impart that to you vvhich
is lofty, and knovvn but to some few.
That these are vain and counterfeit
Countryes, if you consider the whole

but not any for the Soul, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending

(methought) a Cloud from

(said I) you still better me both by
your reproofs and instructions. So
that (methinks) I am now able to
keep under that Affection which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
the place and state in which,
but not as yet that which respects
the Men themselves amongst whom
I have been bred. For how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that the losses of my Country
should not touch and deeply affect
me for my Country-mens and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
sakes, vvho are toss'd in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66431:42"/>
Ocean of these Calamities, or perish
by a different and unhappy Destiny.
<hi>Langius</hi> interrupting me; but this
<hi>Lipsius</hi> said he is not properly Grief,
but Pitty; which yet it self is to be
despis'd, by a wise and constant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
For nothing is more suitable
to such a one than firmness and
strength of Mind, which cannot be,
in case not only his own, but also
anothers Calamity shall overturn and
discompose him. Here I interrupted
him, and vvhat Thornes of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi>
are these said I? Do you forbid
me to pitty too? Yet this is look'd
upon as a Virtue by all good Men; at
least amongst us vvho are season'd
vvith the true Religion and Piety.
<hi>Langius</hi> immediately, but I said he
do forbid it, and if I shall remove this
sickness from the Minds of Men; there
is no Man who is really good that
vvill resent it amiss. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a sickness, nor is he far distant
from misery, whoever he is that pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66431:43"/>
one who is miserable. As it is
a signe of a vveak and bad Eye to
grow Blood-shot at the sight of one
that is so: So is it of a vveak Mind to
grieve at the sight of one that grieves.
Pitty is rightly defin'd, THE VICE
OF A SLENDER AND MEAN
MIND FAINTING AT THE
APPEARANCE OF ANOTHERS
MISFORTUNE. What then?
Are vve so rigid and severe as not
to suffer that any should be mov'd
or affected vvith the grief of another?
Yes, to be affected I approve, but then
it must be so as to assist, not so as to
lament. I am for Mercy, but not
for Pitty. For thus I am willing
to distinguish at this time, and a while
to recede from our Porch the better
to instruct. I call Mercy AN IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLINATION
OF THE MIND
TO LIGHTEN THE PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERTY
OR ANGUISH OF
ANOTHER. This is that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<hi>Lipsius</hi> vvhich you discover as it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66431:43"/>
vvere through a mist, and in vvhich
Pitty creeps to, and imposes upon
you. But you vvill say it is Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to be affected vvith Pitty and
compassion: Be it so; yet is it not
therefore right. Suppose you that
there is any Virtue in the Effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and stoopage of the Mind? In
Sighs, or Sobbs, or in the mingling
of broken and disjoynted vvords with
a Mourner? You are mistaken. If
you think not, I can produce a sort
of covetous old Women and some
fordid <hi>Euclio's</hi> from whose Eyes it is
much more easie to extract a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Tears, than one single Penny
from their Purses. But now that
truly mercifull Man (of vvhom I have
been speaking) he vvill not indeed be
pittiful; but yet he vvill performe the
same, or better Offices, than he that
is so. He will behold other mens
Evils with a humane, but yet with a
right Eye. He will discourse with

Contagion; the Disease of

him: Or lest (as they say of Gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atours)

(I beseech you) of severe and rigid?
and such is the whole Body of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
vvhich to them that look upon
it at a distance, seems to be sterne
and lowring: But as many as make
nearer approaches, it is found to be
so gentle and complaisant, as that
the Goddess of Love her self is not
more amicable and obliging. But
enough of these three Affections;
vvhich I have partly put to the foyle

                  <argument>
                     <p>These Impediments remov'd, Publick
Evils themselves are seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
Four Arguments propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against them. Of Providence;
that it is interested in, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
over all humane affairs.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Come now at length from our
Velitation to a true and serious
fight, and laying aside these light
and jocular Armes, unto such vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
as shall finally decide the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I shall lead up my Souldiers
and Forces in Order; and range them
under their several Ensignes, vvhich
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66431:45"/>
I also forme into Four Squadrons.
The First, shall evince that publick
evils are sent unto, and dispers'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us by God himself. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that they are necessary, and
from Fate. The Third, that they
are advantageous to us. And the
last, that they are neither over-pressive
nor new. Now if these Forces of
mine shall, from their several Posts,
dextrously charge and recharge; shall
all the powers of your Grief dare
any further to resist, or so much as
to face me? They dare not. I have
conquer'd, and with this Omen, let
the Signal be given. Whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Lipsius</hi> all those Affections vvhich
do so variously rush upon, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
the life of Man, do spring from
a distemper'd Mind: So also (in my
Opinion) doth that Grief especially
vvhich vve espouse upon the publick
account. For vvhereas the rest of
the Affections have some end and
scope as it were; (as the Lover to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66431:45"/>
enjoy, the Angry to revenge, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
to heap up, and so in the rest)
to this alone you shall find nothing
proposed besides it self. But lest my
discourse should be too loose and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
I shall curbe and restrain it
vvithin this compass. You lament
you say your falling Country. But
to vvhat end I beseech ye? For what
hope you, or vvhat do you expect
thereby? Is it that thou mayest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
it in its decayes, and underprop
it vvhere it yields? Or is it that by
grieving you may keep off that Plague
and mischief under vvhich your
Country labours? None of all these:
It is only that you may use that
thredbare saying, it troubles me; as
to any thing else this lamentation is
but vain and unprofitable. For it
concernes a thing past; vvhich to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
again, and to render undone;
the Gods themselves would not have
it in their own power. But is your
Grief only vain? Yes, possibly it is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66431:46"/>
impious also, if you shall rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it. For (as you know) there
is an eternal Mind vvhich vve call
God, vvhich Rules, Orders and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
the lasting Orbs of Heaven;
the different courses of the Stars;
the interchangeable variations of the
Elements; and (in a vvord) all things
vvhatsoever, as vvell above as below
us. Suppose you that any Chance
or Fortune bare rule in this beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Body of the World? Or that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affairs are hurried on, and blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together by a rash and blind im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuosity?
I know you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, nor doth any other, vvho
hath any thing (not to say) of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but Sobriety. For it is the
Voice of Nature, I say of Nature,
and vvheresoever you shall turne your
Eye or Mind: Things Mortal and
Immortal, Superiour and Inferiour,
Animate or Inanimate, they all speak
out and proclaim, that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
above us, vvhich hath created
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66431:46"/>
and made those so vvonderful, so
great, and so numerous things; and
being so created and made, doth also
still continue to direct, and preserve
them. This now is God, to whose
superexcellent and most perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there is nothing more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
than that he should be at once
both able and vvilling to undertake
the Care and Guardianship of all that
he hath made. And how shall he
not be vvilling vvho is the BEST?
Or how should he not be able vvho
is the GREATEST? So farr are
any forces from being superiour to
his, that all are Derivative from him.
Nor doth this vastness or variety of
things either molest, or remove him
from their inspection: For that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
light doth every vvay emit its
rayes, and vvith one and the same dint
(as I may say) doth pierce all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements
and Abysles of Heaven,
Earth, and Sea. Nor doth this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
only preside over all things,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66431:47"/>
but it abides vvith; yea resides vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them. Why do ye vvonder at
this? What a part of the World doth
this Sun at once Survey, and inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en?
What a Mass of things doth this
Mind of ours vvith one thought em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and compass? And fooles that
vve are do vve not believe that more
things can be seen into, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by him vvho hath created
and made this very Sun, and Mind?
<hi>Excellently, or rather Divinely said he,
who hath not said much in matters
Divine, I mean</hi> Aristotle; <hi>what the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
(saith he) is in the Ship; the Chario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer
in the Chariot; the chief Chaunter
in the Quire; the Law in a City; or a
General in the Army: Such is God in
the World, with this only difference,
that to them indeed their Government
is laborious, toylsome, and perplexing;
but that of Gods is without Grief or
Labour, and severed from all Bodily
pains-taking.</hi> There is therefore in
God, <hi>Lipsius,</hi> there vvas, and shall be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66431:47"/>
that very vvatchfull, and active care
(yet a care vvhich is secure) vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he looks into, visits, and knowes
all things; and doth guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
them so known, in an immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and (to us) incomprehensible
Order. Now this is that vvhich I here
call Providence; of vvhich there are
not a few, vvho through vveakness
may complain, none that can doubt,
unless they are such as have stopp'd
their Ears, and hardned themselves
against every voice, and the very sense
of Nature it self.</p>

                  <p>WHich if you have throughly
imbib'd, if you do in good

that this Governing Power doth thus
insert and insinuate it self, and (to

                  <p>I do not see vvhat further place
there can be for your Grief or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.
For that very provident Being
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66431:48"/>
vvhich daily moves and turnes about
this Heaven, vvhich leads forth and
recalls the Sun; vvhich discloses and
shuts up all sorts of fruits: hath
brought to the Birth all those chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and vicissitudes vvhich you do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
repine, or vvonder at. Do you
think that only pleasant or profitable
things are sent to us from Heaven?
Yes, those also that are sad and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasteful
are from thence: Nor is
there any thing at all in this grand
frame of the World, vvhich is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
discomposed or confounded
(sin only excepted) vvhose cause and
original proceeds not from that first
cause: <hi>Pindar</hi> said vvell,</p>
                  <l>In Heaven they are that do</l>
                  <l>Dispense to us below.</l>
                  <p>There is (as it vvere) a certain
golden Chain let down from above
(as <hi>Homer</hi> gives it us in a Fable) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vvhich all these inferiour things
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66431:49"/>
are fastned. That there, an opening
of the Earth hath swallow'd up some
Townes; it is from Providence. That
the Pestilence elsevvhere hath mowed
down so many thousands of Men;
is from the same. And that Warre
and Slaughter is amongst the <hi>Belgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
is from the very same. It is from
Heaven, Heaven <hi>Lipsius,</hi> that all these
Calamities are sent, and therefore
they are aptly and vvisely styl'd by
<hi>Euripides</hi>
                  </p>
                  <l>—Calamities</l>
                  <l>Sent by the Dieties.</l>
                  <p>Every Ebbe and Flow (I say) of
humane affaires depends upon that
Moon; and the Rise and Sett of
Kingdomes upon that Sun. As oft
therefore as you give scope to your
Grief, and seem to resent it, that
your Country is thus harrass'd, and
overturn'd; You do not so much as
consider, either vvho you are that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66431:49"/>
repine, or against vvhom your mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs
are directed. What are you?
A Man, a shaddow, Dust. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vvhom do you murmur (I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to speak it) against God himself.
It vvas the fiction of Antiquity; that
certain Giants did attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
the Gods. To omit Fables,
you Complainants are those Giants.
For if all these things are not only
by the permission, but also by the
immission of Almighty God: You
vvho fret and resist, vvhat do you but
(as much as in you lyes) seise his
scepter, and intrench upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of his Empire? Blind Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality!
The Sun, Moon, Starrs, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements,
and all the successive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Creatures, do vvillingly obey,
and submit themselves to this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Law; only the Noblest piece
of the Creation, Man lifts up his heel
against, and replyes upon his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.
Had you hoisted Sailes into
the jurisdiction of the Winds, you
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66431:50"/>
must then go not vvhither you vvould
but vvhither they list. And shall you
in the Ocean of this life refuse to
follow the conduct of that Spirit by
vvhom the vvhole Universe is sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
In vain notwithstanding is this
refusal, for either you shall vvilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow, or be forc'd along; and
those Heavenly decrees shall preserve
their Efficacy, and Order, vvhether
you shall comply or rebel. We should
smile at that Man vvho having ty'd
his Boat to some Rock, and pulling
at the Cord, should rather think he
pulls the Rock to him than that his
boat moves to it. And is not our Folly
every vvay as remarkable, vvho being
chain'd to that Rock of Eternal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
do yet by our struggling and
resistance seem to desire that it should
obey us, rather than vve it? Let us
free our selves at the last from these
Vanities; and (if vve are vvise) let us
follow that Power vvhich attracts us
from above, and think it nothing but
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66431:50"/>
equal that vvhatsoever is pleasing to
God, should (for that very reason)
be so also to Man. The Souldier in
the Camp upon Notice of a March,
gets on his knap-sack; but if it sound
to Armes, he layes it aside, as one
vvho vvith his Mind, and Eyes, and
Ears, is intent upon, and prepared for
any command. Let it be thus vvith
us, and in this Warfare of ours, let
us chearfully and resolvedly March
after our General, vvhich vvay soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he shall command us. <hi>VVe are
sworn to this, saith</hi> Seneca, <hi>to endure
such things as Mortality is liable to, and
not to be disturbed in case some things
fall out, which it is not in our power to
prevent. VVe are born in a Kingdom,
and to obey God is Liberty it self.</hi>

                     <p>The Second Argument for Constancy,

                  <p>THis <hi>Lipsius</hi> is a firme and vvell

Armes vvith vvhich being cover'd,
<hi>Plato</hi> vvould have us to fight against
Chance and Fortune, to be subject
to God, to think upon him, and in
all kind of Events, to bend this Mind
of ours, unto that great Mind of
the World, I mean Providence, whose
pious and fortunate forces, forasmuch
as I have already made sufficient proof
of; I shall now draw forth and lead
up another Squadron, vvhich march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
under the Standard of necessity.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66431:51"/>
A valiant, stout, and Steel temper'd
Squadron it is; and such as I may not
unfitly compare to that Legion vvhich
the Romans call'd <hi>Fulminatrix:</hi> The
stubborn and unbroken force of it is
such, as doth conquer and subdue
all things, and I shall vvonder <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
if you should be able to resist it.
<hi>Thales</hi> vvhen one ask'd him vvhat
vvas the strongest, answered rightly,
necessity; for that Conquers all
things. There is an old saying too,
about the same thing; although not
so advised, that the Gods themselves
cannot force necessity. This neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
I annex to Providence, because
of its near relation to it; or to speak
truly, because it is born of it. For
this necessity is from God, and his
decrees; nor is it any other thing
than as the Greek Philosopher hath
defin'd it: A FIR ME SANC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION
AND IMMUTABLE
POWER OF PROVIDENCE.
Now that it doth intervveave and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66431:52"/>
twist it self vvith publick Evils; I
shall evince two vvayes, from things
themselves; and from Fate. From
things themselves, because it is the
Nature of all created beings, to hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
unto their change and fall, from
a certain inward proneness, vvhich
they have thereunto. As there is a
kind of fretting rust, vvhich doth
naturally cleave to Iron, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
scurffe or Worme that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
Wood: In like manner both
Creatures, Cities, and Kingdomes,
have their internal and proper causes
vvhereby they perish. Look upon
things above or below, great or
small, the vvorkes of the Hand or
Mind; they have perished from the
first Ages; and shall persist so to do
unto the last. And as all Rivers
journey towards the Ocean vvith
a prone and hasty current: So all
humane things slide along by this
Channel (as I may call it) of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
unto their utmost periods.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66431:52"/>
That Period is Death and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and thereunto Pestilence, vvarr,
and Slaughter are as subservient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments:
So that if Death is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to these things, upon the
same Ground are Calamities also.
That this may appear to you the
more evidently by Examples: I shall
not refuse for a vvhile to enlarge my
thoughts and travel vvith you through
this great universe.</p>

                     <p>Instances of Necessary Mutation and
Death throughout the whole VVorld.
The Heavens and Elements change,
and shall pass away. The same is
discernable in Cities, Provinces,

                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:66431:53"/>Cryes out the Tragical Poet. All
those things, vvhich you behold and
vvonder at, do either perish in their
courses; or are certainly changed. Do
you see that Sun? He is sometimes ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed:
The Moon? She suffers in the
like kind, and has her vvaines. The
Starrs? They shoot and fall; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the vvit of Man may seek to
palliate and excuse the matter; Yet
there have and vvill be such acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
amongst those celestial Bodies;
as may pose the skill, and stagger
the Minds of the ablest Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician.
I omit to speak of Commets
of various Form, and different Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
and Motion; concerning
vvhich, that they all have their Birth
from, and Motion in the Air, is a
thing vvhich Philosophy it self can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
easily perswade me to believe.
But behold (of late) there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
new kinds of Motion and Starrs
found out, vvhich have cut out vvork
for the Astrologers. There arose
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66431:54"/>
a Starr in this very year, vvhose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
and decreases vvere through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observ'd; and we then saw (vvhat
will scarcely be believ'd) that in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it self, there may be something
Born and Dye. Behold even <hi>Varro</hi>
in St. <hi>Augustine</hi> cryes out and asserts,
that the Planet <hi>Venus</hi> vvhich <hi>Plautus</hi>
calls <hi>Vesperugo</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
hath chang'd its colour, magnitude,
figure, and motion. Next to the
Heavens look upon the Air, it is
daily changed, and passes into vvinds,
Clouds, or showres. Look to the
vvaters, and those Rivers and springs
vvhich vve call everlasting: Some
are lost, and others have altered
their course, and found out new
Channels. The Ocean it self that
great and abstruse part of Nature, is
sometimes swell'd vvith stormes, and
at others smooth'd vvith calmes, and
though those stormes vvere not, yet
it hath its own Ebbs and Flowes;
and to convince us that it may to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66431:54"/>
perish; It doth daily increase
or decrease in its parts. Look now
upon the Earth vvhich alone some
vvould have immoveable; and to
stand by its own strength: Behold
there it totters, and is shaken into
a palsy fit, by the struggling of those
vapours that are pent up in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of it, and elsewhere it is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Waters or Fires. For even
these are at contest vvith one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and that you may not resent it
over deeply, that there are vvarrs
amongst Men: The very Elements
have theirs also. How many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes,
hath a sudden Deluge, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
of the Sea, either lessen'd,
or intirely swallowed up. Of old
that great Island <hi>Atlantis</hi> (for I
think it no Fable) afterwards <hi>Helice</hi>
and <hi>Bura:</hi> And (that vve may not
have recourse only to ancient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
times) amongst us <hi>Belgians</hi> (in
the Memory of our Fathers) two
Islands; together vvith their Townes,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66431:55"/>
and inhabitants. Even at this very
day that blew Deity, is forcing open
to it self new creeks; and daily frets
and vveares away the unfaithfull shores
of the <hi>Frisians</hi> and <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Nor
doth the Earth her self alvvayes give
vvay by a Womannish sloth; but doth
sometimes vindicate its losses, and
in the midst of the Sea frames Islands
for its self; to the vvonder and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of that hoary god. Now if
those great (and in our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
eternal) Bodies, are destined
to their destruction and change;
vvhat shall vve think of Cities, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
and Kingdomes; which
must needs be as mortal as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of them? As particular persons
have their Youth, Maturity, Old-Age,
and Death: So these, they rise,
grow, stand, flourish; and all these
to that very purpose that they may
fall. In the reign of <hi>Tiberius</hi> one
single Earth-quake overthrew twelve
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66431:55"/>
famous Cities of <hi>Asia,</hi> and another
did the like to as many Townes in

the ancient <hi>Thebes</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and vve scarce believe the hundred
Cities of <hi>Creet.</hi> But let us come
to more receiv'd instances. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients

the Ruines of <hi>Carthage, Numantia</hi>
and <hi>Corinth,</hi> As vve do at the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,
inglorious rubbish of <hi>Athens,
Sparta,</hi> and those other once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novvned
Cities. That Lady of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,
and Queen of Nations
falsely Styled the Eternal City,
vvhere is it? Overturned, Rased,
Burnt, overwhelmed: She has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
more than a single Fate,
and is at this Day curiously sought
for, but not to be found vvhere she
formerly stood. You see that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
proud of its being the Seat
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66431:56"/>
of a double Empire: And <hi>Venice</hi>
that glories in its continuance for a

them. And thou also our <hi>Antwerpe</hi>

a time when thou shalt be no more.
For that great Architect pulls down
and sets up, and (if vve may say it)
doth even sport himself in the affairs
of this World: And as a Potter at
his pleasure, doth mold and unmake
divers forms and representations out
of this Clay. I have hitherto dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd

In old time the East flourish'd;
<hi>Assyria, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Iudea</hi> vvere fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

trembles and seems to have
some sore apprehensions of her great
fall. That vvhich vve may more (though
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66431:56"/>
never sufficiently) vvonder at; this
World vvhich hath been inhabited
this Five thousand and Five hundred
years, doth now grow old, and that
vve may again applaud, the old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded
Fable of <hi>Anaxarchus;</hi> there
arise now elsewhere, and are born
new Men, and a new World. O
the vvonderful and incomprehensible
Law of Necessity! All things turn
about in this Fatal Circle of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ending: and there may be
something in this vvhole frame that
is long liv'd; but nothing that is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.
Lift up your Eyes; and look

                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:66431:58"/>As the Lyrick Poet said truly of
old. <hi>Langius</hi> replyes; Young Man;
Look then upon these things not as
above, but beneath you; and labour
to establish Constancy in your Mind,
by reflecting upon the inconstant and
unsteady levity of all things. Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
(I say) as to our sense and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of them: but if vve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
God and his Providence, than all
things succeed in an admirable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
order. For now laying swords
aside, I come to my Ensignes, and shall
assault that Grief of yours, not with
Arrowes, but more formidable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.
I shall inforce against it
the Ramme of Fate, an Ensigne of
that strength and firmness; as no
humane power or policy shall be ever
able either to elude or resist. And
howsoever the Ground is slippery e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to endanger a fall: Yet I shall
adventure upon it, though vvith a
cautious slowness, and as the Greeks
say vvith a modest foot. In the First
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66431:58"/>
place therefore, that there is a Fate
in things, neither you <hi>Lipsius,</hi> nor
(as I conceive) any Nation or Age
did ever doubt. Here I interpos'd;
pardon me (said I) if as a <hi>Remora</hi> I
stop you in this course. Do your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
me vvith Fate? Weak is this
Ramme, <hi>Langius,</hi> and such as is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the enervate and languid
forces of the Stoicks. I speak freely,
I despise at once, both it and the
destinies: and vvith the Souldier in
<hi>Plautus,</hi> I can blow away this feeble
troop vvith a single breath, as vvinds
do leaves from the Trees. <hi>Langius</hi>
vvith a severe and threatning Eye;
Rash and inconsiderate Young Man
(said he) do you imagine you can
elude or take away Fate? You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
unless together with it, you
deny the very Power and Being of
a Deity: For if God is, Providence
is; if Providence, than a decreed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of things; and if so than a firme
and establish'd Necessity of events;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66431:59"/>
How do you vvard this blow? Or
vvith vvhat Ax do you sever the
Links of this Chain? For vve cannot
otherwise conceive of God that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Mind; than that there should be
in him an eternal knowledge and
prevision of things: vvhom vve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be fix'd, firme, and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
alwaies one and the same; not
at all varying, or altering in those
things, vvhich he hath once willed,
and beheld.
<q>
                        <l>The Eternal Gods are not inclin'd,</l>
                        <l>To variations of the Mind.</l>
                     </q>
vvhich if you acknowledge to be
true (as of necessity you must, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you have divested your self of
all Reason and Sense) you vvill then
also acknowledge, that all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of God are firme and immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
from Eternity to Eternity. Now
from thence doth Necessity derive
it self together vvith that Fate vvhich
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66431:59"/>
you so despise. The truth of vvhich
is so very obvious and clear; that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all sorts of Men, there is not
a more ancient or receiv'd Opinion.
And look to how many the light of
a Deity, and Providence hath shin'd
to vvell nigh as many hath this of
Fate. Insomuch that those very same
privative Fires vvhich discovered the
knowledge of a God to Men; seem
also to have guided Man in the
knowledge of this other. Consult
<hi>Homer</hi> that first and vvisest of all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets.
There is not any one path
vvherein that Divine Muse hath so
frequently pass'd and repass'd, as this
of Fatality: Nor hath the vvhole
Race of the Poets dissented from
their Ancestour. Look upon <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,
Sophocles, Pindar,</hi> and our <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil.</hi>
Look upon Historians; their

Fate. Look upon Philosophers,

as to the beginning
of this vvay vvhich
leads to Fate. I say in the beginning
of the vvay: For I am not about to

these four, Mathematical, Natural,

(saith he) is the perfect, and
absolute Counsel of the Heavenly God;
to which there are two faculties nearly
ally'd; Necessity, and Fate. Fate doth
administer, and is subservient at one
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66431:61"/>
and the same time, both to Providence
and Necessity; and the Stars are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Fate. For no man can ev<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

the force of Fate, nor with all his cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
prevent the powerful influence of
the Starrs. For these are the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
and weapons of Fate, by whose
direction they cause and conclude all
those things which are in Nature or

                  <p>Natural Fate; I call such an Order
of Natural causes vvhich (unless they
are hindred) do by their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and efficacy produce alwayes
a certain and the same effect. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
is for such a Fate if vve may
credit <hi>Alexander Aphrodisiensis</hi> one
of the most Faithful of his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and of the like Mind vvas <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus;</hi>
vvho plainly asserts that Fate
is nothing else, but every Mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Agreeable to those Mens O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66431:61"/>
it is, that a man's begetting
a Man, is by Fate; that if a man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to his death; by internall causes;
vvithout the accession of such as are
forreigne, and outward; this is by
Fate: On the other-side that a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
a Serpent or some other Monster
this is not by Fate, neither if he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
by the Sword or Fire. An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
truly not very peccant; inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it rises not to the force and
height of Fate: And how can that
be in danger of falling vvhich never
adventures to climb? And such is
<hi>Aristotle</hi> almost every vvhere in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
matters; I except only that little
Book of his, <hi>de Mundo;</hi> vvhich is a
golden one indeed; and such as seems
to me, to be inspired by some other
and more heavenly Genius. I read
also farther in a Greek Writer; that
<hi>Aristotle</hi> vvas of Opinion: That Fate
it self is not a cause, but a certain
accidental Mode to the cause; in
such things as proceed from Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66431:62"/>
O the courage of a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher!
Who durst seriously Number,
Fortune and chance amongst the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but not Fate. But I pass him,
and return to my Stoicks (for not to
dissemble I have a great affection and
esteem for that Sect) vvho are the
Authors of violent Fate; vvhich I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
vvith <hi>Seneca,</hi> such a Necessity of
all things and actions; as no power
is able to interrupt: Or vvith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus;</hi>
a spiritual power that doth
orderly govern this vvhole Universe.
Nor are these Definitions very remote
from that vvhich is right and true:
if they may have a sound and modest
interpretation: As neither is their
vvhole Opinion perhaps; vvere it not
that it hath been already murthered
by the retorted Thumbs of the whole
hand of the vulgar. These charge
them vvith two crimes; that they
subject God himself to the disposal of
Fate: and that they place also, the
internal actions of our vvill, under
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66431:62"/>
the same power. Nor vvill I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidently
undertake to clear them
of either of these faults. For amongst
those few of their vvritings vvhich
are yet extant, there are such, from
vvhence these Tenents may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
as there are others, from
vvhence, vvee may receive that
vvhich is sound and Orthodox. It
must be confess'd that <hi>Seneca</hi> (no
mean Trumpet of that School) seems
to dash upon that first Rock, in that
Book (vvhere he had least Reason to
do so) of Providence. <hi>The same
Necessity saith he doth bind even the
Gods themselves, that irrevocable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
doth equally carry along with it,
both humane and Divine things. The
great Creator and Ruler of all things;
did indeed write down this Law of
Fate: But he followes it himself; and
ever obeys, what he once commanded.</hi>
And that indissoluble Chain, and twist
of causes, vvhereunto they fasten all
things and Persons, seems (and that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66431:63"/>
not Obscurely neither) to offer
violence to the vvill of Man. But
the Genuine and true Stoicks, did
never openly avouch these things.
Or if any such matter, did fall from
them (as it is possible enough) in
their heat of writing and dispute;
you shall rather find it in vvords,
than in their sense and meaning.
<hi>Chrysippus</hi> himself vvho first corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Enervated that Masculine
Sect, vvith the intricate niceness of
Questions, he in <hi>Agellius</hi> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
cleares them from attempting
upon the liberty of the vvill. Nor
doth our <hi>Seneca</hi> subject God to
Fate (he vvas better advised) but
(in a certain Mode of speech) God
to God. For those amongst them,
vvho came nearest to the truth, do
by Fate sometimes understand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and at others, God. <hi>And
therefore</hi> Zeno <hi>when he defines Fate
to be a power moving the matter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the same respects, in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66431:63"/>
same manner, he adds; it matters
not, if I had called it, either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
or Nature.</hi> And <hi>Chrysippus</hi>
from the same Principle, doth else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
call Fate, the Eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of Providence. Now <hi>Paneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the Stoick, affirm'd that God
himself vvas Fate; and the same
thing is clearly the Opinion of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca:
You may (saith he) as you please,
vary the Title of this Author of things,
and Natures: You may lawfully call
him, either the best and greatest</hi> Jove;
<hi>or the Thunderer, or the Stayer: Nor
for that Reason which Historians as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe;
because after a Vow made to
him; He stayed the flying Army of
the</hi> Romans, <hi>but he is therefore the
Stayer and Establisher, because all
things do stand, and consist by his
goodness, neither shall you erre, if
you call him. Fate. For since Fate is
nothing else but an implexed series of
causes, he is the Principall cause of
all things, on which the rest do depend.</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:66431:64"/>
Which last vvords are so piously
spoken, that even Calumny it self,
is not able to calumniate them.
Nor did that great vvriter (unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
the Great) in this at all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from the Stoicks. <hi>I conceive
(saith he) that Necessity, ought not to
be call'd any thing else than God, as
an unchangeable Nature: And so also
Fate it self; because it knits together
all things, and is moved and carryed
on, without any impediment.</hi> Which
Speeches though possibly they may
have something in them vvhich is
not so advised: Yet they contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is impious; and by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
interpreters vvill be thought
not farr distant from that true Fate,
vvhich I am about to assert. The
truth is, I do heartily applaud the
Stoicks in this: That there is not
any Sect, vvhich hath more studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
asserted the Majesty, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God; or more earnestly
endeavoured to incline the Minds of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66431:64"/>
Men, to things Heavenly, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
than they. And if in the
performance of this fatal Race,
they have at any time stumbled: I
believe it occasioned, by a good and
praise-vvorthy desire; to recall blind
Mortalls from their blind goddess;
I mean Fortune, not only vvhose
Deity, but Name too, was by them
very manfully exploded.</p>

                     <p>The Fourth, true Fate explained. Of
its Name, its Definition. How it
differs from Providence.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt I have said enough of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
and dissents of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
for why should I over curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or subtilly search into the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Hell? my business is vvith
true Fate; this I shall now propound
and illustrate. And I here call it,
an eternal decree of Providence,
vvhich is as inseparable from things,
as Providence it self. Nor let any
one cavil at the Name; for I do
confidently affirm that the Latine lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
doth not afford any other that
is proper to the thing. Did the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
abuse it? Let us use it never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless;
and inlarging the vvord from
the Prison of the Stoicks, let us bring
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66431:65"/>
it forth into a better light. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Fate is derived a <hi>fando</hi> from
speaking: Nor is it properly any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Divine Sentence and
injunction, vvhich is that very thing
I here mean by it. For I define the
true Fate either vvith the illustrious
<hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi> a Series and Order
of Causes depending upon Divine
Counsel, or in my own termes (though
not so plainly, yet more exactly) an
immoveable decree of Providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in things moveable, vvhich
surely disposes every of them in its
own Order, Place and Time. I call
it a decree of Providence; for I am
not altogether of the same Mind,
vvith the Divines of our dayes (I
crave leave for a free Investigation of
Truth) vvho confound it as vvell in
Name as Thing vvith Providence it
self. I know it is a high and rash
presumption to enterprize the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisal
and limitation of that supersub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
and supercelestial Nature (I
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66431:66"/>
mean God) or vvhatsoever pertains
to him, vvithin the compass of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Termes: Yet according to our
humane capacity; I am sensible that
Providence is one thing properly, and
this Fate I am speaking of is another.
For I apprehend not, nor conceive
of Providence any otherwise, than
that it is a faculty and power in God,
by vvhich he sees, knows and governs
all things; such a power (I mean)
as is universal, undivided, guarded,
and as <hi>Lucretius</hi> faith firmly united.
But now the notion of Fate, seems
rather to descend to things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and in each of them to be
observed: That so there may be such
a digestion and explication of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Providence, as is distinct and
agreeable to its parts. Providence
therefore is in God, and is ascribed
unto him alone: Fate is in things,
and to them it is ascribed. It is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
I may seem to you to trifle, and
as (one saith) to drill Millet. No
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66431:66"/>
                     <hi>Lipsius</hi> I have these things from the
common discourses of the Vulgar,
amongst whom nothing is more usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
than to say, this or that came to
pass, by my Good or Evil Fate: This
is the Fate of that Kingdom or City.
But of Providence no man vvill speak
after this manner: I mean none can
attribute it to things themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
impiety or folly. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
justly said that Providence is in
God: Fate is indeed from God, but
is understood in things. I add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that howsoever Providence is
really inseparable from Fate, yet it
seems to be something more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and superiour to it, as vve com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
say in the Schools, the Sun
excells Light, Eternity Time; and
the intellect Reason. Not to enlarge
my felf any farther about these seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
(though uncommon matters) by
what hath passed, you may readily
apprehend the Reason of my distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
as also of my retaining the old
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66431:67"/>
Name, against the new Senate of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.
For those ancient and hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Conscript Fathers; do not at all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
me, but that I may very freely use
this word Fate, in the found and true
notion of it. But to return to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my Definition, I call'd it an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Decree; to shew that Fate is to be
observed in those things to vvhich, not
in him from vvhence it comes. I added
in moveable things; signifying thereby,
that howsoever Fate it self is immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
yet it doth not destroy the infixed
Nature, and proper motion of things
but acts in a mild and gentle vvay,
according as those marks and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
do require vvhich God hath
engraven upon every thing: In causes
(I understand second ones) necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
necessarily; in natural ones na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally;
in contingent, contingently. In
respect therefore of things, it is no
vvay violent or compulsory, but bends
and leads on every thing, according
as the Nature of it is to do or suffer.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66431:67"/>
But if you reduce it to its own Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
that is to say to Providence and
God: Then I must affirm vvith the
greatest Constancy and boldness, that
all things vvhich are by Fate, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
come to pass. I added in
the last place somewhat of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Time, and Place, confirming
vvhat I had before asserted; that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
is of all things taken together,
but Fate is by vvay of distribution of
particulars. By Order I understand
a Series of Causes vvhich Fate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines.
By Place, and Time I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that vvonderfull and inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
power, by vvhich all Events are
ty'd to certain circumscriptions of
place, and moments of time. Is it
the Fate of <hi>Tarquine</hi> to be expell'd
his Kingdom? Let it be done, but
vvithall let Adultery precede. You
see the Order: Is it the Fate of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
to be slain? Be it so; but be it
also in the Senate-house, and at the
foot of <hi>Pompey's</hi> Statue. You see
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66431:68"/>
the Place. Shall <hi>Domitian</hi> be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
by his Servants? Let him fall,
but let it be in that very hour, which
he sought in vain to decline, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Fifth, you see the time.</p>

                  <p>ARe you sufficiently apprehensive

do you yet stand in need of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and a clearer light? I (shaking
my Head) a clearer <hi>Langius,</hi> a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
said I, or you will leave me for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the midst of this Night. For
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66431:68"/>
vvhat means the subtile thread of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions?
What captious snares of
questions are these? Believe me, I
vvas in fear of some stratagem; and
began to be as suspitious of these your
vveigh'd and vvary vvords, as of so
many Enemies. <hi>Langius</hi> smiling; you
may be confident (said he) no <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
is here, nor are you fallen into an
Ambush, but into a safe place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. I shall very vvillingly enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
you; declare only vvhere and in
vvhat part it is you desire a further
satisfaction. There <hi>Langius</hi> (said I)
vvhere you speak of force and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.
For I am not able to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
vvhich vvay you dissever this
Fate of yours, from that of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks.
For howsoever you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
it in vvords, and (as they say)
at the Portall; yet in reality and at
the Postern, you seem to me to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it. <hi>Langius</hi> readily, farr, farr be
it from me <hi>Lipsius</hi> said he; I vvould
not so much as in my dreams intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66431:69"/>
that Fate of the Stoicks; nor do I
endeavour to revive those long sinceex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
Beldames the destinies. It is a
modest and pious fate I contend for, and
vvhich differs from the violent one these
four vvayes. The Stoicks subject God
to Fate; neither was <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself in
<hi>Homer</hi> able to exempt his <hi>Sarpedon</hi> from
its bonds, when he earnestly desired it.
But we on the contrary subject Fate to
God vvhom vve acknowledge to be a
most free Author, and independent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in all things: Who vvhen he pleases
can surpass, and break through all the
strengths, and intricate foldings of Fate.
They also constitute a Series and Flux
of Natural causes from Eternity; vve
admit not such a Series of these causes
vvithout interruption (for God makes
Prodigies, and worketh Miracles, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entimes
besides, yea contrary to Nature)
nor can this Series of causes be from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.
For Second causes are not Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
as having (most certainly) their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginings
vvith that of the world. Thirdly,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66431:69"/>
they seem to have remov'd contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
from things; vve restore it, and
as often as second causes are such,
vve admit contingency and accident
in events. Lastly, they seem to have
brought in a violent force upon the
Will; this is farr from us, vvho as
vve do assert Fate, so vve reconcile it
with the Liberty of the Will. For
vve so avoid the deceitfull Gust of
Fortune and Chance, as that yet vve
do not force our Ship upon the Rock
of Necessity. Is there Fate? That
Fate is the first cause, which is so
farr from removing the second and
subordinate ones, that ordinarily, and
for the most part, it acts not but by
them. Now amongst these second
causes is the Will, vvhich never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that God vvill either enforce or
destroy. Here is all the Errour, and
Cloud in this matter, no Man knowes
or thinks that he wills what Fate
vvills, and yet that he wills it freely.
For that God who created all things,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66431:70"/>
employes those things, vvithout the
destruction of them. As the highest
Heaven doth so carry along with it
all the inferiour Orbs, as not to stop,
or break off the proper motion of
any of them: So God by the force of
Fate disposes of all things; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes
not the peculiar power or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any of them. Is it his vvill
that Trees, and Fruits should grow?
They do so by Nature, without any
compulsion. Is it his pleasure that
Men should deliberate, and choose?
They deliberate without any inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and they choose vvith their
own vvill. And yet God from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
foresaw that very thing in which
their choice vvould determine: But
he only foresaw, he did not inforce;
he knew, but did not enjoyn; he
foretold it, but he did not prescribe
it. Why stumble our Curioso's at
this? Poor wretches! There is no
point, that seems to me, to carry a
greater evidence of truth vvith it;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:66431:70"/>
vvere it not for that vvanton Mind
of ours vvhich (being infected vvith
an evil Itch of wrangling and dispute)
is ever and anon urging and exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
it self. For (say they if God
foresaw that I should sin; and this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of his is no vvay to be deceiv'd:
How can it otherwise be, but that I
should sin Necessarily? I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it is Necessarily, but not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of your Mind; since your own
free vvill doth here intervene. For
he foresaw that you should sin the
same vvay he foresaw; but he foresaw
you should do it freely, and therefore
of Necessity you must sin freely. Is
not this sufficiently clear? But they
urge again; that God is the Author
of all motions in us. He is indeed
(I confess) the Author of all motions
in common, but the fautor, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer
of nothing but vvhat is good.
Do you prepare your self to an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is virtuous? He knowes and
assists it. Or to one that is vitious?
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66431:71"/>
He knows, and permits it, nor is he
herein chargeable vvith any fault. I
ride upon, and spur a dull and lame
Horse, that I spur him is from me,
that he is dull is from himself. I play
upon a Harp that is out of tune, and
ill strung: You vvill easily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the discordancy of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
is not imputable to me, but
to it self. This very Earth doth feed
all sorts of Trees and Plants vvith one
common juice; and yet some of these
bring forth vvholesome Fruits, and
some others Poysons. What vvill you
here say? That this is from the Earth?
Or rather in that inbred Nature of
the Trees, which converts the good
nourishment, into their own poyson?
In like manner it is here: That you
move is from God; from your self, and
in your self, that you move to Evil.
Finally, that I may at last finish my
discourse about this Liberty; Fate is
as it were the Leader of the Dance,
in this Masque of the world: But so
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:66431:71"/>
that we also have our parts to act, of
alwayes vvilling or nilling; but not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of effecting. For it is only a will
that is left unto Man whereby he may
be desirous to oppugne and resist God:
But he hath not a power whereby he
is able. As I may vvalk up and dovvn
the Decks and Hatches of a Ship;
but this little motion doth not at all
avail to hinder its course: So in this
fatall Ship, in vvhich vve are all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd,
though our vvills move this
or that vvay, they are not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
or put a stop to it. For that
supream Will will alwayes hold and
manage the reines, and guide this
Chariot, with a gentle kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

I behold here the vvreck of <hi>Cicero</hi> who
had rather destroy Providence, than
derogate in the least from the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the vvill. Who (as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

Hovv many even at this

of disputation. By vvhose dangers
<hi>Lipsius</hi> vve being vvarned let us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
choose to coast about the Shore,
than to hazzard our selves too farr in
the depths of this Ocean. <hi>Euclid</hi> to
one that ask'd him many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Gods, made this appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
reply: Other things I know not;
but this I know that they hate the
curious. Think the same of Fate,
vvhich vvill be look'd upon, but not
pry'd into; believ'd, but not known.
I think it is the saying of <hi>Bias;</hi> of the
Gods say that they are, vvhich I may
pertinently apply unto Fate, of vvhich
I advise you, that it is enough if you
knovv it to be: in other matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, it is no Sin to be ignorant.
That properly belongs to our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
(for I novv return from this intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
path into the old and beaten vvay)
that you believe there is a Necessity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd
to publick evils: and that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
from thence some consolation in
your Griefs. What doth it concern you,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66431:73"/>
curiously to enquire about the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Servitude of the Will? Wretch!
Thy <hi>Syracuse</hi> is taken, and thou art
drawing lines in the dust. Warr is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thee, Tyranny, Slaughters, Death,
which certainly are sent from above,
and not at all under the disposal of
thy Will. These things you may fear
but not prevent: Fly, but not be able
to evade. Arme your self therefore
against them, and catch up this fatal
weapon, which will not only pierce,
but kill; not only diminish, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all your Griefs. As if you slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touch a Nettle it stings; but if hard,
it hath no such power: So doth the
asperity of your Grief encrease upon
you if you ply it with gentle reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but gives back in the use of
those which are more forcible and
severe. Now there is nothing more
forcible than necessity; whose first on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
doth rout and conquer these fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
troops. For what does your grief
aim at? There is no place for it in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66431:73"/>
those things which not only may, but
must come to pass. What would
your complaints? You may struggle

But I am yet tossed vvith the vvave

I pray you calme: For if publick

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ate, and that can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be overcome nor avoided: Why
do we further concern our selves or
labour for our Country? Wh do we
not resign up all, to that great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable
Governour, and (as they
say) sit down vvith our hands folded?
since as your self do confess; all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
and power is but vain, when
the Fates do oppose. Obstinacy and
perverseness said <hi>Langius</hi> smiling, have
set thee at distance Young Man from
that vvhich is right and true. Is this
to obey Fate, or to contemne and
elude it? I vvill sit (say you) vvith my
hands folded; 'tis well; I vvish you
had done so vvith your Lips too. For
vvho ever assented, that Fate acts singly
vvithout the intervention of middle and
assisting causes? It is Fate that your
Children dye: Yet so, as that they
shall first be begotten. It is Fate that

you recover of a Disease: But then
you must employ the Physitian, and
make use of remedies. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it is Fate, that the fluctuating
sinking Ship of your Country, shall
be preserv'd: It is then also Fate, that
it shall be supported and defended.
If you vvill arrive at the Haven, you
must apply your hands to the Oare,
and hoise the Sailes; not idlely gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after, or expecting a Wind from
above. On the other side if it is
Fate that this Country of yours shall
perish; by Fate also those things shall
come to pass, vvhich shall promote
and further the ruine of it. The
Commons shall be at variance vvith
the Peers, and amongst themselves
none shall know how to command,
or to obey. Many shall be valiant in
the tongue; all shall be sluggish in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:

<hi>Velleius</hi> said vvell; the irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66431:76"/>
force of Fate, doth corrupt the
Councells of him, vvhose Fortune it
is determin'd to change: And again
it comes to pass for the most part
that God perverts their Councels,
vvhose Fortune he is about to alter;
and (vvhich is the greatest unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
so orders things, that those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
vvhich happen to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
seem deservedly to have fallen
upon them, Neither ought you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to conclude, that the last and
fatal revolution is now come upon your
Country. For how do you know it?
Or vvhich vvay can you be certain,
vvhether it is some light distemper,
or a Disease unto Death? Assist her
therefore, and vvhile the Patient hath
yet breath (as they say) hope. But
if by certain and infallible discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
it shall appear, that its fatall
change is upon it; then (in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
that is vvholsome advice; fight
not against God. That Example of
<hi>Solon</hi> I may here safely commend,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66431:77"/>
vvho vvhen <hi>Pisistratus</hi> had seised <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;</hi>
and he saw that all endeavours
for Liberty vvere vain, laying down
his shield and armes at the doors of
the Curia: O my Country said he, I
have assisted thee both vvith my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
and actions; and so vvent home,
resolving for the future to be quiet.
Do you thus, give place to God,
give place to the times; and if you
are a good Common-wealths Man,
reserve your self to better and more
gentle Fates. That Liberty which
is now perish'd, may revive; and your
Country vvhich is now fallen, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of time may yet arise: Why do
you unadvisedly despond, and cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay
your courage? Of those two
Consuls at <hi>Cannas</hi> I esteem <hi>Varro</hi> a
gallanter Person vvho fled, than <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
that fell: Nor did the Senate and
People of <hi>Rome</hi> judge otherwise, who
gave him publick thanks, that he did
not despair of the Common-vvealth.
But vvhether your Country do only
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66431:77"/>
totter, or vvhether it fall; vvhether it
languish only, or vvholly perish: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict

a Boy from <hi>Levinus Torrentius</hi> came to

and is the day thus privily slipp'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? And with that rising and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me by the Arme; let's go <hi>Lipsius</hi>
said he to this my wish'd Supper. Let
us rather sit still, said I (being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to go) for this to me is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to all other food; which I may
justly call the banquet of the Gods.
In these entertainments I alwayes hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and can never be satisfy'd. But
<hi>Langius</hi> compell'd me, and said he, let
us now performe our promise; to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

                  <p>THe next day it pleased <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
to conduct me to his
gardens which vvith a great
deal of cost and curiosity
he had planted in two places, the one
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66431:79"/>
upon a gentle rise of ground opposite
to his house: the other somewhat far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off, in a lower place, and close
by the River <hi>Maes</hi>
                  </p>
                  <l>Whose Christall streams do gentle slide</l>
                  <l>Along the pleasant City's side.</l>
                  <p>Surprising me therefore in my
Chamber very early in the morning
shall vve vvalk <hi>Lipsius</hi> say'd he, or
vvhether had you rather repose upon
a Chair here vvithin doors? Walk
<hi>Langius</hi> (said I) provided it be with
you; but whither shall vve go? If you
approve it (reply'd he) to my Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
which are by the waters side,
they are not farr distant, and by the
way you shall exercise your Body;
see the City, and besides we shall
there meet with a cool and desirable
air; in the midst of this heat: With
all my heart (said I) nor in your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
is it possible that any vvay should
seem tedious to me, though it vvere
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:66431:79"/>
to the utmost <hi>Indies.</hi> And with this
we called for our Cloakes, cast them
upon us, went forth, and got thither.
Assoon as I entred I took their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
with a wandring and curious
Eve; and really wondring at the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy,
and culture of the place? My
Father (said I) what pleasantness,
what splendour is this? You have
here <hi>Langius</hi> a Heaven rather than a
Garden: Nor certainly do those Starry
Fires above, shine out more illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in a clear and open Night;
than these your flowers, do even
sparkle and glitter in a most delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Variety. Talk we of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
of <hi>Adonis</hi> or <hi>Alcinous?</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with these, they are doubtless
inconsiderable trifles, and such things
as are next to nothing. And with
this being come somewhat nearer,
beholding some; and smelling to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
Oh! said I, which should I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wish the Eyes of <hi>Argus</hi> or the
Nose of <hi>Catullus?</hi> So equally doth
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66431:80"/>
this pleasure even tickle and delight
both Senses. Hence, hence all ye
Odours of <hi>Arabia</hi> which serve only to
provoke a loathing, in respect of that
pure and truly Celestial sweetness
that breaths from hence: <hi>Langius</hi>
gently wringing my hand, and not
vvithout a smile or too; Fair fall
my Gardens, <hi>Lipsius</hi> saies he; for
neither I nor this rustical <hi>Flora</hi> of
mine can pretend any Title to so
skilfull and ingenious a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It is yet a true one, <hi>Langius</hi>
(reply'd I) suppose you that I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
I speak it vvith all the serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
imaginable, the <hi>Elysian</hi> Fields,
are less so than these Gardens of
yours. For see vvhat a comeliness
and order is every vvhere? How fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all things are disposed in their
Beds and Borders? That the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
coloured Marbles in a pavement
are not placed vvith a more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Beauty and exactness. What
plenty of Herbs and Flowers? What
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66431:80"/>
rarity and strangeness? Insomuch as
vvithin the narrow limits of this one
place, Nature seems to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
all those excellencies, vvhich
either this of ours, or that other
World is able to boast off.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>ANd truly <hi>Langius</hi> this your divertis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a praise-worthy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
one; a pleasure vvhereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
(if I am not deceived) the more
excellent and ingenuous persons are
by Nature it self inclin'd. I am ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
induc'd to believe this; inasmuch
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66431:81"/>
as it is not very easie to think of any one
pleasure, in vvhich the most eminent
amongst the Nations have in all ages
so vvillingly consented. If vve turne
over the sacred Volume, vve shall
there find that the World and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
vvere made together, vvhich
God himself bestow'd upon the first
Man, as the Seat of a blessed Life:
If vve search into prophane Stories,
Proverbs and Fables every vvhere
tell us of the Gardens of <hi>Adonis</hi> and
<hi>Alcinous, Tantalus</hi> and the <hi>Hesperides:</hi>
and in true and credible Histories,
vve meet the mention of King <hi>Cyrus</hi>
his Orchards, that were planted with
his own Hands: The airy and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
Gardens of <hi>Semirdmis,</hi> and that
new and celebrated Plat of <hi>Masanissa</hi>
vvhich <hi>Affrick</hi> vvondred at. Amongst
the ancient Greeks and Romans,
how many illustrious persons am I
able to name; vvho casting off all
other cares, have betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
only to this? Amongst the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66431:81"/>
it vvill suffice to say in short, that
most of the Philosophers and Sages,
removing from Cities and the wild cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the Courts; have cloystred
up themselves vvithin private limits
and bounds. And amongst the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
methinks I see King <hi>Tarquine</hi> (in
that then ancient <hi>Rome</hi>) diverting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his Gardens, and smiting off
the heads of the Poppyes. <hi>Cato</hi> the
Censour applying himself to this
study, and vvriting Books vvith all
seriousness about these matters. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi>
retiring to his Gardens, after
all his Asiatique Triumphs. <hi>Sylla</hi>
having lay'd down his Dictatorship
doth here more contentedly grow
old; and <hi>Dioclesian</hi> the Emperour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres
his Sallads and Lettuce at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona;</hi>
before the imperial purple, and
all the Scepters of the Universe.
Nor have the Vulgar receded from
the Judgement of their superiours;
but even amongst them the honester
sort, and such as vvere free from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66431:82"/>
vvere generally this way ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.
For certainly there is a kind
of secret impulse, that vvith us is
born; the hidden Causes of which I
cannot easily explicate; which thrusts
into this innocent and ingenuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
not only us vvho bend that
vvay, but even those serious and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
persons; who both resist and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
it. And as none do behold the
Heavens, and those eternal Fires;
without a secret kind of horror and
Religion; so neither do any take a
view of the Sacred Treasures of the
Earth, and the beautiful Ornaments
of this lower World, without a silent
kind of Gust and Titillation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
Enquire but of your Mind
and Soul, and it will confess it self
not only to be surpriz'd; but even
fed with such a prospect. Ask your
Eyes and Senses and they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that they do not any
where more willingly repose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Look round about I beseech
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:66431:82"/>
you for a while, and observe the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
troops of Flowers, together
vvith the manner of their growth.
Behold how this uncupps, and that
unsheathes, and this other swells it
self out of the rich inclosure of it's
Gemm-like Bud. See how suddenly
the one expires, and the other shoots
out to succeed it; to conclude, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in any one kind of them, the
Beauty, Forme, and Appearance, a
thousand vvayes divers and the same.
What Mind is there so rigid, that in
such entertainments as these, vvill not
vvithdraw and melt it self, into soft
and pleasing Meditations? Let the
curious Eye dwell awhile upon those
Orient and dazeling Colours: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
this native Purple, this Blood,
this Ivory, this Snow, this Flame,
this Gold, and such diversity of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
as a skilful Pencil may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
emulate, but can never be able
to express? To conclude vvhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling

Spirit, and I know not what part
of the Heavenly Air breathed from
above? So that our Tribe of Poets
seem not in vain to have feign'd, that
most Flowers are born of the Blood
and juice of the Immortal Gods. O

O thou happy Seat of <hi>Venus</hi> and

and repose my self in these your shades;

                     <p>Against some curious People, who abuse

Their proper use. That they are
places fit for wise and learned Men;
and that VVisdom it self is bred
and cherished there.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHen I had spoken this some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat
earnestly, and vvith a
kind of Ardour both in voice and
countenance; <hi>Langius</hi> looking mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon me: Certainly said he <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
you are enamour'd of this florid
and purple Nymph; and I am solicitous,
lest you should love her immodest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For you praise Gardens, but yet
so, as to admire only those things
vvhich are vain and external; vvhile
you omit to speak of the true and
lawful Pleasures of them. You greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
behold the colours, and repose
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66431:84"/>
in the beds, and enquire after Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from the known and unknown
World? But for vvhat purpose I
pray? Is it to assure me that you also
are one of that newly sprung up Sect
of curious and idle persons; vvho
have converted the most excellent
and simple delight, into the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a couple of Vices; Vanity,
and Sloth? For to this end have
they their Gardens, vvith an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
curiosity they search after a few
forraign Plants and Flowers; and
vvhen they have them, they cherish
and attend them, vvith the same an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety
and passion, as a Mother doth
her Son. These are they vvhose
Letters vvander into <hi>Thrace, Greece,
India,</hi> for some little parcel of seed,
a Clove, or off-set of a Flower:
Who more passionately lament the
vvithering of some new fashioned
Slipps; than the Death of an old
try'd Friend. Does any Man laugh
at that <hi>Roman,</hi> who put on mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66431:84"/>
for the Death of his Lamprey?
After the same manner bewail they
the Funerals of their Flowers. Now
if any of these Candidates of <hi>Florae</hi>
have got any thing more new or rare,
O how he boasts it! How do his
Corrivals emulate and envy him?
Some of vvhom return no less pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
to their Houses than <hi>Sylla</hi> or <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
vvhen they vvere rejected in
their suit for the Pretorship. What
shall I call this but a merry kind of
madness? Not unlike to that of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
turning pale, and quarrelling
for their Topps and Counters. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
also how these men imploy
themselves in their Gardens; they
sit, they vvalk round about, they
gape and sleep, and nothing else;
as if they intended them not as pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of retirement, but as Sepulchres
of Sloth. A prophane Generation,
and such as I may justly exclude from
the Orgyes of the true and sacred
Garden, vvhich I know to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66431:85"/>
to modest pleasure, not to
Vanity, to ease, but not at all to
Sloth. Should I be of so feeble a
temper, that the gain or loss of a
poor Flower, should either exalt or
depress me? No, I esteem things at
their just rates, and setting aside the
meretricious advantage of Novelty:
I know they are but Plants; I know
they are but Flowers: that is, short-liv'd
and transitory things; of vvhich
the Prince of Poets hath pertinently
spoken,</p>
                  <l>When the soft VVestern winds abroad do
flye,</l>
                  <l>Some Flowers they make to spring, and
others dye.</l>
                  <p>I do not then despise these elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and delights (as you see) but
herein I differ from these delicate
Hortensii; that as I get such things
as these vvithout anxiety, so I keep,
and so I lose them. Nor am I so
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66431:85"/>
stupid, or rather so dead, that I should
cloyster up, and (as it vvere) bury my
self in these Garden shades: For even
in these retirements, I find business,
and my Mind doth here meet vvith
something vvhich it may performe
vvithout action. I am never less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
than vvhen alone (said one;) nor
ever less at leisure than when so. An
excellent saying, and vvhich I dare
affirm had its birth in such Gardens
as these, vvhich are intended for the
Mind, not the Body; to recreate that,
not to dissolve and soften this; and
for a safe retreat both from Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and Cares. Is company trouble<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>some?
Here you shall be vvith your
self: Have employments exhausted
your Spirits? Here they shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payr'd,
vvhere the Mind shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh'd
vvith its proper food of quiet,
and vvhere from this purer air, you
shall have as it were the inspiration
of a new life. If you look therefore
upon the ancient Sages, they dwelt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66431:86"/>
in Gardens; or upon the more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and improved Spirits of our times,
they delight in Gardens: And in those
for the most part are those divine
pieces compos'd, vvhich are the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Mankind, and vvhich no Age,
or successions of time shall ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish.
To this green <hi>Lycaeum</hi> do
we stand indebted for so many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
upon Nature: To this shady
<hi>Academy</hi> vve owe those discourses
about manners, and from the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of these Gardens are those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
springs of Wisdom diffus'd,
vvhich we drink of, and vvhich vvith
their fertill inundations have enrich'd
the World. For the Mind doth raise
and advance it self to higher and
greater things; vvhen free and at
large; it beholds its own Heaven,
then vvhen 'tis cloyster'd up within
the Prison of a House or City. Here
O ye Poets frame an everlasting and
immortal Verse; here let the learned
meditate and write; here O ye Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66431:86"/>
dispute of Tranquility, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
of Life, and Death. See <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
the true end and use of Gardens;
it is rest, secession, meditation, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
vvriting; and yet all these by way
of recreation only, and divertisement.
As Painters vvho by long poring have
vvearied and dimm'd their sight, call
it off to certain glasses and green ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
thereby to quicken and refresh
it; so do vve the Mind when it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
straggles or is tyred. And why
should I conceal my Custome from
you? Do you see that Arbour set out
vvith Topiary vvork? 'Tis the place I
have consecrated to the Muses. It is
my School of Wisdom. There I either
satisfie my Mind with serious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
reading, or improve it vvith the
Seeds of profitable Meditation? And as
arms are lay'd up in a Magazene: So
do I from them, store up precepts in
my Mind, vvhich are alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
by me, against every battery and
impression of Fortune. As oft as I
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66431:87"/>
enter there, I forthwith command
all base and servile cares to absent
themselves; and (asmuch as I may)
vvith an elevated Mind, I despise the
studies of the prophane vulgar, and
this great vanity in the affairs of Men.
Yes, I seem to my self to be wholly
divested of humanity; and to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
into Heaven it self, in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
Chariot of Wisdome. Do you
think it there troubles me, what the
<hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spaniard</hi> are designing? Who
keeps, or loses the Scepter of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia?</hi>
That the Tyrant of <hi>Asia,</hi> now
threatens us by Land or by Sea? Or
to conclude;
<q>
                        <l>VVhat Plots that King is forging in his
brains,</l>
                        <l>That in the North and frozen Climate
raigns?</l>
                     </q>
none of all these I vvill assure you.
Securely fortify'd against all that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal;
I retreat within my self, free
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66431:87"/>
from all sorts of cares except this one,
how I may subject this broken and
subdued Mind of mine to Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and to God: And all other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
things to my Mind, that vvhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
that fatal day shall come that
must put a period to my Life; I may
receive it vvith a compos'd, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadded
countenance; and may so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
out of this life, not as he that is
forc'd into exile, but as one that is
set at liberty. These are my musings
in my Gardens <hi>Lipsius;</hi> and these the
fruits which (so long as I am my self)
I shall not vvillingly exchange for all
the <hi>Persian</hi> and the <hi>Indian</hi> treasures.</p>

me into some amazement, vvhich

Constancy. The vvay I speak of is
Wisdom, whose smooth and even
path, I beseech and advise you no
longer to decline: Hath learning and

upon this as to make it both the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and end of your studies.
These are to be our rudiments but
not our vvork; our vvay but not our
Goale. In a feast (I suppose) you
vvould not feed only upon Quelk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choses
or Junkets; but would gratifie
your stomach vvith something that is
more solid. In this publick banquet
of Learning, why do you not the
same? Why add you not the firmer
food of Philosophy, to those delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Viands of Oratours and Poets?
For (mistake me not) I vvould not
that the one should be deserted, but
that the other should be superadded,
and that those looser, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more fluid Nymphs should be
tempered and mixed, vvith this (as
I may call it) severer <hi>Bacchus. Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope's</hi>
Suitors in <hi>Homer</hi> are justly laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at; vvho deserting the Mistress fell
to courting the Maids: Take heed
you do not the same, that despising
the great and excellent Princess, you
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66431:89"/>
should remain enamour'd of her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids.
It is a desirable purchase to
attain the praise of a learned Man;
that of a vvise Man is beyond it, but
that of a good Man surpasses all.
Hereafter let us aim at these; and
by all our labours endeavour not only
to know, but to be vvise and do:
<q>
                        <l>How vaine's that knowledge where</l>
                        <l>No VVisdome doth appear?</l>
                     </q>
sayes that old and true Verse. How
many are there in this our Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Muses, vvho dishonour
both themselves, and the very name
of Learning? Some in that they are
even covered with the black spots of
detestable impieties; and the most
because they are vain, light Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
only, and of no worthy design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Do they learn languages?
Yes, but languages alone. Do they
understand the Greek and Latine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors?
Yet they do but understand
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66431:90"/>
them, and as <hi>Anacharsis</hi> faid vvell
of the <hi>Athenians</hi> heretofore; they used
money only to count it: so these
their knowledge only to know. So
utterly regardless are they of their
lives, and of what they do, that (even
in my judgement) the vulgar seem
vvith some reason to look upon learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the Mistress of vice: But it is
indeed the Directress to vertue; if
we use it as we ought, and conjoyn
it with wisdom; to which learning
should prepare our Minds, but not
seize upon them, and detain them to
it self: For as there are some forts of
Trees, that will bear no fruit, unless
they are planted by other male ones
(as I may call them) so will the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Muses remain barren, unless
wedded to the Masculine strength of
wisdom. To what end dost thou cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<hi>Tacitus?</hi> and at the same time suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
so many <hi>Errata's</hi> in thine own life?
Why dost thou illustrate <hi>Tranquillus?</hi>
and yet permit thy self to be benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66431:90"/>
vvith Errour? Dost thou carefully
expunge the faults out of <hi>Plautus,</hi>
vvhen thou sufferest thy Mind to be
over-grown and neglected? Espouse
at the last more worthy designs, and
look after such a kind of learning as
may serve, not only for austentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and applause, but also for use. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
your self unto Wisdom which may
reforme your manners; calme and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
your troubled and dark Soul.
For 'tis she alone that can fix upon you
the impress of vertue; and consigne
you to Constancy, and give you a free
admission into the Temple of a good
Mind.</p>

<hi>Langius</hi> as one reproving me. Do

interrupting him, I know it <hi>Langius</hi>
reply'd I; but do you also I beseech
you lend me your assistance, and
continue the thread of Yesterdays
discourse, vvhich our summons to
supper did unhappily break off. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

this her dwelling? I mean that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
vvhich to me seems a Temple,
and the little Table in it, no other than
an Altar, at vvhich sitting down let us
Sacrifice to the Goddess. Besides I
take an Omen from the very place.
What Omen (sayes <hi>Langius?</hi>) 'Tis this
faid I, that as he who sits in a place
where Odors and sweet Unguents are,
carrys along with him in his Garments
the perfume and scent of the place:
So I am not without hope, that some
Air and Odour of Wisdom may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
unto my Mind, by sitting in this
her Store-house. I am afraid (sayes
<hi>Langius</hi> smiling) there is but little of
vveight in so light an Omen: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<hi>Lipsius</hi> let us set forward, for
not to dissemble with you, this so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
heat of yours does excite and
vvarm me too. And as the searchers
after springs, when in the Morning

that there they shall meet vvith

vvater: So have I hopes of a plentiful
spring of vertue, wheresoever I observe
in Youth an early desire of knowledge
to betray it self: And vvith this he,
led me into the Arbour, and seated
himself at the Table. But I first turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my self and calling to the Boyes;
stay there said I and vvaite, but be sure
you lock the door, and observe vvhat
I say; upon your lives see that no

                  <argument>
                     <p>A third Argument for Constancy drawn
from utility: Calamities are good
both in their Original and End.
Their Original is from God; who
being eternally and immutably good,
cannot be the cause of any Evil.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LAngius</hi> without any considerable
pawse thus began. In my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Constancy it is fit I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
I shall therefore observe the
same order and method vvhich Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday
I propounded. Then (as
you know) I form'd Four Squadrons
(as I call them) to fight in its behalf
against grief and dejectedness, The
two former of these, from Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Necessity; I have already
drawn forth, and have sufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
that publick evils are sent down
from God; as also that they are necessary
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:66431:93"/>
and impossible to be declin'd. I shall
now therefore bring up my Third
Squadron led by Utility; vvhich I may
truly call the Legion Adjutrix, a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
and subtile power, vvhich I
know not how doth convey and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate
it self into the Minds of Men,
and with a pleasing kind of violence
so overcomes them, as that themselves
are not unwilling to be conquer'd. It
rather gains upon us by degrees, than
by violent impressions, and rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
than compells us. For we
as readily permit our selves to be led
by Utility, as drawn by Necessity.
This <hi>Lipsius</hi> I now oppose against you
and your failing troops. For these
publick evils vvhich we suffer are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
and contribute much to our
inward advantage. Did I call them
Evils? They are rather goods; if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
this veil of Opinion, we have
a due recourse unto their Original
and End; of vvhich the former is from
good, and the latter is for good. For
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66431:94"/>
the Original of these Calamities (as
Yesterday I sufficiently prov'd) is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
from God: That is, not only
from the chiefest good it self, but
from the Author, cause, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all other good vvhatsoever;
from vvhom it is as utterly impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that any evil should proceed, as
that himself should be evil. That
power is only benign and healthful,
equally despising to receive and to do
vvrong, and vvhose sole and chief
prerogative it is to benefit. And
therefore those ancient and blinder
sort of Men, conceiving something of
the supream Being in their Minds;
did rightly give him his Name from
helping. Suppose you that he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated,
and that as one in a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he hurles down these evils as
so many deadly Arrows upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?
No. Anger and Revenge are
humane Affections, and being the
effects of vveakness, are found only
amongst the infirme. But that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66431:94"/>
Being doth eternally persever
in its benignity, and those very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities
vvhich vve tast off from him,
are only as Medicines; sharp and
bitter to the sense, but healthful in
their issue and events. <hi>That</hi> Homer
<hi>of Philosophers said rightly God doth
no evil, and therefore cannot be the
cause of any. But better and more fully
that wise one of ours. What is the cause
of the ods doing good? Their Nature.
He errs that imagines they are either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
or able to do hurt. As they cannot
receive, so neither can they do an injury.
The first honor that we owe to the Gods,
is to believe that they are, the next is
to ascribe Majesty to them, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
without which there is no Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.
To know they are those, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
over the world; who govern all
things as their own; who are the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
of Mankind, and of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
person, and that no evil is in them,
neither doth any proceed from them.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The end of Calamities alwayes directed
to good; though often administred
by wicked Men, and for their evil
ends. The force of them is broken
and allay'd by God. All things are
guided to our advantage. VVhy
God uses wicked Men as his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
therein.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>CAlamities then are good in their
Original; they are so also in their
End, because they are alwayes dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to our good. You vvill say vvhich
vvay? Is not mischief and ruine the
manifest end of Warr and Slaughter?
It is I confess if you look at Men,
but not if you look upon God. That
you may the more clearly apprehend
this, It vvill be requisite thus to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
of divine punishments; some
are simple and others are mixt: Those
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66431:95"/>
I call simple vvhich are immediately
from God; vvithout the intervening
of any humane Contrivance or Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
The mixt, are such as are
from God too; but acted and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Men. Of the former kind are
Famine, Barrenness, Earth-quakes,
Inundations, Diseases, and Death:
Of the latter, Tyrannies, Warres,
Oppressions, Slaughters. The first
sort are pure and innocent, as being
deriv'd to us from the purest Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
In the other I vvill not deny,
but there is some mixture of filth,
inasmuch as they pass through, and
are convey'd to us by the impure
Channels of Affections. Man inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddles
therein, and then vvhat vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is it, if Sin and corruption do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it self? That is the vvonder that
such is the merciful Providence of
God, as can convert that poyson into
Medicine, and that Sin into good.
See you that Tyrant there, who breaths
out nothing but threatnings and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:66431:96"/>
vvhose delights are in doing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and vvho could be content to
perish himself, provided he might
thereby accomplish the destruction of
others: Let him alone a while, he shall
fail in his designes; and God by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and indiscernible thread (vvhile he
thinks and vvills nothing less) shall
guide him to his end. As the Arrow
vvithout any sense of its own, arrives
at that mark vvhich the Archer intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
so do vvicked Men. For that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
power doth inhibit and restrain
all humane powers, directing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
all their vvandring steps unto
that best end of his. As in an Army
the Souldiers are variously affected;
spoile encourages this, glory him, and
hatred that other; but all fight for
their Prince and Victory: So every of
these wills of ours, whether they are
good or evil, serve under, and fight
for God, and amidst the greatest va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of their own designed ends, do at
last touch upon this (as I may so call it)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66431:96"/>
End of Ends. But you vvill say vvhy
does God use the help of the vvicked?
Why does not he himself send that
better sort of Calamities amongst us;
at least the worser by more desirable
instruments? Thou art over curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inquisitive O Man: Neither am I
certain vvhether I am able to explain
these Mysteries of Providence. But
this I know, that he sufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the reason of his actings;
even at such times as we are not able
to discern the least of it in them. But
vvhat is it that appears so strange,
and unusual to us? The Ruler of a
Province condemnes a malefactour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws; and commits
the Execution of his Sentence to <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi>
or the Lictor. The Father of
a great Family sometimes corrects his
Son himself; at others commits it to
the care of a Servant or Tutor. Why
should not God have the same liberty?
Why should not he vvhen he so pleases
chastise us vvith his own hand? And
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:66431:97"/>
when he sees it good vvith anothers.
There is no wrong or injury done to
us in all this. Does that Servant hate
you? Doth he come vvith a Mind to
do you a mischief? It matters not,
overlooking the instrument of vvhat
you suffer: Look back to the Mind
of him that hath commanded it. For
assuredly the Father that requires it
stands by; nor will he suffer one stripe
to be superadded to what himself hath
prescribed. But you ask again; why
is Sin here immixed? and why are
these divine Arrowes dipp'd in the
poyson of Affections? You put me
upon a difficult task, which yet I shall
adventure upon; and my answer is,
that God may declare his Wisdom
and Power. They are St. <hi>Austine's</hi>
words; he judg'd it better to make
evils good, than to permit no evills
at all. For vvhat greater instance can
there be of Wisdom and Goodness,
than to bring good out of evil, and
to make those things Conspire
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:66431:97"/>
our welfare, which were found out
for our ruine. You commend that
Physitian who successefully mixes his
Treacle with a Viper. And why
should you resent it in God, if vvith
this Plaister of Calamities, he shall
intermixe something that is hurtfull,
vvithout any damage of yours. For
he doth certainly decoct and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
all the adhering poyson, by the
secret fire of his Providence. Lastly,
this magnifyes his power and glory;
to vvhich all things are by himself of
Necessity referr'd. For vvhat can
more lively express his power than
this? That he not only overcomes
those Enemies that wrastle with him;
but also overcomes them in such a
manner, as brings them over to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and causes them to take Armes
in the pursuance of his Victories:
Which every day comes to pass,
vvhen the vvill of God is done by
evill Men, though not of them; since
he so manages all those things which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66431:98"/>
the vvicked do in opposition to his
vvill; that none of them are besides
his will. And vvhat greater miracle
can there be, than that vvicked Men
should make vvicked Men good? Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
thou <hi>Cajus Caesar,</hi> and at once
tread under Foot the two Sacred
Names of thy County, and Son in Law.
This thy ambition vvithout thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
shall be subservient to God;
yes to thy Country it self, against
vvhich it vvas taken up: For it shall
prove the reparation and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Roman State. Thou
<hi>Attila</hi> fly from the remotest parts of
the World, and thirsting after blood
and spoile, Sack, kill, burn, and
wast; all this cruelty shall fight for
God, and prove nothing else but an
awakening of the Christians from
slumbring in the Beds of Pleasure and
Security. You two <hi>Vespasians</hi> what
do you? Ruine <hi>Iudea</hi> and the Jews:
Take, and raze the whole City; but
for what end? As you indeed intend
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:66431:98"/>
it; for the glory and enlargement of
the Empire, but you mistake your
selves, you are only the Lictours and
Executioners of the divine venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
upon an impious Nation. Go
ye vvho possibly have martyr'd the
Christians at <hi>Rome,</hi> and revenge the
Death of <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Iudaea.</hi> All ages
are full of such examples, how God
by the sinful desires of some Men
hath accomplished his own good
pleasure; and by the injustice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
hath executed his own just
and righteous Judgments. Let us
therefore <hi>Lipsius</hi> rather admire than
busily pry into this recluded Power
of his Wisdom, and let us know,
that all sorts of Calamities are good
in their events: Although this Mind
of ours be so blind as not to discern
it, or so flow in its apprehensions
as not to reach and comprehend it.
For their true ends are oftentimes

They are Three-fold; and
to whom each belongs. Of the first
End, vvhich is for the exercise of

                  <p>IF I may therefore hoise Sail and

divine matters; I may possibly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
some things more fully and distinctly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66431:99"/>
concerning the Ends themselves. But
it is fit I should preface an attempt
of this Nature vvith that of <hi>Homer,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>If it may be done by me,</l>
                     <l>Or the thing it self can be.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>For there are some of them, which
methinks I am able with some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
to comprehend and point out,
but there are others vvhich I can
only rove and guess at. Of the more
apparent ones, are these three; to
Exercise, Chastise, and Punish us.
For if you observe it, the most usual
and ordinary calamities do either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
the good, or chastise the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending,
or punish the wicked; and
all this for our good. For (to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
and dwell awhile upon the first
End) we daily see the best Men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
press'd by calamities singly and
apart by themselves; or else inclosed
by them, in society with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
We observe and vvonder at it;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66431:100"/>
as neither sufficiently comprehending
the cause; nor rightly considering the
End. Now the cause is the love of
God towards us, not his hate; and
the End is not our hurt, but our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.
For this exercise doth advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
us more wayes than one: It
strengthens us, it tryes us, and it fits
us to lead on others. It strengthens
us, being (as it vvere) that School;
vvherein God trains up his in Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and Virtue. We see vvrastlers
inure themselves to sharp Tryals;
that they may overcome at last: think
the same of us in this School of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
For that great Master of
ours is a sharp and severe exerciser
of us; and exacts our labours and
patience not only unto sweat but
blood: Suppose you that he fondly
trains up his, and that he eherishes
them in the soft blandishments of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight? No. They are
Mothers vvhich soften and enervate
their children, by an over-tenderness
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66431:100"/>
in their education; but Fathers vvho
preserve them, by acquainting them
vvith hardship. Now God is our
Father, and therefore as he doth truly
so he severel loves us. If you would
be a Pilot, you must be brought up
amongst stormes; if a Souldier, you
must be trained up in dangers; and
if you would be truly a Man, vvhy
do you start at afflictions, since there
is no other vvay to acquire strength.
Do you see those languishing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
Bodies, whom the Sun seldom
looks upon, the vvind never assails,
and the more piercing air never lights
upon; the Minds of those soft and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
happy Men, are such as the least
gust of an angry Fortune vvill over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and dissolve. Afflictions then do
strengthen us, and as trees fasten
their roots the deeper by how much
the more they are shaken with the
Winds; so good Men become the
more fixed in vertue, when attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the storms of adversity. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66431:101"/>
do also prove and try us;
for otherwise how shall any Man be
able to judge of his firmness and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency?
If a prosperous vvind do
ever fill the Sail, the Pilot has no
opportunity to display his skill; and
if all things still evenly and happily
succeed to Man, he shall lose the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his vertue; for the only unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
touch-stone of it, is affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<hi>It was a gallant Speech of</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius:
<hi>Nothing seems to me more
unhappy than that Man who ha's never
tasted of Adversity, and it is most true.</hi>
For our Great General doth not
exempt such Men, but distrusts them;
he doth not indulge, but discards
and contemns them. He rases I say
their names out of the Muster Rolls
of his Legions, as a sort of feeble
and unserviceable persons. Lastly,
they adapt us to lead on others; for
the courage and patience of good
Men in their sufferings, is a light to
this benighted World. They invite
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:66431:101"/>
others by their example to the same
things, and as it were trace out a
path of vertue for them to walk in.
<hi>Bias</hi> lost at once his Fortunes and his
Country; but he yet calls out to
Men, that they be sure to carry all
their Treasure about them. <hi>Regulus</hi>
in the midst of his Torments unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
expir'd; But that excellent and
noble example of promise keeping
doth yet survive. <hi>Papinianus</hi> is slain
by the Tyrant; but his Axe hath
taught us securely to abide it, when
we must dye in the maintenance of
Justice. To conclude, there are a
number of most admirable Persons,
that through violence or injustice, have
been banished or slain: but from
those Rivers of blood; we daily suck
and drink in our improvements in
Constancy and Vertue: All which
notwithstanding would for ever have
been concealed in darkness, were it
not for this Torch of afflictions. For
as Spices do every way emit and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66431:102"/>
their Odours when they are
pounded; so Vertue doth then chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
display her Glories, when she is
oppressed.</p>

                     <p>Of Chastisement, the Second End. That
it avails us two wayes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Second End is to Chastise
us, than vvhich there could not
be a more gentle or effectual means
found out for our preservation. For
it benefits and preserves us two wayes,
either as a scourge, vvhen vve have
offended, or as a Bridle lest vve
should offend. As a scourge, since
it is the hand of a Father vvhich oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
corrects an offendor for his faults;
but it is an Executioner, that slowly
and only once punishes. As vve use
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66431:102"/>
fire or vvater for the cleansing and
purging away of filth and dross: So
doth God make use of afflictions to
take away that of our sins. And it
is deservedly a scourge upon us at
this time <hi>Lipsius;</hi> for vve <hi>Belgians</hi> had
before offended; and being corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vvith vvealth and pleasures, vve
Ran on Headlong in the Way of
Vice. But our God gently warnes
and recalls us; and scourges us with
some stripes, that forewarned by
these, we may return to our selves
and to him. He takes away our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
we abused them to Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury;
our liberty, because we enlarg'd
it to licentiousness? And vvith this
gentle <hi>Ferula</hi> of Calamities, he doth
(as it were) expiate and purge away
our offences. A gentle one indeed,
for how slight a satisfaction is this?
They say the <hi>Persians</hi> when they are
to punish some Illustrious and great
Person, use to stripp him of his Robes
and Tiara; and hanging them up
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66431:103"/>
they scourge these instead of the
Man: So doth this Father of ours,
vvho in every of his chastisements
overpasses us, and touches onely
upon our Bodies, our Lands, our
Goods, and our ourward Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
This Chastisement serves
us also for a bridle, vvhich he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely
casts over us, when he
sees vve are about to offend. As
Physitians do sometimes advisedly
breath a vein, not because we are
sick, but that we may not be; so by
these Calamities God doth vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from us some such things, as
would otherwise become incentives
and fewel to our Vices. For he
vvho gave a being to all things doth
vvell understand their Natures; nor
doth he judge of their Diseases, by
the Complexion and Pulse; but by
the Heart and Reins. Doth he see
the Genius of the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> to be
over-haughty and raised? He rules
them by a Prince: The <hi>Helvetians</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:66431:103"/>
easy and quiet? He indulges them
liberty: The <hi>Venetians</hi> of a temper
betwixt both? He fits them vvith a
middle vvay of Government; and
vvill possibly change all these here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
as the persons shall vary their
Conditions. Nevertheless, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
and vvhy (say vve) are vve
longer harras'd vvith vvar than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
and vvhy are vve crush'd
under a heavier Yoke of servitude?
Thou Fool, and now really sick!
Art thou vviser than thy Maker? Tell
me vvhy doth the Physitian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
more Wormwood or Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
for this than for that Man? Is
it not because his Disease or Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
requires it? Think the same
here; possibly he sees this people
more stubborn, and therefore to be
subdued by stripes; that other more
tractable and apt to be reduced with
the shaking of the Rod. But you
do not think so: It may be so. Our
Parents vvill not trust a Knife or
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:66431:104"/>
Sword in the Hand of their Child
(though he cry for it) as foreseeing
his hurt. Why then should God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
us to our destruction; since
vve are truly Children, and neither
know how to ask those things which
are expedient for us; nor how to
part vvith those that will be fatal to
us? You may therefore lament if
you please, and as much as you please,
but you shall notwithstanding drink
of that cup of sorrowes, vvhich that
Heavenly Physitian presents you with,
and vvhich he hath (not unadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
filled so full for you.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of punishment the Third End; that
it is good both in respect of God,
Men, and him that is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>PUnishment I confess respects evil
Men, but is no evil it self. For
First, it is good if you respect God,
whose eternal and immoveable law
of Justice doth require that the crimes
of Men be either amended, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
out of the vvay. Now cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement
amends those that can be
vvashed out; and those vvhich can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
punishment takes away. It is
good also in respect of Men, amongst
vvhom no society could stand and
continue; if all things vvere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vvith impunity to turbulent
and desperate spirits. As the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of petty Thieves and Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66431:105"/>
conduces to every Mans private
security: So does that of the greater
and most famous ones to that of the
publick welfare. Those divine ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions
upon Tyrants, and the
great riflers of the World ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
sometimes to intervene, that
there may be examples to admonish
us,</p>
                  <l>—That there is a wakeful Eye</l>
                  <l>Of justice, which doth all descry.</l>
                  <p>And vvhich to other Potentates
and people may cry out,</p>
                  <l>—Thus warn'd by others miseries,</l>
                  <l>Learn justice and the Gods not to despise.</l>
                  <p>It is good: Thirdly, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
those very persons that are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
For it is for their sakes; since
it is not so properly a revenge, or an
utterly destroying judgement, as a
gentle cohibition and restraint from
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66431:105"/>
Sin, or to speak it fully vvith the
Graecians a punishment not a revenge,
for that Gracious Diety</p>
                  <l>Never consults his Anger that from
thence</l>
                  <l>He may severest punishments dispense.</l>
                  <p>As that Impious Poet said piously.
As Death is sometimes sent in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to good Men before they sin: So
to the incorrigeable vvicked in the
midst of their Sins, because they are
so devoted to them, that unless they
be cut off, they cannot be divorced.
God therefore stops their unbridled
course, and vvhile they are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sin for the present, and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others for the future; he merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
takes them away. To conclude
all punishment is good, as it respects
justice, as on the contrary impunity
is evil, which makes Men sinful,
that is miserable Men to continue so
longer. Boetius <hi>said well, wicked
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66431:106"/>
Men are more happy under punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than if Iustice should inflict
none at all upon them; and he gives
this reason, because some good is come
amongst them (to wit) punishment,
which in all the heap of their other crimes
they never yet had.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a fourth End; which pertains either
to the Conservation and defence of
the Vniverse, or its Ornament. The
Explication of each.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THese are the three certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Ends, vvhich I have pass'd
vvith a sure and steady Foot: the
fourth remains vvhich I must adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon with a doubtful one. For
it is more remov'd and obscure, than
that our humane capacities should
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66431:106"/>
perfectly reach it. I discover it only
through a Cloud, and I may guess
and offer at it, but never certainly
know and attain to it. The End
vvhich I mean hath a double respect
and regards either the conservation
or the beauty of the Universe. I
therefore suppose it is for its conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
because that God who made
and disposed all things by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
wisdom; did so make them, that
he bounded every of them within a
certain number, measure, and weight:
Nor can any particular Creature trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
these limits, vvithout the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or ruine of the vvhole. Thus
those great bodies the Heavens, the
Earth, the Sea have their bounds; thus
every Age hath its appointed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and thus both Men, Cities, and
Kingdomes have their stated accounts.
Will they exceed these? It is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that some storme and tempest of
Calamities do check and retard them:
For otherwise they vvould endanger
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66431:107"/>
and bring damage to, this beautiful
frame of the World. But those things
especially vvould exceed these bounds
very often, that are under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Encrease and Multiply. Look
upon Men, who can deny that by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
vve are born faster, than we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
dye? So that in a few years
from two persons a family of a hundred
may be propagated; of vvhich in that
space not above ten or twenty may
dye. Look upon a flock of Sheep;
how numerous would the encrease
be, if the Shepheard should not year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
choose out and set apart some to
the Slaughter? The Birds and Fishes
vvould in a short time fill the Air and
Waters, if there vvere not certain
dissentions; and (as it vvere) vvarrs
amongst themselves, and the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of Men to diminish them. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
age is building of Cities and
Towns; and if fire or other wayes of
destruction should not interpose; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this vvorld of ours, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66431:107"/>
vvorld vvould be able to contain
them. The same may vve imagine
of the vvhole Creation. What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
therefore is it if our <hi>Saturn</hi> doth
sometimes thrust his Sickle into this
over-grown Field; and reap thence
some superfluous thousands, either by
the pestilence or vvarr? Which if he
should not do, vvhat Country vvould
be able to hold us, or vvhat Land
could afford us sustenance? It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
requisite that something should
perish from the parts; that so the
vvhole may be eternal. For as to
Rulers in States the safety of the
People is the supream Law: So is it
to God in respect of the World. For
the beauty or Ornament of the
World I conceive calamities make two
vvayes. First, because I apprehend
no beauty any where in this great
frame without variety, and a distinct
succession and change of things. I
acknowledge the Sun is exceedingly
beautiful, but he becomes more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66431:108"/>
to us at his return; through
the interposition of the dew-engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
Night; and those black Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
vvhich she shuts him out vvith.
The Summer is a most pleasant sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but yet the vvinter sets it off,
vvith it's icy marbles, and hoary
Frosts: Which if you take away,
you really destroy the true rellish,
and that particular gust of Joy, which
it's light and Warmth afford us.
In this Country of ours, one and
the same face of things delights me
not; but I am pleasingly affected to
behold the Valleys and Hills, and
Rocks, fruitful and vvast places, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and Woods, for satiety and
loathing are alwayes the Companions
of Equality. And vvhy then in this
Scene of life (as I may so call it) should
the same dress and countenance of
things delight us? In my Mind it
should not: Let there be sometimes
some smooth and Halcyon Calmes;
and let those after a while be discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:66431:108"/>
and ruffled vvith the vvhirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvinds
of Warr, and the boysterous
stormes of succeeding Tyrannies. For
who would wish that this Universe
should be like the dead Sea; without
Wind or Motion? But there is also
another Ornament vvhich I guess at
vvhich is more serious and inwardly
fruitful. Histories informe me, that
better and smoother times, do still
succeed storms. Do Warrs molest
any people? Yet for the most part
they refine and sharpen them; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
the Arts, and a various cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ingenuity. The <hi>Romans</hi> of old
impos'd a heavy yoke upon the world;
but vvithall it prov'd a happy one in
the event; for as the Sun chases away
darkness from our Eyes: So did that
ignorance and barbarisme from their
Minds. What had the <hi>Gaules</hi> or we
<hi>Germans</hi> now been, if the light of that
great Empire had not risen to us? A
sort of wild and inhumane savages,
glutting our selves with our own and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66431:109"/>
others blood; and despisers both of
God and Man. And if I rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
the same will befal this new
World; vvhich the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with an
advantageous kind of cruelty have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted;
but vvill again restore, and
otherwise replenish. And as those
vvho have great plantations; remove
some trees elsewhere, and cut down
others: Skilfully disposing all things,
to make them more fruitful and to
prosper the better: So doth God in
this vast Field of the World. For he
is the most excellent improver, in
some places he prunes and cuts off the
luxuriant branches of some Families,
and in others (as I may so say) he
plucks off some leaves of persons.
This helps the stock, though the
branches fall, and the leaves that drop
off, become the mockery of the vvinds.
He sees this Nation scorched and
vvithered away; as having out-liv'd
their Vertues, and he casts them out.
That other he observes to be vvild
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66431:109"/>
and unfruitful; he therefore transfers
them; and others he mingles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and engrafts them (as it vvere)
into one another. You <hi>Italians</hi> in
the declining of the Empire, being
now decayed and enfeebled: Why
cumber you any longer that choice
part of Earth? Depart and let those
hardy and unbroken <hi>Lombards</hi> more
happily improve that soil. You vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and effeminate <hi>Graecians</hi> perish
and let the harsh and sowre <hi>Scythians</hi>
be mellowed there. So also by a kind
of confusion of Nations, you <hi>French</hi>
possess <hi>Gaul,</hi> you <hi>Saxons Brittain,</hi> you
<hi>Normans Belgia</hi> and the places ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning.
All which and more <hi>Lipsius</hi>
will readily occurre to him that is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Histories and the Events of
things. Let us take courage then
and know, that whatever private Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
comes upon us; is some way
or other advantageous to some part of
the Universe. The setting of this
Nation or Kingdom shall be the rise
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66431:110"/>
of another. The ruines of this City,
the foundation of a new one, nor can
any thing here be properly said to
dye, but to change only. Shall we
<hi>Belgians</hi> think to be the only choice
ones with God; that shall be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
wedded to felicity; and the only
white boyes of Fortune. Fooles that
we are. That great Father hath many
more Children whom (because he will
not all at once) permit to cherish, and
receive by turnes into his bosome.
We have already had our Sun-shines;
let the Night succeed awhile, and let
those beauteous rayes withdraw to the
Western Nations. <hi>Seneca</hi> (as he uses)
speaks aptly and wisely to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
<hi>Let a wise Man repine at nothing that

do make to the conservation of the
Visiverse, and are of that number which
fullfil that Law and Order which the

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:66431:111"/>
how comes it to pass that this arrow

This is that thick and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

which (if you can) I pray dissolve and
scatter with some ray of Reason. <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
frowning upon me, Young man

in the chase of that first buck they

you shall follow me in that track which

that if you are good, you may know

As Moths and other little

the Mind of Man, sport it self and

the causes (say you) vvhy divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
overpasses these; and seises
upon these? The causes? I may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
say I know them not. For that
Heavenly Court never admitted me,
nor I its decrees. This only I know,
that the chief cause of all other causes
is the vvill of God: Beyond vvhich if
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66431:112"/>
any Man enquire, after any force or
power; he is ignorant of the Divine
Nature. For it is necessary that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
cause be both before and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than its effect; but than God and
his Will, there is nothing either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or greater. There is therefore
no cause of it. God strikes, and God
passes by; vvhat would you have more?
As <hi>Salvian</hi> sayes piously and truly;
the vvill of God is the perfection of
Justice: But you vvill say, vve desire
some reason of this inequality from,
vvhom? from God? To vvhom alone it
is lawful to do vvhatsoever he pleases,
and vvho is pleased to do nothing but
vvhat is lawful? Shall a Servant call
his Master; or a Subject his Prince to
account? The one vvould call it an
affront; and the other Rebellion:
and vvill you be more insolent against
God himself? Avvay vvith this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
curiosity! This reason doth not
otherwise appear to be one, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it may be rendred to none.

And yet vvhen you have all done,

                  <argument>
                     <p>Yet to satisfie the curious, three usual
Objections are answered: First, of
that; that evil Men are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
To which is reply'd; that
though their punishments are defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they are not remitted. And
this comes to pass either for Mans
sake, or from the Nature of God
which is slow to Revenge.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis rude and simple vvay <hi>Lipsius</hi>
is here the only safe one; the
rest are slippery and deceitful. In su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
and divine things, the only
acuteness is to discern nothing; and
the only knowledge is to be ignorant.
But forasmuch as this Cloud hath
heretofore, and doth still rest upon the
Minds of Men; in a few words (if
possible) I shall endeavour to remove
it, and vvaft you (now at a-stand) over
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66431:113"/>
this River also. Pardon me, O thou
Heavenly Mind said he (lifting up his
Eyes) if I shall deliver any thing of
these secrets (yet vvith a pious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
less pure and pious than I ought.
And first of all <hi>Lipsius</hi> methinks I am
able in general to vindicate the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God vvith this one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If God doth behold humane
things, he doth also care for them,
if he cares for them, he governs
them, if he governes them it is with
judgement, and if vvith judgement,
how then unjustly? For vvithout
judgement there is no government,
but a meer heap, confusion and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.
What have you to oppose
against this Javelin; What Shield or
vvhat armes? If you vvill confess it,
nothing but humane ignorance; I
cannot conceive (say you) vvhy these
should be punish'd, and those other
escape. Be it so; vvill you therefore
add impudence to your imprudence;
and carp at the power of that Divine
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:66431:114"/>
Lavv, vvhich you cannot conceive
of? What more unjust way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
against justice can there be
than this? If any stranger should take
upon him to judge of the Laws and
Constitutions of your Country; you
vvould command him to desist and
be silent, because he understands
them not, and shall you vvho are
the inhabitant of earth, presume
rashly to censure the Laws of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
You understand not? Or you
that are the vvork to question your
Maker? But it matters not, go
on, for I shall now come up more
close to you, and distinctly examine
(as you desire me) these misty ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
of yours by the Sun of
Reason. Three things you object,
that God doth not punish the vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
that he doth punish the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
and that he substitutes and
and exchanges offendours. You say
first divine vengeance doth ill to pass
by vvicked men. Doth it then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpass
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66431:114"/>
them? In my apprehension it
doth not, but rather deferrs their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
If divers Men owe me
money; and I require it of this deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
assoon as it becomes due, and
allow to that other a longer time of
payment: Am I therefore culpable?
Or are not these things at my own
dispose? The same does our Great
God; to vvhom all vvicked men owe
a punishment: He requires it present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of these, but gives day to others;
yet to be paid with interest, and what
injustice is this? unless (possibly) you
are solicitous for God, and fear he
should lose part of his debt, by his
merciful forbearance: But you need
not fear it; no Man ever prov'd bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
to this supream Creditour. We
are all under his Eye vv<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eresoever we
betake our selves; nay already in his
shackles and custody. But I vvould
(say you) have such a Tyrant imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
punished, that by his present
slaughter, he may satisfie so many as
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:66431:115"/>
he hath oppressed. For this vvay the
Justice of God vvould shine out the
more illustriously to us. Rather your
stupidity in my Mind. For vvho art
thou that not only presumest to lead
on the judgements of God, but also
to prescribe him his season? Do you
think him your judge, or rather your
Lictour or Executioner? Dispatch,
lead him off (say you) scourge him,
cover his face, and hang him up: For
it is my vvill it should be so. O im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence!
But God vvills it otherwise,
vvho (you ought to know) sees more
clearly into these matters, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
for other ends. The heats of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and a certain desire of Revenge
transport us; from all vvhich God is
most remotely distant, and intends
the vvarning and correction of others:
For he best knowes to vvhom and
vvhen these things may be useful. The
choice of times is of great moment,
and for vvant of a due and seasonable
administration, the safest medicines
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66431:115"/>
do oftentimes prove fatal to us. He
took away <hi>Caligula</hi> in the first setting
out of his Tyranny: He suffered <hi>Nero</hi>
to run on longer, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> beyond
either; and this no doubt for the good
of those very Men, vvho then also
complain'd. Our vicious and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
manners, do often stand in
need of a lasting and continued scourge,
though vve vvould have it straight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,
and thrown into the Fire.
This is one cause of the forbearance
of God, vvhich respect us; the other
respects himself. To vvhom it seems
natural to proceed on to his Revenge
vvith a slow pace; and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the delay of his punishment
vvith the vveight of it. <hi>Synecius</hi> said
vvell, the Divine inquisition moves on
slowly and by degrees: And so did
the Ancients vvho from this property
of his; feign'd God to have feet of
Wool. So that although you are
passionately hasty of Revenge; you
cannot yet accuse this delay, since it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66431:116"/>
is so only a respite of punishment;
that it may be also an encrease. Tell
me, vvere you present at a Tragedy;
vvould you stomach it that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treus</hi>
there, or the <hi>Thyestes;</hi> in the
first or second act, should in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
garbe, and vvith a stately tread,
pass through the Scenes: That they
should rule there, threaten and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
all? I suppose you would not,
for you know that felicity is but short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd:
And expect that all this gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
should finish in a fatal Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe.
In this Play and Fable of
the World, vvhy are you more offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vvith God, than you vvould be
vvith any Poet? That wicked Man
flourishes, and that Tyrant lives hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
Be it so; but think vvithall that
this is but the first Act: And before
possess your self inwardly vvith this,
that tears and forrows press on hard
to overtake those joyes. This Scene
shall shortly flow vvith blood, and then
those robes of Gold, and Purple shall
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66431:116"/>
be rowled up and down, and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in it. For that great Master of
ours is a good Poet, and vvill not
rashly exceed the Lawes of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.
Do vve not vvillingly bear with
Discords in Musick for some time;
because vve know that the last clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
vvill end in comfort? Do so
here. But you vvill say those miserable
Creatures that have suffered under this
Tyranny, do not alwayes see the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
What wonder is it? For
the Play is oftentimes somewhat long;
and they are not able to sit it out in
this Theatre. But others see it and
fear; because they see that though
(in this severe Court of Judicatory)
some Men are reprieved; yet they
are not pardoned: And though the
day of execution is prolonged, yet it
is not forgot. Wherefore <hi>Lipsius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this; that vvicked Men are
sometimes forborne, but never acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Nor is there any Man that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
a crime into his brest, but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66431:117"/>
vvho also hath a <hi>Nemesis</hi> at his back;
for that Goddess is in pursuit of him
and as I may say vvith <hi>Euripides,</hi>

                  <l>And though he strive with utmost hast</l>

                  <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>That there are divers sorts of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
some occult and internal,
which accompany the crime it self;
and which the wicked never escape.
That such are more grievous than
any external ones.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHich notwithstanding that you
may more clearly apprehend;
and that I may once lead you into the
height of this cause: You must know;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66431:117"/>
that Divine punishments are threefold;
Internal, Posthumous, and External.
Those I call Internal vvhich are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on the Soul, vvhile it is yet
in the Body; such are Anxiety, Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
Fears, and a thousand pangs
and stings of Conscience. Those are
Posthumous; vvhich are inflicted upon
the same Soul, but then vvhen it is
freed and separate from the Body.
Such are those torments which even
the Ancients (most of them) vvere
of opinion did await the vvicked after
Death. The third sort are such as
touch upon the Body, or the things
that belong to it; as Poverty, Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Pain, Diseases, Death. All
vvhich do (sometimes) by the just
Judgment of God concurr against the
Wicked; but the two former alwayes.
To speak of internal punishments;
vvhere shall we find the Man, so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusely
and audaciously wicked; that
hath not sensibly felt in his Soul some
of these sharp scourges, and stripes
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66431:118"/>
either in the Commission of his crimes
or at least after he hath acted them.
So true is that vvhich <hi>Plato</hi> said of
old; that punishment treads upon the
heels of sin: or as <hi>Hesiod</hi> more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
it is coeval and twinns with it.
The punishment of evil is not only
ally'd to; but is bred vvithin that evil,
nor is there any thing in this Life,
that can pretend to calmness and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity;
besides innocence alone. As
the <hi>Roman</hi> custome did enforce the
Malefactour to bear that Cross which
vvas streight to bear him: So hath
God impos'd upon all wicked Men,
this Cross of Conscience; on vvhich
they shall begin to suffer, before their
further and vvorse sufferings do begin.
Do you suppose that only to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
which we can look upon,
and which this Body doth sensibly
undergo? No. All those external things
do but lightly, and for no long time
touch upon us; they are the internal
that more exquisitely torment us. As
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66431:118"/>
we judge them to be more desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sick, who languish away under an
inward waste; than those that are seis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vvith some visible inflammation, or
preternatural hearts, though these last
are more apparent: So are vvicked
Men under a more grievous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vvho vvith so low and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible
procedures are lead on to
their eternal Death. It used to be
the cruel command of <hi>Caligula;</hi> so
strike as that he may feel he dyes;
the same befalls these Men, vvhom
their Conscience as an Executioner,
doth daily torture, and even kill by
these slow degrees of lesser and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
stripes. Nor let the splendour or
the inlarged power and vvealth of those
Men impose upon you: Since they are
no more happy and fortunate for these
than they are healthful, whose Gout
or Feaver rests it self upon a purple
Couch. Do you see a beggarly Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
represent in some Play the person
of a Prince, all Pompous and brave?
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66431:119"/>
You behold him yet vvithout envy;
for you know how under those golden
Robes his Sores and Filth, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
lye hid: Think the same of all
those great and proud Tyrants: <hi>In
whose Minds if they lay open to us saith</hi>
Tacitus, <hi>we might behold gashes and
wounds:</hi> For as Bodies are torn with
stripes; so are the Souls of Men mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
dilacerated vvith blood, lust,
and other impious contrivances. They
laugh I confess sometimes, but it is
no true laughter: They rejoyce, but
their joyes are not genuine and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but it fares vvith them as vvith
condemned vvretches in a prison, who
endeavour with Dice and Tables to
shake out of their Memories the
thoughts of their execution, but are
not able: For the deep impression of
their approaching punishment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
with them; and the fearful
Image of pale Death is continually
before their Eyes. Look now upon
the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrant, vvith-dravving
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66431:119"/>
only the Veil of his outward happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <l>A drawn Sword hangs in a twine thread</l>
                  <l>Over the wretches impious head.</l>
                  <p>Hear that <hi>Roman</hi> lamenting, let the
God's and Goddesses destroy me worse
then I every day perceive my self to
perish. Hear that other thus sighing;
Am I then that only one, vvho have
neither Friend nor Enemy? These <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
are the true torments and agonies
of Souls; to be in perpetual Anguish,
Sorrow, Dread, and which are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
beyond any Racks; or other
invented wayes for the torture of the
Body.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That punishments after Death do await
the wicked, and that for the most
part they are not acquitted from

                  </argument>
                  <p>ADde to these those Posthumous
and External pains vvihch vve
have learned from Divinity; and which
vvithout further discussion it will be
sufficient only thus to mention. Adde
to those also external punishments;
which yet if they should be wanting,
since the former are inflicted, who could
reasonably blame the external Justice?
But they are not vvanting. Nor was
it ever, at least very seldom, but that
publick oppressours, and Men openly
wicked; do undergo publick and open
punishments; some sooner, others
later; some in their own persons, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66431:120"/>
others in those of their posterity. You
complain of <hi>Dionysius</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> that
for many years with impunity, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
his Lusts, Rapine, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
Forbear awhile, and you shall
behold him inglorious, exiled, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyless;
and from a Sceptre (vvho
would believe it) reduc'd to a Ferula.
The King of that great Island shall
teach School at <hi>Corinth,</hi> being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
become the mockery of Fortune:
On the other side you resent it vvith
passion that <hi>Pompey</hi> and his Army of
Patricians should be vanquished in the
Plains of <hi>Pharsalia;</hi> and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
for some time, doth wanton
and even sport himself with Civill
blood. I do not wonder at you: For
I see here the helm of right reason
wrested out of the hands of <hi>Cato</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and this faltering expression falls
from him: Divine things have much
of obscurity in them. But yet thou
<hi>Lipsius,</hi> thou <hi>Cato,</hi> turn your eyes this
way a little. One sight shall reconcile
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66431:121"/>
you both to God. See that ambitious
<hi>Caesar;</hi> that prov'd commander in his
own opinion, and in others too al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a God; see him slain in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
house, and by the hands of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours;
not falling by a single Death,
but secured by Three and twenty
vvounds; like some vvild beast, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
in his blood (and vvhat vvould
you more) in <hi>Pompey's</hi> own Court,
and at the foot of <hi>Pompey's</hi> Statue
falling a great Sacrifice to that great
shade. So methinks I pitty <hi>Brutus</hi> slain
for and vvith his Country in the Fields
of <hi>Philippi;</hi> but vvithall I am some what
satisfyed, vvhen not long after I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
those victorious armies like gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours
slaughtering one another at

<hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> vanquished both

Butcher of the Roman armies; the
pursuer of <hi>Pompey</hi> and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvealth?
See how with thy bloody
hand, thou hangest in a Cord; how
being yet alive thou creepest into thy
monument, and how even in Death
it self thou art unwilling to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd
from her that vvas the cause of

dying <hi>Brutus</hi> spent his last breath and
vvish in vain.</p>
                  <l>Iove suffer not to scape from thee</l>
                  <l>The cause of this Calamity.</l>
                  <p>No <hi>Brutus,</hi> he vvas not hid; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did he escape. No more did that
other General vvho smarted for his

for his Daughter, and another for his
Grandchild. Let him lose some of
his Grandchildren by fraud, others
by force, and let himself force others
into exile: and out of the impatience
of these crosses, let him attempt to
dye by a four dayes abstinence but not
be able. To conclude let him live
vvith his <hi>Livia</hi> dishonestly married,
and dishonestly detain'd, and let him
dye an unworthy Death by her, on
vvhom he so unworthily doted. In

Heaven, or merited it: Let him dye
and leave the Son of his Enemy to

are to be thought of <hi>Lipsius</hi> as oft as
complaints of injustice are ready to
break from us: and the Mind is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to reflect upon these two things;
the slowness and the variety of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66431:123"/>
and do still every day repeat it.
We are born in sin, and so we live in
it; and to speak vvith the Satyrist the
Magazeens of Heaven had been long
since emptyed, if its Thunder-bolts
had alwayes fallen upon the Heads
of such as deserved them. For vve
must not think that as Fishes, though
encreas'd and bred up in the Sea, do
yet retain nothing of its saltness; so
Men in the filthiness of this World
should contract nothing of uncleaness.
If then all are in fault; where are those
guiltless people you speak of, who
have not deserved the punishments
they undergo; since it is most righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that punishment should be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
companion of unrighteousness
But you vvill say it is the inequality of
it that displeases me: For vve see
them heavily scourged that have but
lightly offended; vvhile those that are
outragiously vvicked, do continue and
flourish in the height of all their gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs.
Would you then vvrest the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66431:124"/>
ballance out of the hands of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Justice, and poise it vvith your
own vveights agreeable to your own
apprehensions? For vvhat else can
you mean by that bold pronouncing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the equality or inequality of crimes,
otherwise than God hath done before
you? You are therefore here <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
to consider of two things: First,
that a true estimation of the crimes
of others, neither can nor ought to
be attempted by Man: For how shall
he do it; that not so much as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
them? And vvhich vvay shall
he put an exact difference, betwixt
those things vvhich he hath not so
much as seen? For you will easily
grant it me that it is the Mind that
sins; by the Body and senses indeed
as its instruments, but yet so as that
the main business and vveight of the
crime, doth in the mean time depend
upon it self. This is so exactly true;
that if it appear any one hath unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sinned; he is clear of the sin. And
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66431:124"/>
if this be so how is it possible I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, that you should throughly
discern of Sin, who are not able to
reach to the residence and seat of it.
For so farr are you from seeing into
the Heart and Soul of another; that
you cannot attain to the knowledge
of your own: It is therefore a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
vanity; and no less a temerity,
to pretend to the Censure and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of such things, as are neither
fully seen, nor to be seen; neither
known, nor to be known. Consider
secondly, that if what you say were
true, there were yet neither Evil nor
injustice done to them. No Evil;
because its done for their good, who
are presently punished, even for smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
offences. 'Tis rather the love of
God to them; since that punishment
vvhich is delayed is justly to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
as portending a heavier judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to come. Neither is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just;
because (as I said) we have all
deserved punishment: Nor can the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66431:125"/>
best of us pretend to so unblemished
a purity; but there vvill be found
some such spots in it, as are to be
vvashed out (as I may say) vvith this
salt water of Affliction. Forbear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
young-man this intricate pursuit
of the respects and proportions of
crimes: And since thou art but an
earthly and pedaneous judge; leave
it to God, who from his higher tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
vvill determine of it; vvith great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
equity and certainty. 'Tis he only
that can distinguish of our deserts;
and 'tis he alone vvho (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all artificial disguises) can behold
both vice and vertue in their proper
countenances. Who can impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him vvho equally searches into
things internal and external; that sees
at once the Body and the Mind, the
Tongue and the Heart: And (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude)
those things that are open,
vvith those that are recluded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred?
Who doth not only most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
behold our actions themselves, but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66431:125"/>
also their causes, and the vvhole
progress of them. When <hi>Thales</hi> vvas
ask'd, vvhether a Man might hide his
evil actions from God: He answered
truly; no nor his evil thoughts nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Whereas on the contrary vve
are here so benighted; that vve do not
only not see those close sins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the bosome, and (as they say)
vvithin the Buttons; but scarcely
those vvhich are open and dragged into
the light. For vve cannot behold the
Crime it self, and the vigour of it; but
some certain footsteps of it, vvhen it is
already committed, and upon its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture:
They oftentimes are the best
Men to us, vvho are the worst in the
sight of God; as on the contrary they
are reprobates in our esteem, vvho are
the choicest to him. Forbear therefore
(if you are vvise) to discourse or judge of
persons that deserve or deserve not their
punishments; for such obscure causes as
these are not to be decided, by some
light and superficial appearances.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Third Objection; that punishments
are transferred, answered. That
Men do the same; why God doth
so?</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt you have cast another Cloud
upon Justice; vvhich I must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse:
It is concerning substitutes.
For say you it is not so just that
God should transferre punishments;
and 'tis somewhat hard that posterity
should rue the crimes of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours.
But vvhere is the wonder and
strangeness of it. I rather vvonder at
these vvonderers that they can find a
wonder in that which is every day done
by themselves here on Earth. Pray
tell me; do not those honours, vvhich
for his vertue a Prince hath conferred
upon the Ancestours, descend to his
posterity? Yes they do; and so also
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66431:126"/>
do those mulcts and punishments,
vvhich are inflicted on him for his
offences. In attaindours for treason
or rebellion it is manifest that these
are guilty; but others share in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
vvhich humane cruelty doth
so farr enlarge; as to make Lawes
that follow the innocent Children
vvith perpetual vvants; such as make
life a burthen, and death a comfort.
Perverse Minds, who will permit that
to be lawful to a Prince or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;
which you forbid to God:
Who yet if you examine it rightly
hath a juster reason for his severity.
For all of us in one have sinned, and
rebelled against this great King; and
through so many successive Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that first blot hath been derived
to the unhappy Children: So that
there is to God a continued twist and
chain of Crimes. For instance; my
Father or yours did not begin to sin,
but all the Fathers of our Fathers:
What vvonder then is it if he punish
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66431:127"/>
in their posterity not (properly) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
offences; but such as by a kind
of communion of seed, have been still
linked and coupled together, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
discontinued. But to omit these
higher speculations, and to deal with
you, in a more popular way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning.
You must know this that
God joynes those things, vvhich vve
(through ignorance and unskilfulness)
use to sever, and that he considers
Families, Cities, and Kingdomes; not
as divided but as one Body and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
The Family of the <hi>Scipio's</hi> or the
<hi>Caesars</hi> is one thing to him. <hi>Rome</hi> or
<hi>Athens,</hi> for the whole time of their
duration, were but one to him; and
so was the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and that
very justly, for the Society of the
same laws, and priviledges, is that
bond vvhich unites these great bodyes,
and intitles them though in several
ages, to a communion in partaking of
rewards and punishments. Were then
the <hi>Scipio's</hi> of old good? That Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66431:127"/>
judge vvill remember it to the
advantage of their posterity. Were
they Evil? It shall be hurtful to them.
Were the <hi>Belgians</hi> some years ago;
Lascivious, Covetous, Impious? We
shall suffer for it. For in every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
punishment, God not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
the present, but also looks back
upon pass'd times; and vvith the
vveights of them both, doth most
equally poise the ballance of his Just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice.
I sayd in external punishments
and I vvould have you to observe it.
For crimes themselves are not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd,
nor is there a kind of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of them: God forbid there
should. But certain punishments and
corrections only, such as are about us
not in us; and which properly respect
the Body, or estate; but not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Mind of ours. And in all this
where is the injury? We are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
willing to be heirs of those ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
and rewards (if any) that
are due to our ancestours: And if
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66431:128"/>
so; why do we refuse the burdens,
and punishments?</p>
                  <l>Those Plagues for which the former times
did call</l>
                  <l>On thee poor <hi>Roman</hi> undeservedly fall;</l>
                  <p>Sings the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet, and truly;
had he not added undeservedly. For
'tis most deservedly, since our ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
did deserve it. But the Poet
could only see the effect: He ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to the cause; but as in one
and the same Man, we justly punish
in his old age, that offence, which
he committed in his youth: So doth
God the elder crimes of Empires and
Kingdomes, because in respect of their
outward communion, they are to him
but one conjoyned thing. These in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervalls
of time do not divide us with
him who comprehends all eternity in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66431:128"/>
the vastness of his Mind. Should
those martial Wolves, heretofore rase
so many Cities, and break so many
Scepters vvith impunity? Should they
broach so much blood by the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of others; and themselves never
bleed for't? I should then indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that God to be no avenger, who
yet hears and sees all that we do. But
they shall not scape so, at length of
Necessity they must undergo punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at least in their posterity; such as
are slow indeed, but not too late.
Nor is there a conjunction of time
only vvith God but of parts too. I
mean thus, that as in a Man the whole
Body suffers, when possibly only the
hand, or groin, or belly has offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
So is it in great Societies. All
many times do account for the faults
of a few: Especially if those that have
sinned are (as it were) the more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
members; as Kings, Princes,
and Magistrates. <hi>Hesiod</hi> spake truly,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66431:129"/>
and from the most inward recess of
Wisdom it self.</p>
                  <l>For one Mans crime, oft the whole City
smarts</l>
                  <l>For his oppressive sacrilegious Arts;</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Jove</hi> from high Heaven his dreadful ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
sheds</l>
                  <l>Of Plague or Famine upon all their heads.</l>
                  <p>So the vvhole Navy of the <hi>Graecians</hi>
perished.</p>
                  <l>For ones offence what <hi>Ajax</hi> did commit</l>
                  <l>In the distemper of a brain-sick fit.</l>
                  <p>Thus in <hi>Iudea</hi> threescore and ten
thousand were slain with a single pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence;
for the unlawful pleasure of
their King. And sometimes on the
other side; God singles out one or
but some few; to be the expiatours
of a general sin. In which if he recede
something from the rigid Law of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
yet out of that very disparity a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:66431:129"/>
new equity is raised; and that is a
merciful act of Justice towards many;
which seems cruelty upen a few. Does
not the School-master give the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rula
to some one of his wantonizing
Scholars? And does not a General
chastize his cowardly Army, by the
decimation of them? And both these up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the safest considerations: because the
punishment though but of those few
does terrify and amend all. I have
often seen the Physitian strike a vein
in the Foot or Arm, vvhen the whole
body was distempered: how know
I but it may be thus here. These
are secrets <hi>Lipsius,</hi> secrets I say, and
if vve are vvise let us presume no nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
unto this sacred fire, some spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
emanations and bright emissions
of which Men may possibly behold,
but it self they cannot. As they lose
their sight that too daringly gaze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sun; So they all the light of
their Minds, who too intentively fix
it upon this more glorious light. Let
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66431:130"/>
us therefore abstain from that which
is at once of so curious and so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a disquisition: And let us rest
satisfied at least in this, that crimes
neither can nor ought to be estimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Men, that the ballance and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
of God is different from that of
ours; and that how abstruse soever
those judgments are, yet they are not
to be blamed, but patiently undergone
and trembled at by us. This one
Sentence I shall immind you of, and
with it, shall both close this discourse
and shut the mouths too of all those
Curioso's. The judgments of God
are many of them hidden; but none
of them unjust.</p>

And though (I confess) it doth
not directly lead on my discourse:
Yet neither is it at all besides it. For
we shall doubtless undergo our Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
with greater cheerfulness and
patience; when once we are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfyed that they are not unjust.
And here <hi>Langius</hi> pawsing awhile, he
suddenly broke forth again. 'Tis well
(said he) I have recovered breath;
I have got beyond all those Rocks of
objections; and now (methinks) I may
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66431:131"/>
with full Sails spoom away into the
Haven. I discover my fourth and last
Brigade; which I shall very cheerfully
lead up. And as Marriners in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
when they behold the Twins
are full of hopes and mirth: So also
am I (after all these storms) at the
appearance of my Twinny Legion.
I may safely call it so after the old
custom since it is double. And two
things I shall evince by it; that these
miseries which we now suffer are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grievous, nor new. Which while
I shall dispatch in those few things that
remain yet to say; see <hi>Lipsius,</hi> that
you be attentive. Never more <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
(reply'd I) for it joyes me to have
passed these difficulties; and after
these serious and severer Medicines, I
greedily long after this gentle and
more popular one; for so the Title
promises me it is. Nor are you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
said <hi>Langius,</hi> for as Physitians
after they have sufficiently made use
of Causticks and Incisions; do not so
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66431:131"/>
cast off and relinquish their patients;
but apply some gentle fomentations,
and other remedies to asswage their
pains: So will I deal vvith you; whom
(because I have enough followed with
the sharper methods of wisdom) I will
now cherish with milder discourses,
and handle (as they say) vvith a Ladies
hand. I shall descend from that steep
hill of Philosophy; and take a turn or
two vvith you, in the pleasant plains
of your Philology, and that not so
much to recreate you as to compleat
your cure. As they say <hi>Demochares</hi>

So I vvill administer to you, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical

                     <p>That publick Evils are not so great as

                  <p>MArch on then my Legion; and
before the rest, let that cohort
first advance, vvith vvhich vve shall
maintain that these publick evils are
not grievous, this shall be performed
vvith the double vveapon of reason
and comparison of reason. First, for
if vve respect that, all those evils which
are either present or imminent, are
not really either great or grievous,
but are so only in appearance. It is
Opinion that heightens and aggravates
our calamities, and presents them to
us in so tragical a garbe. But (if you
are wise) disperse this circumjected
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:66431:132"/>
Cloud, and examine things by a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
light. For instance, you fear Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
amongst these publick Evils,
Banishment, Death: All which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
if you look upon them
vvith a perfect and setled Eye, vvhat
are they? If you examine them
by their own just vveights, how light
are they? This Warr or Tyranny by
multiplyed contributions vvill exhaust
you; vvhat then? You shall be a poor
Man. Did not Nature it self bring
you into the World so? And vvill it not
hurry you thence in the same manner?
But if the despised and infamous name
of it, displease you; change it, call
your self free and delivered. For For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
(if you know it not) hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened
you and placed you in a
securer station, vvhere none shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust
you any more: So that vvhat
you esteemed a loss, is no other than
a remedy. But say you I shall be
an exile; call it (if you please) a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
If you change your affection;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:66431:133"/>
you change your Country. A vvise
Man vvheresoever he is, is but a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer;
a Fool is ever banished. But
I daily expect Death from the Tyrant:
As if you did not do the same from
Nature. But that is an infamous
Death that comes by the Ax or Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Fool! nor that nor any other Death
is infamous: unless your life be so. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
to your thoughts all the excellent
and more illustrious persons since the
vvorld began; and you shall find them
snatched away by a violent and untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Death. Thus <hi>Lipsius</hi> you must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
(for I have given you but a tast)
all those things vvhich have so fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
an appearance, you must look
upon them naked and apart, from those
vizards and disguises; vvhich opinion
hath put upon them. But alass poor
creatures; vve gaze only upon the vain
outsides of t<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ings: Nor do vve dread
the things themselves, so much as we
do the circumstantial dresses of them.
If you put to Sea, and it swell high, your
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66431:133"/>
heart fails, and you tremble at such
a rate, as if (should you suffer Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack)
you were to swallow it all;
vvhen alass one or two Sextaries would
be sufficient. If there be a sudden
Earth-quake; what a cry, and vvhat
fears it raises? You apprehend imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
that the vvhole City (or house
at least) vvill fall upon you: Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how sufficient any single stone
is to perform the vvork of Death.
'Tis thus in all these calamities; in
vvhich it is the noise and vain image
of things that chiefly affrights us. See
that Guard; these Swords. And what
can that Guard, or those Swords do?
They vvill kill. And vvhat is that being
kill'd? 'Tis only a single Death; and
lest that name should affright you:
It is the departure of the Soul from
the Body. All those military troops,
All those threatning Swords, shall
perform no more than vvhat one Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
one Grapestone, or one Insect can
do. But this is the harsher vvay of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66431:134"/>
dying. Rather it is much the milder,
for that Feaver vvhich you vvould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr,
does often torture a Man for a
year together; but these dispatch him
vvith a blow, in an instant. <hi>Socrates</hi>
therefore said vvell; vvho vvas vvont
to call all these things by no other
name than that of Goblins and Viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
vvhich (if you put on you) will
fright the children; but if you take
them off again, and appear vvith your
own face, they'l come again to you
and embrace you. 'Tis the very same
vvith these evils; vvhose Vizzards if
your pluck off, and behold them apart
from their disguises; you vvill confess
you vvere scared vvith a childish fear.
As Hail falling upon a house dashes
it self in pieces: So if these calamities
light upon a constant Mind, they do
not break it but themselves.</p>

from <hi>Langius</hi> and therefore
interrupting him; vvhether go you
said I, was this it you promised? I
expected the sweet and delicious vvines
of History; and you bring me such
harsh and unpleasant ones, as scarce
all the stores of Wisdom vvill afford
their like. Suppose you that you are
speaking to some <hi>Thales?</hi> 'Tis to <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
a Man; and that of the middle
rank; vvho desires remedies that are
somewhat more humane than these.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66431:135"/>
                     <hi>Langius</hi> vvith a mild countenance and
tone, I acknowledge (said he) you
justly blame me. For vvhile I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
that pure ray of reason; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
I am got out of the common
Road, and unawares again fallen into
the path of Wisdom. But I return
now; to vvalk vvith you in a vvay
that is better known; since the auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that wine doth displease you;
I shall quallify and allay it vvith the
sweets of examples. I come now to
comparison; and I vvill clearly shew
you that in all these calamities vvhich
every vvay surround us, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
great or grievous, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them with those in times past,
For those of old vvere greater by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees, and more truly to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
I replyed vvith a gesture that
discovered something of impatience.
Will you averre this said I
<q>
                        <l>—and hope you to perswade</l>
                        <l>Me to believe what you have said?</l>

                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:66431:135"/>Never <hi>Langius</hi> so long as I am Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of my reason; for vvhat former
age (if you rightly consider it) vvas
ever so calamitous as this of ours,
or vvhat after one shall be? What
Nation? What Country ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
<q>
                        <l>So heavy miseries and manifold</l>
                        <l>Grievous, or to be suffered, or be told?</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>As vve <hi>Belgians</hi> do at this day? You
see vve are involved in a Warr; not
in a forreign one only, but a civil;
and that in the very bowels of us.
For there are not only parties amongst
us, but (O my Country vvhat hand
shall preserve thee) a subdivision of
those parties. Add to this the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
add Famine, add Taxes, Rapines,
Slaughters, and the height of all the
Tyranny and Oppression, not of our
Bodies only, but our Souls too. And
in the rest of <hi>Europe</hi> vvhat is there?
Either Warr or the expectation of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66431:136"/>
Warr, or if there be peace, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
with a base subjection to pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Rulers; and not a vvhit eligible
before Warr it self. Which way so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you turn your Eyes or thoughts,
you vvill find all things full of suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and suspense: And as in a house
that is ill underpropt; many visible
signes of an approaching ruine. To
conclude <hi>Langius</hi> as there is a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
rendezvous of all Rivers at the
Ocean: So all sorts of Calamities
seem to Centre in this Age. And
yet I now speak only of such as are
at present upon us; what are those
that await us? Of vvhich I may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sing that of <hi>Euripides,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Such spacious Seas of ills I see</l>
                        <l>As cannot safely passed be.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Langius</hi> looking severely upon me;
do you again (said he) cast your self
down vvith these complainings? I
thought by this time you had stood
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66431:136"/>
firme; and that your vvound had
been closed: But you relapse. If
ever you vvill recover, it is requisite,
that there be a kind of calmness in
your Mind. This Age say you is the
most unhappy. It is an old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint;
I know your Gransier said the
same, and so likewise your Father;
I know also your posterity vvill have
the same complaint. Nature has ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
this into the Disposition of
Man; to look fixedly upon his Evils;
and to shut his Eyes upon his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
As Flyes and other Insects, do
not rest long upon smooth and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
places, but stick to those that
are rough and soiled: So this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous
Mind of ours, lightly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
our better fortunes: But vvill
not be vvithdrawn from its contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations
of that vvhich is vvorse. It
handles and pryes into its evils, and for
the most part shews it self vvitty, in
the aggravating comments that it maks
upon them. As lovers ever find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66431:137"/>
in their mistress; for vvhich she
must needs surpass all others in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency:
So do those that are afflicted,
vvith their miseries. Yes vve fancy
to our selves vain additions, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not only our present, but future
Calamities. And vvhat is the reward
of this too too inquisitive Genius of
ours? No other, than as some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are frighted out of their Camp,
by the dust that is raised afarr off:
So vve are often cast down, by the
false shaddow of a future danger.</p>

that as to all the sorts of Calamities,
not only the like have happened of

Were there then no Warrs amongst

they were not so great, so grievous
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66431:138"/>
as ours. So farr are you from the truth;
that (I speak seriously) these vvars of

                  </argument>
                  <p>NOt to stay here any longer; let
us pass over into <hi>Greece,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
orderly all those warrs they
maintained both against forraigners
and amongst themselves; would be too
tedious and to little purpose. This
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:66431:140"/>
I say it was so exhausted and lop't with
a constant continued Ax of Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
That <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us (which I
never read without wonder and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation)
all of it in his age was not able to muster up three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Souldiers; which number yet,
the one small City of <hi>Megara</hi> (saith
he) had formerly set forth in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Warr. Ah! whither art thou
fallen, thou once the glory of the
Earth, the light and leader of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
There is scarce a Town at
this day (of any name) in this our
vvasted <hi>Belgia,</hi> but is able to raise
such a number of Men fit to bear
Armes. Let us take now a view of
<hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Romans. Augustine</hi> and
<hi>Orosius</hi> have already eased me of this
trouble. Consult them and there you
vvill meet vvith Seas of evils. The
second <hi>Punick</hi> vvarr it self, in less
than seventeen years (for I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
computed it) consumed in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spain</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> only, above fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:66431:141"/>
hundred thousand men. The
civill vvar betwixt <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi>
three hundred thousand. And the
Arms of <hi>Brutus, Cassius,</hi> and <hi>Sextus
Pompcius</hi> a greater number. But why
should insist upon such Warrs, as were
managed by the conduct of several
Commanders? That one <hi>Caiuis Caesar</hi>
(the plague and poyson of mankind)
confesses and that in a vvay of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
that there fell by him in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
batails, eleven hundred ninety
and two thousand men; not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into this number the slaughters
of the civil Warrs; But only those of
forraign Nations, which he had made
in those few years wherein he had the
Government of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Gaul.</hi> In
which notwithstanding (greater in this
too) the Great <hi>Pompey</hi> out-went him;
who wrote in the Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi>
that there were by him vanquished,
put to flight, slain and taken One and
twenty hundred, and eighty three
thousand men. To these (if you will)
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:66431:141"/>
you may adde <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> vvho
slew one hundred and ten thousand
<hi>Gauls. Caius Marius</hi> two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Cimbrians.</hi> And in the latter ages
<hi>AEtius</hi> vvho in that memorable <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launican</hi>
Field slevv one hundred sixty
two thousand <hi>Hunnes.</hi> And lest you
should think that in these Warrs, there
vvere only Carcases of Men; there
vvere those of Cities too. That <hi>Cato</hi>
the Censour boasts that he took more
Towns in <hi>Spain</hi> than he continued
dayes there. <hi>Sempronius Gracchus</hi> (if
vve may believe <hi>Polybius</hi>) raised Three
hundred in the same <hi>Spain,</hi> nor hath
any age (as I think) any thing to add
to these Examples; unless it be our
own, though acted in another World.
A few <hi>Spaniards</hi> about Eighty years
ago; passing over into those vast and
nevv found Lands: Good God! vvhat
funeralls, vvhat slaughters did they
make? I do not discourse the causes
and justness of that Warr; but only
the events. I see that huge space of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:66431:142"/>
Earth (vvhich certainly vvas a great
enterprize to discover, not to say to
overcome) overrun by twenty or
thirty Souldiers, and those unarmed
multitudes every vvhere mow'd down as
corn is by the sythe. Where art thou
<hi>Cuba</hi> the greatest of Islands, <hi>Haytus</hi> or
you <hi>Iucayans?</hi> Which heretofore were
each of you guarded vvith six or ten
hundred thousand men; but have now
(some of you) scarce preserved fifteen
of them for seed. Shew thy self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhile
thou <hi>Peru</hi> and thou <hi>Mexico.</hi>
O vvonderful and miserable face! that
immense tract, and such as may vvell
be called another World, appears
vast and desolate, in such a manner as
if it had been blasted vvith a fire from
Heaven. My Tongue and Heart fail
me <hi>Lipsius,</hi> as oft as I remember these
things; and I look upon all that hath
befallen us (in comparison of these)
to be but pieces of strawes (as the
Comaedian vvords it) or little mites.
Nor do I here represent to you, the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:66431:142"/>
condition of captivity, than vvhich
nothing vvas more bitter in the Warrs
of the Ancients. Free, noble, Men,
Women and Children, all sorts vvere
hurried away by the Victour; and
vvho knowes but it vvas into eternal
slavery? Into slavery it vvas. The

have not been nor yet are in the

                  <p>BUt you goe forward in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and speak of the plague
and Famine, of Taxes and Rapines.
Will you then that we proceed vvith
each of these in our comparison,
though briefly. Tell me in these five
or six years, how many thousands,
hath this plague snatched away in all
<hi>Belgia?</hi> As I guess fifty or at the most
one hundred thousand. But in <hi>Iudaea</hi>
a single plague in the reign of King
<hi>David,</hi> swept away seventy thousand
in less than a day. When <hi>Gallus</hi>
and <hi>Volusianus</hi> vvere Emperours, a
plague beginning in <hi>AEthiopia</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
through all the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:66431:143"/>
and for fifteen years together did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibly
exhaust them. Nor did I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read of a mortality that lasted so
long, or that spread it self so vvide.
But that vvhich seised upon <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
and the neighbouring places in
the reign of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperour is
more remarkable for the fury and
fierceness of it: vvhich vvas such that
it made every day five thousand fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
and sometimes ten. I should
not be forward to speak this; but
should my self remain doubtful of the
credit of this report: vvere it not
confirmed by unquestionable vvitnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that lived in the same age. Nor vvas
that <hi>African</hi> plague less vvonderful,
vvhich began upon the ruine of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
and destroyed in <hi>Numidia</hi> alone
eighty thousand men, in the Sea costs
of <hi>Africa</hi> two hundred thousand:
about <hi>Vtica</hi> thirty thousand Souldiers
left there as the guard of those parts.
Again in <hi>Greece</hi> in the reign of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Ducas</hi> there was so raging a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:66431:144"/>
plague that (they are <hi>Zonaras</hi> his
vvords) the living did not suffice to
bury the dead. To conclude in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarchs</hi>
time (as himself reports it)
so direful a one sate brooding upon
<hi>Italy,</hi> that of every thousand men scarce
ten survived. I come now to speak of
Famine: Certainly vve of this Age
have seen nothing, if vve consider
the times past. When <hi>Honorius</hi> vvas
Emperour, there vvas such a dearth
and scarcity of all sorts of provisions,
that men vvere ready to eat one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
For it vvas openly cried at the
Cirque, set the price of mans flesh.
In the reign of <hi>Iustinian</hi> throughout <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
(after the <hi>Goths</hi> had vvasted it)
there vvas one so great, that in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenum</hi>
alone, there vvere fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men famished to death: and all
about, they eat not only the flesh of
men, but their own excrements.
Two vvomen (I tremble to speak it)
had at several times by night treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
killed seventeen men and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:66431:144"/>
them: and vvere themselves slain
by the eighteenth who had discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their practise. I forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the famine in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the
vvell known examples of it there. If
I must say something of Taxes also;
I deny not but they are heavy ones
with which we are pressed. But
they are such only, vvhen you look
upon them by themselves; not when
you compare them vvith those of old.
All, most all the Provinces of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire, payed yearly the fifth
part of the profits of their pasture,
and the tenth of their arable. Nor
did <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> forbear to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
the tributes of nine or ten years
to be payed in one. When <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
vvas slain, and armes were taken
up for their liberty, every Citizen
was commanded to pay down the
five and twentyeth part of all their
goods. And more than this all that
were Senatours payed for every tile
of their house six asses. An immense
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:66431:145"/>
contribution, above the reach of our
senses as vvell as of our Estates. But
<hi>Octavianus Caesar</hi> (probably vvith some
reference to his name,) exacted and
received of all freed men the eighth
part of their Estates. I omit vvhat
the Triumvir's and other Tyrants
have done, lest I should teach those
of our times, by the recitall of them.
Let that one of Colonies, be instead
of all examples of Exactions and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines.
An invention then vvhich no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
did more contribute to the
strength of the Empire: and nothing
could be devised more grievous to
the Subject. Veterane Legions and
Cohorts were drawn out into Towns
and Fields, and the miserable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials,
(in a moment of time) were
thrust out of all their Estates and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and that for no offence or
unlawful attempt, their riches onely
and plentiful possessions vvere their
crimes. In vvhich certainly the sum
of all calamities is comprized. It's a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:66431:145"/>
great misfortune to be robbed of our
money, vvhat is it then to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of our houses and lands? And
if it is grievous to be driven thence:
vvhat is it to be forced from our
Country, our Temples and Altars? You
might see some thousands of woful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
hurryed away, children from their
Parents, Masters from their Families,
Wives from their Husbands, and
thrown out into divers Countryes, as
their lot designed them. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the thirsty <hi>Affricans,</hi> and as the
Poet saith in this very case,
<q>
                        <l>Others were into Scythia hurl'd,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>One single <hi>Octavianus Caesar</hi> placed
eight and twenty colonies in <hi>Italy</hi>
only; and in the Provinces as many
as he pleased. Nor vvas there any

                  <argument>
                     <p>A rehearsall of some strange Cruelties
and murthers in time past, above
the guilt of this Age.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt yet (say you) there are such
cruelties and murthers at this day,
as the like have not been heard of. I
know vvhat you point at, and vvhat
vvas done of late, but I appeal to
your conscience <hi>Lipsius,</hi> vvas their no
such thing amongst the ancients? How
ignorant are you if you know it not,
and how vvicked if you dissemble it?
For there is such a plenty of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in this matter, and they lye so
ready, that it is some trouble even
to choose. Know you not the name
of <hi>Sylla</hi> the Fortunate? If you doe,
you remember that infamous and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
prescription of his, by vvhich he
cast out of one City four thousand se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:66431:146"/>
hundred Citizens. Nor were
they of the meaner sort; but one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and forty of them vvere Senators.
Nor do I touch upon those infinite
slaughters that were usually acted either
by his permission or command. So that
not undeservedly those words burst
from <hi>Quintus Catulus</hi> vvith vvhom at
length shall vve live; if in Warr vve
kill armed Men, and in peace the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed.
But shortly after; this same
<hi>Sylla</hi> vvas imitated by his Disciples: I
mean the triumvirs, vvho in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
proscribed three hundred Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and above two thousand Roman
Knights. O vvickedness! A greater
cruelty than this the Sun in all its tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
from the East unto the West, did
never yet behold; not is like to do
hereafter. If you please you may look
into <hi>Appianus,</hi> and there you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the various and deformed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those times: Of those that lay
hid, and fled; of those that stopped
their flight, and halled them forth:
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:66431:147"/>
the vvoful vvailings of Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
so that you vvould believe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
itself had perished and fled from
that savage and inhumane age. These
cruelties were acted upon the persons of
Senatours and Knights, that is to say,
upon so many little less than Kings
and Princes; but possibly the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
were more favourably dealt with.
No such matter. Look upon the same
<hi>Sylla,</hi> who commanded four Legions
of the contrary party (for whose secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
he had given his faith) to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in the publick Villa; they in
vain imploring the mercy of his treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous
right hand: Whose dying groans
reaching the Curia and the Senate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
startled and amazed at it: Let us
mind our business Conscript Fathers,
(said he) a few seditious fellows are
punished by my command. I know not
vvhich I should most vvonder at; that
a Man could do so, or that he could
speak so. Will you have more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of cruelty? Take them. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:66431:147"/>
Galba</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> summoning the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of three Cities together; as if to
communicate to them something to
their advantage; suddenly commanded
seven thousand of them to be slain;
amongst vvhich vvas the flower of
their youth. In the same Country
<hi>Lucius Licinius Lucullus</hi> the Consul sent
his Souldiers into the City of the <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeans,</hi>
and slew twenty thousand of
them contrary to the Articles agreed
upon at their yielding <hi>Octavianus
Augustus</hi> vvhen he had taken <hi>Perusia;</hi>
chose out three hundred of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of both orders, and though they
had yielded themselves, he slew them
as Sacrifices before an Altar vvhich
he had erected to <hi>D. Iulius Antonius
Caracalla,</hi> (being offended vvith those
of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> for I knovv not vvhat
jests upon him) enters that City in a
semblance of peace, and vvhen he
had commanded all their young Men
into the Field; he surrounds them
vvith his Souldiers, upon a Signal given
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:66431:148"/>
he kills them every one, and using the
same cruelty to the remaining multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
he utterly exhausted that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
and most frequented City.
King <hi>Mithridates</hi> by one letter caused
eighty thousand Roman Citizens to
be slain; that were dispersed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Asia</hi> about their mercandise. <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesus
Messalla</hi> the Proconsul of <hi>Asia,</hi>
in one day caused three hundred to be
beheaded; and strutting amongst the
dead bodyes with his armes on his
sides, as if he had done some glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
act; cryed out aloud; O Princely
deed! Hitherto I have only spoken
of prophane and impious persons; but
behold amongst those that are devoted
to the service of the true God: You
vvill find it of the Emperour <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
that having by the highest vvicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and deceit, betrayed seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
innocent people of <hi>Thessalonica</hi>
into the Theatre, under pretence of
exhibiting some playes; He sent his
Souldiers amongst them, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:66431:148"/>
them all: Than vvhich fact
nothing is to be found more impious
in the records of all the Heathen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties.
Go now my <hi>Belgians,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this, accuse the cruelty and
treachery of the Princes of this Age.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the present Tyranny. That it is from
humane Nature or Malice. Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
external and internal were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>LAstly, you complain of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
that is now adayes, and
the oppressions at once both of our
Bodies and Souls. My purpose is not
(at this time) to applaud, or condemn
our own age; for to what end were
it? My business is to compare only.
I ask you therefore when ever those
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:66431:149"/>
evils vvere not; and where that place
was. Assign me any one Age, any
one Nation, without a remarkable Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
in it; and (for I'le run the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard)
I will then confess, that we are
the most wretched do all that are
miserable. Why do you not reply?
I see that old Sarcasme is true; all the
good Princes may be registred in a
Ring. For it is natural to Man to
use authority insolently, and hardly to
keep a mean in that which it self is
above it. Even we our selves who
complain of Tyranny, do yet carry
the feeds of it inclosed in our bosoms:
Nor is there a Will wanting in most
of us to discover them, but the power.
A Serpent vvhen he is benummed with
cold, hath poyson within him, though
he do not exert it; 'Tis the same in
us, whom only weakness keeps inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and a kind of Winter in our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
Give but power, give means,
and I fear that the most of those that
accuse would transcend the example of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66431:149"/>
their superiours. This is every dayes
instance; see that Father stern with
his Children, that Master with his
Servants, and that School-Master
with his Scholars. Each of them is a
<hi>Phalaris</hi> in his kind, and raise the same
waves in their Brooks, as Kings do
in their greater Seas. The same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is discernible in other creatures;
most of which prey upon their own
kind, both in the Air, the Earth, and
the Water:
<q>
                        <l>So greater Fish devaour the smaller fry,</l>
                        <l>And weaker Fowle under the Goshauks die.</l>
                     </q>
sayes <hi>Varro</hi> truly; but you will say these
are the oppressions of Bodies only: But
this is the peculiar of our age, that
ours are of the Soul also. Take heed
you speak not this with more malice
than truth. That Man seems to me to
be little skilled in the knowledge of
himself, and the heavenly nature of the
Soul; that thinks it can be forced or
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:66431:150"/>
compelled. For no outward violence
whatsoever can make you will, that
which you do not will; or to yield to
that which you do not assent to. Some
have power over the bond and tye of
the Soul; but none over it self. A ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
may loose it from the Body, but
he cannot dissolve the nature of it,
which being pure, eternal, fiery, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pises
every external or violent attempt.
But we may not speak our own thoughts.
Be it so. The bridle then curbs your
Tongue only, not your Mind; your
Actions, but not your Judgment. But
even this is new, and unheard of. Good
Man! how are you mistaken? How
many can I point you out, who have
suffered under Tyrants, for their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions?
through the heedlesness of
their tongues? How many of those
Tyrants have endeavoured to compel
mens Judgements, and their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
too in matters of Religion? It
vvas the common custom of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
and the Eastern Nations to adore
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:66431:150"/>
their Kings, and we know that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
challenged to himself that divine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration,
with the ill will of his ruder
<hi>Macedonians.</hi> Amongst the Romans
that good and moderate Emperour <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
had in the Provinces, yes in every
house, Flamens and Priests as a God.
<hi>Caligula</hi> cutting off the Heads from the
Statues of the Gods, with a ridiculous
impiety, caused his own to be placed
upon them. The same instituted a
Temple, Priests and chosen Sacrifices
to his own deity. <hi>Nero</hi> would be taken
for <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the most illustrious of
the City were slain, under this accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that they had never sacrificed to
the heavenly voice. <hi>Domitian</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
called our Lord and God. Which
vanity or impiety if it were found at
this day, in any of our Kings; what
would you then say <hi>Lipsius?</hi> I vvill sail
no nearer this <hi>Scylla,</hi> into which no
vvinds of ambition shall either betray
or force me: For a secure old age is
the reward of silence. I will bring in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66431:151"/>
only one testimony of the ancient sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
in this respect; and that shall be
out of an Author you are well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vvith, and I vvould have you to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him. 'Tis <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the reign of
<hi>Domitian: We read</hi> (sayes he) <hi>that when</hi>
Petus Thrasea <hi>was praised by</hi> Arulenus
Rusticus, <hi>and</hi> Priscus Helvidius <hi>by</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennius
Senecio; <hi>it was capital to them
both. Nor did the cruelty extend it self
only to the Authors, but also to their
Works. Charge being given to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirs,
that the monuments of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
wits should be burnt in the</hi> Forum
<hi>and</hi> Comitium, <hi>supposing by that one fire,
to have suppressed the voice of the people of</hi>
Rome; <hi>the liberty of the Senate, and the
conscience of Mankind. The professours
also of Wisdom were banished; and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
arts proscribed, lest there should
any where appear the least footsteps of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty.
We gave certainly a grand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of our patience; and as the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ages saw the utmost height of liberty,
so did we of slavery, the commerce of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:66431:151"/>
and speaking being barred; and in
danger by informers. VVe had certainly
lost our memories together vvith our speech
if it had been as much in our power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
as it was to be silent.</hi>

he brings him into the Tower,
and from the top of it shews him all
the houses of that great City. Think
vvith your self (sayes he) how many
sorrows have heretofore been under
these roofs; now are, and hereafter
shall be: And then cease to lament the
evils of Mankind, as if they vvere your
own only. I vvish I could give you the
like prospect of this vvide World <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
but since it is not to be done
actually, let us imagine it. I place you
upon the top of some high Mountain
(<hi>Olympus</hi> if you please) look down now
upon all those Cities, provinces and
Kingdoms beneath: And think that
you see but so many inclosures of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Calamities; the Amphitheatres,
and (as it vvere) the Sands, in vvhich
the bloody sports of Fortune are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.
You need not look farr from
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66431:153"/>
hence; do you see Italy? It is not yet
thirty years since it rested from sharp
and cruel vvarrs on every side. See
you the spacious <hi>Germany?</hi> The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
sparks of a Civil discord were
there but of late, vvhich threaten to
break forth afresh (and if I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived)
into a more destructive flame.
Do you see <hi>Brittain?</hi> Warrs and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are perpetually in it, and that peace
vvhich it now awhile enjoyes; it owes
to the government of the middle Sex.
See you <hi>France?</hi> Behold and pitty it.
