            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God, which shall shake down and lay waste all that withstands
the Light and Life of God, girt up your Spirits in the Majestie of
the Power of the Son of Righteousnesse, that you may shine as

People, that the Nobility of their understandings be cleared, to

            <p>Dear valiant Vessels of the Host of the mighty strength of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

there shall be nothing too hard, for the decree is sealed with the
unchangeable God, the overthrow of <hi>Babel</hi> is determined, in vain
it is for her to seek to uphold her self, for you are elected of the

the hearts of the Heathen with fear, and to give to the mighty

decree is gone out against them, and the arm of the Lord is
stretched out according to his counsel, which he wil never draw
in, till he hath caused his birth to reign and bring to nought
all that resist his appearance; you chosen generation, feel the
vertue of the Son of God in every one, and abide in him; let
your vessels be filled with the comfort of his Life, that you may
tread upon every thought, and every imagination that's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

Spirit in all your exercise, and in your meetings and all times
feel the glory of his life crowning the holy birth with the joy

vertue, and moves you in the strength thereof, be obedient,
quench not the Spirit, and keep within the bounds of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that you may retain the salt and savour in yourselves, and
in all with whom you are, that none strive further then the
Lord leads, and moves in his life, and all feel the honourable
babe in Dominion, that makes self of no reputation, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
self to the Crosse, and is the least in its own eye, whatever
the Lord does with it; and let the strong serve the weak, and
bear its burden, and all feel the healing restoring Spirit in you
all, to improve every gift God gives you to the glory of the
Lord, and gather you into the life of truth, that there be not

you, not life it self, that you might enjoy the light
of the countenance of God, which he hath now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
in the everlasting Covenant of his Light in Christ,
which now constraineth in the power of our royal life, born of
the noble seed, to stand out, over and above all flattering
tongues, and all threatnings and wrath of men, which will be
more and more manifest before this day of tryal be over, and
what wrath ever the Lord suffers to arise in the powers of the
earth, without the Lord move, do not any seek to stop it, let
God have the glory, the wrath of man turns to the praise of
God, and the remainder he will restrain, while the royal babe
which is in meeknesse and patience stands still, and gives glory
to God in faithful obedience with life to death if the Lord call
for it, who hath blessed the labour of all he called into the
vineyard of God, in whom my bowels is enlarged in the strength
of the life I have received of the Father; oh feel me, for I am
with you filled with joy in the Lord, that his Royal birth is
brought forth, and the captive set free, the tongue of the dumb
loosed, and in the living power of God raised, to offer up living
praises on the holy Altar of God, in the Assembly of his Saints;
oh lift up your heads, be glad in the strength of the Lord, in
this day of gathering the good ripe fruit, in the vineyard of the
Lord how doth the vines abound with vertue, laden with
clusters of the purest grapes fully ripe, which drops abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the wine renewed in the Kingdom of the Father; Oh
fill your cups, be not straitned in your Spirits to receive of the
fulnesse of God, in whom I am constrained to say unto you in
the Light, drink, drink abundantly, let the thirst of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
birth earnestly in the Light reach forth it self, to draw
more and more the infinite Life, that it may comprehend you
in the power of it self, that in its strength your hearts be set
free over all below, and your Spirits in the Light and Life
raised in the heavenly harmony, to praise and glorifie the
Name of the Lord in eternal unity, to the astonishment of all
that know not God, whose hearts shall fail before the Life of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50628:5"/>
God, which keeps all that abide in it, with what ever he gives
low in his fear, that neither heights, nor depths, nor tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
nor distresse, persecution, or famine, or nakednesse,
peril or sword, life nor death, things present, nor things to
come, can ever separate the Royal birth from its faithful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Christ Jesus the Light; dwell out of time, and place,
and over all Creature-enjoyments, in the unlimited power
to guide, that your words be few, and savoury at all times,
whether in bonds or out of bonds, to minister grace to the
hearers, and be tender affectionate one towards another, in
the pure chast Love of God, all to lye down together in the
eternal unity, one in the fulnesse in the most High God over
all blessed for ever. Farewell.</p>
