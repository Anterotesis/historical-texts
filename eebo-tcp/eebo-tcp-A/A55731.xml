            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PRESENTMENT of the Grand-Jury for the Town and Borough of Southwark in the County of Surrey, and
divers other adjacent Places in the ſame County, at the General Seſſions of the Peace holden for the ſaid Town and Borough, &amp;c.
at the Bridghouſe-Hall within the ſaid Borough, on Friday the 27th. of June, in the Six and Thirtieth year of the Reign of
our Sovereign Lord CHARLES the Second by the Grace of God King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here having been lately detected a Horrid Conſpiracy, againſt the Lives of the King and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the eſtabliſhed
Government of Church and State, and the Liberties of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation: We do <hi>Preſent</hi> the ſaid Conſpiracy to be ſtill
manifeſtly carried on; as appears by the Practices of the Republican, and Fanatical Faction: And likewiſe, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
of ſome of the Conſpirators themſelves at the place of Execution: <hi>Holloway,</hi> particularly, delivering himſelf in
his <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Narrative,</hi> in theſe very words, <hi>There would be no want of Men, if it</hi> (ſpeaking of the Inſurrection) <hi>were once
begun.</hi> And afterward, <hi>If we ſhould name every one that we thought would be concerned, I believe we might name three parts of</hi> London.
Giving therein to underſtand, that they expected as well to be ſeconded by thoſe that were only <hi>Well-willers</hi> to the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> as by
others that were Actually engaged in the <hi>Malice</hi> of the <hi>Deſign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do therefore Preſent, as our Opinion, that all thoſe, who either by Open favour, or Connivence, Directly or Indirectly, by Word, Counſel,
or Action, give Countenance, or Encouragement, to any Seditious or Schiſmatical Diſturbers of the Publick Peace, are, and ought to be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
within the number of the aforeſaid <hi>Well-willers</hi> to the intereſt of that <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we do the rather Preſent, and humbly Recommend this to conſideration; in regard of the many Frauds, and Artifices, that are commonly
made uſe of for the Inveigling of the credulous Multitude, ſeducing the Ignorant; corrupting the Vain, and improving all occaſions and ill humors,
toward the diſhonour both of the King and of the Church, and the embroiling of the Government.</p>
            <p>And whereas it has been the conſtant Method of theſe Turbulent Spirits, as well in printed Libels, and written News-Letters, as in their ordinary
Diſcourſes, to Revile and Slander the King, and the Church; to Calumniate his Majeſties Miniſters of State and Juſtice, and all Loyal Subjects,
that out of a ſenſe of Conſcience, and Duty, have either Acted, ſpoken, or written, in Defence of the Government, Eccleſiaſtical and Civil; and for
the undeceiving of his Majeſties Liege People: By means whereof, they have endeavoured, as much as in them lay, not only to blaſt the Memory
of all honeſt men, but even to ſtigmatize Virtue and Loyalty it ſelf.</p>
            <p>In contemplation of theſe Outrages againſt Humanity, Duty, good Manners, and common Juſtice; We do Preſent, as our further Opinion, the
neceſſity of fixing ſome publick Mark of Infamy, upon all ſcandalous and ſeditious, printed Books, Pamphlets and Papers, of the Quality above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
to prevent the tranſmitting of ſo many Honourable Names, with Infamy, to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>We do likewiſe Preſent, that Factious Coffee-men, Victuallers, and Ale-houſe-Keepers in this Borough, have greatly contributed to our late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions;
and that divers of them do ſtill continue to make their Houſes the Receptacles of Diſloyal and ill-affected Perſons in ſuſpicious numbers:
Notwithſtanding their entire dependence upon his Majeſties Grace and Bounty, for the Livelihood of Themſelves, and their Families.</p>
            <p>In which regard, we Preſent it needful, that ſome effectual courſe be taken with them, either for their ſuppreſſion, or their better behaviour for
the future.</p>
