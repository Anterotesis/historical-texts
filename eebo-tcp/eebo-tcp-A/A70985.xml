         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

men, Learned men, great Schollars, Wiſe Diſputants,
all is in valn, their labour is little worth, the Lord is come
down to walk in the Garden, and his Voice, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> is
gone forth, and now is the Lord come, and coming to make
inquiſition for blood, and to bring every man's Work to
Judgement, and to reward every man according to his Work.</p>
            <p>And now ye Prieſts and Profeſſors in <hi>Southwark,</hi> eſpecially
who are called <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whoſe cry is very loud againſt us
who are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the noiſe among you is, <hi>That we
are the deceivers, falſe prophets, and wolves in ſheeps clothing, and
that we deny the Scriptures, and are Jeſuits, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Muſt this be true becauſe you ſay ſo? And muſt the
people believe you before you prove it? Nay, but you will be
counted falſe accuſers, and fierce deſpiſers of thoſe that are
good, till you make it appear by better proofs then you could
find to prove your ſelves Miniſters of Chriſt at the late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
&amp; then you can find to quit your ſelves from being guilty
of thoſe things you charge us withall; for indeed we count you
guilty of the ſame things you accuſe us for, and ever ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
you can clear your ſelves, and convince us to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for we ſee many ſigns, marks, and characters upon you,
and many practices among you which were never found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor among the true Miniſters of Chriſt, and that are not
owned by the Scriptures; and this hath been ſignified to you
already at the late Diſpute, and in Writing alſo given into
<hi>William Cooper</hi>'s hands ſome Weeks ſince.</p>
            <p>And alſo in a printed Paper, titled, <hi>The grounds and reaſons why
we deny the Teachers of the world;</hi> Which hath been printed ſix
years ſince, and no Anſwer hath appeared from you the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Prieſts, who are concerned therein.</p>
            <p>And now ſeeing <hi>William Cooper</hi> and ſome others of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
affirmed publikely, that we (the people called <hi>quakers)</hi>
are Jeſuits, and Jeſuitical, and proffered to prove their affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
(in the bitterneſs of their ſpirits) therefore let us
reaſon a little with you, and prove and examine you, that the
people may ſee your Clothing or outſide (if not your inſide)
to be Jeſuitical at leaſt; and let us and all people know how
you can quit your ſelves from being of that Popiſh Train; and
as for us, let our integrity and innocency plead for us, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100966:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we ſhall ſay nothing for our ſelves, for the Lord doth
plead our cauſe.</p>
            <p>Are not you like the Jeſuits and Popiſh Prieſts, Firſt, In your
being made fit for your Call to your Miniſtry. Secondly, In
your Call. Thirdly in your going forth, Fourthly, In your
Work called to. Fifthly, In your Maintenance in your Work.
Sixthly, In your Doctrines, Practices, Places of Worſhip, and
manners in Worſhip. If you ſay nay, Make it appear not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Words, but in Fruits; not Fruits of Violence I do not
mean; but Fruits of the Spirit of God, if you know it, and
anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Are you not like the Jeſuits and Popiſh Prieſts in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
your ſelves, and making your ſelves fit for your Call to
your Miniſtry you profeſs? Are you not prepared and fitted
at thoſe Schools and Colledges firſt ordained by the Pope?
Doth not learning ſome natural Languages and Arts, as Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
and Rhetorick, and ſuch like, make you fit for your Call?
And are not the Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits made fit after this
manner, in ſuch places, and by ſuch means, for their Call?
Then are you nor like them in this thing? And was ever any
of the Miniſters of Chriſt fitted and prepared after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that he ſent forth?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Are you not called, appointed, and ordained by
men to preach? And do you not count that your Call, if you
have the approbation of ſome that are counted Orthodox
men, which have learned the natural Tongues and Arts that
are taught in the Popiſh Schools and Colledges? And are not
the Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits called and approved after this
manner? And are you not like them in this alſo? Was ever
Chriſt's Miniſters called by man, or approved by man?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In your yoing forth to preach are you like the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Chriſt? Do you go gorth freely, and miniſter free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from City to City, and Nation to Nation, as the Miniſters
of Chriſt did? Have you received freely? Have not you bought
what you have with money? And do you not ſtrive to get the
beſt Market place you can to ſit down into ſell it again, even
at a deer rate? And are not the Popiſh old Maſ-houſes your
Market-places, where you abide many times for term of life?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100966:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Are not you the creepers the Apoſtle ſpoke of, that ſhould
creep into houſes, and lead ſilly Women captive, laden with
ſin, led aſide with divers luſts, ever learning, and never able
to come to the knowledge of the truth? Are not all your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
ſuch? Doth not your fruits make you appear to be ſuch
houſe-creepers as were in the Apoſtles dayes? Is not this the
Popiſh Prieſts manner? Do not they go forth in this way? Are
not you careleſs Watchmen, and dreaming Prophets, and idle
Shepherds? Do you not ſay we are Wolves? And have we not
had meetings ſeveral years in many of your Folds, (called
pariſhes) in &amp; over which you count your ſelves good Wattch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and true Shepherds? But when did either of you, or any
of you pariſh-Maſters (who would have others count you
true Shepherds) ſo much as come to ſave your ſheep from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drawn or taken from, or out of your Fold? And have you
not loſt many of the beſt and ſobereſt of your flock? Have you
cared naturally for your flock, or naturally for the fleece?
Have you ſhewed your ſelves like true ſhepherds, or like hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in this thing? Do you think you are wronged to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and counted careleſs, dreaming, falſe, idle ſhepherds, and
ſuch who want the ſpiritual Weapons, and true Shepherds
Crook? Put aſide Whips, and Stocks, and Priſons, and compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Laws, and what can you do? Where's your Spiritual Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons?
Where's your Shepherds Crook then? If you loſe theſe
Weapons, what can you do to defend your ſelves or flock?
And if you put away the Wiſdom which man teacheth, and
which man hath taught you, as natural tongues, and arts,
what can you ſay? Is your armour the whole armour of light?
and have you the Sword of the Spirit? and do you ſpeak as
the Spirit gives you utterance, as Chriſt's Miniſters did? Or do
you not gain utterance as the popiſh prieſts and Jeſuits gains
it? and have you not bought the art of uttetance? and yet are
not many of you ſo dull and ſottiſh, that if you ſhould loſe
your Notes (which I have ſeen ſome of you craftily hide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the leaves of your Bibles that the people might not ſee
them) would you not loſe your method, matter and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and ſo have little to ſay? Why do you endeavour to
hide your notes? And do not ſome of you carry a Bible on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100966:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
purpoſe up with you into your Pulpits to hide your Notes?
And are there not ſome of you that have<note n="*" place="margin">I have ſeen ſuch</note> Note Books bound
and painted in form of a Bible, when there is no printed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in it? Now could you not preach better without your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then without your Notes and Note-Book? Why do you
not leave your Bibles at home? Do you bring it onely for a
cloak, cuſtom &amp; faſhion? and is not this the reaſon why people
cry againſt us for denyers of the Scriptures, becauſe we do
not hold a Bible in our hands when we preach to people, and
becauſe we follow not your faſhion, and have Notes to tell
the people the Chapter and Verſe? Did Chriſts Miniſters go
forth after this manner with Notes in their pockets, or in a
Book, to tell them what to preach, and how to preach? and
did they ever ſit down and continue in one place for term of
life, unleſs they could hear of a people that would give them
more money, and greater hire? Whoſe example do you
follow in this, if not the Popiſh Prieſts? Come Prieſts, let the
people hear your anſwer.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In your Work called to; you ſay 'tis to preach the
Goſpel, and the cry is among poor, blind, ignorant people,
you are Miniſters of the Goſpel; But are you not Miniſters of
the Letter? and do you not call <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and
<hi>John</hi>'s Writings, the Goſpel? and do you not take the Letter
for your ground-work, which you call your Text, and then
by your art which you have learn'd at School, raiſe that you
call your Doctrines, Points, Reaſons, Uſes, Motives, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
and ſuch like? Now is not your preaching, or making an
hours ſpeech, artificial? and is not your Work herein like the
Popiſh Prieſts? and are you not very unlike the Miniſters of
Chriſt in this your Work? Did any of the latter Prophets take
the former Prophets Words to ſpeak from? Or did any of the
latter Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt, take the former Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Miniſters Words for their Ground-Work? Did not
they all miniſter according as they had received from God?
and was not their Work and Miniſtry for this end, To turn
people to Gods gift in them, from the darkneſs to the light,
from the power of Satan to God? But is your Work ſo? Do
not you turn people's minds to ſomething without them?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100966:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and do not your ſelves hate the light, and ſo are you like to
turn people from darkneſs? and are you not under the power
of Satan you ſelves? and do you not teach the poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
people, that 'tis impoſſible to be freed from under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Satan, and that they muſt never expect to be freed
from committing of ſin while living in the Body? and are not
thoſe under the power of the Devil that doth the Works of
the Devil, and obeys his Will? are not thoſe that commit ſin
the ſervants of ſin, and free from righteouſneſs? Is not he that
commits ſin, of the Devil? Then to what end and purpoſe is
all your labour, pains, and ſtudy, and preaching, and praying,
&amp;c. if people muſt always be ſervants of sin, and ſlaves to the
Devil, and never be redeemed from fin and iniquity?
What ſpiritual things do you ſowe to poore people?
What Goſpel do you preach? What glad tydings do you
bring? Is this your glad tydings, that people muſt live in
ſin, and under the power of the Devil? Are you not miſerable
Miniſters? Have you not brought another Goſpel beſides that
which the Apoſtles preached? Is not the Goſpel glad tydings
to ſuch as are weary and heavy laden with ſin, and in bondage
to the Devil? And is not the Goſpel the Power of God? And
is not Chriſt the Power of God? and is not he appointed to
ſave his people from their ſin, and not in their ſins? Have you
not one thing ſtill to learn of the Pope, and that is, to know
where the time and place of Cleanſing is? How come you to
miſs preaching up a Purgatory, or place of Cleanſing after this
life, ſeeing your Doctrine and Principles admits of no ſuch
place and time in this World? But are not the Papiſts and you
both deceived in this thing? Doth not the Tree lie as it falls?
And Judgement finde as death leaves? And no unclean thing
enter the Kingdome? Come Prieſts, let us and the people
here your anſwer.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As to your Maintenance in this your Work;
How can you quit your ſelves from being like the Papiſt Prieſt
and Jeſuits? Are you any thing like the Miniſters of Chriſt in
this thing alſo? Have not the Pope, Cardinals, and Biſhops,
been the Foundation of your ſetled ſtanding-maintenance
by Tithes, Gleab-lands, Eaſter-reckonings, Midſummer dues,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100966:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mortnaries and Smoke penys, and ſuch like? Are you not behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Pope &amp; Popiſh Laws for this your way of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?
And why do you deny the Pope? Is it becauſe he hath no
authority in this Nation to give you any more means, nor to
take from you what you have? Is it not a great ſign that the root
of all evil is in you, (to wit) Covetouſneſs, that you have ſwallowed
down ſo much blood, liberty and goods of many of the
poor innocent Lambs of Chriſt within theſe few years, becauſe
for conſcience ſake they could not put into your mouths? Have
you not prepared war againſt the innocent people of the Lord,
who living in his pure fear, did not dare to maintain you in
your Idolatry, in your lightneſs, pride and high-mindedneſs?
How many of you have appeared like a Troop of Robbers in
taking, and cauſing to be taken away violently poor peoples
Ports, and Pans, and Kettles, and diſhes from them, ſometimes
not leaving them things neceſſary to make ready their food in;
and Bedding, and Clothes, and Oxen, and Cows, and Horſes,
and Harneſs, and Barns of Wheat, and Cart-loads of Hey and
Corn, and their bodies alſo caſt into priſon? Hath not this
been your Work in this Nation? Hath not the Lord raiſed a
patient and harmleſs people to try you, which have not ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
againſt you in their Wills, that you might manifeſt what
was in your hearts, notwithſtanding your talk of Chriſtianity;
Have we not ſeen the murtherer offer a ſacrifice? and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
perſon weep for the bleſſing? and the children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
call God Father? Hath not our eyes ſeen this? And is it
not manifeſt if the Lord God, which is the higher Power,
unto whom our ſouls are ſubject, did not over-power, &amp; chain,
and fetter, and break the horns of the Wicked, no leſs then
our lives and blood would ſatisfie; for had not you (to wit,
you eſpecially called Presbyterian Prieſts) rather ſit as a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Synod or Inquiſition, then in the ſpirit of meekneſs, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſs,
and ſoundneſs in words, in life and converſation, and
Scripture-example; prove your ſelves Miniſters of Chriſt by
your fruits &amp; effects? Was ever the true Miniſters of the Goſpel
in any age or generation ſince the days of Chriſt, the Son of the
living God, manifest at Jeruſalem, maintained as you are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
by the ruine of others? Did they ever take any thing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100966:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
violently from any man? Nay, did ever they take or receive
any thing at all from thoſe that denied their Doctrine, and
that would not receive nor own them as Miniſters of Chriſt?
What, are you quite without ſhame? Are you ſo greedy of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
lucre, that you do not care how much you manifeſt your
ſhame, and uncover your nakedneſs to all people? If you keep
a Flock, eat the Milk the Flock will give you; if you plant a
Vinyard, eat the fruit the Vinyard will yeild you; ſhould you
covet your Neighbours goods, and take them away becauſe
you ſay he is a Heretick? Should you rob your Neighbours
vinyard becauſe you cannot have fruit enough to ſatisfie your
covetous deſires out of that you have planted? Should you
go reap your Neighbours field, becauſe where you have ſown
there is little come up but briars and thorns? If you do thus,
may not we, yea &amp; all people, count you greedy of filthy lucre,
covetous perſons, and robbers? Would you have better come
up then you ſow? They that preach the Goſpel, lives of the
Goſpel, and they never did, nor need petition the powers
of the Earth to eſtabliſh a Livelyhood upon them; but you
ſmell much of Popery in this thing, and you have no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the holy Scriptures to juſtifie you, but the Romiſh black
Train is your example, and therefore we deny you, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but count of you as you are, and in ſo doing we wrong
you not; But have not you wrong'd us, and falſly accuſed us,
and charged us to be like, or one with thoſe whoſe example
you are found in, and whoſe ſteps you follow, to wit, falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
falſe Teachers, Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits? You ſhall bear
your own Judgement.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Concerning your Doctrine, Practices, Places, and
manner of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Are you not found, and do we nor find you in the popiſh
Doctrine, and Jeſuitical practices, and popiſh Maſs-Houſes,
and in the manner of their Worſhip in ſome things, and in
ſome other things of later invention which the Scriptures
doth not own nor juſtifie, neither did the Miniſters of Chriſt
allow of? If ſo, may vve not count you ſuch as do not deny
the popiſh vvayes, places, and manners, but lives in them, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100966:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by them? Is it not a popiſh Doctrine and practice to oppoſe the
light within, wherewith Chriſt hath enlightened every man
that is come into the World, and to teach ſome other way to
attain the knowledge of God, beſides the light which ſhines
in the heart, notwithſtanding the Scripture teſtifies, that the
light which ſhines in the heart muſt give man the knowledge
of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt? And is it not the papiſts
doctrine and practice to deny Revelation and Inſpiration,
and the immediate power of God preſent now, as of old? and
is not this your Doctrine and practice alſo? Doth not the
Scripture ſay, or is it not written, That <hi>there is none that knows
the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him?</hi> So do
not the papiſts herein (and you with them) deny that the
knowledge of God is attainable, ſeeing you deny the way
wherein, the manner how, &amp; the thing by which he is known,
ſeen, and revealed, to wit, the light within? and if God be
not known onely, and alone, by the revelation of Chriſt,
and you and the papiſts deny revelation, and ſay it is ceaſed,
then by what means do you expect to attain the knowledge
of God, which is life eternal?</p>
            <p>And how do you that deny Inſpiration and immediate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
from God, believe the Scriptures, wherein is promiſed
many glorious things to be enjoyed by the children of the
Lord, as the pouring forth of his ſpirit upon his ſons &amp; daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
and how do you own the New Covenant, the fear in
the heart, and the Spirit of the Lord in the inward parts? and
you that deny the immediate voice, power, and preſence of
the Lord,, as of old, how do you believe Chriſts words, who
ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Lo, I will be with you to the end of the world?</hi>
and is not the preſence of Chriſt the immediate power of
God? and where two or three are gathered together in his
Name, is he not in the midſt? and is not he and his Father one,
whoſe abode is with his people? But is not this too wonderful
for Hirelings without a meaning?</p>
            <p>And why do you talk of the Scriptures for your Rule? Is it
not for ends to yourſelves? Doth the Scriptures your preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Rule, juſtifie you any more then they juſtifie the Pope,
Cardinals, Biſhops, Jeſuits, Fryers, Monks, and popiſh prieſts?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100966:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
VVhy do you talk of three perſons, or Trinity? Hath not the
Pope learnt you that alſo? Doth the Scripture ſpeake any
where of three perſons? And where had you that word <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
and the word <hi>merit?</hi> Had you not theſe from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts?</p>
            <p>And concerning your places wherein you commonly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
your publike VVorſhip; who founded and named them
for you? Did not the papiſts? as St. <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> Church,
St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Church, St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Church, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church,
St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church: Did not the very ſame ſpirit that was caſt
out of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and that ſtoned <hi>Stephen,</hi> and that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> build and give Names to thoſe Steeple-houſes?
which you have ſuffered, if not taught the people, to
call Churches, and the Houſes of God, inſomuch that it hath
been a great crime among poor ignorant people to hear them
called otherwiſe, &amp; is ſtil, eſpecially in ſome places of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Were they not the Popes Maſs-Houſes, and places of their
Idolatrous Worſhip? And what Rule have you in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
for any to worſhip the true God in theſe Idolatrous
Dens, and Popiſh Houſes, and to call them ſuch, and ſuch a
Saints Church, eſpecially without alteration in form, in name
and eſteem? Did the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> do ſo? Did the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Chriſtians do ſo? VVhere is your example? And who made
<hi>George</hi> a Saint? and <hi>Katherine,</hi> and <hi>Olives,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mary Overies,</hi> and
<hi>Giles,</hi> and <hi>Gregory, &amp;c.</hi> that your Churches are called by their
Names? are they not of the Popes making? are you not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
that people ſhould call thoſe places Churches?</p>
            <p>And then concerning your Manners and Worſhip in theſe
places; Is it not your manner before your Worſhip begins, to
ring Bells to call your Hearers (your Brethren) together? and
whom do you imitate? and who learnt you this but the
papiſts? and why do you deny them in words, and imitate
them in practice?</p>
            <p>And is it not your manner to get an hour-glaſs to preach,
and pray by, and to ſing by? and have you not the chief ſeats
in the Aſſemblies? the popiſh Train hath ſo; and are you not
like them? Do not they worſhip, and preach, and pray, and
ſing by the hour? then do you not agree with them? Did ever
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100966:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the true Chriſtians and Chriſtian Miniſters do ſo?</p>
            <p>And why muſt you have a ſoft Cuſhion with ſilken Jobs at the
corners to lean on to read your ſtudied, deviſed, framed artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sermon or ſpeech to the people? And by what order was your
Pulpit or high place hung with imbroydered Cloath, and ſome
other of your ſtalls lined with cloath, when others want it to
wear, even of your own heap, and ſect and fold? Who are you
like in this? Have you any ſuch preſident in the holy Scriptures?
What? and where is your Rule and Example? If you muſt have
a Cuſhion, cut off the Jobs; and if you muſt have a Pulpit, take
off your imbroydered cloaths, and cloathe your brethren which
are within your own Pariſh, and of your own fleſh; and do not
let them go up and down begging for clothes and food, while
your Pulpits and Stalls, or other chief Seats, are clothed, imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and laced; What manner of Chriſtianity and brotherly
love is there among you towards one another? And how come
you by this manners among you, that he that hath a Gold Ring,
and coſtly Apparel, and is called a rich man, muſt have a ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſeat in the principal place; and others in vile rayment can
ſcarce have a place to ſit on, but muſt ſtand afar off? Where I
ſay did you learn this manners? Did you learn it of the Church
of Chriſt, or the Pope and his Church? And is it not your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and cuſtom to reſpect perſons, places, times, dayes &amp; things?
Doth not the Heathen ſo? and the Papiſts ſo? Then who may
we compare you with, if not with thoſe? Did ever any of the
primitive Chriſtians do ſo? Was it their manner to reſpect the
perſon of him or her that had a Gold Ring or coſtly Apparel?
Or was it their manner to reſpect or cry up the Jewiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
or Heathen Idolatrous Temple, or any particular place
or houſe whatſoever, as the onely place of Worſhip, and call it a
Church? Or did the Church of God in the dayes of <hi>Moſes</hi> and
the Prophets, when the Lord had given them victory over the
Heathen their Enemies, did they (I ſay) preſerve the Heatheniſh
Idolatrous places of Worſhip, as Altars, Groves and Temples,
and teach the people to call them Churches? Was it not as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for thoſe places to be called a Church, as 'tis for theſe popiſh
Dens (builded with obſervation Eaſt and Weſt, with a picture of
a Cock and a Croſs upon it, as the Papiſts deviſed and appointed)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100966:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be called a Church? Did not the Miniſters of Chriſt gather
people out of them, and bear their teſtimony againſt them, and
all Temples made with hands? Did not the Lord by his Hammer,
and battel-Ax of War, break down, burn, and utterly deſtroy
thoſe places, and Images, and Groves, ſet up and conſecrated by
the Idolaters? Did not the Lord begin ſuch a work in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome years ſince? And hath ſome Inſtruments proved like
<hi>Jehu,</hi> begun in zeal, and ended in covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry,
and hath not regarded the Law of God withall their heart, And
ſhall that fruſtrate the work and purpoſe of the Lord? Is he not
raiſing others to accompliſh his Work, and fulfil his Decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Adulterous generation, of what name or ſect ſoever?
and down in eſteem, if not in form, muſt the Popiſh Maſs-Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
come, (and which is now the Prieſts Market place, and called
a Church) and down muſt your Bells, and Pulpit-embroydered
cloathes, and ſuch like trumpery come, which hath been ſet up in
the time of Popery, and ſince the cry was, Who is able to make
war with the Beaſt?</p>
            <p>And then is it not your manner to reſpect times, dayes, and
things? Are you not like the Papiſts in this alſo? And have you
not learnt of the Pope, Biſhops, Cardinals, Jeſuits Prieſts, Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Monks, and Heathens, how, and what to call your times,
dayes, months, and quarters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Have they not all Heatheniſh
and Popiſh Names? The holy Scriptures you are not aſhamed to
ſay is your Rule, but in what one thing do you walk according to
your pretended Rule? unleſs you mean the Popiſh &amp; Heatheniſh
Scriptures, or Writings, &amp; call them your holy Rule; if you mean
thoſe, you ſhall be believed, becauſe you are found walking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
but if you mean the Writings which holy men wrote as
they were moved by the Holy Spirit, we know you are lyars, and
cannot believe you, for they never learnt you to follow the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and cuſtoms of the Heathen nor Papiſts, as you do, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting,
and naming, or calling your Times, Dayes, Months and
things; the Scripture of Truth teacheth to call Days and Months
after this manner, Firſt day, ſecond day, third day, fourth day,
fifth day, ſixth day, ſeventh day. Firſt month, ſecond month, third
month, and ſo to the twelfth month. The Heathen and Papiſts,
and their Writings, teacheth to call the firſt day of the Week
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100966:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Sunday,</hi> or dies <hi>Solis,</hi> the day of the Sun; the ſecond day <hi>Monday,</hi> or
dies Lun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, the day of the Moon, or the Moons day; the third day
<hi>Tueſday;</hi> &amp; the fourth <hi>Wedneſday;</hi> the fifth <hi>Thurſday;</hi> ſixth <hi>Fryday;</hi>
the ſeventh <hi>Saturday;</hi> according to the Names of the 7. <hi>Planets</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
the Heathen and Papiſts talk ſo much of. And the firſt Month they
call <hi>March,</hi> the ſecond <hi>April,</hi> and ſo on to the eighth Month,
which is called <hi>October,</hi> which ſignifieth the eighth Month, <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
the ninth Month, <hi>December</hi> the tenth Month, from the <hi>Lattin</hi>
words, <hi>Octo, Novem, Decem,</hi> eight, nine, and ten; and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Month you call <hi>January,</hi> and the twelfth Month <hi>February.</hi>
Now do you not prefer the Heatheniſh and Popiſh Traditions,
Rules, Cuſtoms, Manners, and Writings, before, and above what
is delivered, preſcribed, and taught in the Writings of the holy
men of God? ſo that it is come to paſs by your ſo doing, that if
people are brought to call daies, and months, and times,
and places, and perſons, according as thoſe did who had
the ſpirit of God, which the Scriptures teacheth and witneſſeth
unto; I ſay, When people are brought to this, they become a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and a wonder among you, and are counted nice, and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and unmannerly, and when we ſpeak and write of hours,
dayes, and months, as they are recorded in the Scripture, people
cannot tell what we mean, nor how to underſtand us, nor when
ſuch a time, hour day or month is, but will rather mock and jeer
at firſt hour, firſt day, firſt month &amp;c. and will have no ſuch recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of times in their temporal, civil, or ſpiritual Accompts; theſe
are your Auditors your Diſciples, or Schollars; as you have learnt,
you teach; as you the Prieſts are, ſo are the people, imitators of
the Papiſts and Heathen in this, as well as other things; and the
Chriſtians life, words, manners and behaviour, you are out of, and
ſtrangers to; and may we not juſtly with the Heathen and Papiſts
compare you, whoſe example you follow?</p>
            <p>And then concerning the manner of your publike Divine
Worſhip, (as you call it) have you not this manner and cuſtom
as the firſt part of your Worſhip, to ſing <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms in rime
and meeter, diviſed, or turned thereinto by Poets or Muſicianers,
as <hi>Thomas Sternhold,</hi> and <hi>John Hopkins,</hi> and others, with apt Notes
to ſing them withall, before your prayer, and after your Prayer;
before your Sermon, and after your Sermon, of all the people
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100966:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
together; Is not this your own invention? Was there any ſuch
manner of ſinging in the Church of Chriſt? You ſay; Let <hi>us ſing
to the praiſe and glory of God;</hi> and you keep an Officer to read the
Pſalm to people, which are ſome drunkards, ſome covetous, ſome
proud, ſome defrauders of their Brethren, diſſemblers, double<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
dealers, ſome Adulterers and unclean perſons; ſome jeſters, and
idle talkers; ſome light, and vain, wild, and wanton; ſome ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
high-minded, and mockers; ſome diſobedient to Parents, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful,
and unholy, and of rude, unchriſtian behaviour; Of
ſuch conſiſteth your Church; and are not the Steeplehouſe-ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſuch? And can ſuch perſons ſing to the praiſe and glory of
God? Or are they in a ſtate and condition fit to ſing at all? Doth
not weeping and howling, mourning, ſorrow, and lamentation,
and wo from the dreadful Lord God of Heaven and of Earth,
belong to ſuch ſingers? Singing with Grace in the heart unto the
Lord, we own; but ſinging with wickedneſs, with pride and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
in the heart, we utterly deny; Singing with the Spirit
and with underſtanding, we own; but your ſinging by Letter,
with Muſical Notes and Tunes, cuſtomarily, ignorantly, without
underſtanding, we wholly diſown, and bear our teſtimony againſt
it as abomination in the ſight of the Lord, and it was never or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
nor appointed in, nor by the true Church; but it hath been
ordained and appointed by the falſe Church, the Whore, and her
Merchants, in the dark night of Apoſtacy, ſince the dayes of the
Apoſtles, and ſince the true Church fled in to the Wilderneſs; And
is not this ſinging of <hi>David</hi>'s Prayers, Mournings, Sighings, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings,
and Cryes unto the Lord, and his Praiſes, Rejoicings,
and magnifying the Lord, and ſuch like conditions as <hi>David</hi> was
in; I ſay, Is not your ſinging of theſe things, like the Papiſts ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
have you any more rule in the Scripture for your ſinging, then
the Papiſts have for their ſinging? And hath it not been one of
the Whores later invention and addition to your Worſhip, even
about the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign in this Nation? but
the ſame pure, eternal light which appeared in the hearts of ſome
about the beginning of our Engliſh Wars, and manifeſted much
of the Popiſh Trumpery which was then in being, of which qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſters
and ſinging-boys in white Surplices was one; I ſay, the
ſame pure, eternal light hath manifeſted your ſinging and noiſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100966:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be as abominable in the ears of the Lord, as theirs, and to
be denyed and witneſſed againſt; for you have no more rule
in the Scripture for your ſinging <hi>David's</hi> Prayers, then the
quireſters and ſingers then had to ſing the Prayer which Chriſt
taught his Diſciples, which they called <hi>Pater Noſter;</hi> Which of
all you Maſs-houſe Singers are, or ever were what you ſing, as
when you ſing, <hi>O Lord I am no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

will ſcarce look upon, nor walk with, nor relieve thoſe that
are poor, though they be of your own Church? Then do you
not ſing a lye in this? And is that to the praiſe and glory of
God? Surely you dare not ſay that God is glorified with a

not in the ſame ſtate, condition, and life that <hi>David</hi> was in,
they are lyes in your mouths: <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Mine eys guſh out with

<hi>David</hi> ſaid, and you ſing theſe words ignorantly, cuſtomarily,
never witneſſing the ſame ſtate &amp; condition, ſo they are lyes in
your mouths, and God is not glorified, but diſhonored by you
in this part of your Worſhip; and your ſinging, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
and quiriſters, and Surplice-boys ſinging, is abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
alike in the ſight of the Lord, and in the ſight of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
who are redeemed from amongſt you, and from under
the great Whore, which ſits upon the Waters; but the Lord our
God is taking her ſeat from under her, and into the pit ſhe

Fornications) ſhall fall, and none ſhall be able to deliver her,
neither can ſhe ſave her ſelf, nor thoſe that hath been, and
ſtill are made drunk with her Sorceries and deceiveable ways
of unrighteouſneſs, of which this trick, craft, and art of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is one; <hi>James</hi> ſaid, <hi>Is any merry, let him ſing Pſalms;</hi> He wrote
theſe words to Saints; but hear what he wrote to ſuch as you,

and whoſe hearts are unpurified, and whoſe minds are

(ſo called) ſuch? But the Lord hath redeemed,
and is redeeming many thouſands from among you, <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
ſingers, and hath brought, and is bringing them to godly
ſorrow, which leadeth to repentance never to be repented of,
and afterwards to the joy which ſhall never have an end; and
your rejoicing and ſinging which is carnal, cuſtomary, and
formal, before any godly ſorrow for ſin you know, and before
you are lead to that repentance which is never to be repented
of; I ſay, this your rejoicing and ſinging which is before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
muſt of neceſſity end in ſorrow and anguiſh of heart:
The Lord grant you ſuch ſorrow which leadeth to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in time, before Eternity ſeizeth upon you, that weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and howling, and gnaſhing of teeth be not your portion
for ever; for if the prayers of the unregenerate, ungodly, or
wicked are abomination to the Lord, is their praiſes and
ſinging any better? Is praiſe comely in the mouth of a fool?
And are not they fools that lives in iniquity, &amp; yet rejoiceth?
Conſider this ye Prieſts, ye Jeſuits, and Popiſh Chriſtians, and
let the Witneſs for God in your conſcience, and in all conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
anſwer whether ye are not all alike.</p>
            <p>Concerning your praying after you have done ſinging.</p>
            <p>The Scripture ſaith, <hi>I will that men pray every where, lifting
up holy hands, without wrath or doubting;</hi> But what hands do you
lift up? Are your hands holy, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Have not you Wrath, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
and Malice in your hearts, and doubtings, and waverings
in your minds? Is not your prayings like the Popiſh Prieſts and
Papiſts prayings? And like the Scribes and Phariſees prayings?
Did Chriſt ever teach you to pray any more then he taught
them? Are you his Diſciples, or Schollars, or followers any
more then they? What do you learn of him? And whither
do you follow him? Can you ſay that he hath taught you to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100966:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pray as he taught his Diſciple to pray? Have you not learnt to
pray of ſome other beſides Chriſt? And do not you (inſtead
of being led to pray by the Spirit of Chriſt) pray cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily?
You know when you have ſung out your Pſalm, you
make and frame a prayer, or elſe the people will wonder at
you; ſo inſtead of waiting and ſtaying for the moving and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the holy ſpirit to pray by, you wait for the end of the
Pſalm, and then you move and ſtir up your ſelves, and makes
a mock of the movings of the ſpirit of God; and ſo inſtead
of praying by the Spirit, you turn up your Hour-glaſs, and
prayes by that; ſo that you know how long to pray, and how
long to preach, and how long to ſing by your guide, the Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,
and your eye is often towards it for direction; and when
'tis a pretty deal run, you will tell the people you ſee the time
is far ſpent, therefore you muſt haſten; and when your Glaſs
is out, you tell the people the time is ſpent, and you ſee the
time is paſt, and therefore you ſhall conclude: Oh what do ye
mean ye Prieſts, that ye are not yet aſhamed of this divice
and Popiſh Invention in this day of the light's breaking forth
in the hearts of people! Ye ſearch the Scriptures which you
falſly call your Rule, and you ſay you are Miniſters of Chriſt,
and ſucceeders of the Apoſtles, but in trial you are found ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,
and your pretended Rule (the holy Scriptures) witneſſeth
againſt you as tranſgreſſors, out of the life of the holy men
that gave them forth, wreſting their words to ſerve your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ends to your own (and others that are led by you) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and out of the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſts
ſteps, life, manners, behaviour, doctrine and practices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where
is it written in the holy Scriptures, and which of the Apoſtles
and Miniſters of Chriſt appointed and ordained that their
ſucceeders ſhould pray, and preach, and ſing by an Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,
and to meet together by the ſound of the Bells to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?
Where is that written? And which of the Miniſters of
Chriſt appointed Bells to call their Brethren together? In
which of the Chriſtian Churches before the Apoſtacy, was
there Hour-glaſſes, and Bells, and Pulpits with embroydered
Cloath about them, and lined Stalls for the rich, with a lock
and key to keep the poor out, and many ſuch like devices

which are found amongſt you? I ſay, Where is your Rule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Where is your Example for any of theſe and ſuch like things
in the Scriptures of the holy men of God? Come Prieſts,
look out the Chapter and Verſe, if you can, and let us know
where it is; until then, we ſhall conclude, yea, and it is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
already, That you walk not, nor worſhip not as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
before the Apoſtacy did, neither have you them for
your example or pattern; but that your example and pattern
is the falſe Romiſh Church your elder Siſter, and the great
Whore your Mother, we know, and the Beaſt ſhe rides on, we
have ſeen, which is of a Scarlet colour, and the blood ſhe hath
drunk of the Prophets, Saints, and Martyrs, the Lord is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
after, and making inquiſition for, and a bed of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhe ſhall be laid on; Hearken and rejoice ye Saints, ye
Children of the Moſt High, a Bed (which betokeneth a place
of Reſt) ſhall be the Whores place of Torment, her reſting
place ſhall torment her; Alas! alas! Weeping, and wailing,
and mourning over her, ſhall be the greateſt comfort
her Merchants that hath been made rich by her, and her
children ſhe hath delicately brought up, ſhall yeild her; yea
all ye Ship-Maſters, and all ye company in Ships, and Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
and Kings, and Merchants, ſhall ſtand afar off for fear of
her torment, and caſt duſt on their heads, and cry, weeping,
and wailing, ſaying, Alas! alas! that great City, wherein were
made rich all that had Ships in the ſea, by reaſon of her coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
for in one hour is ſhe made deſolate: Rejoice over her
thou Heaven, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets, for God
hath avenged you on her, you have ſeen the Angel take up
the great ſtone, and give the ſign of her perpetual downfal;
and a great voice of much people in Heaven is heard, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Halelujah, Salvation, and Glory, and Honor, and Power
unto the Lord our God, for true and righteous are his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for he hath judged the great Whore which did corrupt
the Earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood
of his Servants. And again they ſaid, Halelujah, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And now you National Prieſts, are not you the Ship-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
or Pariſh-Maſters, Merchants, or Traders by Sea here
ſpoken of? <hi>And the gathering together of the waters he called Sea;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100966:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And the Beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns roſe out of the Sea; The
wicked are like a troubled Sea: And the waters thou ſaweſt where the
Whore ſitteth, are peoples, kindreds, tongues, and nations:</hi> So the ſea
is Waters, and the Waters is Peoples, Multitudes, Tongues and
Nations, whereon the Whore your Mother hath long ſate, and
in, or among whom you her Merchants have built your Ships,
and ſet up your Trade by the Authority of the Beaſt which
roſe out of the ſame place the Whore ſate on; He that hath
Wiſdom, let him underſtand: I ſay, By the Authority of this
Beaſt who hath ſeven heads, ten horns, ten Crowns upon his
horns; &amp; upon his heads the name of Blasphemy, unto whom
the Dragon gave his power, have you, and all Pariſh-Maſters
and others of the Whores choice Merchants in whole Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſate and advanced your Trade above, and beyond all
the Crafts-mens Trade beſide in the whole World: And this
may appear plain to the view of all people, if theſe few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
following are conſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You have got a Market-place where none muſt ſell any
Wares but your ſelves, though it be never ſo much better
then yours; neither muſt any come into your Market-place to
give freely to poor people, whoſe ſouls are ready to ſtarve for
want of the Bread of life, notwithſtanding they buy of your
deceitful Wares.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You have had, and ſome of your Brethren ſtill
have a compulſive Law to compel and conſtrain all people
within ſuch a compaſs or quarter to come to your Market-place
and buy of you, and none other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whether thoſe people within ſuch a compaſs, or
quarter, or pariſh, come to your Market, or no, or receive any
of your Merchandize, notwithſtanding you will make them
pay as much as if they did, or elſe you will take, or cauſe to be
taken from them violently (it may be) three, four, or five times
as much as the price was you firſt ſet upon your Commodities.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Though your Merchandize be never, ſo deceitful
and inſufficient, yet none muſt refuſe them, neither will you
bate of your price; and if any come to ſee the deceitfulneſs
and inſufficiency of what you ſell at a very deer rate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
againſt it, that people might not be deceived and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100966:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
always with deceitful words, and devilliſh Doctrines,
you wil ſue ſuch at the Law for ſlanderers, and get one of the
Beaſts Horns that hath a Crown upon it, to grant you 100. l.
damage, or ſome other puniſhment, as whip, or priſon, or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
or life, (if ye can get it) for the Whore loves blood,
and ſo doth her Merchants and children.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Another thing that makes your Trade exceed all
the Crafts-mens Trade beſide in the whole World, is, That
when poor people have bought your Merchandize, and paid
you, or at leaſt are liable to pay you, you take them home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in your Pockets, or Bibles, or Note-Books, and lay them
up in your Ware-houſe, to wit, your Liberary, and as you ſee
occaſion, and opportunity, you carry them to Market again,
and they wil yeild you as much as they did at the firſt; and yet
after you have ſold your Imagery Work over and over, you
can trim it, and dreſs it a little, and put the title Doctor of
Divinity to it, or Batchellor of Divinity, or Mr. <hi>William,</hi> or Mr.
<hi>John</hi> ſuch a one, Miniſters of God's Word at ſuch a Church,
in ſuch a place, and find a Chapman, ſome Bookſeller, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or other, to give you money for it: Much like this might
be mentioned, but this is ſufficient to let all people which
are not quite blind ſee wherein this whores Merchants trade
exceeds all other Arts, Crafts, and Trades, in the whole world.
And alſo the reaſon may here be ſeen wherefore theſe Pariſh-Maſters,
and others of Myſtery Babylons Merchants ſtrives
and petition that their trade may be upheld even in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
under this notion, Propagate or hold up the Goſpel;
when if they would ſpeak as they mean, it is thus, Propagate,
hold up, or maintain our Mothers Authority, by which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
we have had a good trade a great while, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
hath been great, and our incombs ſure; and let the Romiſh
Churches our elder Siſters, her Inſtitutions, Ordinations, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
Manners, Practices and Places ſtand, elſe we ſhal have
no certain Trade; for if we loſe our Elder Siſters Law which
gives us Tythes, and that compels people to buy our Goſpel,
we ſhal be undone, peoples hearts are ſo hard they wil give
us little freely, though they have been, and ſtil are our Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and we have taught them ſome ten, ſome twenty, thirty
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100966:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or forty years, yet we are afraid if we loſe our elder Siſters
Law, that thoſe that have been our conſtant cuſtomers would
hate us much of our price, and thoſe that do not like our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Church-diſcipline, and our chargeable Goſpel, will
give us nothing at all; is not this the very language of your
hearts, whoſe cry is, Propagate the Goſpel? let that which
ſearcheth your hearts and diſcerns the ſecret intents thereof,
the light of Chriſt in your Conſciences anſwer; for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
is Chriſt the power of God, which propagates, or holds
up all things, and 'tis ignorance and blaſphemy to cry and
petition to an arm of fleſh to propagate this Goſpel, but 'tis
another Goſpel, that they who have brought it are accurſed
that wants propagating; and this ſhall all your Merchants of
Babylon know, in the dreadfull day of the Lord our God,
when all the blood you have drunk, and Tortures, and Racks,
Whips and Priſons, Stocks and Inquiſitions, and other carnal
weapons you have uſed to propagate your Goſpel, ſhall riſe
up in Judgement againſt you; then will ye cry to the Rocks,
and the Mountains to fall upon you, to hide you from the
Wrath of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>And now is the wondrfull day at hand, wherein the
Wolves, Bears, and Lions ſhall be afraid and ſeek to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the preſence of the Lamb. Conſider this all ye
hirelings, that rend and tear, and make a prey upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
lambs of Chriſt for to ſerve your own bellies, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
unchriſtian, greedy deſires, how greatly do you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour
the name of Chriſt, in calling your ſelves his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters?
have not you and all your Brethren, the Popiſh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in whole Chriſtendome ſent an ill ſavour throughout
the Nations and Regions round about you? yea and many of
thoſe you count heathens ſhal riſe up in judgment againſt you,
even againſt you who have the ſheeps cloathing, the Prophets
words, Chriſts vvords, the Apoſtles words, but inwardly raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Spirit of God in your ſelves, and ſo have appeared
devouring wolves, and deſtroyers of the ſheeps life, &amp; ſcatterers
of the flock of God, hear the Word of the Lord by the mouth
of his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> againſt ſuch as you, <hi>Wo be to the
Shepherds of Iſrael, that do feed themſelves, ſhould not the ſhepherds
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100966:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
feed the flocks? ye eat the fat, and ye cloth you with the wool, ye kill
them that are fed, but ye feed not the flock; the diſeaſed haue ye not
ſtrengthened, neither have ye healed that which was ſick, neither have
ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again
that which was driven away, neither have ye ſought that which was loſt,
but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them,</hi> &amp;c. Ezech. ch. 34.</p>
            <p>There is much in theſe words; and this hath been your work,
as fully and as truly as ever it was the falſe ſhepherds work in
the time of the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and now is the Lord mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
appearing to be againſt ye ſhepherds, and requiring his
flock at your hand, and is cauſing you to ceaſe from feeding
his flock, and alſo from feeding your ſelves of his flock, and
delivering them from your mouths, and gathering them from
all places where they have been ſcattered in the cloudy and
dark day, according to <hi>Ezechiels</hi> Propheſie; and this is the
Lords own work, in this his mighty day, and all the hirelings
and wolviſh Shepherds in whole Chriſtendome ſhall not be
able to withſtand and hinder the accompliſhing, and fulfilling
of this the Lords purpoſe, though <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> beaſt and
falſe prophet, ioyn together; yet the Lamb and the Saints
ſhall have the victorie, and the Plagues upon the Seat of the
great Whore ſhall be poured, and the tongue of the Egyptian
ſea ſhall be dryed up, and the waters which hath overflowed
the higheſt Mountain ſhall abate and be dried up, and the ſhip-maſters,
the Pariſh-maſters trade ſhall fail: And thou O Mount
<hi>Seir,</hi> becauſe thou haſt had a perpetuall hatred, and haſt ſhed
the blood of the children of Iſrael by force of the Sword in
the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had
an end; therefore as I live ſaith the Lord God I will prepare
thee unto blood, and blood ſhall purſue thee, ſith thou haſh
not-hated blood, even blood ſhall purſue thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is
the portion of <hi>Cain,</hi> who was a murtherer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
whoſe ſacrifice is the fruit of that ground which is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and which the dew of heaven never deſcended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor the bleſſing of the moſt High was ever appointed for;
And out of this ground, out of this earth, in which <hi>Cain</hi> is a
Vagabond, ſpringeth and ariſeth that ſpirit that can offer a
Sacrifice, and murther when he hath done, and that this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100966:13"/>
is manifeſt in and among you the Nationall Prieſts is very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
and ſufficiently proved by your own fruits, acts and
deeds within theſe few years, yea and the cry of innocent
blood hath entred the ears of the Lord againſt you, even
againſt you both Prieſts and people, who notwithſtanding
your pretences of worſhipping God, have envy, the root of
murther in your hearts, and violence in your hands, and
while you regard iniquity in your hearts, your very prayers
are abomination and ſtinks in the noſtrils of the Lord.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Whore and her Merchants that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thirſteth after the
blood of creatures under the notion of hereticks, and that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
men about matters of Religion; the Chriſtians and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Miniſters never did ſo, neither did they wreſtle with
fleſh and blood, but you and the papiſts are found wreſtling
with flesh, and deſtroying mens lives, and not ſaving them, and
you ſhall have your reward together according to your Work.</p>
            <div type="queries">
               <head>A few Queries for all that own Tythes due to the preſent
Priesthood, and for the Prieſthood that takes them to
conſider and anſwer.</head>
               <p>1. TO vvhat end do you the people pay tithes? and to vvhat
end do you the Prieſts take tithes? is your end accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Lavv of God that gave the tithes to the firſt Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?
then people vvhy do you not ſee them improved to
that end? and Prieſts vvhy do you not let them be improved
to that end? and vvas not the end vvherefore tithes vvas gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that the Widovvs, Strangers, and Fatherleſſe might be
relieved and maintained by them as vvell as the Prieſts? And
had not the Widovvs, Strangers, and Fatherleſſe as much Right
to the Tithes, as the Leviticall prieſts had? and had they not
their maintenance out of them, ſo that there need not be a
beggar among them? Was not the prieſts gates to ſtand open,
that the Widovvs, Strangers and Fatherleſſe might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
               <p>2. Did not that Lavv of God that gave Tithes to this end,
ordain a place to put them in, a Store-houſe, (into vvhich
Store-houſe the people brought them, elſe they robbed God)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100966:14"/>
and vvere they not to be taken out of this Store-houſe, as the
Widows, Strangers, Fatherleſſe and Prieſts had need of them?
and was not this Store-houſe called Gods Houſe? read <hi>Mal.</hi>
3. 10. How comes it to paſſe, if not by the order of the
Pope, Biſhops and Cardinals, and the reſt of the popiſh train,
that there is no Store-houſe in whole Chriſtendome (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
to put the Tithes of the Land in, nor no Widows, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Fatherleſs relieved according to their neceſſities out
of the Tithes, but pope, chief Magiſtrate and prieſts, have,
and would have them all brought into their own houſe? and
how many of their gates ſtand open, that the Widows, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Fatherleſſe, and poore, might paſſe freely in and
take part of the Tithes with them? do they not more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
lye begging at their gates when they are ſhut? and lye
about the Streets begging and crying for bread, and at the
Steeple-houſes there is a hideous, dolefull noiſe for bread
many times? was it ſo in the time of the Law, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Tithes from the people? did not the Lord make the
Tithes, give the poore, the Widows, the Strangers, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe,
and prieſts alſo enough? and now people that pay
Tithes, and prieſts that receive Tithes, whom do you imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and follow, if not the Popiſh train? are not you unlike
both Jews and Chriſtians? did the true Chriſtians ever pay, or
receive Tithes?</p>
               <p>3. Is not this a monſtrous Prieſthood, that hath roſe up
ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, who denied the firſt prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
that devours and impropriates all the Tithes to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and will not allow the Poore, the Widows, Strangers,
and Fatherleſſe any ſhare with them of the Tithes, though
they may be ready to ſtarve for vvant of food and Raiment?
is not this monſtrous prieſthood in Chriſtendom (vvho call
themſelves Miniſters of the Goſpel) exceedingly ſtained and
laden with the blood of the poor, of the Widows, of the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and Fatherleſs? And you the people, how can you be clear
in paying your tithes to ſuch a prieſthood, that do not let their
gates ſtand open, nor have no Store-houſe, nor that do not
improve them to that end, that they were improved to, in the
time of the Law? are not all your Tithes given and received
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100966:14"/>
to a worſe end, notwithſtanding you ſay you are Chriſtians,
and live in the glorious day of the Goſpel, then they were
given and received in the time of the Law? How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of poore, of Widows, Strangers, of Fatherleſſe, and
beggars are there in thy borders, O Chriſtendome, which want
relief, which the Law of God that gave Tithes to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
which God ordained, provided for, by the Tithes that
were brought into the Store-houſe? Why muſt a greedy, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
proud prieſthood, that is not like the prieſthood under
the Law, nor the Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſwallow down,
and devour, and treaſure up to themſelves, which belongs no
more to them, then to the Widows, Strangers, and Fatherleſs?
Put the Popes Lavv aſide, the Magiſtrates of <hi>England,</hi> and if
Tithes and prieſthood muſt ſtand, let them ſtand according
to the Lavv of God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not according to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
Law, and covetous prieſts deſires.</p>
               <p>4. Did not the Pope, and the falſe Church (which hath ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles) who invented Tithes for
the maintenance of his Miniſters, exclude and ſhut out the
poore, the Fatherleſſe, the Widows, and Strangers from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a ſhare with him and his prieſts of the Tithes? and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
why do you love to uphold a popiſh invention, and the
falſe Churches Synodicall Decrees, Edicts and Ordinances?
and is not this one popiſh Decree, that Tithes are due to God
and holy Church? do you not know what God the Pope and
papiſts mean? and what, and where the Holy Church is,
that Tithes are due to, by his, or their Decree? is not their God
their belly, and their glory their ſhame, and their Holy
Church a Cage of unclean birds, a den of Idolaters, which
murthers, priſons, racketh and tortureth and perſecuteth
thoſe that are indeed the members of the Holy Church (which
is in God) and did ever the miniſters of Chriſt, who were
members of the Holy Church, preach up Tithes to be due to
them, or covet after them, or receive any of them? did they
not on the contrary preach againſt Tithes and deny them,
and the prieſthood that received Tithes, and the Law that
gave Tithes they denied alſo, and witneſſed the change of the
Law and prieſthood both? as in the 7. of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100966:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Hebrews;</hi> Then are not thoſe prieſts that preach for Tithes,
and plead for Tithes, oppoſers of the true Miniſters of Chriſt,
and their Doctrine, and upholders of the Pope, Papiſts and
their Decrees, and Orders?</p>
               <p>5. Did not Chriſt Jeſus who is the ſubſtance of all the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall</hi>
adminiſtrations ſend forth his Miniſters freely, ſaying
to them, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give?</hi> did ever Chriſt
bid them demand Tithes from the people they preached to?
then ſurely they did never ſue them at the Law for that they
never demanded of them, as thoſe that call themſelves the
Miniſters of Chriſt do now in this age, who have been rifling
mens houſes and fields for Tithes; People do you not believe
that it is a great abomination and blaſphemy againſt the Lord
for ſuch to call themſelves the miniſters of Chriſt? is not Chriſts
glorious Goſpel of God diſhonoured by them? is not the
Pope that ordered Tithes to be paid to the Prieſts, Biſhops and
Clergy men onely, and that excluded the poore from having
part of the Tithes, more honoured and obeyed then Chriſt,
by all the Tithe-mongers and hirelings in Chriſtendome, and
people that own them? Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Freely you have received

and if people will not give us freely, we will compell them
by force and cruelty; and whoſe Miniſters are ſuch? and
whoſe Commands and Ordinances do ſuch obey, Chriſts or
the Popes? hath not your fruits and works anſwered already,
that the Popes Command and Order is preferred above
Chriſts, and obeyed rather then Chriſts Command and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
Did not Chriſt ſay, <hi>Into whatſoever Town or City you enter,
enquire who in it is worthy, and there abide till ye go thence,</hi> &amp;c. this

Miniſters into any Town, City or Countrey, to enquire how
much money by the year they would give them to preach to
them, and to enquire after Tithes, and Augmentations and
ſuch like, and to agree and make bargains with people for a
100. or 200 l. by the year? if Chriſt ſent any ſuch Miniſters
forth, and if the true Chriſtians ever owned ſuch Miniſters,
prieſts and people, anſwer and declare when, till then we ſhall

given into the hands of</hi> William Cooper <hi>about the middle of the third
Month, encloſed with ſome Directions for him to convey it to the reſt of

Cooper <hi>ſoon after ſent word by one of his Communicants, That
we ſhould have a ſpeedy Anſwer; but no Anſwer hath appeared: And
now therefore are they further examined, and their practices and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Worſhip more fully enquired into in the former Treatiſe; And
in both all people may ſee that are not quite blind, how that much and
many relicks of Popery are yet ſtanding chiefly in the Presbyterian
Churches, ſo called, and that the true Chriſtian life and primitive
Church-Order is not among them. And if they can ſay otherwiſe, let
them lay aſide that wiſdom which man teacheth, and which they have
learn'd at School by natural Education, and anſwer without logical
Arguments, in plainneſs, according to the holy Scriptures.</hi>

And whereas you asked, <hi>If we owned you to be Miniſters of
Chriſt:</hi> Unto which in part we anſwered, and I do here more
plainly teſtifie, No, we cannot own you to be Miniſters of
Chriſt, nor ſent of him, for we know the contrary, becauſe
you are different and contrary to the Miniſters of Chriſt that
were in the dayes of the Apoſtles, in Call, in Practice, and
Converſation; in Maintenance, and in your Fruits and Effects;
in all theſe things we ſay, and can prove, that you are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording,
but different and contrary to the Apoſtles and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the true Churches before the Apoſtacy; and therefore
I hereby certifie you, That we (to wit) the People of God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Quakers,</hi> do not own you as the Miniſters of Chriſt, but
do look upon you to be Deceivers and falſe Teachers, and of
Antichriſt, and your fruits and works doth manifeſt it, and
thereby do we know you not to be the Miniſters of Chriſt, but
falſe Teachers, as I have ſaid.</p>
               <p>And whereas you affirmed your ſelves to be Miniſters of
Chriſt, and went about to prove it by your Arguments of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
Logick, and the ſubſtance and intent of your firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
was, <hi>Thoſe that have the Characters and Signs upon them
ſpoken of in 1 Tim. 3. are Miniſters of Chriſt; but you have thoſe
Signs and Characters upon you, and therefore, You are Miniſters
of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now this Scripture which you have mentioned
for proof of your Miniſtry, when you are truly laid
to the line and meaſure thereof, will prove that you
are not true Miniſters, for you are not thus qualified in your
Spirits and Converſation, as this Scripture doth ſignifie, but
the contrary fruits and effects doth appear from you, then is
ſet down in this Scripture; Are you blameleſs in your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations?
And are you ſober and of good behaviour, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Hoſpitality, and apt to teach? And are you not given
to Wine and filthy Lucre? And are you patient, not brawlers
nor covetous? And are you not lifted up with pride? And
are you of good report? And do you hold the myſterie of
faith in a pure conſcience? Theſe things were required to be
in the Miniſters of Chriſt; and have you theſe characters? and
are you ſuch as is here ſpoken of? And have you theſe fruits
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100966:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and marke upon you? now are you to be tried, and and I am
ſearching your own proof, whether it holds ſound to confirm
that for which you brought it? No it is manifeſt by your
fruits according to your own proof, that you are men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
generation, and are bringing forth fruits and works clean
contrary to them, whom the Apoſtle allows of for Miniſters;
For you are not blameleſſe, nor ſober, nor of good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
for you are guilty of the pride and vanity of this world,
and live in envy and bitterneſſe, and ſo not blameleſſe, nor
ſober, nor of good behaviour, neither apt to teach; for you
want the Spirit, that was in the Apoſtles, and you cannot
ſpeak as that Spirit gives you utterance, but you ſpeak from
humane ſtudy, and what you have gathered from other mens
works, and many of you are given to wine and ſtrong drink,
and are greedy of filthy lucre, and ſue men at Law for wages,
and remove from one place to another for more means, and
for greater hire, and this is covetouſneſſe and greedineſſe of
filthy lucre, which you (to wit, genrally the Prieſts) are known
to be guilty of through the whole Land; and ye have an ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
to be covetous men, and proud men, and ambitious,
and ſelf-ſeeking men, this report you have of many that are
without, and the poore unconverted people they know you to
be guilty of theſe things; and your Conſciences are not pure,
neither do ye hold the myſterie of faith in it; but your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are defiled with the evil and ſinfull practiſes of this
wicked world; and that faith that you profeſſe is not the true
faith that the Apoſtles had, which gave them victory over the
world, and over all ſinne; for you are in the pollutions of the
world, unſanctified, and the guilt of ſinne lies upon you; theſe
things are true, as the Witneſs in your own conſciences may

you do not agree with the Apoſtles, but are different
and contrary to them, and are according to the falſe Teachers,
and falſe Apoſtles, and with them you do agree in ſpirit and
in practice in many things.</p>
               <p>And as to your call to the Miniſtry, you are not able to make
any good proof thereof at all, nor did not at that time,
but ſome of them did deny, that the anointing, the unction
of the holy Spirit, was neceſſary unto the Miniſtry; and this
was the Argument, That all things were mentioned for the
qualification of a Miniſter, in that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. but the holy uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not mentioned; therefore, <hi>the unction of the ſpirit is not
neceſſary to the Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Something was ſpoken to this before, as to ſhew the
ignorance of it, and the wickedneſſe of this Argument; and
ſome of you were partly aſhamed of it your ſelves; and had
not the man and you been vvholly ignorant and blind, this
would never have proceeded from amongſt you; and are you
like to be Miniſters of Chriſt, who hath aſſerted, That the
ſpirit of God, and the anointing is not neceſſary to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry?
Was ever the like ignorance uttered by any before you?
even your Fathers, the Friars at <hi>Rome</hi> would be aſhamed of you
herein, to utter ſuch dark and ignorant aſſertions. Is this your
Learning, and your wiſe Logick, to prove the anointing unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the miniſtry? and ſuch miniſters we believe are you
that have not the holy unction of the ſpirit, but are miniſters
of the letter, and by the will of man, and not by the ſpirit,
nor of the ſpirit, and ſo your call is not the ſame as was the
Apoſtles, but contrary to them and different from them; ſo
that we cannot own you to be miniſters of Chriſt; for ye are
different and contrary to them both in your call, and in your
converſations.</p>
               <p>And though you ſeemed to deny to be made miniſters by
your Learning and Education, yet it is manifeſt that through
that, you received the miniſtry, through the attainments of
ſuch Arts and Sciences, and at laſt you came to attain to the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100966:17"/>
Office of Miniſters as you ſay; and it was not by the call of the
ſpirit, nor by the gift of the holy Ghoſt, for that you have in
part denied, and ſaith the unction is not neceſſary to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry;
ſo it is but your hypocriſie to deny that you are made
Miniſters by your natural learning; for we know that thereby
onely, and without the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, did you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to that Miniſtry which now you hold, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
ſinners to God, nor turn the wicked from his evil way;
for it anſwers not the teſtimony of God in people, but peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
remains always blind and ignorant under it; and you go
on dreaming for carnal ends unto your ſelves, ſeeking for
your hire, and for your gain, and therefore we do deny that
you are true Miniſters of Chriſt, for you can neither prove
that you are ſo, neither doth your fruits and works prove it,
but the contrary is manifeſt.</p>
               <p>And whereas you further ſaid, <hi>The gift of the holy ſpirit is not
ſufficient to make a Miniſter;</hi> This is alſo your ignorance; for as I
ſaid, they alſo have receiv'd the ſpirit, have received the fruits
thereof; and the Apoſtle ſaith, As every one hath received the
gift of the ſpirit, ſo he may adminiſter of the ſame to another;
&amp; who have received the ſpirit of Chriſt, they are Chriſts; and
if any man have not that ſpirit, ſuch are none of his, but how
full of confuſion are you? I cannot but mind you of it; Some
time you ſay, the Spirit is not neceſſary to the Miniſtry; and
again you ſay, The ſpirit alone is not ſufficient to make a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter;
and here is <hi>Babylons</hi> ſtuff (Confuſion) brought forth by
you her Merchants, and ſuch as theſe hath deceived the ſouls
of men, one ſaying one thing, and others another, and thus
is your kingdom divided, and that is a ſign that it cannot
ſtand, but it muſt fall when the kingdoms of this World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas you affirmed,</hi> One may be called into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
by Chriſt, and yet at the ſame time be under the power of the
Devil, and the ſelf-ſame man at the very ſame time may be a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Chriſt, and yet a Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I cannot but mind you of your ignorance, and return
your words to you again; For a man that is under the power of
the Devil, he is the ſervant of the Devil, and not Chriſts ſervant;
and that man that is a Diſciple of Chriſt, and learns of
him, is a child of God, and not of the Devil; for the Devil is out
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100966:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of truth, and ſo are all that are under his power, but the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Chriſt is in the truth, and learns of Chriſt who is truth;
and though you would ſeem to prove theſe things by <hi>Judas</hi> &amp;
<hi>Peter,</hi> yet as for <hi>Judas</hi> he turned from Chriſt, and againſt him,
and the Devil entered into him, and he loſt the power of God,
and erred from it, and then he was a Devil, and a betrayer of
the juſt; but whilſt he followed Chriſt, and was faithful in his
Miniſtry, he was not a Devil: Neither was <hi>Peter</hi> Satan, he that
was Chriſt's Diſciple; but he that ſavoured the things that was
of man, and not the things of God, and he that denied Chriſt,
he was the Satan; for the Diſciple of Chriſt, and Satan, are two,
and not one; they are contrary, and not the ſame, though you
in your ignorance would make them one; but ye know not of
what ſpirit ye are of, nor whoſe work you are doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas you held it forth,</hi> That you had the fruits of the
ſpirit, becauſe you ſhew forth faith and repentance, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now I did, and do deny that you ſhew forth faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
for your Works doth manifeſt the contrary; And to
prove that you have repentante, you ſay you <hi>deteſt all ſin, and
therefore, &amp;c.</hi> Now this I did, and do deny again, and do aſſert
the contrary, and thus I prove it, Whoſoever breaks the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Chriſt, and acts thoſe things which he cryed wo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
&amp; thoſe things which the holy Prophets cryed againſt,
they do not deteſt all ſin; but thus you do, (to wit) you that
profeſs your ſelves to be Miniſters, you act thoſe things which
Chriſt forbad, &amp; which the holy Prophets cryed againſt. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you do not deteſt all ſin, and ſo have not the fruits and
marks of the Holy Ghoſt upon you, that you act theſe things
that Chriſt forbad, and which the Prophets cryed againſt; it is
plainly manifeſt Chriſt forbad his Miniſters to be called of men
Maſters, but you are called Maſters; &amp; Chriſt cryed wo againſt
them that loved the uppermoſt Rooms, and the chief Seats, &amp;
greetings in the Markets, and theſe things are you guilty of.
And the holy Prophets cryed againſt them that preached for
hire, and divined for money, and againſt them that fed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the fat, and clothed themſelves with the Wool, and
did not feed the flock; and theſe things you are guilty of; and
thus it is manifeſt you do not deteſt all ſin, but lives in it; for
in the fruits and works of the fleſh you do abound, in pride
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100966:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and covetouſneſs, in wrath and bitterneſs, and in many other
things, whereby it is clearly manifeſt that you have not your
own noted ſigns of the holy ſpirit upon you, and ſo we cannot
own you, but muſt deny you to be the Miniſters of Chriſt: And
as for your carriages and proceedings at that Diſpute, they were
not agreeing with the ſpirit of truth, for you were wild, and vain,
and ſcornful, which practices becomes not Chriſts Miniſters: And
why did you run ſo ſoon away? Why had not you longer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for the tryal of all things? Were you afraid to be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that your ſhame ſhould have appeared? Were you hit
upon your ſore, which made you fling away ſo ſuddenly, that
you could not abide any longer. Many things more I had
to have ſpoken, if you had not left us in that manner, which
a ſhame unto your ſelves, and to your companie who uſed
ſuch wildneſs and violence, and laid violent hands upon
me, thruſting me forth, and threatning of us with Conſtables,
and theſe things ought not to have been, nor had you been Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Chriſt would they have been, but your fruits makes
you manifeſt, and by your fruits we know you, as Chriſt hath
told us; for your fruits are the fruits of unrighteouſneſs and not
the fruits of the holy Spirit of the Lord, which fruits are pure
and peaceable, but your fruits are otherwiſe, to wit, the fruits
of the ſpirit of this world that lies in wickedneſs, And whereas
you accuſed us to be <hi>Jeſuites</hi> or ſuch like; theſe were your falſe
accuſations, and we ſee you to be nearer to agreement with the
Jeſuites then we are, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is your Mother, &amp;
from her you have deſcended in your Call and in your Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and in the moſt part of your worſhip and practices, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
come, let's reaſon with you, Had not you (the Profeſſed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of <hi>England)</hi> this way of making Miniſters at Schools and
Colledges, &amp; by natural learning, from the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Was
not ſhe the firſt that inſtituted theſe Colledges, &amp; gave the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to them, and gave all theſe names to Schollers, as Batch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellour
of Arts, and Maſter of Arts, Batchellour of Divinity, and
ſuch like names, which yet remains amongſt you, the originall
of which came from the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> and was firſt ſet up in
<hi>England</hi> by the Whores Authority. Did theſe things come from
the Church of Chriſt, or was there ſuch names amongſt Chriſts
true Miniſters? or have not you received theſe things and wayes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100966:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the Whore, and drunken her cup? this way of making mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
have you had from the Whore of <hi>Rome;</hi> and from whence
had you this way of maintenance in your miniſtry, by Tithes
and gleab-lands, and <hi>Eaſter</hi> reckonings, and ſo much a year
out of your Pariſh? did not all this proceed out of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was not in the day of the Apoſtles, nor practiſed
by Chriſts miniſters, but from the Whore you have had this alſo?
this way of being maintained, and ſuing people at the Law for
your Tithes and for your money, Chriſts miniſters never did
thus, but the Churh of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been the originall of all theſe
things and practiſes; and from whence had you this practice of
ſprinkling infants, and calling it the Baptiſme into the faith, and
into the viſible church? did not this come from <hi>Rome?</hi> and have
not you received it from thence? if there was any ſuch Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Practice amongſt the Apoſtles prove it by Scripture, elſe we
will not believe you, but muſt tell you the originall of this came
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and you have drunken the Whores cup, and been
made drunk thereby; &amp; ſo now when we examine you through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in your wayes and practices, we find you agreeing with the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
in many things; and while you accuſe others your ſelves
are guilty; and now people begins to ſee your ſhame, and you
cannot hide it, for the witneſs is riſen in people, and the ſeed of
God is coming forth, which tramples over and treads down the
falſe church, and all her falſe ordinances and inſtitutions, and
her cup muſt be broken to pieces, and ſhe ſhall no more make the
Nations drunk; and as for you falſe miniſters, though you pray
and preach, and cry againſt Hereſie and Error, and would beg
Laws to ſuppreſſe it, as ye ſay; yet your ſelves are found guilty of
the error, and you want the ſpirit of truth to guide you; and your
own hearts are not cleanſed, and then how can you cleanſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
and that which you call error and hereſie is truth; for your
judgements are corrupted, and your eye is blind, and what you
know, you know naturally, and not by the teachings of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, but by Traditions, and by the words of other men
without you, and the holy anointing in your own ſelves, you
know not; for you have not received it; And whereas you que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
whether the Scriptures were the word of God and the rule
of life I do now anſwer:</p>
               <p>The Scriptures were given forth by the ſpirit of God, and are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100966:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the words of God, &amp; the word was in them that gave them forth,
and Chriſt is that word, and the Scriptures teſtifie of him, &amp; the
Scriptures are not the rule of life, but the ſpirit that gave them
forth, that is the rule to the children of God; for as many as are
the ſons of God are led by the ſpirit of God, and them that walk
according to that rule of the ſpirit peace is upon them, and ſo
it is the ſpirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures; that is,
the rule of life, and not the Scriptures; yet where the ſpirit is
the rule, it leadeth up according to the Scriptures in the
fulfilling of them; and as for ye hypocrites who do profeſs the
Scriptures to be your rule, and yet walks contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
your own rule condemns you, and out of your own mouths
will the Lord judge you. Is the Scripture your rule to preach
for hire, and to have ſo much a year for preaching, and if any
will not pay them to ſue them at the Law, and take their goods
by violence, and to caſt their bodies into priſon? this is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of many miniſters in this nation; but what rule in all the
Scripture have you for theſe things, or vvhat example, ſaving
from the falſe Prophets, falſe Apoſtles? and vvhat rule have you
in all the Scriptures for ſprinkling of infants, and calling it Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
into the faith? and what rule have you to take Tithes? and
are not you hypocrites to profeſſe the Scriptures to be your rule
and yet act theſe things which the Scripture neither gives Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
nor example for, but the rather bears witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt?
but who hath the ſpirit, and walks by that rule, ſees you,
and judges you who are out of the life of the Scriptures, in the
life that is contrary, and with the ſpirit of God are you repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
in all your wayes of darkneſſe and error.</p>
               <p>And whereas you queried concerning the light within, we do

that was it that enlightened every man that cometh into the

which light gives them the knowledge of God, and the
knowledge of you, and all your falſe wayes of error, and brings
men to depart from them all, and to follow the Lord in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and ſo every man is lightened, that they may
believe; and they that believe, and walk in the light ſhall
be ſaved; but they that believe not, but hate the light, ſhall
be condemned, and this is their condemnation, that light
is come into the world and into their hearts; and as for you,
you are but ſhallow men; for you want the knowledge of God,
and truth ſtands over you, though you oppoſe it, and it will
grow to a Mountain, where all the Righteous ſhall be refreſhed;
and the Lord is begun to work in the earth, he hath ſet his hand
to pull down Babylon, and there ſhall not one ſtone be left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another, and all her Merchandiſe ſhall fail, and her ſtrong
holds ſhall be broken down, and all her Merchants ſhall howl
and lament; therefore now conſider it ye Leaders of the people,
the day of the viſitation is now, but it will ſuddenly be ſhut up,
with the night of darkneſs upon you, and you will be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and you can never be healed, you will be ruined, and can
never be revived; This is from a lover of your Souls,</p>

               <p>AND now you Prieſts, the black Clergy of England, who count your ſelves Orthodox
men, ſound, able Miniſters of the Gospell of Chriſt, know and conſider, and let it
be known to, and conſidred by all people, that we ſlander you not, nor do you no wrong in
diſowning you to be the Miniſters of Chriſt, and in comparing you to the black, bloody, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
trait, your mother-Church; nor in comparing you with the falſe Prophets, idle ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beards
of Iſrael, and the deceivers and falſe teachers which crept in, in the days of the
Apoſtles, which ſince hath overſpread the Nations; for if ever there were a company of
Prieſts that were like a troop of robbers, and that murthered with conſent, and that
preached for hire, and divined for money, and that ſought their gain from their quarter,
ſed themſelves with the fat, and cloathed themſelves with the wool, and that cared
not naturally for the flock, but for the fleece, and that taught for filthy lucre, and that
ſaid, Thus ſaith the Lord; when the Lords voice they never heard; and that had ſtolen
then Neighbours words, and that run before they were ſent, and that did not profit the
people at all; I ſay, if ever there was ſuch Prieſts and Teachers, as certainly there was
in the Prophets days, and Apoſtles days, ſuch aſſuredly in thee, oh England, doth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
abouned, as by the fruits in every Conntry, City, Town, and Village moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeareth, in which wickedneſs is grown ſo exceeding high, and the envy &amp; offering
of <hi>Cain,</hi> in prieſts &amp; people is ſo ſtrong, and the Jewiſh blind zeal' ſo fierce, and the cry of the
rude multitude, Away with him, Away with him, ſo loud, loud, and many Pilates
through importunity of the prieſts, and cry of the multitude, ſo ready to deliver the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent

to ſave mens lives, and not to deſtroy them; and better then his Miniſters, whole weapons
were never carnal, as Tucks, Rapiers, Staves and Canes, which hath been the weapons
of thirty Engliſh prieſts already recorded within this ſeven or eight years, who have not
onely incenſed and ſtirred up the Magiſtrates and people to perſecute, but hath ſhed blood,
