            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter to the King.</head>
            <p>LET thy mind Oh King, attend on Reading, Hearing, and <unclear>Inſtruction</unclear> and reject not the Counſel of the Lord ſpoken to thee by his Servants and Hand-maids, but mind it till thou art truly reformed into the way of Truth and Life of him that brings Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on near, thorow the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; which Goſpel is to be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Nations before the end come, though it be Fooliſhneſs to that Wiſdom that ſtands not in the Power and Demonſtration of the Spirit that gives Life and Liberty to the Juſt; for the world by wiſdom knew not God, and it pleaſed him by his infinite Wiſdom thorow the Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Preaching to ſave them that Believe; and this is the infinite Wiſdom of the inviſible wiſe God, who is incomprehenſible and full of Glory; Oh this infinite wiſe God, that founded all things in Wiſdom, and man by his Earthly Knowledge cannot find it out; this is he that hath given unto us a Saviour, him that is the Light to lighten the Gentiles, and to be his Salvation to the ends of the Earth; and all muſt come to the meaſure of him in themſelves, to the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his pure Spirit, which is Truth and Life, that comes to know the depth of the Wiſdom of God; the Myſtery of this Kingdom ſtands not in words, but in power, and demonſtration of the pure Spirit of Life, which Spirit breaths thorow and helps the infirmity of all that truſt to it, and believes in it; and bleſſed are all they that are joyned to it, for it ever lives to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with ſighs and groans that cannot be uttered.</p>
            <p>So dear Friend, if thou wilt be endowed with pure Wiſdom from above, wait in love and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs of mind, to receive the Spirit of Life from God, and that is more than all the World, and will be more comfort to thy ſoul, than all the Dominions that the Earth can afford; for the firſt man is but of the Earth Earthly, but the ſecond is the Lord from Heaven, the quickning Spirit, which Spirit if it be received, is it that works the Reformation, for it is grieved with Evil where ever it meets with it, at home or abroad; &amp; ſo long as Iniquity bears Rule, it ſuffers, &amp; it interceeds unto God from whence it came: Oh dear Friend, that this were deſcended into thy lowermoſt part<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that thou mightſt feel him riſe, and Eternally know the power of his Reſurrection, then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly thou wouldſt ſuffer no Evil to be done in thy Name, nor in thy Nation, and then the fruit of thy Goodneſs would ſpring forth, and thy Glory and Renown ſpread unto the Nations round about thee, and this wholſome Wiſdom would be a Crown of Glory to thee, and as a Royal Diamond in the hand of the Lord thou wouldſt be found, and thy Name would be had in Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance, with ſucceeding Generations; which if thou doſt not mind the Glory of the Lord, and be tender of the birth Immortal, and relieve the Oppreſſed; then thy Name will <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Oh therefore ſeek the Glory of God, and the good of his People, that thy Soul may live and be refreſhed with his vertue; ſo with diligence and ſuffering, wait to know the coming of the juſt One in thy own particular, the manifeſtations of his Eternal Spirit, that thou mayſt anſwer his Love, which muſt be with his own, if ever thou pleaſe him, who thou ſeeſt rents the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from men, and overturns, and will overturn till he come to Reign whoſe Right it is, even them that will fear him, that they may give Glory to his Name.</p>
            <p>So dear Heart, as the Lords Love hath been large unto you, mind the Wiſdom that will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his dear Goodneſs unto you; for it was his Love indeed unto you, and great cauſe you have to remember it, and not to let his Benefits ſlip out of your mind, leſt you forget his Goodneſs which hath been great unto you; for this I can ſay, who am the leaſt of many thouſands, as in the Myſtery and Life of Truth, which reveals the ſecrets of the Lord, that I ſaw and felt in the Spirit that reacheth over Sea and Land, your Coming before you came, and my ſpirit breathed to the Lord for you; and I felt three, and one was a Woman, and that I ſpoke of then, that my ſpirit reached forth unto three; and they ſaid you were three Brethren, but I ſaid that one of the three that I felt was a Woman, and ſtill that did abide with me; and now that you are come, my ſpirit breaths to the Lord, deſiring him to ſubdue that in you, that will not glorifie him, that the Kingdoms may not be rent from you; So mind the fear, and remember how he rent the Kingdoms from <hi>Saul</hi> becauſe of his Diſobedience, and he is the ſame ſtill, holy and pure, and though he wait to be gracious, yet he will not alwayes ſtrive with man, but he will take to him his great Power, and rend the Kingdom from man, and will overturn, overturn, till he come to Reign whoſe Right it is, the <hi>SON</hi> of <hi>Equity</hi> the <hi>KING</hi> of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> So in Love <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">
