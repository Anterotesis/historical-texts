         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>GOod Sugar, which is white, hard, ſolid, and cleare, and of a good ſmell; ought not to be cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, for it will yeeld little or no ſcumme; But for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar which is not cleare, nor hard, ſhall be clarified as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Take (for example) two pound of Sugar, break it and cut it into ſmall pieces, put it into a pan, and poure upon it a pint of water decoction or infuſion to melt it, and while it is a melting, take two whites of egges with the ſhells, and beate them very well together in another pan or baſon, pouring by little and little into it another pint of water or decoction, which being well beaten together with a whiske or little rod; then take the ſugar being melted from the fire, and beate them all together, then put them upon the fire, and when you ſee the ſcumme riſe and it begins to boyle, then take it from the fire, and ſtraine it through the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19574:37"/>
blancket made faſt to the foure corners of the wooden ſquare, with a baſon underneath to receave that which is ſtrained.</p>
                     <p>If the ſaid ſugar being ſtrained ſeeme not to be cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified enough, you may paſſe it againe through the blanket, and ſo you may doe two or three times, but it muſt be done while it is hot.</p>
                     <p>When the ſaid ſugar is faire enough, one need not take the paines to clarifie it for Syrups, &amp;c. but onely at the end of their boyling, take them from the fire and ſcumme it with a ſilver ſpoone, or with a ſpoone with holes you may take of the ſcum.</p>
                     <p>That if you clarifie ſugar, you muſt put for each pound of ſugar a pint of water decoction or infuſion, and one white of an egge with the ſhell; but if the Sugar bee ſoule, you muſt put more of the liquor, and more whites of eggs, according to the dampneſſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>That thoſe ſyrups which are made of Iuices, are made with good white ſugar; as thoſe of Raſpas, Quinces, Mulberries, Cherries, and the like: for if they be often clarified, they looſe their ſtrength and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                     <p>Alſo that to make ſyrup of Lymons, Granates, and others, you muſt have of the beſt ſugar, and it muſt bee boyled to the height as you make your ſugar of Roſes, but if you cannot get that which is very white, you muſt firſt clarifie it, and then boyle it and ſcumme it as is aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>At the end when your ſugar is ſtrained, you muſt not preſſe and ſqueeze the blancket, but let it ſtraine by little and little untill it be all dropt into the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:19574:37"/>For to clarifie Honey, take a pound or two, or the quantity you pleaſe of the beſt Honey; put it into a pan with as much water or other liquor, and put it upon the fire, and when it hath boyld a walme or two, ſtraine it through a ſtrong linnen cloath; and for every two pound of honey take a white of an egge with the ſhell; (as is aforeſaid in the clarification of Sugar) and the ſecond ſtraining ſhall bee boyled to what conſiſtence the Phyſician ſhall ſee fitting.</p>
                     <p>If the honey bee very foule, you muſt put more liquor and whites of egges, as is ſaid of Sugar; Note, that when you ſtraine your honey it muſt bee very hot, but the ſugar ought to coole a little before you paſſe it.</p>

                     <p>THE decoctions and infuſions ought not to bee ſtrained boyling, but halfe cold before they bee paſſed through the ſtrainer or blancket; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, one putteth the white of an egge with the ſhell upon two pound of decoction or infuſion, doing as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Take a white of an egge with the ſhell, and put it into the pan or baſon, and beate it very well with the ſaid whiske or little broome; then put to it halfe a pint of the ſaid decoction or infuſion, beating them very well together; then poure in by little and little the reſt of the ſaid infuſion or decoction, then put it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19574:38"/>
upon the furnace, and when it hath boyled a walme or two that you ſee the durty ſcum riſe, then let it ſtand untill it be halfe cold, and then paſſe it thorow the ſtrainer or blancket.</p>
                     <p>That infuſions and decoctions are paſſed but one time through the blancket, for if they be paſſed any more, they looſe a part of their vertue.</p>

                     <p>And if you will uſe them preſently, you may doe as you make Syrups and other Compoſitions, but if you will keepe them, put them into a double glaſſe, filling the glaſſe almoſt to the necke, then fill up the glaſſe with a little oyle of Olives, and ſtop it, and keepe them in a temperate place.</p>
                     <p>And when you will uſe the foreſaid Iuices, you muſt take a little Cotton, and put into the mouth of the glaſſe to ſucke up the oyle, and your juyce will be cleare and cleane, which you may paſſe through the blancket to make it more clearer.</p>

                     <p>The Syrups ought to bee boyled ſoftly upon the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19574:43"/>
furnace upon a charcoale fire, taking it from the fire when it is boyled, and ſcumming of it with a pierced ſpoone or ſilver ſpoone.</p>
                     <p>When the Syrup beginneth to boyle, the fume will goe out very ſtrong; but when it is boyled or neere being boyled, you ſhall ſee the fume very well dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                     <p>To know better, take a little upon the ſpoone or ſpatule and let it fall, and if it make a thred it is boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                     <p>Alſo in taking a little between the thumbe and one of the fingers it maketh a thred it is enough, or in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little upon a trencher, and it runneth drop by drop and maketh a thred.</p>
                     <p>And when it is boyled, take it from the fire and let it coole in the baſon, then put it into a pot and cover it with a paper full of holes made with a needle, that nothing falleth into it, and when it is cold cover it with a double paper, and keepe it in a temperate place.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19574:75"/>
Arteries, dryed up with Sponges: then you muſt come to the head.</p>
                  <p>The head or Cranium ſhall bee ſawed in two, as you doe in an Anatomie, and the braines and parts ſhall be put into the veſſell with the bowells, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the blood that hath been drawne out of the three bellies; that is, the head, breſt, and belly inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and put them altogether into a barrell, and hoope it round, to be buried or put into the ground; but if they deſire to carry them far, or to keep them you may embalme them as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Having emptied and ſqueezed the blood from the excrements, you muſt waſh them with warme oxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat, made with foure parts of water, and one of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger compounded, as ſhall be written hereafter: then powder them all about with one of the balming pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders hereafter written, then put them into a barrell pitcht within and without, and hoope the barrell well, and then wrappe it round with Ceare-cloth and cord it faſt, then put it into a bigger barrell alſo pitcht and hoopt, and ſend it whither you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>The head, breſt, and belly inferiour being alſo emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied and cleanſed, you ſhall begin to embalme them: beginning at the head being well waſhed within with the ſaid vineger compounded, then with pieces of Cotton ſoaked in the ſaid vineger and filled with balme, the head ſhall be filled, and both the pieces of the skull ſhall bee bound together with thred.</p>
                  <p>Doe alſo to the breſt as you doe to the head, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Muſcles and fleſh with a bodkin, to make the blood runne out, which you muſt dry up with ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then waſh and ſoake it with the ſaid vineger, and

fill it up with Cotten full of Balme, do ſo alſo to the belly inferiour.</p>
                  <p>The foreſaid parts being embalmed, you muſt make long Inciſions in the armes, legges, thighes, and buttocks, and principally in the great veines and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, to make the blood runne out, and to dry them up with Sponges; then ſoake them with the ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, and ſtop them full of pieces of Cotton filled with Balme.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall make an Inciſion from the ſhoulder to the wriſt in the arme, piercing it with a bodkin to the bone all about, to make way for the blood, then dry it up with ſponges, and waſh and ſoake it well with the ſaid vineger, and then filling it with pieces of Cotton ſoaked in the ſaid vineger and filled with Balme, and then ſowe it up with a needle and thred; ſo doe to the thighes making an inciſion from the belly to the knee, piercing of it, and ſtoping and ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it up as before, and ſo the knees and others.</p>
