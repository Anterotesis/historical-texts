            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

unto any <hi>Adult</hi> Perſon, tho' Elected to his <hi>actual</hi> Juſtification,
before he is Actually, or Perſonally United to Jeſus Chriſt; aud therefore
not in Actual Union with Chriſt and Juſtified from Eternity, as ſome ſay;
nor from the Death of Chriſt as others ſay:</p>
            <p>3. He ſtedfaſtly Believes, God's Election of particular Perſons from
Everlaſting, for whom he gave his own Son to Die: And that the
Election of the Father, the Redemption of the Son, and the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Sanctification of the Holy Ghoſt, are of Equal extent.</p>
            <p>4. That Chriſt Dyed as the great <hi>Repreſentive, common Head, Root,</hi>
and <hi>Surety</hi> of all the <hi>Elect,</hi> doing and Suffering in their Room and Stead;
whatſoever he did and Suffered <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as their Head and Repreſentative; and
that he hath made full Satisfaction to the Juſtice of God, and anſwered
all the demands of the Law for them: So that all they for whom
Chriſt dyed, ſhall certainly be Saved, as an act of Juſtice, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouineſs,
as well as an Act of Sovereign Grace and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>5. That Faith, by which the Soul apprehends Chriſt is a
Grace of the Spirit, purchaſed by Chriſt, and freely given to us as
a ſign of God's Eternal Love.</p>
            <p>Moreover he and we with him, diſtinguiſh, or explain Union with
Chriſt, and <hi>Juſtification</hi> thus;</p>
            <p>1. That all the Choſen of God are Decretively Juſtified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from
Eternity.</p>
            <p>2. Vertually at the Death, or rather at the Reſurrection of our bleſſed
Saviour.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Yet that no Adult Elect Perſon is really and Actually in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion
with Chriſt, and Actually Juſtified before he doth Believe in him:</hi>
And ſo is tranſplanted out of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> as a common Head, and
implanted into the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> It being impoſſible any ſhould ſtand
in (or grow out of) two cwo common Roots at one and the ſame time;
ſince all (as conſidered Actually in the firſt) are Dead and under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
and all that are Actually in the Second are made Alive and
brought into Juſtification, and declared free for ever from <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

is none of his.</hi> That is Actually his, tho' many of them may be in the
Election of Grace.</p>
            <p>As touching the Sins of the Elect before Faith, we ſay they are
charged upon them by the <hi>Law,</hi> under which they remain till they
Believe, or are United by the Spirit, unto their bleſſed Covenanting
Head; and are by the ſame Law with other Unbelievers, under the
Sentence of Condemnation, tho' their Juſtification, Pardon, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

Faith hath a twofold Uſe; Firſt by God's Ordination, as it apprehends
and receives Chriſt 'tis ſaid to Juſtifie us; and by its own Spiritual Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
it Rennovates and Sanctifies us.</p>
            <p>I muſt Confeſs, by reading ſome Paſſages in Mr. <hi>Ayre's</hi> Treatiſe,
and that paſſage of Mr. <hi>Davis,</hi> mentioned in this Narrative,
I cannot ſee that theſe Men, by all the Noiſe they make about
<hi>Juſtification</hi> before <hi>faith,</hi> that 'tis anything more than that which we call a
<hi>decretive</hi> and <hi>Vertual</hi> Juſtification: So that it appears, 'tis but about
ſtrife of Words that theſe poor People made that <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the Church
at <hi>Kilby:</hi> Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Elect are dead in Traſpaſſes and
Sins, and under the declared condemnation of the Law and Goſpel, till
they Believe, and then, and only then, they are freed from Condemnation;
which I take</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to be actual Juſtification by faith: And that he
will ſtand by the Aſſemblies deſinition of Juſtifying faith! and that the
Moral Law holds the Elect, during their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregeneracy, under tis condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Force till they believe.</hi> I would know, what is it we ſay more or
leſs? Why then does this man make this Stir, and Diviſion in Churches?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Ayre</hi> ſaith <q>Juſtification actively Conſidered, as it is in God (who
is the Juſtifier) was Compleat and Perfect, before we had a being;
and in this Senſe, Faith is not the Inſtrument of it,</q> and Dr. <hi>Twiſſes</hi>
(whom he Quotes) ſaith, <q>It was ours before we Believe in reſpect of
right, becauſe of the intention of the Father and the Son—tho' not
in Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment.</q>

               </gap> our right to <hi>Juſtification</hi> in reſpect of
God's Decree and Intention before we were born; nor of that Vertual
right in Chriſt, as our head, and Repreſentative at his reſurrection: Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe men fight only with their own Shaddows; for what is this to an
actual and perſonal right? Can men be actually Juſtified before they
have a perſoual and actual Being? 'Tis enough that our right is ſecured
for us in Chriſr, and ſhall in time be actually conveyed and Applied to us.</p>

            <p>Take what the Reverend Mr. <hi>Tho. Cole</hi> delivered at <hi>Pinners-Hall,July</hi> 21.
1696. He ſaid, <q>The Marriage Bond between us and Chriſt, is on Chriſt's
part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Faith on ours; by which the Spirit Unites the Soul
to Chriſt: There can be no Union without Faith; nor no Faith without
Union: for it (that is the Spirit) works both, and brings in a Comfortable
hope of Pardon, from that full Satisfaction, made by Chriſt to the Law
and Juſtice of God; ſo redeeming ns from the Curſe of the Law, and
ſetting us at Liberty.</q>

ſoon as he hears his Surety has diſcharg'd his Debt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Among Men the Debter finds the Surety, and ſo may in point
of Juſtice, demand his Diſcharge; but there is a great difference here, ſeeing
God found our Surety, not we: therefore, tho' what he did was in our
Stead and Room: Yet we having all in a way of Sovereign Grace, as
well as in a way of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs; the Father and Son might
in that Eternal Compact between them Both, agree how, and when we
ſhould have the Benefit of Chriſt's Merits, and actual intereſt in him;
and ſo be Juſtified; which no Adnlt Perſon hath until he Believes, or
receives the Spirit the Bond of that Union. We muſt not ſay with the
beforementioned <hi>David Culy, That we may go to God with holy Impudence,
and ſay, Father! put off thy Righteouſneſs? for it is mine.</hi> Are not theſe
ſtrange Expreſſions? As if we were Juſtified by the Eſſential Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God: Yea, by the Righteouſneſs of the Father; and may De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it with holy Impudence; or rather unholy Impudence.</p>
            <p>I'll add no more but this one thing; I deſire thoſe Perſons, who are
ſo fond of this Notion, would Conſider, What profitable Uſe can be
made of Juſtification before Faith: Alſo know that, That Doctrin that
hath no profitable Improvement to be made of it, but many Abſurdities to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, is not a Truth of Chriſt: [But ſo it is here; <hi>Ergo</hi>] But Sad it is that

            </p>
            <p>3. You ſay I ſaid, from 2. Cor. 5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt,
he is a New Creature.</hi> That it was not <hi>Election,</hi> nor the <hi>Purpoſe</hi>
of God, which cauſed us to be in Chriſt; but being <hi>Formed</hi> of God,
<hi>Regenerated,</hi> and <hi>Born again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55801:11"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> In this you wrong me; for I never thought that <hi>Election,</hi> or
the <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of God, was no cauſe at all of our being in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but
I have often Affirmed, That our <hi>Election,</hi> and the Purpoſe of God,
is the Efficient and Antecedent cauſe of our being in Chriſt: For we
were <hi>Elected</hi> from <hi>Eternity,</hi> but our Ingrafting into <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in Time,
or elſe, How could we be ſaid to be out of Chriſt before calling?
Alſo, How could <hi>Junia</hi> and <hi>Andronicus</hi> be in <hi>Chriſt</hi> before <hi>Paul?</hi>
Rom. 16. 7. And the <hi>Epheſians</hi> be ſaid to be ſometimes without
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> Epheſ. 2. 12. That at that time you were without <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
yet <hi>Paul's,</hi> and the <hi>Epheſians Election,</hi> took place as ſoon as <hi>June</hi>'s
and <hi>Andronicus.</hi> (2.) If we were in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as ſoon as we were <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,</hi>
then we could not be Guilty of <hi>Original Sin</hi> when we came
into the World; for there is no <hi>Condemnation</hi> to them that are in
<hi>Chriſt; Rom.</hi> 8. 1. But it is Evident, that by <hi>Adam's Sin, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
came upon <hi>all</hi> Men to <hi>Condemnation; Rom,</hi> 5. 18. And all
the <hi>World,</hi> as they ſtand in the firſt <hi>Adam, all</hi> are <hi>Guilty</hi> before
God, <hi>Rom,</hi> 3. 19. So that it is for want of Diſtinguiſhing between
<hi>Election</hi> as the fore-runner of our being in Chriſt and our Actual
being in him that cauſeth your Miſtakes: As for the <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of God
it will be more cleared up, by what I ſhall ſay upon this Point. Gods
<hi>Purpoſe</hi> in it's own Nature, cannot be the immediate Actual doing of the
thing Purpoſed, but the Purpoſe of Neceſſity muſt be Antecedent
to the thing Purpoſed, or elſe the <hi>Purpoſe</hi> is Deſtroyed: And ſo God
<hi>Purpoſed</hi> to <hi>make</hi> the <hi>World</hi> from Eternity, but the <hi>World</hi> was not
<hi>made</hi> from Eternity, but in time; So God <hi>Purpoſed</hi> to <hi>call</hi> a certain
Number into the Fellowſhip of his <hi>Son,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 9. And hence Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are ſaid to be called <hi>According to his Purpoſe, Rom.</hi> 8. 28.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. So that it is evident, That God's <hi>Purpoſe</hi> was Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to our <hi>Calling,</hi> or elſe it could not be ſaid, <hi>We were called
according to his Purpoſe.</hi> So that from hence I conclude, That a
Man may be in the <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of God, and yet at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
be no <hi>New Creature,</hi> and ſo not in Chriſt; <hi>For if any Man
be in Chriſt he is a New Creature.</hi> And to ſay, that any Man is
in Chriſt before he is a <hi>New Creature,</hi> is to give the <hi>Text</hi> the <hi>Lye,</hi>
and to deſtroy the Doctrine of Chriſt about Regeneration; and to
ſuppoſe a Perſon may be in Chriſt, and not Regenerate, this muſt of
Neceſſity run you into a deſparate Abſurdity on the Right-Hand,
or the Left: For if you ſay, a Perſon may be <hi>in</hi> Chriſt
and not <hi>Regenerated,</hi> then a Perſon may be <hi>Saved</hi> and not <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated:</hi>
This is to give Chriſt the Lye, who ſaid, <hi>Except a Man be</hi>
Born again <hi>he cannot</hi> enter <hi>into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And if
you ſay a Man may be <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, and not Regenerated, and ſo not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55801:11"/>
               <hi>Capable to Enter</hi> into the Kingdom of God, then a Man may be

the Goſpel, to convince ſinners of their ſins, which is contrary to
that is ſaid, <hi>The Spirit ſhall Convince the World of ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer. That the <hi>Law</hi> doth convince of <hi>ſin</hi> is evident, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
7. 7. and <hi>Romans,</hi> 1. 3. 19. That Sin is the Tranſgreſſion
of the <hi>Law</hi> is as plain, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 4. Thus, by the Scripture
it is Undeniable that the <hi>Law</hi> convinces Sinners of <hi>Sin;</hi> and that it
might to be Preached, I Prove
<list>
                  <item>1. From the Doctrin of <hi>Repentance;</hi> and</item>
                  <item>2. From the Prophets and Apoſtles Practice.</item>

1. From the Doctrin of Repentance, I Argue thus; That if the
Doctrin of <hi>Repentance</hi> ought to be Preached every were, then they
that Preach the Doctrin of <hi>Repentance</hi> to the People, muſt firſt tell
them what they muſt Repent off: But the Doctrin of <hi>Repentance</hi> ought
to be every were Preached, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. Therefore thoſe that
Preach to the People muſt firſt acquaint the People with what they
ought to Repent off; if there is no <hi>Law</hi> to be Preached, then there
is no ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. And if there is no <hi>Law</hi> to be Preached, then
there are no Sinners, and then alſo there is no need of Repentance,
nor no need of a Mediator: Therefore the <hi>Law</hi> muſt firſt be Preached
to <hi>Sinners,</hi> to make them ſenſible of <hi>Sin,</hi> and of their Undone Eſtate by
reaſon of <hi>Sin,</hi> that they may Know the Want, Worth, and Neceſſity
of a Saviour; for the <hi>Law,</hi> all Grant, is not to be Preached to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
for any ſuch End, becauſe they are not <hi>under the Law, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Grace. Rom</hi> 6. 14. Therefore I Conclude, That the <hi>Law</hi> ought
to be Preached firſt to ſinners for the Conviction of Sin; and</p>
            <p>2. I prove that the <hi>Law</hi> ought to be Preached firſt to Sinners for
the Conviction of Sin, from the Practice of the Prophets, and Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and for this I ſhall give ſome Inſtances; ſee the 2 <hi>Sam. 12. Nathan</hi>
Convinceth <hi>David</hi> of his Sin in the matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> by a Parable of
one that had broken the <hi>Law,</hi> by Covetting and taking of another's
<hi>Ewe-Lamb;</hi> and when <hi>David</hi> was Convinced, he ſaid, <hi>I have Sinned</hi>
ver. 13. Then the Prophet Preached the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to him; ſaying, <hi>The
Lord hath put away thy Sin, thou ſhalt not Dye.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> admits of no
Remiſſion, but, <hi>That Soul that Sins ſhall Die.</hi> So in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
Preached <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> to the People in the former part of
the Chapter, and then afterwards Preacheth the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> Ver. 12,
13, 14. So in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 41. 18. When they were under Conviction
of Sin by the <hi>Law.</hi> then the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was Preached to them; v. 20.
Moreover, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> Preached <hi>firſt</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> to the <hi>Jews,
Acts</hi> 2. 23. Compared with Verſe. 36. And when they were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of their <hi>Murder,</hi> which was the Breach of the <hi>Law,</hi> then
he Preached the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to them; Verſe. 38, 39. I might give you
many more <hi>Inſtances:</hi> alſo I might ask you, To whom do you Preach the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> if not to Sinners? and if the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is Preached to Sinners,
it Implyes the Law; for, how can they be Sinners if the Law be
Deſtroyed: <hi>Where there is no</hi> Law <hi>there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi> Deſtroy
the Law and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is dead in Vain; <hi>For Chriſt came to Redeem thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55801:12"/>
that were under the Law, Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. We and all Men while in Uubelief, are in the Fleſh and cannot
pleaſe God, <hi>Rom. 8. 8. Heb.</hi> 11. 6. What in Union with Chriſt, and
yet at the ſame time cannot pleaſe God? Whilſt we are in Unbelief, we are
all Children of Wrath, our Natures being Corrupted by the Sin of our
firſt Parents, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 3. Condemed. John 3. 18. And the Wrath of
God abiding on all.</hi> John 3. 36. And yet for all this United to
Chriſt. 3. Whilſt in Unbelief we are in a ſtate of Enmity, being in the
Carnal Mind: <hi>Rom. 8. 7. Aliens &amp; Enemies in our Minds by wicked Works,</hi>
Colloſſ. 1. 21. <hi>Haters of God, Rom.</hi> 1. 30. What, cannot we pleaſe God?
What, under a ſtate of Wrath, Aliens and Enemies againſt God, and
yet in Union with, and United to Chriſt at the ſame time? What,
Strange Doctrin is this? and how contrary to the Scriptures. Thus I
come to make enquiry into the Nature of Union.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A Conjugal Union is an Agreement of two Perſons together, by
which they Twain become One Fleſh; and as Conjugal Union muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
firſt from one Party, which commonly is the Man, his Affections goes
out after the Woman he ſeeks to make his Wife, he Sues for her Love
by Arguments and Gifts; yet here is no Union till ſhe Conſents,
and is Actually United to him in her Affection, and is Joined to him,
and he to her, by God's Appointment and Ordinance This is the
true ſtate of Union: The Application is eaſie. God and Chriſt have a Love
of good Will and Affection for the Elect whilſt they are Enemies; and from
that Love they Invite, Woo and Beſeech poor Sinners to be Reconciled
and United</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 20. <hi>by their Miniſters;</hi> verſe 18. And this is
looked upon as done by the Father and the Son; <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. And to the
end they may be Reconciled, he gives to them the Gift of Repentance;
<hi>Acts 5. 31. and the</hi> 11. 18. And the Gift of Faith, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 8. Phil.</hi>
1. 22. To the end that all things may be of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 18. To
the exaltation of free Grace, and through the hearing of the Word of
Reconciliation the Holy Spirit is given, <hi>Gal. 3. 2. 5. Acts</hi> 10. 44<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
By which they are joined to the Lord in a Perpetual Covenant, that
ſhall not be forgotten, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4. 5. Thus being joined to the Lord,
they become one Spirit with the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. And by this
are Married to Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. And this is their actual Union with
Christ, they being Reconciled to him, as well as he being Reconciled to
them: <hi>But can this be when we are</hi> Strangers to the Covenant of
Promiſe, Aliens from the Common-Wealth of Iſrael, and without Christ,

had ſaid, Faith is the effect of Love, you had ſaid True: But I ſay,
ſaith is the Bond of Union on our part; moreover, there may be
love in one Party where there is no Union; Union is a mutual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of both Parties, by which both Parties are joined together
more than in Love and Affection. The Lord open the Eyes of your

            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this I ſhall give you my Judgment in the Words of
two <hi>Authors,</hi> one in great Eſteem with yourſelves, and that is that
<hi>Worthy</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> Divine Dr. <hi>Goodwin;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Davis.</hi> Dr.
<hi>Tho. Goodwin</hi> upon <hi>Epheſ.</hi> page 296. Part 2. States this Queſtion:</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> How are we Saved in Chriſt, and Juſtified in
Chriſt upon Believing, when we were Juſtified from our Sins in
Chriſt, when he Roſe, and had Sin taken off from him? Did
not he repreſent us then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Anſwer is as followeth:</hi> To inſtance <hi>Adam</hi> will clear all;
Were not all men Condemned in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet no man is Condemned
in his own Perſon till he is Born; yet Repreſentively in <hi>Adam</hi> all
<hi>Dyed:</hi> So it is here, ſo far as we take Chriſt as a Common Perſon
Repreſenting us; what was done in him, was done for us in him;
and ſo from Eternity: Before Chriſt Dyed we were Saved in him in
that Senſe, according to the Grace that was given us in Chriſt before
the World began; Saith he in 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. Chriſt himſelf Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it, with a Reſerve till we did Believe and Repent, or elſe we are
not to have that Benefit of his Death: The Bond lay in God the
Father's hand, till we ſhould come in to him for it. I do not ſay
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55801:14"/>
the Scripture uſeth the Word from Everlaſting, but only that the
Grace was given us in Chriſt; and Chriſt dyed Repreſentively;
but when we come to Exiſt in our own Perſons, then it is applyed to
us, and we are Saued in our own Perſons, by that Grace which
once Jeſus Chriſt purchaſed as a common Perſon for us.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus far Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> where you may ſee the very Thing you
Charge me with as Error, prov'd to be a Truth in plain Words, by this
<hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Learned,</hi> Divine, that no man could, or did find Fault with
as ever I could hear of: You may ſee your Fooliſh and Unſound
Notions laid down, and proved to be Falſe by this <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Judicious</hi>
Man, in the ſecond Part of his <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Page
144. 135. 294. <hi>ſo on,</hi> and in divers Places in that Book.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Davis,</hi> in his Vindication againſt the <hi>Rowel</hi> Pamphlet, Saith;
<q>I do not ſee what need there is of all this Noiſe about Words,
as I have conſtantly Preached and Affirmed, That Elect Sinners
are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins; and under the declared Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> till they Believe; and that then, and
only then, they are freed from that Condemnation, which I take to
be actual Juſtification by Faith. <hi>And he further adds,</hi> That he
ſhall ſtand by the Aſſembly's Definition of juſtifying Faith.</q>
And in 24. <hi>Artic.</hi> of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Davis</hi>'s <hi>Confeſſion of Faith;</hi> he
Saith, <hi>That the Moral Law holds the Elect during their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
under it's Condemning force till they Believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Davis:</hi> Thus you ſee the Man you ſo much admire,
is of my Mind. But to Proceed, The Elect are dead in Treſpaſſes
and Sins, and under the declared Condemnation of Law and Goſpel
till they Believe; and that then, and not till then they are freed from
that Condemnation. If the <hi>Moral Law</hi> holds the Elect during their
Unregeneracy under its Condemning force till they Belieue, what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
have they, while in Unbelief, ſave only they are ſecured from
the Execution of that Condemnation, by the gracious Purpoſe of God,
and Merits of Jeſus Chriſt? To which Words I gave my Aſſent, and
ſince have ſet my Hand to the ſame: Tho' you refuſed it, and ſome
of thoſe that did, and eſpecially <hi>Benjamin Winckles,</hi> who was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the firſt General <hi>Aſſembly</hi> with me, and ſince hath with me
and others ſet his Hand to the ſame Words; but after all this, is
ſhamefully gone off from his firſt and ſecond Act. I have Proved by
theſe two Authors, That there is no actual Benefit conveyed to the
Elect, whilſt in Unbelief.</p>
