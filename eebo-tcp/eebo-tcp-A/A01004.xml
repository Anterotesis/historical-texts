            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A course which pleased much the common people in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, persuading them that they had been blinded and wronged by the Pope, taking from them, together with the vse of Scriptures, their authority to iudge definitions of the Church by Scriptures. The deuisers of this way seemed to haue great zeale of the truth, but were not carefull to prouide for peace. And so in practise this deuise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got a multitude of Sects and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one against another, that many, weary of all, began to thinke it were better men should be vnited in error, then thus mortally diuided in Truth.</p>

               <p>And if this proposition, <hi>the Pope hath no power to depose the King,</hi> which is the foundation of all the other partes in the Oath, be sworne as probable, vpon better aduise changeable, who seeth not that the whole frame of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance that is built thereon, is left to the arbitrement of the swearer, and that by <hi>VViddringtons</hi> doctrine the drift of the Oath, to make his Maiesty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, is ouerthrowne. I add hereunto that if the Oath be satisfied with a probable persuasion that the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depose the King; then the Oath leaues liberty to the Papist that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7386:56"/>
sweares, to follow with safe cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience the contrary in practise, seeing they may, by comon consent of their Deuines, follow what probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they please: yea they may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out synne follow that opinion which they themselues thinke lesse probable. Which is to be vnderstood when the Authors that allow the speculation of a doctrine, doe not themselues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the practise therof, as somtimes they do, because the doubtfullnes of the speculation makes the practise cleerly against Charity or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Iustice, as in the instances that <hi>VViddrington</hi> brings in his last reply. But no instance can he giue when both speculation and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise is allowed as probable by graue authors, that then Papists may not follow the same with a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. And such is the doctrine, that the Pope may depose Kings, their schooles that allow the specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, condemne not the practise. Yf then <hi>VVidrington</hi> taking the oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance may without breach of his Oath thinke the contrary doctrine,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7386:57"/>
that the Pope may depose Kings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, he may with the Oathes good leaue, by the principles of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, also follow that doctrine in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise: so that swearers vpon probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I conclude, that either we tender the new Oath to no purpose, or els we vrge men further then in conscience they can sweare.
