            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Delivered
At a Conference concerning the Power of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
to proceed againſt their KING for
MISGOVERNMENT.</p>
            <p>In which is Stated:</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>I.</hi> That Government by blood is not by Law of Nature, or Divine, but only by humane and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Laws of every particular Common-wealth, and may upon juſt cauſes be altered.</item>
               <item>II. The particular forme of Monarchies and Kingdomes, and the different Laws whereby
they are to be obtained, holden, and governed in divers Countries, according as each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
hath choſen and eſtabliſhed.</item>
               <item>III. The great reverence and reſpect due to Kings, and yet how divers of them, have been
lawfully chaſtiſed by their Parliaments and Common-wealths for their miſgovernment, and
of the good and proſperous ſucceſſe that God commonly hath given to the ſame.</item>
               <item>IV. The lawfulneſſe of proceeding againſt Princes: what intereſt Princes have in their
Subjects goods or lives: how Oathes do binde, or may be broken by Subjects towards their
Princes: and finally the difference between a good King and a Tyrant.</item>
               <item>V. The Coronation of Princes, and manner of their admitting to their authority, &amp; the Other
which they doe make in the ſame, unto the Common-wealth for their good Government.</item>
               <item>VI. What is due to onely Succeſſion by birth, and what intereſt or right an Heire apparent
hath to the Crown, before he is Crowned or admitted by the Common-wealth, and how juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he may be put back, if he have not the parts requiſite.</item>
               <item>VII. How the next in ſucceſſion by propinquity of blood, have often times been put back by
the Common-wealth, and others further off admitted in their places, even in thoſe Kingdoms
where ſucceſſion prevaileth, with many examples of the Kingdomes of <hi>Iſrael, &amp; Spaine.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>VIII. Divers other examples out of the States of <hi>France and England,</hi> for proofe that
the next in blood are ſometimes put back from ſucceſſion, and how God hath approved the
ſame with good ſucceſſe.</item>
               <item>IX. What are the principall points which a Common-wealth ought to reſpect in admitting or
excluding their King, wherein is handled largely alſo of the diverſity of Religions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <head>The firſt Speech.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Examples of a mad or furious Heir apparent, or of one that were by
Education a Turke or Moor in Religion, or by Nature deprived of his
Wit or Senſes, do plainly prove that propinquity of Birth or Bloud
alone, without other circumſtances, is not ſufficient to be preferred to
a Crown; for that no Reaſon or Law, Religion or Wiſedom in the World, can
admit ſuch Perſons to the Government of the Common-wealth by whom no
good, but deſtruction may be expected to the ſame, ſeeing that Government
was ordeined for the benefit of the Weal-publique, and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And though ſome in theſe our Dayes have affirmed the contrary, and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame in writing for the defence, flattery, or advancement of the Prince
they favour, affirming that even a fool, mad or furious man, or otherwiſe ſo
wicked as he would endeavour to deſtroy the Common-wealth, were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Seat Royal, without further conſideration, if he be next in Bloud;
yet this is manifeſtly agaiſt all reaſon and conſcience, and againſt the very firſt
end and purpoſe of inſtitution of Common-wealths, and Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>Hereof it doth enſue, that ſome other Conditions alſo muſt needs be requiſite,
for coming to Government by Succeſſion, beſides the onely propinquity or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
in Bloud, and that the Conditions muſt be aſſigned and limited out by
ſome higher Authority than is that of the Prince himſelfe, who is bound and
limited thereby, and yet it ſeemeth evident they are not preſcribed by any Law
of Nature or Divine, for that then they ſhould be both immutable and the ſelfe-ſame
in all Countries, (as God and Nature are one, and the ſame to all, without
change) where notwithſtanding we ſee, that theſe Conditions and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of ſucceeding by Birth, are divers or different in different Countries, as
alſo they are ſubject to changes according to the diverſity of Kingdomes,
Realmes, and People, whereby we are forced to conclude that every particular
Countrey and Common-wealth hath preſcribed theſe Conditions to it ſelfe, and
hath Authority to do the ſame.</p>
            <p>For better proof whereof, it is firſt of all, to be ſuppoſed, that albeit ſociabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or inclination to live together in company, Man with Man, (whereof enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
both City and Common-wealth, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> gathereth in his firſt Book of
Politiques) be of Nature, and conſequently alſo of God, that is Authour of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
though Government in like manner and juriſdiction of Magiſtrates which
do follow neceſſarily upon this living together, in company; be alſo of Nature, yet
the particular Forme or manner of this or that Government, in this or that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
as to have many Governours, few, or one, and thoſe either Kings, Dukes,
Earles, or the like: or that they ſhould have this or that Authority more or leſſe,
for longer or ſhorter time, or be taken by Succeſſion or Election, themſelves and
their Children, or next in Bloud: all theſe things (I ſay) are not by Law either
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115403:3"/>
Natural or Divine, (for then as hath been ſaid, they ſhould be all one in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and Nations, ſeeing God and Nature is one to all) but they are ordained by
particular poſitive Lawes of every Countrey.</p>
            <p>But now that ſociability in Mankinde, or inclination to live in company; is by
Nature, and conſequently ordained by God, for the common benefit of all, is an
eaſie thing to prove: ſeeing that all ground of Realmes and Common-wealths
dependeth of this point, as of their firſt Principle, for that a Common-wealth is
nothing elſe but the good Government, of a Multitude gathered together, to live
in one, and therefore all old Philoſophers, Law-makers, and Wiſe men, that have
treated of Government or Common-wealths, as <hi>Plat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> in his ten moſt excellent
Bookes, which he wrote of this matter intituling them <hi>of the Common-wealth,
Plato de repub. Cicero de repub. Arist. Polit.</hi> And <hi>Marcus Cicero</hi> that famous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
in other ſix Books that he writ of the ſame matter, under the ſame Title.
And <hi>Aristotle</hi> that perhaps excelleth them both, in eight Bookes which is called
<hi>his Politiques,</hi> All theſe (I ſay) do make their entrance to treat of their Common-wealth affaires,
from this firſt Principle, to wit, <hi>That man by Nature is ſociable,
and inclined to live in company:</hi> whereof do proceed firſt, all private Houſes, then
Villages, then Townes, then Cities, then Kingdomes, and Common-wealths.</p>
            <p>This ground and Principle then do they prove by divers evident reaſons, as firſt,
for that in all Nations, never ſo wilde and barbarous, we ſee by experience that
by one way or other, they endeavour to live together, either in Cities, Townes,
Villages, Caves, Woods, Tents, or other like manner, according to the Cuſtome
of each countrey, <hi>Pompon, Mela. lib. 3. cap. 3, 4. Tacit. lib.</hi> 8. which univerſal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
could never be in all, but by impreſſion of Nature it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they prove the ſame, by that the uſe of ſpeech is given to Man for
this end and purpoſe; for that little available were this priviledge of ſpeaking, if
Men ſhould live alone, and converſe with none, <hi>Arist. l. 1. pol. c.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, not onely <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> but <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> alſo <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and others do
confirme the ſame, <hi>Theoph. lib. de Plaut. Plutarch. Com. de fortuna, &amp; lib. de pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
in parent.</hi> by the poor eſtate and condition, wherein Man is borne, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
than any other creature, though by creation hee bee Lord and Governour
of all the reſt; for whereas each other creature is borne in a certaine ſort
armed and defended in it ſelfe, as the Bull with his hornes, the Boar with his
tuske, the Bear and Wolfe, with their teeth, the Bird with her feathers againſt
cold, and with her wings to flie away, the Hart and Hare with their ſwiftneſſe,
and the like, onely Man is borne feeble and naked, not able to provide or defend
himſelfe in many yeares, but onely by the helpe of others, which is a token that
he is borne to live in company, and to he holpen by others, and this not onely for
his neceſſity and helpe at his beginning whiles he is in this imbecility, but alſo for
his more comodious living in the reſt of his dayes afterwards, ſeeing no Man of
himſelfe is ſufficient for himſelfe, and he that liveth alone can have no benefit of
others, or do any to others; wherefore wittily ſaid <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the ſecond chapter
of his firſt Book of Politiques, <hi>That he which flieth to live in ſociety is</hi> Deus aut
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115403:3"/>
Bellua, <hi>a God or a beaſt: for that</hi> either he doth it becauſe he hath no need of any,
which is proper to God, or elſe for that he will do good to none, and feeleth not
that natural inſtinct, which Man hath to live in converſation, which is a ſigne ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a Beaſt than of a Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> doth adde another reaſon for this purpoſe, to wit, the uſe of certain
principal vertues given unto Man, but principally juſtice and friendſhip, which
ſhould be utterly in vain, and to no utility, if Man ſhould not live in company of
others, for ſeeing the office of juſtice is to diſtribute to every one his own:
where no number is, there no diſtribution can be uſed, as alſo neither any act of
friendſhip, which yet in the ſociety of Man is ſo neceſſary and uſuall, ſaith this
excellent Man, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nec aqua, nec igne, nic ipſo ſole pluribus in locis utamur, quàm
amicitia, Cicero lib. de amîcitiâ.</hi> That we uſe neither water nor fire nor the Sun it
ſelfe in more places or occaſions than friendſhip.</p>
            <p>And to this effect, of uſing friendſhip, love and charity the one towards the
other, do Chriſtian Doctours alſo, and eſpecially <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Book of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
reduce the inſtitution of this natural inſtinct of living in company: <hi>Aug. lib.
de amicitia.</hi> Which ſeemeth alſo to be confirmed by God himſelfe in thoſe words
of <hi>Geneſis, Dixit quoque Dominus Deus; non eſt bonum hominem eſſe ſolum, facia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
ei adjutorium, ſimile ſibi, Gen.</hi> 2. 18. God ſaid, It is not good that Man ſhould
be alone, let us make unto him an helpe or aſſiſtant like unto himſelfe, of which
words is deduced, that as this firſt ſociety of our firſt Parents, was of God, and
for ſo great purpoſe as here is ſet down, the one to be holpen by the other; ſo all
other ſocieties in like manner which grow of this firſt, ſtand upon the ſame
ground of God's Ordination for the ſelfe ſame end of Mans utility.</p>
            <p>And I have beene the longer in ſpeaking of this naturall inſtinct to ſociety, for
that it is the firſt fountaine of all the reſt, that enſueth in a common-wealth: for
of this come, families, villages, townes, caſtles, cities and common-wealthes,
all which <hi>Aristotle,</hi> doth prove to be of nature, for that this firſt inclination to
live to gether (whereof all thoſe other things do ſpring) is of nature.</p>
            <p>Out of this, is the ſecond poynt before mentioned deduced, to wit, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
alſo, ſuperiority, and juriſdiction of magiſtrates, is likewiſe of nature,
for that it followeth of the former, and ſeeing that it is impoſſible for men to
live together with help and commodity of the one, to the other, except there be
ſome Magiſtrate or other to keep order among them, without which order there
is nothing els to be hoped for as Job ſayeth, <hi>but horrour and confuſion, Job. 10. v.</hi>
12. as for example, whereſoever a multitude is gathered tegether, if there bee
not ſome to repreſſe the inſolent, to aſſiſt the impotent, reward the vertnous,
chaſten the outragious and miniſter ſome kind of juſtice and equality unto the
inhabitants: their living together would be farre more hurtfull, then their living
aſunder, for that one would conſume and devour the other, and ſo we ſee, that
upon living together followeth of neceſſity ſome kind of juriſdiction in Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats,
and for that the former is of nature, the other alſo is of nature.</p>
            <p>All which is confirmed alſo by the conſent and uſe of all nations throughout
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115403:4"/>
the world, which generall conſent, <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth, <hi>ipſius vocem naturae</hi> the voice
of nature herſelfe: <hi>Cicero</hi> li. 1. <hi>de natura Deorum,</hi> for there were never yet nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
found either of ancient time or now in our dayes, by the diſcovery of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
or elſe where, among whom men living together, had not ſome kind of
Magiſtrate or ſuperiour, to governe them, which evidently declareth that this
point of Magiſtrates is alſo of nature, and from God that created nature, which
poynt our civill law doth prove in like manner in the very beginning of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts,
where the ſecond title of the firſt booke is, <hi>de origine juris civilis &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
magistratuum, Lib. 1. digest, tit.</hi> 2. of the beginning of the civill law and of
all magiſtrates which beginning is referred to this firſt principle, of naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
and Gods inſtitution: And laſt of all, that God did concurre alſo expreſly
with this inſtinct of nature, our Divines doe prove by cleare teſtimony of holy
ſcripture, as when God ſaith to <hi>Solomon, by me Kings doe reigne, Prov.</hi> 8. and
Paul to the Romans avoucheth, <hi>that authority is not but of God, and therefore he
which reſiſteth authority reſiſteth God, Rom.</hi> 13. Which is to bee underſtood of
authority, power or juriſdiction in it ſelfe, according to the firſt inſtitution, as
alſo when it is lawfully laid upon any perſon, for otherwiſe when it is either
wrongfully taken or unjuſtly uſed, it may be reſiſted in divers caſes, for then it is
not lawfull Authority.</p>
            <p>Theſe two points then are of Nature, to wit, the Common-wealth, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ſame by Magiſtrates, but what kinde of Government each Common-wealth
will have, whether <hi>Democratia,</hi> which is popular Government by the
People it ſelfe, as <hi>Athens, Thebes,</hi> and many other Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> had in old
time, and as the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzers</hi> at this day have: or elſe <hi>Ariſtocratia,</hi> which
is the government of ſome certain choſen number of the beſt, as the <hi>Romans</hi> many
yeares were governed by Conſuls and Senatours, and at this day the States of this
countrey of <hi>Holland</hi> do imitate the ſame: or elſe <hi>Monarchia,</hi> which is the Regiment
of one; and this again either of an Emperour, King, Duke, Earle, or the like: theſe
particular Formes of Government (I ſay) are not determined by God or Nature,
as the other two points before, (for then they ſhould be all one in all Nations,
as the other are, ſeeing God and Nature are one to all) but theſe particular Formes
are left unto every Nation and countrey to chuſe that Forme of Government,
which they ſhall like beſt, and thinke moſt fit for the Natures and conditions
of their People, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proveth throughout all the ſecond and fourth
Books of his Politiques very largely laying down divers kindes of Governments
in his dayes, as namely in <hi>Greece</hi> that of the <hi>Mileſians, Lacedemonians, Candians,</hi> and
others, and ſhewing the cauſes of their differences, which he attributeth to the
diverſity of Mens Natures, cuſtomes, educations and other ſuch cauſes that made
them make choice of ſuch or ſuch Forme of Government.</p>
            <p>And this might be proved alſo by infinite other Examples both of times paſt
and preſent, and in all Nations and countries both Chriſtian and otherwiſe,
which have not had onely different faſhions of Governments the one from the
other, but even among themſelves at one time, one Forme of Government, And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115403:4"/>
another at other times; for the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt had Kings, and after rejecting them
for their evil Government, they choſe Conſuls, which were two Governours for
every Year, whoſe Authority yet they limited by a multitude of ſenatours,
which were of their counſel, and theſe Mens power was reſtrained alſo by adding
Tribunes of the People, and ſometimes Dictatours, and finally they came to be
governed laſt of all by Emperours.</p>
            <p>The like might be ſaid of <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and many Cities and Common-wealthes
of <hi>Grece,</hi> which in divers ſeaſons, and upon divers cauſes have taken
different Formes of Government to themſelves.</p>
            <p>The like we ſee in <hi>Europe</hi> at this day, for in onely <hi>Italie,</hi> what different Formes
of Government have you? <hi>Naples</hi> hath a King for their Soveraigne, <hi>Roma</hi>
the Pope, and under him one Senatour in place of ſo many as were wont to be in
that Common-wealth. <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genua</hi> have Senatours and Dukes, but little
Authority have their Dukes. <hi>Florence, Farara, Mantua, Parma, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi>
have their Dukes onely without Senatours, and their power is abſolute.
<hi>Milan</hi> was once a Kingdom but now a Dukedom, the like is of <hi>Burgundy, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,
Bavire, Gaſconie,</hi> and <hi>Britaine</hi> the leſſer, all which once had their diſtinct
Kings, and now have Dukes for their ſupreme Governours. The like may be ſaid
of all <hi>Germany,</hi> that many Yeares together had one King over all, which now is
divided into ſo many Duke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>omes, Earldomes, and other like Titles of Supreme
Princes.</p>
            <p>But the contrary is of <hi>Caſtile, Aragon, Portugal, Barcelona,</hi> and other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
this day in <hi>Spain,</hi> which were firſt Earldomes onely, and after Dukedomes,
and then Kingdomes, and now again are all under one Monarchy. The like is of
<hi>Bohemie</hi> and <hi>Polonia,</hi> which were but Dukedomes in old time, and now are King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
The like may be ſaid of <hi>France</hi> alſo after the expulſion of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
which was firſt a Monarchy under <hi>Pharamond</hi> their firſt King, and ſo continued
for many Yeares under <hi>Clodion, Meronys, Childrik,</hi> and <hi>Clodovaus,</hi> their firſt
chriſtened Kings, but after they divided it into four Kingdomes, to wit, one of
<hi>Paris,</hi> another of <hi>Sueſſons,</hi> the third of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the fourth of <hi>Metts,</hi> and ſo
it continued for divers yeares, but yet afterwards they made it one Monarchy
again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> alſo was firſt a Monarchy under the <hi>Britaines,</hi> and then a Province un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and after that divided into ſeven Kingdomes at once under the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> and now a Monarchy again under the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and all this by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
and approbation, who in token thereof, ſuffered his own peculiar People
alſo of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be under divers manners of Governments in divers times, as firſt
under Patriarchs, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> then under Captaines, as <hi>Moſes,
Joſhua,</hi> and the like; then under Judges, as <hi>Othoniel, Aiod,</hi> and <hi>Gideon;</hi> then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
high Prieſts, as <hi>Heli</hi> and <hi>Samuel;</hi> then under Kings, as <hi>Saul, David,</hi> and the
reſt; and then under Captaines and high Prieſts again, as <hi>Zorobabel, Judas, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabeus,</hi>
and his Brethren, untill the Government was laſtly taken from them, and
they brought under the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and forreigne Kings appointed by
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115403:5"/>
So as of all this, there can be no doubt, but that the Common-wealth hath
power to chuſe their own faſhion of Government, as alſo to change the ſame
upon reaſonable cauſes, as we ſee in all times and Countries, and God no
doubt approveth what the Realme determineth in this point, for otherwiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be certain, for that of theſe changes doth depend all that hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
            <p>In like manner, is it evident, that as the Common-wealth hath this Authority
to chuſe and change her Government, ſo hath ſhe alſo to limit the ſame with
what Lawes and conditions ſhe pleaſeth, whereof enſueth the great diverſity of
Authority and power which each one of the former Governments hath, as for
example, the Conſuls of <hi>Rome</hi> were but for one year, other Officers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
were for more or leſſe time, as their Common-wealth did a lot them. The
Dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> at this day are for their lives (except in certain caſes wherein
they may be depoſed) and thoſe of <hi>Genua</hi> onely for two yeares, and their power
is very ſmall and much limited, and their Heires have no claime or pretence at all
after them to that Dignity, as the children and next of kin of other Dukes of
<hi>Italy</hi> have, though in different ſort alſo, for that the Dukedomes of <hi>Ferara,
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> are limited onely to Heires male, and for defect thereof to
return to the Pope or Sea of <hi>Rome: Florence,</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> for like defects are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to the Empire, and do not paſſe to the Heires female, or to the next of kin,
as <hi>Savoy</hi> and ſome others do.</p>
            <p>And now if we reſpect God and Nature, as well might all theſe Governments
follow one Law, as ſo different, for that neither God nor Nature preſcribeth any
of theſe particular Formes, but concurreth with any that the Common-wealth
it ſelfe appointeth, and ſo it is to be believed, that God and Nature concurred as
well with <hi>Italy</hi> when it had but one Prince, as now when it hath ſo many; and
the like with <hi>Germany,</hi> and alſo with <hi>Swizerland,</hi> which once was one Common-wealth
onely under the Dukes and Marqueſſes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and now are divided
into thirteen Cantons or Common-wealths under popular Magiſtrates of their
own, as hath been ſaid; ſo as when Men talke of <hi>a natural Prince or natural Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour</hi>
(as many times I have heard the word uſed) if it be underſtood of one
that is borne in the ſame Realme or Countrey, and ſo of our own natural Bloud,
it hath ſome ſenſe, though he may be both good or bad, (and none hath been
worſe or more cruel many times than home-borne Princes:) but if it be meant
as though any Prince had his particular Government or intereſt to ſucceed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Nattre, it is ridiculous, for that Nature giveth it not as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
but the particular conſtitution of every Common-wealth within it ſelfe.</p>

other, and the very firſt, that is to ſay, the moſt perfect, for that it hath moſt commodities and
leaſt inconveniences in it ſelfe of any other Government, and it is the firſt of all other; for that
all People commonly made their choiſe at the beginning of this kinde of Government, ſo as
of all other it is moſt ancient; for ſo we reade that among the <hi>Syrians, Medes,</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> their
firſt Governours were Kings; and when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did aske a King at the hands of
<hi>Samuel, 1 Reg.</hi> 8. which was a thouſand yeares before the coming of Chriſt, they alledged for one
reaſon, that all Nations round about them had Kings for their Governours, and at the very ſame
time, the chiefeſt Cities and Common wealths of <hi>Greece,</hi> as the <hi>Lacedemonians, Athenians, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
and others, whereof divers afterwards took other Governments unto themſelves, for
the abuſes in kingly Government committed, at that time were governed by Kings, as at large
proveth <hi>Dyaniſius Halicarnaſſeus, Coruelius Tacitus, Cicero,</hi> and others. <hi>Dyoniſ. Hal. l. 5. Cornel. Tac.
l. 3. Cic. l. 1. Offic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> alſo began with Kings, as before I have noted, and the reaſon of this is, for that
as our Chriſtian Doctours doe gather, (eſpecially <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Chriſoſtome, Hierom. l. 2. Epiſt.</hi> 12.
<hi>Chriſoſt. hom.</hi> 23.) this kinde of Government reſembleth moſt of all the Government of
God, that is but one: it repreſenteth the excellency of one ſun that lightneth all the
Planets, of one ſoul in the body that governeth all the powers and members thereof, and
finally they ſhew it alſo to be moſt conforme unto Nature, by example of the Bees which do
chooſe unto themſelves a King, and do live under a Monarchy, as the moſt excellenteſt of all
other Governments, to which purpoſe alſo I have heard alleadged ſometimes by divers thoſe
words of <hi>Peter, Subjecti eſtote omni humanae creaturae propter Deum, ſint Regi quaſi precellenti, ſive du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus
ab co miſſis, &amp;c. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. Be you ſubject to every humane creature for God's cauſe, whether
it be to a King, as the moſt excellent, or to Dukes ſent by God for the puniſhment of evil men
and praiſe of the good: cut of which words ſome do note two points, firſt, that as on the one
ſide the Apoſtle doth plainly teach, that the Magiſtrates Authority is from God by his firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
in that he ſaith, We muſt be ſubject to them for God's cauſe; ſo on the other ſide, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it <hi>a humane creature,</hi> or a thing created by man, for that by man's free choice this particular
Forme of Government (as al other alſo) is appointed in every Common-wealth, and that by mans
election and conſent, the ſame is laid upon ſome particular man or woman, according to the
Lawes of every Countrey, all which maketh it rightly to be called both a humane creature, and
from God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point which divers do note out of theſe words, is, that <hi>Peter</hi> calleth a King moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
which though it may be underſtood in reſpect of the Dukes Authority, whereof imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
there followeth mention; yet may it ſeem alſo to be taken and verified of kingly Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in reſpect of all other Governments, ſeeing that at this time when the Apoſtle wrote this
Epiſtle, the chief Governour of the world was not called King but Emperour, and therefore
ſeeing in ſuch a time <hi>Peter</hi> affirmeth the ſtate of kingly Government to be moſt excellent, it
may ſeem he meant it abſolutely, ſignifying thereby that this is the beſt kinde of Government
among all others, though to confeſſe the truth between the Title of King and Emperour there is
little or no difference in ſubſtance, but onely in name, for that the Authority is equal, every King
is an Emperour in his own Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And finally the excellency of this Government above all other, is not onely proved by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
thereof in it ſelfe, as for that it is moſt ancient, ſimple, and conforme unto Nature, and
moſt reſembling the Government of God himſelfe, as hath been ſaid, but by the effects alſo and
utility that it bringeth unto the Subjects, with farre leſſe inconveniences than any other Forme of
Government whatſoever if we compare them together; for in the Monarchy of one King, there
is more unity, agreement and conformity, and thereby alſo celerity commonly in diſpatching of
buſineſſes, and in defending the Common-wealth, than where many Heads be; leſſe paſſions alſo,
in one man than in many; as for example, in <hi>Demecratia,</hi> where the common people do bear the
chief ſway, which is <hi>Bellua multorum capitum,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> wiſely ſaid, that is, a Beaſt of many
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115403:6"/>
heads. <hi>Cicero</hi> l. 1. <hi>Offic. Democratis.</hi> There is nothing but ſedition, trouble, tumults, outrages, and
injuſtices committed upon every little occaſion, eſpecially where crafty and cunning men may
be admitted to incenſe or aſſwage them with ſugred words, ſuch as were the Oratours in <hi>Athens,</hi>
and other Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> that had this Government, and the Tribunes of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and other ſuch popular and plauſible men, who could move the waves, raiſe up the windes, and
inkindle the fire of the vulgar Peoples affections, paſſions or furies at their pleaſure, by which
we ſee that of all other Common wealths, theſe of popular Government, have ſooneſt come to
raine, which might be ſhewed not onely by old examples of <hi>Greece, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> but alſo of
many Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Florence, Bolonia, Siena, Piſa, Arezzo, Spoleto, Perugio, Padua,</hi> and others,
which upon the fall or diminution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire (under which they were before) took
unto themſelves popular Governments, wherein they were ſo toſſed with continual ſedition, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies,
and banding of Factions, as they could never have end thereof, untill after infinit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
maſſacres, and inundation of bloud, they came in the end to be under the Monarchy of
ſome one Prince or other, as at this day they remain: ſo that of all other Governments this is the
worſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Forme, which is called <hi>Oligarchia</hi> or <hi>Ariſtocratia</hi> (for that a few and thoſe preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be the beſt, are joyned together in Authority) as it doth participate ſomething of both
the other Governments, to wit, of <hi>Monarchia</hi> and <hi>Democratia,</hi> or rather tempereth them both:
ſo hath it both good and evil in it, but yet inclineth more to the evil, for the diſ-union that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
by man's infirmity and malice is among thoſe Heads, for which cauſe the States before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genua,</hi> which were wont to have ſimply this Government of <hi>Ariſtocratia,</hi> in
that their Regiment was by certain choſe Senatours, were enforced in the end to chuſe Dukes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
as Heads of their Senates, for avoiding of diſſention, and ſo they have at this day, though
their Authority be but ſmall, as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>We ſee alſo by the examples of <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> where Government of <hi>Ariſtocratia</hi> took
place, that the diviſion and factions among the Senatours of <hi>Carthage,</hi> was the cauſe why aid
and ſuccour was not ſent to <hi>Hannibal</hi> their Captain in <hi>Italy</hi> after his ſo great and important victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at <hi>Cannas,</hi> which was the very cauſe of the ſaving of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the loſſe of their
own: and alſo afterwards the emulations, diſcord, and diſ union of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senatours
among themſelves in the affaires and contentions of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> and of <hi>Pompry</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
was the occaſion of all their deſtruction, and of their Common-wealth with them. <hi>Tit. Liv. l.</hi> 30.
<hi>Entrop l. 3. Oroſ. l. 5. &amp;</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Evident then it is, that of all other Governments the Monarchy is the beſt, and leaſt ſubject to
the inconveniences that other Governments have, and if the Prince that governeth alone, and
hath ſupreme authority to himſelfe, as he reſembleth God in this point of ſole Government, ſo
could he reſemble him alſo, in wiſe, diſcreet, and juſt Government, and in ruling without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
no doubt, but that nothing more excellent in the World could be deſired for the perfect fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
of his Subjects: but for that a King or Prince is a man as others be, and thereby not onely
ſubject to errours in judgement, but alſo to paſſionate affections in his will: for this cauſe, it was
neceſſary that the Common-wealth, as it gave him this great power over them, ſo it ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
him alſo the beſt helpes that might be, for directing and rectifying both his will and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and make him therein as like in Government to God, whom he repreſenteth, as man's
frailty can reach unto.</p>
            <p>For this conſideration they aſſigned to him firſt of all the aſſiſtance and direction of Law,
whereby to governe, which Law <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eſt meus quaelam nulle perturbata affectu, Ariſt. l.</hi> 3.
<hi>Pol. c. ult.</hi> It is a certain minde diſquieted with no diſordinate affection, as mens mindes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
be, for that when a Law is made, for the moſt part, it is made upon due conſidlration
and deliberation, and without perturbation of evil affections, as anger, envy, hatred, raſhneſſe,
or the like paſſions, and it is referred to ſome good end and commodity of the Common-wealth,
which Law being once made, remaineth ſo ſtill without alteration or partial affection, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to all, and partial to none, but telleth one tale to every man; and in this it reſembleth
the perfection as it were of God himſelfe, for the which cauſe the ſaid Philoſopher in the ſame
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115403:6"/>
place addeth a notable wiſe ſaying, to wit, <hi>That he which joyneth a Law to governe with the Prince,
joyneth God to the Prince, but be that joyneth to the Prince his affection to governe, joyneth a beaſt. Ar. l.</hi> 3.
<hi>Pol. c.</hi> 12. For that mens affections and concupiſcences are common alſo to Beaſts: ſo that a
Prince ruling by Law is more than a man, or a man deified, and a Prince ruling by affections, is
leſſe than a man, or a man brutified. In another place alſo the ſame Philoſopher ſaith, that a
Prince that leaveth Law and ruleth himſelfe and others by his own appetite and affections, <hi>Of
all creatures is the worſt, and of all beasts is the moſt furious and dangerous. Ariſt. l. 1. Pol. c.</hi> 2. For that
nothing is ſo outragious, as injuſtice armed, and no armour is ſo ſtrong, as wit and authority.
whereof the firſt he hath in that he is a man, and the other in that he is a Prince.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe then all Common-wealths have preſcribed Lawes unto their Princes, to govern
thereby, as by a moſt excellent, certain and immutable rule; to which ſenſe <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, <hi>Leges
ſunt inventae ut omnibus ſemper una &amp; eadem voce loquerentur;</hi> Lawes were invented to the end they
ſhould ſpeak in one and the ſelfe ſame ſenſe to all men <hi>Cic. l. 2. Offic.</hi> For which very reaſon in
like manner theſe Lawes have been called by Philoſophers a rule or ſquare, inflexible, and by
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in particular, a minde without paſſion, as hath been ſaid, but the Prophet <hi>David</hi> who
was alſo a Prince and King, ſeemeth to call it by the name of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> for that as Diſcipline
doth keep all the parts of a man or of a particular houſe in order, ſo Law well miniſtred keepeth
all the parts of a Common-wealth in good order, and to ſhew how ſecurely God exacteth this at
all Princes hands, he ſaith theſe words, <hi>And now learn ye Kings and be inſtructed, ye that judge the
World, ſerve God in fear, and rejoyce in him with trembling, imbrace ye diſcipline, leaſt he enter into
wrath, and ſo ye periſh from the way of righteouſneſſe. Pſal.</hi> 2. Which words being uttered by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
and King do contain divers points of much conſideration for this purpoſe; as firſt, that
Kings and Princes are bound to learne Law and Diſcipline: and ſecondly, to obſerve the ſame
with great humility and fear of Gods wrath: and thirdly, that if they do not, they ſhall periſh
from the way of righteouſneſſe, as though the greateſt plague of all to a Prince were to loſe the
way of righteouſneſſe, law and reaſon in his Government, and to give himſelfe over to paſſion,
and his own will, whereby they are ſure to come to ſhipwracke: and thus much of the firſt
helpe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond helpe that Common-wealths have given to their Kings and Princes, eſpecially in
later Ages, hath been certain Councels and Councelours with whom to conſult in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of moſt importance, as we ſee the Parliaments in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the Courts in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and Diets in <hi>Germany,</hi> without which no matter of great moment can be concluded; and
beſides this, commonly every King hath his Privy Councel, whom he is bound to hear, and this
was done to temper ſomewhat the abſolute forme of a Monarchy, whoſe danger is by reaſon of
his ſole Authority to fall into tyranny, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wiſely noteth in his fourth Book of Politiques,
ſhewing the inconvenience or dangers of this Government; which is the cauſe that we have
few or no ſimple Monarchies now in the World, eſpecially among Chriſtians, but all are mixt
lightly with divers points of the other two formes of Government alſo; and namely in <hi>England</hi>
all three do enter more or leſſe; for in that there is one King or Queen, it is a Monarchy; in
that it hath certain Councels which muſt be heard: it participateth of <hi>Ariſtocratia,</hi> and in that
the Commonalty have their voyces and Burgeſſes in Parliament, it taketh part alſo of <hi>Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
or popular Government, <hi>All which linitations of the Princes abſolute Authority, as you ſee, do
come from the Common-wealth, as having authority above their Princes for their reſtraint to the good of
the Realme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From like Authority, and for like conſiderations have come the limitations of other Kings
and kingly power in all times and Countries, from the beginning, both touching themſelves and
their poſterity and ſucceſſours, as briefly in this place I ſhall declare.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, if we will conſider the two moſt renowned and allowed States of all the
World, I mean of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> we ſhall finde that both of them began with Kings,
but yet with farre different Lawes and reſtraints about their Authorities; for in <hi>Rome</hi> the Kings
that ſucceeded <hi>Romulus</hi> their firſt Founder, had as great and abſolute Authority as ours have now
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115403:7"/>
a dayes, but yet their children or next in bloud ſucceeded them not of neceſſity, but new Kings
were choſen partly by the Senate, and partly by the people, as <hi>Titus Livius</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Livil. 1 dec.</hi> 1.
So as of three moſt excellent Kings that enſued immediatly after <hi>Romulus,</hi> to wit, <hi>Numa Pompili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Tullius Hoſtilius,</hi> and <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus,</hi> none of them were of the Bloud Royal, nor of kin
the one to the other, no nor yet <hi>Romans</hi> borne, but choſen rather from among ſtrangers, for their
vertue and valour, and that by election of the Senate and conſent of the People.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Grecce,</hi> and namely among the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> which was the moſt eminent Kingdom
among others at that time, the ſucceſſion of children after their fathers was more certain, but
yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> noteth, <hi>Ariſt. l. 2. c. 8. Pol. Plutarch. in Lycurg.</hi> Their authority and power was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by certain Officers of the people named <hi>Ephori</hi> (which commonly were five in number)
as they were not onely checked and chaſtened by them, if occaſion ſerved, but alſo deprived and
ſomtimes put to death; for which cauſe the ſaid Philoſopher did juſtly miſlike this eminent ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of the <hi>Ephori</hi> over their Kings: but yet hereby we ſee what authority the Common-wealth
had in this caſe, and what their meaning was in making Lawes, &amp; reſtraining their Kings
power, to wit, thereby the more to binde them to do juſtice, which <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Offices uttereth
in theſe words, <hi>Juſtitiae fruendae cauſa apud majores noſtros &amp; in Aſia, &amp; in Europa bene morati Reges
olim ſunt conſtiti, &amp;c. at cum jus aquabile ab <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> viro homines non conſequerentur, inventae ſunt leges.
Cic. l. 2. Offic.</hi> Good Kings were appointed in old time among our Anceſtours in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi>
to the end thereby to obtain juſtice, but when men could not obtain equal juſtice at one mans
hands, they invented Lawes.</p>
            <p>The ſame reaſon yeildeth the ſame Philoſopher in another place, not onely of the firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Kingdomes, but alſo of the change thereof again into other Government, when theſe
were abuſed. <hi>Omnes antiquae gentes regibus quondam paruerunt, &amp;c. Cic. l. 3. de legibus.</hi> That is,
<q>All old Nations did live under Kingdomes at the beginning, which kinde of Government firſt
they gave unto the moſt juſt, and wiſeſt men which they could finde, and alſo after for love of
them, they gave the ſame to their poſterity or next in kin, as now alſo it remaineth where king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Government is in uſe: but other Countries which liked not that forme of Government,
and have ſhaken it off, have done it not that they will not be under any, but for that they will
not be ever under one onely.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far <hi>Cicero,</hi> and ſpeaketh this principally in defence of his own Common-wealth I mean
the <hi>Roman:</hi> which had caſt off that kinde of Government, as before hath been ſaid, for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
they had taken againſt certain Kings of theirs, and firſt of all, againſt <hi>Romulus</hi> himſelfe
their firſt Founder, for reigning at his pleaſure without law, as <hi>Titus Livius</hi> teſtifieth, for which
cauſe the Senatours at length ſlew him, and cut him in ſmall pieces. And afterwards they were
greatly grieved at the entring of <hi>Scrvius Tullius</hi> their ſixth King, for that he gat the Crown by
fraud and not by Election of the Senate, and ſpecial approbation of the people, as he ſhould
have done: but moſt of all they were exaſperated by the proceeding of their ſeventh King na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Lucius Tarquinius,</hi> ſirnamed the proud, who for that he neglected the Lawes of Government
preſcribed to him by the Common-wealth, as namely in that he conſulted not with the Senate
in matters of great importance, and for that he made War and Peace of his own head, and for
for that he appointed to himſelfe a Guard, as though he had miſtruſted the People, and for that
he did uſe injuſtice to divers particular men, and ſuffered his children to be inſolent, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
with all his poſterity, and the Government of <hi>Rome</hi> changed from a Kingdom unto the
Regiment of Conſuls, after two hundred yeares that the other had endured.</p>
            <p>And thus much of thoſe Kingdomes of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Greece:</hi> and if likewiſe we will look upon
other Kingdomes of <hi>Europe,</hi> we ſhall ſee the very ſame, to wit, that every Kingdom and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
hath his particular Lawes preſcribed to their Kings by the Common wealth, both for their
Government, Authority, and Succeſſion in the ſame: for if we behold the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire it
ſelfe, as it is at this day annexed to the <hi>German</hi> Electours, though it be firſt in Dignity among
Chriſtian Princes, yet ſhall we ſee it ſo reſtrained by particular Lawes, as the Emperour can do
much leſſe in his State than other Kings in theirs, for he can neither make War, nor exact any
contribution of men, or money, thereunto, but by the free leave and conſent of all the States of

or pretence at all to ſucceed in their Fathers Dignity, but onely by free Election, if they
ſhall be thought worthy nay, one of the chiefeſt points that the Emperour muſt ſwear at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
as <hi>Sleydan</hi> writeth, <hi>Sleydan l. 8. Anno</hi> 1532. is this, <hi>That he ſhall never go about to make the
Dignity of the Emperour peculiar or bereditary to his Family, but leave it unto the ſeven Electours free in

            <p>The Kingdomes of <hi>Poloma</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> do go much after the ſame faſhion, both for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant
of power, and ſucceſſion to their Kings. For firſt touching their Authority, they have great
limitation, neither can they do any thing of great moment, without the conſent of certain princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal

            <p>In <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the priviledges of Kings are farre more eminent in both theſe
points, for that both their Authority is much more abſolute, and their next in Bloud do ordinarily
ſucceed, but yet in different manner; for as touching authority, it ſeemeth that the Kings of
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> have greater than the King of <hi>England,</hi> for that every ordination of theſe two
Kings is Law in it ſelfe, without further approbation of the Common-wealth, which holdeth not
in <hi>England,</hi> where no general Law can be made without conſent of Parliament; but in the other
point of Succeſſion, it appeareth that the reſtraint is farre greater in thoſe other two Countries
than in <hi>England,</hi> for that in <hi>Spain</hi> the next in Bloud cannot ſucceed be he never ſo lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,
but by a new approbation of the Nobility, and States of the Realme, as it is expreſly ſet
down in the two ancient Councels of <hi>Tolledo</hi> the fourth and fifth, <hi>Concil. blet. 4. c. 74. &amp; coneil. ſ.

their new conſent; and ſo we have ſeen it practiſed in our dayes towards three or four of king
<hi>Philips</hi> children, which have ſucceeded the one after the other in the Title of Princes of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and at every change a new Oath required at the Subjects hands, for their admiſſion to the ſaid

            <p>Neither did it avail, that the two kings aforeſaid alleadged, that it was againſt reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and cuſtome of all Nations, to exclude women, from the Succeſſion of the Crown
which appertained unto them by propinquity of Bloud, ſeeing both Nature and God hath made
them capable of ſuch Succeſſion every where, as it appeareth by example of all other Nations,
and in the old Teſtament among the people of God it ſelfe, where we ſee Women have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
unto kingdomes by ſucceſſion, but all this (I ſay) prevailed not, with the <hi>French</hi> as it did
not alſo ſince for the admiſſion of <hi>Dona Iſabella Eugenia Clara, Infanta of Spain,</hi> unto the ſaid
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> though by diſſent of Bloud there be no queſtion of her next propinquity, for
that ſhe was the eldeſt childe of the king's eldeſt ſiſter.</p>

obſerve the ſame, and to alter the courſe of natural Diſcent, and nearneſſe of Bloud, as we have
ſeen, and that the king of <hi>Navar</hi> and ſome others of his race by vertue of this onely Law did
pretend to be next in Succeſſion to this goodly Crown, though in nearneſſe of Bloud they were
farther off, by many degrees from king <hi>Henry</hi> the third, than either the foreſaid <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi>
or the prince of <hi>Lorain,</hi> who were children of his own ſiſters, which point yet in <hi>England</hi> were
great diſorder, and would not be ſuffered, for that our Lawes are otherwiſe, and who made theſe
Lawes, but the Common-wealth it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>By all which we ſee that divers Kingdomes, have divers lawes and cuſtomes in the matter of
ſucceſſion, and that it is not enough for a man to alleage bare propinquity of blood, thereby to
prevaile, for that he may be excluded or put back by divers other circumſtances, for ſundry other
reaſons which afterward we ſhall diſcuſſe.</p>
            <p>Yea, not onely in this point hath the common-wealth authority to put back the next inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
upon lawfull conſiderations, but alſo <hi>to diſpoſſeſſe them that have bin lawfully put in poſſeſſion,
if they fulfill not the lawes and conditions, by which and for which, their dignitie was given them.</hi>
Which point as it cannot ſerve for wicked men to be troubleſome unto their Governours, for
their own intereſts or appetites, ſo yet when it is done upon juſt and urgent cauſes and by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
authority of the whole body the juſtice thereof is playne, not onely by the grounds and
reaſons before alleaged, but alſo by thoſe examples of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
who lawfully depoſed their Kings upon juſt conſiderations, and changed alſo their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie
and Kingly Government, into other forme of regiment, And it might be proved alſo, by
examples of all other nations, and this perhaps with a circumſtance which every man conſidereth
not, to wit, <hi>That God hath wonderfully concurred (for the moſt part.) with ſuch juditiall acts of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth
againſt their evill Princes, not onely in proſpering the ſame, but by giving them alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſome notable ſucceſſor in place of the depoſed, thereby hath to juſtify the fact, and to remedy the
fault of him that went before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am far from the opinion of thoſe people of our dayes, or of old, who make ſo little account
of their duty towards Princes, as be their title what it will, yet for every miſlike of their owne
they are ready to band againſt them whereſoever they thinke they may make their party good,
inventing a thouſand calumniations for their diſcredit without conſcience or reaſon, whom in
deed I do thinke to have little conſcience or none at all but rather to be thoſe whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> did ſpeake of when they ſaid. <hi>Novit Dominus iuiquos in diem judicii reſervare,
cruciandos, magis autem eos qui dominitionem contemnunt, audaces, ſbi placentes, &amp;c. 2 Pet</hi> 2 10.

but much more thoſe which do contemne domination or government, and are bold and

            <p>Nay further, I am of opinion, that whatſoever a Princes Title be, if once he be ſettled in the
Crown, and admitted by the Common-wealth (for of all other holds I eſteem the tenure of a
Crown) if ſo it may be termed (the moſt irregular and exraordinary) every man is bound to
ſettle his conſcience to obey the ſame, <hi>In all that lawfully he may command,</hi> and this without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of his Title or Intereſt, for that God diſpoſeth of kingdomes, and worketh his will in
princes affaires, as he pleaſeth, and this by extraordinary meanes oftentimes, ſo that if we ſhould
examine the Titles at this day of all the princes in Chriſtendom by the ordinary rule of private
mens rights, ſucceſſions, or tenures, ſhould finde ſo many knots and difficulties, as it were hard
for any to make the ſame plain, but onely the ſupreme Law of God's diſpoſition, which can
diſpence in what he liſteth.</p>
            <p>This is my opinion in this behalfe for true and quiet obedience, and yet on the other ſide, as
farre off am I from the abject and wicked flattery of ſuch as affirme princes to be ſubject to no
Law or limitation at all, either in authority, government, life, or ſucceſſion, but as though by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115403:8"/>
Nature they had been created kings from the beginning of the World, or as though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
had been made for them, and not they for the Common-wealth, or as though they
had begotten or purchaſed, or given life to the Weal-publique, and not that the Weal-publique
had exalted them, or given them their authority, honour, and dignity; ſo theſe flatterers do free
them for all obligation, duty, reverence, or reſpect unto the whole Body, where of they are
the Heads; nay, expreſly they ſay and affirme, that <hi>All mens goods, bodies, and lives, are the Princes
at their pleaſures to diſpoſe of; that they are under no Law or account-giving whatſoever, that they ſucceed
by Nature and generation onely, and not by any authority, admiſſion, or approbation of the Common-wealth,
and that conſequently no merit or demerit of their perſo is to be reſpected, nor any conſideration

            <p>All theſe abſurd paradoxes have ſome men of our dayes uttered in flattery of princes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
a kings Title with aſſertions and propoſitions, do deſtroy all Law of reaſon, conſcience,

yet ſome proportion of equity is held between the prince and the people, both in Government

part, commodious to the weal publique, and that it may ſeem that God approved and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame, by the good ſucceſſe and ſucceſſors that inſued thereof. Yet with this proteſtation,
that nothing be taken out of my ſpeech, againſt the ſacred authority and due reſpect and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
that all men owe unto Princes, both by Gods Law and Nature, but only this ſhall ſerve
to ſhew that as nothing under God is more honourable, amiable, profitable, or Soveraigne, than a
good Prince: ſo nothing is more peſtilent, or bringeth ſo generall deſtruction and deſolation as
an evill Prince. And therefore as the whole body is of more authority th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the only head, and
may cure the head if it be out of tune, ſo may the weal-publique cure or purge their heads, if they
infect the reſt, ſeeing that a body Civill may have divers heads, by ſucceſſion, and is not bound
ever to one, as a body naturall is, which body naturall, if it had the ſame ability that when it had
an aking or ſickly head, it could cut it off and take another, I doubt not, but it would ſo do, and
that all men would confeſſe that it had authority ſufficient and reaſon to doe, the ſame rather
then all the other parts ſhould periſh or live in pain and continuall torment: but yet much more
cleare is the matter that we have in hand for disburdening our ſelves of wicked Princes, as now
I ſhall begin to prove unto you.</p>
            <p>And for proofe of both the points joyntly, I might begin perhaps with ſome examples out of
the Scripture it ſelfe, but ſome man may chance to ſay, that theſe things recounted there of
the <hi>Jewes,</hi> were not ſo much to be reputed for acts of the common-Wealth, as for particular
ordinations of God himſelfe, which yet is not any thing againſt me, but rather maketh much
for our purpoſe. For that the matter is more authorized hereby, ſeeing that whatſoever God
did ordaine or put in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

now having his authority and approbation for the ſame. Wherefore (ſaid he)
though I do haſten to examples that are more neerer home, and more proper to the particular
purpoſe whereof we treat, yet can I not omit to note ſome two or three out of the Bible, that doe
appertain to this purpoſe alſo, and theſe are the deprivation and putting to death of two wicked
Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> named <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Amon, 1 Kin. 31. 4. King.</hi> 22. 44. (though both of them were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115403:9"/>
placed in that dignity) and the bringing in of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Joſia</hi> in their roomes, who were
the two moſt excellent princes that ever that Nation or any other (I thinke) have had to governe
them.</p>
            <p>And firſt king <hi>Saul</hi> though he were elected by God to that royal Thron, yet was he ſlain by the
<hi>Philiſtims,</hi> by God's order as it was foretold him for his diſobedience, and not fulfilling the
law and limits preſcribed unto him. <hi>Amon</hi> was lawfull King alſo, and that by natural diſcent and
ſucceſſion, for he was ſon and heir to king <hi>Manaſſes</hi> whom he ſucceeded, and yet was he ſlain by
his own people, <hi>Quia non ambulavit in via Domini,</hi> for that he walked not in the way preſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him by God: and unto theſe two kings ſo deprived God gave two Succeſſours, as I have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
the like whereof are not to be found in the whole ranke of kings for a thouſand yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
for of <hi>Joſias</hi> it is written, <hi>Fecit quod crat rectum in conſpectu Domini, &amp; non declinavit neque
ad dextram neque ad ſiniſtram. 2. Paralip.</hi> 34. 5. He did that which was right in the ſight of God,
neither did he decline unto the right hand nor the left; he reigned 31 yeares, 2. <hi>Paralip.</hi> 35.
And <hi>Jeremias</hi> the prophet that lived in his time loved ſo extremely this good king, as he never
ceaſed afterwards to lament his death, as the Scripture ſaith, 2 <hi>Chron. 34. &amp; 35. Chapters</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for king <hi>David,</hi> it ſhall not be needfull to ſay any thing, how excellent a king he was, for
as many learned men do note, he was a moſt perfect paterne for al kings that ſhould follow in the
World, not as king <hi>Cyrus</hi> whom <hi>Xenophon</hi> did paint out more according to his own imagination
of a perfect king, that he wiſhed, then to the truth of the ſtory, but rather as one that paſſed farre
in acts that which is written of him, and this not onely in matters of religion, piety, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but alſo of chivalry, valour, wiſedom and policy; neither is it true which <hi>Nicholas Maehia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi>
the <hi>Florentine, N. Mach. l. 2. c. 2. in Tit. Liv.</hi> And ſome others of his new unchriſtian ſchool do
affirme, for defacing of Chriſtian vertue, <hi>That religion and piety are lets oftentimes to politique and
wiſe Government, and do break or weaken the high ſpirits of magnanimous men, to take in hand great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes
for the Common-wealth. Aug. l<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

are wont to ſay (and it is moſt true) Grace doth not deſtroy or corrupt, but perfect Nature; ſo
ſo as he which by Nature is valiant, wiſe, liberal, or politique, ſhall be the more, if alſo he be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and religious: which we ſee evidently in king <hi>David,</hi> who notwithſtanding all his piety, yet
omitted he nothing appertaining to the ſtate and government of a noble, wiſe, and politique
Prince: for firſt of al, he began with reformation of his own Court and Realm in matter of good lif
and ſervice of God, wherein he uſed the counſel and direction of God and of <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet,
as alſo of <hi>Abiathar</hi> and <hi>Hiram</hi> the chief Prieſts and of <hi>Heman</hi> his wiſe Councellour 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 15. He
reduced the whole Clergy into 24. degrees, appointing 4000. Singers with divers ſorts of muſical
inſtruments, under <hi>Aſaph, Heman,</hi> and other principal men that ſhould be Heads of the Quire.
<hi>pſal. 22. &amp;</hi> 25. He appointed all Officers needfull both for his Court, and alſo the Common-wealth,
with the Armes of the Crown, which was a Lion, in remembrance of the Lion which
he had ſlain with his own hands, when he was a childe; he ordained a mynt with a peculiar
forme of money to be ſtamped: took order for diſtributing relief unto the poor, and other like
acts of a prudent and pious Prince.</p>
            <p>After all this he turned himſelfe to his old exerciſe of Warres, to which he was given from his
child hood, being wonderfull valiant of his own perſon, as appeareth by the Lion and Bear that
he ſlew with his own hands, and the courage wherewith he took upon him the combat with <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah;</hi>
and as he had ſhewed himſelfe a great Warriour and renowned Captain many yeares in the
ſervice of <hi>Saul</hi> againſt the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and had gained many noble victories: ſo much more did he
after he was king himſelfe, for that he conquered not onely the <hi>philiſtims,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Amorites,
Idumeans, Moabites,</hi> with the kings and people of <hi>Damaſco</hi> and all <hi>Syria,</hi> even unto the River <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phates,</hi>
and left all theſe Countries peaceable to his Succeſſour, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8. and in three or four Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes
wherein <hi>David</hi> himſelfe was preſent, within the ſpace of two or three yeares, almoſt a hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thouſand Horſe and Foot ſlain by him, 8. <hi>paral.</hi> 18. and that himſelfe flew in his dayes eight
hundred with his own hands, 2 <hi>reg. 13. Joſeph. l. 7. antiqu. c.</hi> 10. and that he made by his example
thirty and ſeven ſuch Captaines as each one of them was able to lead and governe a whole Army,
and yet among all theſe expences of Warres had he care to lay up ſo much money and treaſure as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115403:9"/>
was ſufficient for the building of that huge and wonderfull Temple after him, which hee recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to his ſon <hi>Salomon,</hi> and amidſt all this valour and courage of ſo warlike a King and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
had he ſo much humility as to humble himſelfe to <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet when he came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
him for his fault, and ſo much patience and charity as to pardon <hi>Semci</hi> that reviled him, and
threw ſtones at him in the high way as he went, and among ſo many and continuall buſineſſes,
both Martiall and Civill, and great affaires of the Commonwealth, he had time to write ſo many
Pſalmes as we ſee, and to ſing prayſes ſeven times a day to Almighty God, and to feel that
devotion at his death which we read of, and finally he ſo lived and ſo dyed, as never Prince (I
thinke) before him, nor perhaps after him, ſo joyned together both valour and vertue, courage
and humility, wiſdome and piety, government and devotion, nobility and religion. Wherefore
though I have been ſomewhat longer then I would in this example, yet hath it not been from the
purpoſe to note ſomewhat in particular what two worthy Kings were put up by God in place of

government, they had but fifteen miles territory without their City, it is knowne, that when

more then fifteen thouſand miles in compaſſe, for that they had not only all Europe under their
dominion, but the principall parts alſo of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> ſo as this chaſtiſement ſo juſtly laid upon

and put to death by the Souldiers of <hi>Rome,</hi> at the requeſt and common deſire both of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

called more <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and ſo it was obſerved, though no other name had ever been more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
before, to the world for the remembrance of the good Emperors that had been ſo called.</p>
            <p>This man being chaſtized as is ſaid, there was preferred to the Empire in his room a goodly
young man, of his next kindred, named <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> ſon to <hi>Mamonea</hi> which was ſiſter to

that the Senate (not being able to match him in open ſtrength) ſent privily into <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
to invite <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to come, and do juſtice upon him, and ſo he did, and he being drowned in the

that all men know, and the firſt Emperor that publiquely profeſſed himſelf a Chriſtian, and planted
cur faith over all the World, and this of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>And if we will come lower down, and nearer home, we have yet another example, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
perhaps than all the reſt, which was the change of the Empire from the Eaſt to the
Weſt, for the evil Government of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the ſixth, who was depoſed firſt, and his eyes put

the yeare 1326. <hi>Polyd. l. 18. hiſt. Anglicanae Anno</hi> 1326. and his body adjudged to

hee was degraded, his name of King firſt taken from him, and
he appointed to be called <hi>Edward of Carnarvan</hi> from that houre forward. And
then his Crowne and ring were taken away, and the Steward of his houſe
brake the ſtaffe of his office in his preſence, and diſcharged his ſervants of
their ſervice, and all other people of their obedience or allegiance toward
him: and towards his maintenance he had only a 100 marks a year allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

particular keepers, who led him priſoner from thence by divers other places
uſing him with extreme indignity in the way, untill at laſt they took his life
from him in the Caſtle of <hi>Barkley,</hi> and his ſon <hi>Edward</hi> the third reigned in his

nor the example of one Princes puniſhment maketh another to beware,
for the next ſucceſſour after this noble <hi>Edward</hi> which was King <hi>Richard</hi> the

the miſerable end of his great Grandfather for evill government, as
alſo the felicity, and vertue of his Father and Grandfather for the contrary,
ſuffered himſelfe to be abuſed and miſled by evill councellours, to the great
hurt and diſquietneſſe of the Realme. For which cauſe after he had reigned
22. yeares, he was depoſed by act of Parliament holden in <hi>London,</hi> the yeare
of our Lord 1399. and condemned to perpetuall priſon in the Caſtle of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret,

               </gap> 
               <hi>London,</hi> and afterwards alſo by publicke Act of Parliament,
in reſpect not only of the title which King <hi>Edward</hi> pretended, but alſo and
eſpecially for that King <hi>Henry</hi> did ſuffer himſelfe to bee overruled by the
Queen his wife, and had broke the articles of agreement made by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
between him and the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and ſolemnly ſworne on both
ſides, the 8. of <hi>Octob.</hi> in the yeare 1459. In puniſhment whereof and of his
other negligent and evill government, (though for his owne particular life
he was a good man) ſentence was given againſt him, partly by force and
partly by law, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth was put in his place, who was no
evill King and all Engliſh men well know, but one of the renownedſt for
martiall acts and juſtice that hath worne the Engliſh Crowne.</p>
            <p>But after this man againe, there fell another accident much more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
which was that <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> this King <hi>Edwards</hi> yonger
brother, did put to death his two nephews, this mans children, to wit, King
<hi>Edward</hi> the fifth and his little brother, and made himſelfe King, and albeit
he ſinned grievouſly by taking upon him the. Crown in this wicked manner
yet when his nephews were once dead, he might in reaſon ſeem to be lawfull
King, both in reſpect that he was the next male in blood after his ſaid bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as alſo for that by divers acts of Parliament, both before and after the
death of thoſe infants, his title was authoriſed and made good, and yet no
man wil ſay (I think) but that he was lawfully alſo depoſed again afterward
by the Commonwealth, <hi>An.</hi> 1487. which called out of <hi>France, Henry</hi> Earle of
<hi>Richmond</hi> to chaſtiſe him, and to put him downe, and ſo he did, and tooke
from him both life and Kingdome in the field, and was King himſelfe after
him by the name of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and no man I ſuppoſe, will ſay
but that he was lawfully King alſo, which yet cannot be, except the other
might lawfully be depoſed; I would have you conſider in all theſe mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
what men commonly have ſucceeded in the places of ſuch as have been
depoſed, as namely in <hi>England,</hi> in the place of thoſe five Kings before named,
that were deprived, to wit, <hi>John, Edward</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond,
<hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt, and <hi>Richard</hi> the third, there have ſucceeded the three <hi>Henries,</hi>
to wit, the third, fourth, and ſeventh, and two <hi>Edwards,</hi> the third and
fourth, all moſt rare and valiant Princes, who have done infinit important
acts in their Commonwealths, and among other, have raiſed many houſes to
Nobility, put downe others, changed ſtates both abroad and at home, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
Eccleſiaſticall dignities altered the courſe of diſcent in the blood
Royall, and the like, all which was unjuſt, &amp; is void at this day if the changes
and deprivations of the former Princes could not be made, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
none of theſe that doe pretend the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> at this day, can
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115403:13"/>
have any title at all, for that from thoſe men they deſcend who were put up
in place of the deprived.</p>
            <p>And this may be ſufficient for proofe of theſe two principall points, that
lawfull Princes have oftentimes by their Commonwealths been lawfully
depoſed, for miſgovernment, and that God hath allowed and aſſiſted the
ſame, with good ſucceſſe unto the Weal-publique, and if this be ſo, or might
be ſo, in Kings lawfully ſet in poſſeſſion, then much more hath the ſaid
Commonwealth power and authority to alter the ſucceſſion of ſuch as doe
but yet pretend to that dignity, if there be due reaſon and cauſes for the
ſame.</p>

            <p>TRuly Sir I cannot deny, but the examples are many that this Gentleman
hath alleaged, and they ſeeme to prove ſufficiently that which you affirmed,
at the beginning, to wit, that the Princes by you named were deprived, and put
downe by their Common-wealths for their evill government. And good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors

and now to call theſe facts in queſtion, were to embroyle and turne up-ſide-down
all the States of Chriſtendome, as you have well ſignified, but yet for that you
have added this word lawfully ſo many times, in the courſe of your narration,
I would you tooke the paines to tell us alſo, by what Law, they did the ſame,
ſeeing that <hi>Belloy</hi> whom you have named before, and ſome other of his opinion
doe affirme, <hi>Belloy apolog. catholic. part. 2. paragraf. 9. &amp; apol. pro rege. cap.</hi> 9. That
albeit by nature the Common-wealth have authority over the Prince, to chuſe
and appoint him, at the beginning, as you have well proved out of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
and other wayes; yet having once made him, and given up all their authority
unto him, he is now no more ſubject to their correction, or reſtraint, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
abſolute of himſelfe without reſpect to any, but onely to God alone,
which they prove by the example of every particular man, that hath authority
to make his Maſter or Prince, of his inferiour; but not afterwards to put him
downe againe, or to deprive him of the authority which he gave him, though
he ſhould not beare himſelfe well and gratefully, but diſcourteous rather, and
injuriouſly towards him that gave him firſt this authority.</p>

            <p>And hereby alſo we may gather what the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> meant, when he thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

theſe diſorders were lawfull or appertained to a righteous King, but that ſeeing
they refuſed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o be under the moderate government of their high Prieſts, and other
Governors which God had given them hitherto, &amp; required to be ruled by Kings,
as other Heathen Nations of <hi>Egipt, Babilon, Syria,</hi> &amp; <hi>Perſia</hi> were, whoſe manner of
Government not only Hiſtoriogr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>phers, but Phyloſophers alſo, &amp; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> among
the reſt doth note to have been very tyrannicall, <hi>Ariſt. l. 5. pol. c. 11. Joſeph. l. 6. ant.
c.</hi> 4. yet for that the Jews would needs haue that government, as a matter of more
pomp &amp; glory, then that which hitherto they had had, <hi>Samuel</hi> did firſt iuſinuate to
them, what extortion &amp; wickedneſſe thoſe Heathen Kings did uſe commonly over
their people, in taking their children, ſervants wives, goods, &amp; the like from them,
&amp; that many Kings of Iſrael ſhould do the like, &amp; take it for their right and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
&amp; ſhould oppoſe &amp; tyranize over them, &amp; inforce them to cry out to God
for help, &amp; they ſhould not find remedy, for that ſo heddily they had demanded
this change of Government, which highly diſpleaſed Almighty God.</p>
            <p>And this is the true meaning of that place, if it be well conſidered, and not to

2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10 for their Kings when they ſhould have them, which God foretold many
yeares before they had any, and this is the admonition that King David left unto,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> the 2. his Sonne and ſucceſſour <hi>Salomon,</hi> at his death, and by him to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kiogs and Princes, and for want of obſerving their points of <hi>judgement justice
diſcipline,</hi> and truth, wee ſee not only <hi>Achab,</hi> and <hi>Iezabel</hi> before mentioned
grievouſly puniſhed but many other Kings alſo by God himſelfe, as <hi>Achaz Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes
Ioachim,</hi> and the like which had not been juſtice on Gods part ſo to puniſh
them if it had been lawfull for them to uſe that manner of proceeding towards
their people, as theſe good inſtructors of Princes in out daies moſt fondly, and
wickedly do affirme, and thus much for that place.</p>
            <p>But to the point by what Law the Common-wealthes, did puniſh their evill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
it is by all law divine and human<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> divine for that God dath approve that form
of government which every common-wealth doth chuſe unto it ſelfe, as alſo the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115403:15"/>
conditions, ſtatutes und limitations which it ſelfe ſhall appoint unto her Princes
as largely before hath been declared. And by all human law alſo; for that all law
both naturall, nationall, and poſitive, doth teach us, that Princes are ſubject to
law and order, and that the common-wealth which gave them their authority
for the commmon good of all may, alſo reſtraine or take the ſame way again, if
they abuſe it to the common evill.</p>
            <p>And whereas theſe men ſay, that like as if a private man ſhould make his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
or equall to be his prince, he could not after reſtrain the ſame again, and ſo
neither the common wealth having once delivered away her authority: I anſwer
firſt that the compariſon is not altogether like, for that a privat man though he give
his voice to make a Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce, yet he being but one maketh not the Prince wholly
as the Common wealth doth, and therefore no marvaile though it lie not in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
mans hand to unmake him again, beſides this, a privat man having given
his voice to make his Prince remaineth ſubject and inferiour to the ſame, but the
whole body though it be governed by the Prince as by the head, yet is it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
but ſuperiour to the Prince; neither ſo giveth the common wealth her
authority and power up to any Prince, that ſhe depriveth her ſelf utterly of the
ſame, when need ſhall require to uſe it for her defence for which ſhe gave
it. And finally which is the chiefeſt reaſon of all, and the very ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
indeed of all Kings authority among chriſtians the power and authority which
the Prince hath from the common wealth is in very truth not abſolute, but <hi>poteſtas
vicaria or deligata,</hi> that is to ſay a power deligate, or power by commiſſion from
the common wealth, which is given with ſuch reſtrictions cautels, and conditions
yea, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h ſuch plaine exceptions, promiſes and oathes of both parties, (I meane
between the King and common wealth at the day of his admiſſion or coronation)
as if the ſame be not kept, but willfully broken, on either part, then is the other
not bound to obſerve his promiſe neither, though never ſo ſolemnly made or ſworn
for that in all bargains, agreements and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>racts, where on part is bound mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and reciprocally to the other, by oath, vow, or condition, there, if one ſide
go from his promiſe, the other ſtandeth not obliged to performe his: and this is
ſo notorious by all law, both of nature and nations, and ſo conform to all reaſon
and equity, that it is put among the very rules of both the civill and cannon law
where it is ſaid, <hi>frustra a fidem ſibi quis poſtulat ſervari ab eo, cui ſidem a ſe preſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam

               </gap>miſed, if on the other part, that be not performed
in reſpect whereof this oath was made: as for example, if two ſhould ſweare the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, &amp; after falling upon enemies that
were either kin or friends to the one of them, &amp; he ſhould take their part againſt
his fellow; cleer it is, that the other were not bound to keep his oath toward that
Party that hath ſo wickedly broken it unto him. Nay, not only in this caſe, that is
ſo evident &amp; palpable by nature it ſelf, but in many other alſo, it is both lawfull,
honeſt, &amp; convenient, to leave ſometimes the performance of our oath; as namely,
when the fulfilling thereof ſhould containe any notable hurt or inconvenience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115403:15"/>
Religion, Piety, juſtice, honeſty, or the weal publike, or againſt the party him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to whom it was made, as if a man had ſworn to reſtore a ſword to a mad or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
man, wherewith it were likely he would deſtroy himſelf &amp; others, and other
like caſes, which <hi>Cicero</hi> putteth down in his firſt book of offices, &amp; deduceth them
from the very ground of nature and reaſon it ſelf, &amp; ſaith that it were contrary to
the duty of a good or honeſt man, in ſuch caſes to perform his promiſe. Our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
do alſo alledge the example of <hi>Herod,</hi> that had ſworn to the daughter of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
as to give her what ſhe demanded, who demanding the head of St. John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 24 though <hi>Herod</hi> were ſory for the ſame; yet ſaith the text, <hi>that for his
oaths ſake he commanded it to be performed,</hi> which yet no man will deny, but that it
had been far better left unperformed &amp; the oath better broken then fulfilled, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to another rule of the law, which ſaith, <hi>in malis promiſſis fidem non expedit
obſervari, Regul. 68. in fine 6. Decret.</hi> it is not expedient to keep our promiſe in
things evill promiſed. And finally to this purpoſe, <hi>to wit,</hi> to determine how many
ways an oath may be lawfully broken or not kept, there is a whole title in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
law, containing 36 chapters, wherein are ſet down many &amp; divers moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
&amp; evident caſes about the ſame, determined by <hi>Gregory</hi> the 1. &amp; other antient
Popes &amp; Doctors; and in the ſecond part of the <hi>Decret.</hi> there is alledged this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
out of <hi>Iſidorus,</hi> &amp; eſtabliſhed for law, <hi>in malis promiſſis reſcinde fidem, in turpi
voto muta decretum, impia enim promiſſo quae ſcelere impletur, that is,</hi> in evill promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
perform not your word, in an unlawfull vow or oath change your determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for it is an impious promiſe which cannot be fulfilled but with wickedneſſe,
and the very ſame matter is handled in the queſtion following, which is the fiſt,
throughout 23 whole chapters together. So as nothing is more largly handled in
our law, both Civill &amp; Canon, then this matter of promiſes &amp; oaths how &amp; when
&amp; why, &amp; in what caſes they hold or bind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. All which, to apply it
now unto our matter of Kings, that we have in hand, we are to underſtand that
two evident caſes are touched here, as you ſee, when a Subjects oath or promiſe
of obedience may be left unperformed towards his Prince: the firſt when the
Prince obſerveth not at all his promiſe &amp; oath made to the Common-wealth, at

things, neither fit, either for a Captain in War, or for a Head in Peace; and if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe may be expected while he is King, but detriment to the State, ignominy
to the Nation, danger to Chriſt &amp; Religion, and deſtruction to the Weal Publike,
then it is lawfull for you no doubt, moſt holy Father, to deliver the French from
this band of their oath, &amp; to teſtifie that no promiſe can bind this Nation in perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
to that which may be hurtfull to all Chriſtendome ingenerall. Thus far that
Biſhop and his ſpeech was allowed, and <hi>Chelderick</hi> depoſed, and <hi>Pepin</hi> made King
in his place.</p>
            <p>By this then you ſee the ground whereon dependeth the righteous and lawfull
depoſition and chaſtiſement of wicked Princes, <hi>viz.</hi> their fayling in their oath &amp;
promiſes, which they made at their firſt en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rance, that they would rule and govern
juſtly, according to law, conſcience, equity, and religion, wherein when they fayle,
or wilfully decline, caſting behind them all reſpect of obligation and duty, to the
end for which they were made Princes, and advanced in dignity above the reſt;
then is the Common wealth not only free from all Oaths made of obedience or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance
to ſuch unworthy Princes, but is bound moreover for ſaving the whole
body, to reſiſt, chaſten, &amp; remove ſuch evill heads if ſhe be able, for otherwiſe all
would come to deſtruction, ruine, and publike deſolation.</p>
            <p>And here now comes in all thoſe conſiderations which old Phyloſophers, Law-makers,
&amp; ſuch others as have treated of Common-wealths, are wont to lay
down, of the difference &amp; contrariety between a King &amp; a Tyrant, <hi>Plat. dial. 1 de
repub. Arist. l. 2. pol. c.</hi> 5. for that a King (as both <hi>Plato</hi> &amp; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth declare)
when once he declineth from his duty becommeth a Tyrant, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> of the
beſt &amp; moſt Soveraign thing upon earth, the worſt &amp; moſt hurtful creature under
Heaven; for that as the end &amp; office of a King is to make happy his Common-wealth,
ſo the butt of a Tyrant is to deſtroy the ſame. And finally the whole diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is reduced to the principal head that before I have mentioned, <hi>to wit,</hi> That a
King ruleth according to equity, oath, conſcience, juſtice, &amp; law preſcribed unto
him; &amp; the other is enemy to all theſe conditions, There is a ſpeciall book ſet
forth of this matter, by one <hi>Bartolus,</hi> Father of Civil Law, where the matter is
handled largly, as alſo how lawfull &amp; commendable it is to reſiſt any Tyrant. He
concludeth with <hi>Cicero</hi> in his books <hi>de legibus,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>ut populo Magiſtratus

two worthy Emperors, recorded in our civil Law, who ſaid, <hi>Digna vox est
Majeſtate regnantis, legibus ſe allegatum fateri.</hi> It is a ſpeech worthy the Majeſty
of him that reigneth, to confes that he is bound unto the Laws, &amp; the contrary,

one, as <hi>Suetonus</hi> reporteth, <hi>Memento mihi omnia &amp; in omnes licere,</hi> remember that
all things are lawful unto me &amp; againſt all men without exception. The ſaying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of the famous Emperor <hi>Trajan</hi> deſerveth immortal memory &amp; commendation
who when he delivered the Sword to a Pretor or Governor of <hi>Rome</hi> to do juſtice
he added theſe words, Take this Sword, &amp; if I do reign juſtly, uſe it for me, and if
not, then uſe it againſt me, which in effect &amp; ſubſtance, are the very ſame words,
which our Chriſtian Princes at this day do uſe at their entrance and coronations,

Epiſcop. Tuyenſ. in hiſtor. Hiſpan, Loudou, de molin. lib. de hered. Thus
far goeth this firſt article, which is the more to be marked, for that divers
and thoſe moſt ancient Spaniſh Authors do ſay, that from this <hi>Don Pelayo,</hi>
the ſucceſſion of Kings deſcended ever by propinquity of blood, and yet we
ſee that election was ioyned there withall in expreſſe termes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond part of the law containeth the manner of ceremonies uſed in
thoſe old dayes at the admiſſion of their Kings, which is expreſſed in theſe
words, let the King be choſen aud admitted in the Metropolitan City of this
Kingdome, or at leaſt wiſe in ſome Cathedrall Church, and the night before he
is exalted, let him watch all night in the Church, and the next day</hi>
let him here maſſe, &amp; let him offer at Maſſe a peece of Scarlet, and ſome of his own
money, and after let him communicate, and when they come to lift him up let him
ſtep upon a buckler or target and let the cheife and principall men there preſent
hold the Target, &amp; ſo lifting him up let them &amp; the people cry three times, as hard
as they can, Real, Real, Real. Then let the King command ſome of his own money, to
be caſt among the people, to the quantitie of the hundr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115403:20"/>
on his own Sword in the form of a croſſe, and let no Knight or other man, beare a
Sword that day, but only the King.</p>
            <p>This was the ould faſhion of making Kings in <hi>Spain,</hi> which in effect and
ſubſtance remaineth ſtill, though the manner thereof be ſomewhat altered, for
that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kings be not Crowned, but have an other ceremony for their
admiſſion equall to coronation, which is performed by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
primat of all <hi>Spain,</hi> as the other Coronations before mentioned are by the
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Moguntia</hi> to the Emperour, and by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Gueſna</hi>
to the King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> and by the Arch-Biſhop Praga to the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
and by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Praga</hi> to the King of <hi>Portuga</hi> as was by the
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to the King of England, and by the Arch-Biſhop
<hi>Rhemes</hi> to the King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> of which Realme of France we may not omit
to ſay ſomewhat in particular, ſeeing it is ſo goodly a Kingdome, and ſo neere
to England, not only in Cituation, but alſo in Lawes manners and cuſtomes, and
as the race of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings have come from them in diverſe manners, ſince
the conqueſt, ſo may it be alſo ſuppoſed that the principall ceremonies and
circumſtances of this action of Coronation, hath beene received in like manner
from them.</p>
            <p>Firſt then touching the act of Cornation, and admiſſion of the King of
<hi>France,</hi> even as before I have ſaid of <hi>Spayne,</hi> ſo alſo in this Kingdom do I find
two manners of that action, the one more ancient which the <hi>French</hi> doe ſay
hath indured in ſubſtance from their firſt Chriſtian King named <hi>Clodoueus,</hi>
unto this day, which is nigh Twelve hundred yeares, for that <hi>Clodouius</hi> was
Chriſtened the yeare of our Lord, 490. in the City of <hi>Rhems</hi> by Remigius,
Biſhop of that City, and annointed alſo, and Crowned King by the ſame
Biſhop, which manner and order of anoynting, and Coronation endured after
for about ſix, hundred yeares, unto the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, and King <hi>Phillip</hi>
the firſt his ſonne, both Kings of <hi>France.</hi> At what time (which is about 500.
yeares a gone) both the Chroniclers, and Coſmographers of <hi>France</hi> do teſtifie,
that there was a peculier booke in the library of the Church of <hi>Beuais,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining

                  </gap>eus</hi> unto that time. Which order, for ſo much as toucheth
the ſolemnite of officers in the Coronation and other like circumſtances, was
far different at that time, from that which is now, for that in thoſe dayes there
were no Peers of <hi>France,</hi> appointed to aſſiſt the ſame Coronation, which now
are the chiefe, and the greateſt part of that Solemnitie. Yea <hi>Girard du Hailan</hi>
Secretarie of <hi>France</hi> in his third booke of the affaires, and ſtate of that
Kingdom ſayth, that the ceremonies of Crowning their ould Kings were much
after the faſhon which I noted a little before, out of the law of <hi>Dan Pelay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

firſt King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> after the Moores, for that they were lifted up and carried
about upon a Target by the chiefe ſubjects there preſent as the Spaniards were.</p>
            <p>But as touching the principal point of that action which is the ſubſtance
of admitting the King unto his Royal authority, and oath by him made o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Governing well and juſtly, and of the reciprocall oath of obedience made to
him againe by his ſubjects, it was not much different from that which now
is, as ſhall appeare by the Coronation of the foreſaid <hi>Phillip</hi> the firſt, who
was crowned in the life and preſence of his Father, King <hi>Henry,</hi> after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion

            <p>Thus ſaid the King, and then having aſked every one of the aſſiſtance in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
for his conſent apart and afterwards the whole aſſembly ingenerall, whether
they would ſwear obedience to him or no, and finding all to promiſe with a good will
he paſſed over the feaſt of the aſſention with great ioy in Paris, and after went to
Rhemes with all the Court and Tryan, to celebrate the Coronation upon the
feaſt of Whitſunday.</p>
            <p>Thus far are the words of William de Nangis alleadged in the ſtory of <hi>France</hi>
by Balforeſt, and it is to be noted firſt how the King did r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>The Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Rhemes <hi>being veſted in his pontificall attire, and come to the

I will take order that in all iudgments juſtice ſhall be kept, with equity and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to the end that God of his mercy may conſerve unto me with my people his holy grace and

<hi>Realm</hi> and all my Dominions, all ſuch as the Church hath or ſhall declare for Heriticks
as God ſhall help me and his holy Goſpells. Thus ſweareth the King, and then kiſſeth the
Goſpells, and immediately is ſung. Te Deum laudamus, and after that are ſaid many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
prayers by the Arch-Biſhop, and then is the King veſted, and the ring, ſcepter
Crown and other Kingly Ornaments and Enſignes are brought and put upon him, with
Declaration firſt what they ſignifie, and then particuler prayers are made to God, that their
ſignification may be by the King fulfilled.</p>
            <p>And after all ended the Arch-Biſhop with the Biſhops do bleſſe him, and ſay theſe
words unto him. <q>God which reigneth in Heaven, and governeth all Kingdoms
bleſſe you, &amp;c. Be you ſtable and conſtant, and hold your place and right, from
henceforth which here is committed and layd upon you by the Authority of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, and by this preſent tradition and delivery which we the Biſhops and
other Servants of God do make unto you of the ſame, and remember you in place
convenient, to bear ſo much more reſpect and reverence unto the Clergy, by how
much nearer then other men you have ſeene them to approach to Gods Alter, to
the end that Jeſus Chriſt Mediatour of God and man, may confirme &amp; maintaine
you by the Clergy and people, in this your Royall Seat and Throne; who being
Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, make you raigne with him and his Father, in
the life and glory everlaſting.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ſaith the Arch-Biſhop unto him, and after this he is led by him and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Peeres, unto the ſeat Royall, where the Crown is put upon his head, and many
other large Ceremonies uſed, which may be read in the Author aforeſaid, and are to
long for this place. And yet have I bin the larger in this matter of <hi>France;</hi> for that I
do not think it to be improbable, which this Author and others do note, to wit, that
moſt Nations round about have taken their particuler formes of Anointing and
Crowning their Kings, from this ancient Cuſtome of <hi>France,</hi> though the ſubſtance
thereof, I meane of their ſacring and Anointing, be deduced from examples of far
more antiquity, to wit, from the very firſt Kings among the people of Iſrael. 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 10.
<hi>&amp; 16. 2. Reg.</hi> 2. whom God cauſed to be anointed by his Prieſts and Prophets, in
token of his election, and as a ſinguler priviledge of honour and preheminence unto
them whereof King <hi>David</hi> made ſo great accompt when he ſaid to the Souldier that
had kiſſed <hi>Saul</hi> his enemy in the war. 2. <hi>Reg. 1. quaere non to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of God, and he put him to death for it notwithſtanding <hi>Saul</hi> had been long before
depoſed, and rejected by God, and that himſelfe had lawfully borne Armes againſt
him for many dayes, ſo much was that ceremony of Anointing eſtemed in thoſe daies
and ſo hath it been ever ſince among Chriſtian people alſo, for that Kings hereby are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115403:22"/>
made ſacred, and doe not only participate with Prieſts, but alſo with Chriſt himſelfe
who hath his name of this circumſtance of Anointing as all the world knoweth.</p>
            <p>Probable then I ſay it is, that albeit the ſubſtance of this ceremony of Anointing
King be much elder then the Chriſtian Kingdom of <hi>France:</hi> yet is this particuler rule
and maieſticall manner of doing the ſame by way of Coronation, the moſt ancient in
<hi>Frauce</hi> aboue all other Kingdomes round about, eſpecially if it began with their
firſt Chriſtian King <hi>Clodovious</hi> not full 500. Yeares after Chriſt, as <hi>French</hi> Authors
doe hold. At what time alſo they recount a great miracle of holy Oyle ſent from

remaining for the Anointing of their Kings at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> which point I will not ſtand
to treat or diſcourſe in this place, but rather will referr my reader to the foreſaid
Chapter of <hi>Francis Belforeſt</hi> Chronicler of <hi>France, Belfo. l. 3. Cap.</hi> 17. who alleadgeth
divers writers of almoſt 500. year antiquitie that write of the ſame, but howſoever
that be, very propable it ſeemeth that all the ceremonies of Coronation in <hi>Germany</hi>
and <hi>Polonia</hi> before receited (which had their begining long after the reigne of <hi>Clodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>)
might be taken from thence, &amp; ſo the affinity &amp; likeneſſe of one to the other
doth ſeeme to agree, and <hi>Garibay</hi> alſo the Chronicler of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and Nauarra, in his
22. Booke <hi>Eſtevan, Garribay. lib. 22. c.</hi> 1. talking of this cuſtome of annointing and
Crowning the Kings of Nauarra, ſaith, that this excellent cuſtome began there (I
meane in Nauara) about 800. yeares paſt and was brought in by certain Earls of
Champain of <hi>France</hi> named <hi>Theobaldes</hi> who comming to attaine that Crowne brought
with them that reverent ceremony of Anointing and Crowning their Kings, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the uſe of the <hi>French,</hi> which cuſtome endureth untill this day in that part
of Navarra that is, under the houſe of <hi>Vandome,</hi> albeit in the other that is under the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> (which is firr the greater it was left of in the Year 1513. when <hi>Fardinande</hi>
ſurnamed the Cathol que King of <hi>Spaine</hi> entred thereupon, for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kings are
never Anointed nor Crowned but otherwiſe admitted by the Common wealth.</p>
            <p>But among all other Kingdomes it ſeemeth that <hi>England</hi> hath moſt particularly
taken this cuſtome, &amp; Ceremony from <hi>France,</hi> not only for the reaſon before alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that diverſe of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings have come out of <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>William</hi> Corque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

albeit I have not ſeen any particuler Book of this action in <hi>England,</hi> as in French
there is: yet it is eaſie to gather by ſtories What is uſed in <hi>England</hi> about this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire.</p>
            <p>For firſt of all, that the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>terbury</hi> did ordinarily doe this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in <hi>England,</hi> as the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rhemes</hi> doth it in <hi>France,</hi> there is no doubt,
and with the ſame ſolemnity and honour, according to the condition and ſtate of our
Countrey and Polidor Virgill in his ſtory <hi>Polid. ib. 13 Hiſt Angile in vita Henrici.</hi>
noteth that Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> did interdict and ſuſpend the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> with
his two aſſiſtants the Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and Salisbury, for that in the abſence of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
<hi>Becket</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and without his licence, they did Crown
<hi>King Henry</hi> the ſeconds ſonne, named alſo <hi>Henry,</hi> at his Fathers perſwaſion, and
divers do attribute the unfortunate ſucceſſe of the ſaid <hi>King Henry</hi> the younger that

appointment. Secondly, that the firſt thing which the ſaid Arch-Biſhop requireth
at the new <hi>Kings</hi> hands at his Coronation, is about religion, Church matters and the
Clergie (as in <hi>France</hi> we have ſeen) it appeareth evedently by theſe words which the
ſame Arch-Biſhop <hi>Thomas</hi> (ſurnamed commonly the martyr) remaining in baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wrote to the ſame King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second which are theſe. <hi>Memores ſitis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſionis

for keeping and defending the liberty of the Church when you were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
and Anointed King by Thebaldus our predeceſſour. By which words appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that as the King of England was conſecrated and anointed in thoſe dayes by
the Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury, ſo did he ſweare and give up his Oath alſo in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and for more ſolemnity and obligation, laid it down or rather offered it up with
his owne hands upon the Alter, ſo much as was required of him by the ſaid Arch-Biſhop
and Clergie, for the ſpeciall ſafety of Religion, and theſe Eccleſiaſticall
liberties, which is the ſelfe ſame point that we have ſeene before, as well in the Oath
of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and of the Emperours both Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
and <hi>German.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very like admonition in effect I finde made by another <hi>Thomas</hi> Arch-Biſhop

the fourth, when in a Parliament holden at Coventry, in the Yeare 1404. the King
was tempted by certain temporall men, to take away the temporalities from the

deſired him to conſider his promiſe alſo to all the realm, which was that he would preſerve
unto every man their wright and title, ſo far as in him lay.</hi> By which ſpeech of the Arch-Biſhop
the King was ſo far moved, as he would heare no more of that bil of the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
but ſaid that he would leave the Church in as good eſtate, or better then he found
it, and ſo he did, but yet hereby we come to learne, what Oath the Kings of <hi>England</hi>
do make at their Coronations touching the Church and Clergie.</p>
            <p>The other conditions alſo of good government, are partly touched in the ſpeech
of the Arch-Biſhop, <hi>Holinoſh in his Cro. Page 476. and</hi> 1005. and much more expreſly
ſet down in the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Oath, recorded by ancient writers, for that he
ſweareth as both <hi>Holinſhead</hi> and others do teſtifie, in their Engliſh ſtories, in theſe
very words, to wit.</p>
            <p>That he will during his life, beare reverence and honour unto almightie God, and to his

            <p>Which after he had ſworne, laying his handes upon the Goſpells: then doth the
Arch-Biſhop [turning about to the people] declare what the King hath promiſed and
ſworne, and by the mouth of a harrald at armes aſketh their conſents, whether they

be content to <hi>ſubmit themſelves unto this man as unto their King or no, under the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
propoſed,</hi> whereunto when they have yealded themſelves, then begineth the

ſcepter, &amp; Crown, as before in the <hi>French</hi> Coronation you have heard, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he giveth him the Scepter of <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> and then he adeth alſo the ſame
words of Commiſſion and exortation as the other doth, to wit, <hi>ſtand and hold thy
place and keepe thy Oath,</hi> and thereunto adjoyneth a great communication or treat, on
the behalf of Almighty God, if he ſhould take upon him that dignity without firm
purpoſe to obſerve the things which this day he hath ſworn, and this is the ſumme
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coronation, which you may read alſo by piece meale in <hi>Iohn Stow.

King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4 now laſt mentioned, as alſo of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, at their firſt
entrances to the Crown, for in the admiſſion of K. <hi>Henry, Stow</hi> ſheweth, how the
people were demanded thrice <hi>whether they were content to admit him for their King,</hi>
and that the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canturbury</hi> (who was the ſame <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi>
of whom we ſpeak before) did read unto them what this new King was bound by
Oath unto, and then he took the Ring, wherewith he was to wed him to the
Common-wealth (which wedding importeth as you know an Oath and mutuall
obligation on both ſides in every marriage) and the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> high
Conſtable of <hi>England,</hi> for that day, was willing to ſhew the ſaid Ring to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that they might thereby ſe the band whereby the King was bound unto them.
And then it was put upon his finger, and the King kiſſed the Conſtable in ſigne of
acceptance, fel on his knees alſo to prayer that he might obſerve his promiſe, and
other like Ceremonies, ſaith <hi>Stow,</hi> were uſed, and this was done the 13 of <hi>Octob.</hi>
1359. and therefore upon good reaſon might this ſame Arch-Biſhop put him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

            <p>At the admiſſion alſo of <hi>King Edward</hi> the fourth. 1 the peoples conſent was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

            <p>By all which, and by infinite more that might be ſaid and alleadged in this
matter, and to this purpoſe, it is moſt evident, that this agreement, bargain, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
between the King and his Common-wealth, at his firſt admiſſion, is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and firme (notwithſtanding any pretence or intereſt he hath or may have by

            <p>COncerning the intereſt of Princes before their Coronation, moſt of them have
not failed to find as ſhamles flatterers, as themſelves were either vaine or
wicked Princes, and for my part I am of opinion, that the propoſitions of <hi>Belloy</hi> did
rather hurt and hinder, then profit the Prince; for whom and in whoſe favour he
writ them, is the King of <hi>Navara,</hi> whom hereby be would have admitted to the
Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> without all conſent or admiſſion of the Realm. But I for my
part, as I doubt not greatly of his title by propinquity of bloud, according to the
law <hi>Salique;</hi> ſo on the other ſide, am I of opinion, that theſe propoſitions of <hi>Belloy</hi>
in his behalf, that he ſhould have entered by only title of birth, without conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conſent or approbation of the Realm, as alſo without Oath, Anointing, or
Coronation, yea of neceſſity, without reſtraint or obligation to fulfill any law, or
to obſerve any priviledges to Church, Chapell, Cleargy, or Nobility, or to be
checked by the whole Realm, if he rule amiſſe: theſe things I ſay, are rather to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify,
the people and ſet them more againſt his entrance, then to advance his title;
and therefore in my poore judgment, it was neither wiſely written by the one, not
politiquely permitted by the other. And to the end you may ſe what reaſon I have
to give this cenſure, I ſhall here ſet down his own propoſitions, touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as I find them in his own words. Firſt then he avoucheth, <hi>that all families which
enjoy Kingdoms on the world were placed therein by God only, aud that he alone can chang
the ſame,</hi> which if he referr unto Gods univerſal providence, <hi>quae attingit à fine vſquae

the ground, as our Saviour teſtyfieth, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. no man will deny but all is from
God either by his Ordinance or permiſſion; but if we talke (as we do) of the next
and immediate cauſes of an Empyres, Princes, and of their changes; cleere it is, that
men alſo do and may concurre therein, and that God hath left them lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ſo to do, and to deſpoſe thereof, for the publique benifit, as largly before hath
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115403:24"/>
been declared, and conſequently to ſay that God only doth theſe things, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
nothing to mans judgment therein, is againſt all reaſon, uſe and experience of
the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond propoſition of</hi> Belloy <hi>is,</hi> that where ſuch Princes be once placed in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the Law of ſucceſſion by birth eſtabliſhed; there the Princes children or
next of kin do neceſſarily ſucceed, by only birth without any new choice or approbation of
the people, Nobility, or Clergy, or of the whole Common-wealth together. Apolog. Cathol.
part. 1. parag. 7. <hi>And to this aſſertion he joyneth an other as ſtrange as this, which
is,</hi> that a King never dyeth for that whenſoever or howſoever he ceaſeth by any meanes to
Governe, then entreth the ſucceſſor, by birth not as heyre to the former, but as lawfull go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Realm without any admiſſion at all, having his authority only by the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his birth, and not by addoption or choice of any. Apolog. pro Rege. c. 6. &amp; 34.
<hi>Which two propoſitions albeit they have been ſufficiently refuted, by that which
hath been ſpoken in the laſt two chapters going before, yet ſhall I now again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
more amply the untruth thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Other two propoſitions he addeth,</hi> Apolog. Cathol. part. 2. parag. 7. &amp; pro Rege
c. 9. That a Prince once entred to Government and ſo placed as hath been ſaid, is under
no law or reſtraint at all of his authority, but that himſelfe only is the quick and living
law, and that no limitation can be given unto him by any power under heaven except it
be by his own will and that no Nation or Common-wealth can appoint or preſcribe how
they will obey or how their Prince ſhall govern them, but muſt leave his authority free from
all bands of law, and this either Willingly or by violence, is to be procured. <hi>By which
words it ſeemeth that he painteth out a perfect patterne of a tyrannicall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which how it did further the King of</hi> Navar <hi>I do not know.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His other propoſition is,</hi> Apolog. pro Rege Cap. 20. That albeit the heire apparant
which is next by birth to any Crown, ſhould be never ſo impotent, or unfit to Govern, as if
(for examples ſake) he ſhould be deprived of his ſences, mad, furious, lunatique, a fool, or
the like, or that he ſhould be known on the other ſide to be moſt malicious, wicked, vitious
or abominable, or ſhould degenerate into a very beaſt, yea if it were known that he ſhould
goe about to deſtroy the Common Wealth, and drowne the ſhip which he had to guide, yet
(ſaith this man) he muſt be ſacred and holy unto us, and admitted without contradiction to
his inheritance, which God and nature hath laid upon him, and his direction rèſtraint or
puniſhment muſt only be remited to God alone; for that no man or Common-wealth, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
or reſtrain him. <hi>Which I doubt not will ſeeme unto you rather belly and baſe
doctrine, then to come from the head of any learned or diſcreet man, that regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the end why Common-wealths, and Kingdoms,</hi> and all Governments were
ordained by God and nature, and not the flattering or adoring of any one miſerable
man that ſhall ſtand over them to deſtroy the whole.</p>
            <p>But now to the particuler matter that we are to treat, which is, what is to be
attributed to this ſucceſſion or propinquity of birth alone, I am of opinion, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
their want not reaſons on both ſides among learned men, what kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
Governours to Common-wealths is beſt, either by ſimple and free election
only or by ſucceſſion of birth: my opinion (I ſay) is, that ſucceſſion is much to be
preferred, not for that it wanteth all difficulties and inconveniences (which all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
things uppon earth have) but like as before I have ſhewed of the particuler
Government of a Monarchy in reſpect of other forms of regiment to wit, that is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115403:25"/>
wanted not all, but had fewer inconveniences then their formes of Regiment have
ſo ſay I alſo of this, that albeit ſome inconveniences want not in ſucceſſion yet are
they commonly far leſſe and fewer, then would follow by meere election which are
ſubiect to great and continuall dangers of ambition, emulation, diviſion, ſedition, and
contention, which do bring with them evident peril of univerſall deſtruction and
diſolation of the whole body, and this at every change of the prince, which change
on the other ſide, is much aſſured by ſucc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſion, for that great occaſions of ſtrife
and contention are there by cut of.</p>
            <p>2. And beſides this, the Prince who is in preſent poſſeſſion knowing that his ſon
or next of kin, is to be his heire, hath more care to leave the realme in good order,
as we ſee that the huſbandman hath to till and manure that ground, which is his
owne, and to remaine to his poſterity.</p>
            <p>3. A third commodity alſo there is, for that leſſe mutations and alterations are
ſeen in the Common-wealth, where ſucceſſion prevaileth, for that the ſonne follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his father, doth commonly retaine the ſame friends, councellors, officers, and
ſervants, which his father had before him: purſueth the ſame actions and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
with the ſame manner of proceeding for the moſt part; whereas he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
by election, being an aliene to him that went before him, and never lightly
his friend, doth change alter and turne upſidowne all things.</p>
            <p>4. Furthermore (which may be alſo a fourth reaſon) he that entereth by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for that he is either borne a Prince, or hath been much reſpected ſtill for his title
to the Crowne, bringeth with him leſſe paſſions of hatred, emulation, anger, envie,
or revenge againſt particuler men (for that no man durſt offend him) then doth he
which entereth by only election, for that he having bin a ſubject &amp; equall to others
before his advancement, and thereby holding contention with many, eſpetially at
this election, muſt needs have matter of quarrell with many, which he will ſeeke ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
to revenge when he is in authority, as one the other ſide alſo ſuch as were his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals
before will beare him leſſe reſpect and more unwillingly be under him, then
by birth he had been there Soveraigne.</p>
            <p>5. Theſe and diverſe other are the comodities of ſucceſſion, whereunto we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
add the preheminence and priveledge of primogenitura, and auncetrie of birth ſo
much reſpected and commended by holy writ, not only in men, but in all other cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures
alſo, whoſe firſt borne were dedicated to God himſelfe, and one notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
among other occurreth to my mind of the two ſonnes of Iſack, of the which
two albeit God hath ordained to chuſe the younger before he was borne, as S. Paul
teſtifieth, and to reject the elder, that is to ſay, that Iacob ſhould inherite the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
&amp; not Eſau: Yet would God have his yonger to procure the ſaid priviledge of
elderſhip from Eſau by divers means as firſt by bargain, and after by guile according
to the ſtorie we read in <hi>Geneſ. 15 and 49. Deut. 21. and 15. 2 Paralip. 21 and 3 Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi>
3. <hi>and 2. Rom. 9. and</hi> 13: <hi>Geneſ. 28 and</hi> 27. Out of which ſtory two points may
be pondered much to our purpoſe, firſt that primogenitura or elderſhip of birth (as

and ſucceſſions of Kings were commonly among that people, for that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> God would ſhew even in this begining, that yet this priviledge
was not ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, but that upon juſt cauſes it might be broken, as it was by this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115403:25"/>
his choyce of Iacob the yonger and rejecting Eſau the Elder, and many times after in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of government the ſame was practiſed by God himſelfe, as when Iudah the fourth
tribe and not Ruben the 1 and Eldeſt was apointed by God enioy the ſcepter and Crown
of the Iewes, as alſo when King David died not in his firſt ſecond or third ſonne, but his
tenth in order, to wit, Solomon who was alſo the fourth that he had by Berſabe, was
appointed for his ſucceſſor, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 29 and, 9. <hi>Exod, 1. 2. Reg.</hi> 5. 1. Paral. 3.</p>
            <p>So that in very deed we have here both our two caſes that were propounded in the
begining, over ruled and determined by authority and example of holy writ it ſelfe,
namely; and 1 of all, that priority and propinquitie of blood in ſucceſſion, is greatly to be
honored regarded and preferred in all affairs of digni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie and principallity, (which is the
ſecond point) are we not ſo abſolutly and peremptorily bound thereunto alwaies, but
that upon iuſt and urgent occaſions that Courſe may be altered and broken.</p>
            <p>Which licence or liberty is indeed, the only (or at leaſt wiſe) the moſt principall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for ſuch inconveniences as before I ſhewed to be farr leſſe and fewer then are wont
to follow of bare election alone yet did I confeſſe alſo, that ſome did or might fall out,
as namely, that the perſon who by ſuceſſion of blood is next, may be unable or un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
to governe, in which caſes the remedy is (as before hath been declared) hitherto
helpe and aſſiſt him by lawe directions and wiſe councells, if he be capable thereunto or
elſe to remove him and take in another of the ſame blood royal (though further of in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
or propinquity) in his place.</p>
            <p>And this is and hath ben the Cuſtom &amp; practice of all Kingdoms and Commonwealths
from the begining, ſince ſucceſſion hath ben eſtabliſhed among them, and by this means
we come to remedy the difficulties and inconveniences of both kinds of making our
Kings &amp; Princes, which are election, and ſucceſſion; for by ſucceſſion we do remedy the
inconveniences and dangers before mentioned of bare electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to wit, of ſtrife, banding,
ambition, &amp; the like, and by this other mean of adding alſo election, conſent, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the Realme to ſucceſſion; we remedy the inconveniences of bare ſucceſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
which inconveniences are principally, that ſome un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pt impotent or evill Prince
may be offered ſome times to enter by, periority of blood; whereof the Realme may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
it ſelfe, by this other meanes of not admitting him, ſo as election by ſucceſſion, and
ſucceſſion again by election is ſalved, and the one made a preſervative and treacle to the
other, and this is the wiſdom and high policy left by God and nature, to every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth,
for their own conſervation and maintenance, and every man that is of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and iudgment, and void of paſſion will not onely allow, but alſo highly commend
the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now then to anſwer in particular to the two queſtions. 1 what is to be attributed to
ſucceſſion alone, and ſecondly what intereſt a Prince hath thereby to any Crowne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he be Crowned or admitted by the common wealth. To the firſt I ſay, that to
ſucceſſion alone, or priority of blood only, great honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reverence, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſpect ought to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s before hath been declared, for that it is the principall circumſtance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
which leadeth us to the next ſucceſſion of the Crown infalibly, and without a
ſtrife: if his propinquity be cleare and evident, and that other nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſary circumſtances
and conditions do concur alſo in the ſame perſon; which conditions were appointed
and ſet down at the ſame time, and by the ſame authority that this law of ſucceſſion was
eſtabliſhed, for that both the one and the other of theſe 2. poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, were ordained by the
Common-Wealth, to wit, that the elder and firſt in blood, ſhould ſucc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, and that he
ſhould be ſuch a perſon as can and will govern to the publike weale of al.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:115403:26"/>
To the ſecond queſtion I anſwer, that an heyre apparent to a Crown before his Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and admiſſion by the Realm, if he have the conditions before required, hath the
ſame intereſt to the Kingdom, which the King of <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>Ceſar</hi> hath to the Germain
empyre after his election and before he be crowned or to uſe a more familiar example
to <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> as the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> hath to the majoralty, after he is choſen, and before
he be admitted, or have taken his Oath. For as this man in rigour is not truly Mayor,
nor hath not his juriſdiction before his Oath and admiſſion, nor the other is properly
Emperour before he be crowned: ſo is not an heyre apparent, truly King though his
Predeceſſour be dead, and he next in ſucceſſion, untill he be crowned or admitted to the
Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>Another example is there in Mariage alſo, whereby our matter is made more playn;
for in this contract go both the betrothing and actuall joyning together of the parties
in wedlock, the firſt is done by words <hi>de futuro,</hi> or for the time to come, and is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Mariage, but eſpouſal only, the other is by words <hi>depreſenti,</hi> that is, by mutual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
conſent given of both parties, and this ſecond is only and properly true Marriage,
which two points are expreſly repreſented in the ſtate of an Heyre apparent, and of a
Crowned King; for that the Heyre apparent by propinquity of blood, is only eſpouſed or
be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rothed to the Common-Wealth, for the time to come, and is married afterwards by
preſent mutuall conſent of both parties, in the contract and knitting up of the matter, as
his Coronation, by the Oathes which either part maketh the one to take the other, and
by putting on the ring and other, wedding garments before mentioned in their Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by all which the heyre apparent, (which before was but eſpouſe) is made now
the true King and husband of the Common-Wealth, which before he was not, by only
ſucceſſion; but only a betrothed ſpouſe or deſigned King.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it followeth alſo, that the Common-Wealth oweth no allegeance or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
unto the heyre apparent in rigour of Juſtice, untill he be crowned or admitted,
though his Predeceſſour be dead, for that in very deed untill that time, he is not their
true King and Soveraign, though for better keeping of order and avoyding of Tumul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>,
all Common-Wealths lightly that have their Princes by ſucceſſion, have ordayned in
theſe latter ages, that from the death of the former Princes, all ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ters of government
ſhall paſſe in the name of his next ſucceſſor (if his ſucceſſion be cleare) and this (as I
ſay) for avoyding of garboyles, and under ſuppoſall of confirmation and approbation
afterward of the Common-Wealth, at his Coronation; for which cauſe alſo, and for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
accompt of yeares, it was ordained that the begining of the ſucceſſors reigne, ſhould
be reckoned from the day of the death of his Predeceſſor, and not from the day of his
Coronation, as otherwiſe in rigour it ought to be, and as in old time it was accuſtomed
to be as <hi>Girard</hi> Secretary and Chronicler of <hi>France,</hi> doth wiſely note, in his third book
of the eſtate and affaires of <hi>France, Girard die Haillan l. 3. del. eſtate pag.</hi> 241. to wit, that
Kings in old time were wont to accompt the yeares of their reignes from the day only
of their anointing and Coronation.</p>
            <p>This point alſo that heyres apparent are not true Kings untill their Coronation: how
juſt ſoever their title of ſucceſſion otherwiſe be, and though their Predeceſſours be dead;
it might be confirmed by many other Arguments, but eſpecially and above all others;
for that the Realm is asked again three times at their Coronation, <hi>whether they will have
ſuch a man to be King,</hi> or no, as before hath been ſhewed, which thing were in vain to ask
if he were truly King, as <hi>Belloy</hi> ſaith, before his Coronation.</p>
            <p>Again we ſee in all the formes and different manners of Coronations, that after the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115403:26"/>
Prince hath ſworn divers times to govern well and juſtly, then do the ſubjects take o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Oathes of obedience and allegiance, and not before, which argueth that before they
were not bound unto him by allegiance, and as for the Princes of <hi>England,</hi> it is expreſly
noted by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtoriographers in their Coronations. how that no aliegeance is due
unto them before they be Crowned, and that only it happened to <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, among
all other <hi>Kings,</hi> his Predeceſſour to have this priviledg, and this for his exceeding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſſe,
and for the great affection of the people towards him, that he had homage
done unto him, before his Coronation, and Oath taken. Whereof <hi>Polidor</hi> writeth in theſe

                  <hi>Engliſh,</hi> is this Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> after he had finiſhed his fathers funeralls, cauſed a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to be gathered at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where whilſt conſultation was had, according
to the ancient cuſtome of <hi>England,</hi> about creating a new King; behold certain of the
Nobility of their own free wils, began to ſwear obedience and loyalty unto him;</q> which
demonſtration of love and good will, is well known that it was never ſhewed to any
Prince before, until he was declared <hi>King:</hi> So great was the hope that men had of the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlines
of this P. <hi>Henry,</hi> even from his tender age, and the very ſame thing expreſſeth
<hi>Iohn Stow</hi> alſo in his Chronicle in theſe words. <hi>To this noble Prince by aſſent of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
all the States of the Realm after 3 dayes, offered to do fealty before he was Crowned,
or had ſolemnized his Oath well and juſtly to Governe the Common-wealth, which offer before
was never found to be made to any Prince of</hi> England, <hi>Stow in the begining of the life of</hi> K.
<hi>Henry</hi> 5. In whoſe narration as alſo in that of <hi>Polidor</hi> it may be noted: that K. <hi>Henry</hi>
the 5. was not called King untill after his Coronation, but only Prince, though his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. had been dead now almoſt a moneth before. And ſecondly that
the Parliament conſulted <hi>de Rege creando more majorum</hi> (as <hi>Polidor</hi> his words are) that
is making of a new King according to the ancient cuſtome of their anceſtors, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
that he was not yet King, though his father were dead, nor that the manner of
our old <hi>Engliſh</hi> anceſtors, was to account him ſo before his admiſsion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that this demonſtration of good will of the Nobility to acknowledge him
for King before his Coronation, <hi>and Oath ſelemuized well and juſtly to Governe the
Realm,</hi> was very extraordinary and of meere good will. And laſt of all, <hi>that this was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
done to any Prince before K.</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 5, all which points do demonſtrate, that it is
the Coronation and admiſſion, that maketh a perfect and true King; whatſoever the
title by ſucceſſion be otherwiſe, And that except the admiſſion of the Common-wealth
be joyned to ſucceſſion, it is not ſufficient to make a lawfull King, and of the
two, the ſecond is of far more importance, to wit the conſent and admiſſion of the
Realm, then nearneſſe of bloud by ſucceſsion alone.</p>
            <p>This I might prove by many exampl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

admiſsion of the Realm were <hi>Kings,</hi> againſt the order of ſucceſsion, and very ſpecially
it may be ſeene, in the two examples before mentioned of the admiſsion of the two
Kings <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> both ſurnamed the 4. whoſe entrances to the Crowne, if a

ſureſt of their titles, upon the election conſent, and good will of the people. <hi>As in
their laſt words to their friends in Sr. Tho. Moore and Stow.</hi> Yea both of them at their
dying daies having ſome remorſe of conſcience, (as it ſeemed) for they had cauſed ſo
many men to dye for maintenance of their ſeverall Rights and titles, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad no better way
to appeaſe their own minds; but by thinking that they were placed in that roome by
the voice of the Realm, and conſequently might lawfully defend the ſame, and puniſh
ſuch as went about to deprive him.</p>
            <p>You ſhall find, if you looke into the doings of Princes in all ages, that ſuch Kings as
were moſt politique, and had any leſt doubt or ſuſpition of troubles about the title,
after their deaths, have cauſed their ſonnes to be Crowned in their own dayes, truſting
more to this, then to their title by ſucceſsion, thongh they were never ſo lawfully and
lineally diſcended. And of this I could alleadg you many examples out of divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
but eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi> ſince the laſt line of <hi>Capetus</hi> came unto that Crown; for
this did <hi>Hugh Capetus</hi> himſelf procure to be done, to <hi>Robert</hi> his Eldeſt ſonne, in his
owne daies, and the like did King <hi>Robert</hi> procure for his younger ſon <hi>Henry</hi> the 1. as
<hi>Girard</hi> holdeth, and excluded his elder onely by Crowning <hi>Henry</hi> in his owne daies:
<hi>Henry</hi> alſo did intreate the States of France, to admit and Crown <hi>Philip</hi> the 1. his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
ſon, whilſt himſelf reigned, <hi>An.</hi> 1131. and this mans ſon <hi>Luys Le Cros,</hi> did the ſame

which were Crowned in their fathers life time and this <hi>Luys</hi> again the younger which
is the ſeaventh of that name; for more aſſuring of his ſon named <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
the Realm to admit and Crown him alſo in his own dayes, with that great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
which in the former chapter hath ben declared.</p>
            <p>And for this very ſame cauſe of ſecurity, it is not to be doubted, but that alwaies the

his own daies. Our King <hi>Henry</hi> alſo the 2 of <hi>England,</hi> conſidering the alteration of that

the like might happen alſo, after him, cauſed his eldeſt ſonne named, likewiſe <hi>Henry,</hi> to
be Crowned in his life time, ſo as <hi>England</hi> had two K. <hi>Henries</hi> living at one time with
equall authority, and this was done in the 16. year of his Reign, and in the year of our
Lord 1170 but his device had no good ſucceſſe; for that K. <hi>Henry</hi> the younger made
war ſoone after upon K. <hi>Henry</hi> the elder, and had both the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>
and many Nobles of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> to take his part; for which cauſe it is
thought that this thing hath never been put in practiſe again ſince that time in <hi>England,</hi>
but yet hereby it is evident, what the opinion of the world was in thoſe daies of the

any preſidents and examples of holy Scripturs, ſome other might chance to reply, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115403:27"/>
this was by particuler priviledge, wherein God Almighty would deale and diſpoſe of
things againſt the ordinary courſe of mans law, as beſt liked himſelfe, whoſe will is more
then Law, and whoſe actions are right it ſelfe, for that he is Lord of all, and to be limitted
by no rule, or law of man, but yet that this is not properly the Act of a Common-Welth.</p>
            <p>Thus (I ſay) it may be, that ſome man would reply, and therefore having ſtore enough
of plain and evident matter, which hath no exception; for that it hath happened in ſetled
Common-Wealths, and thoſe near home, where the law of ſucceſſion is received and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
to wit, in <hi>Spayne, France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall retyre my ſelfe to them alone: but
yet putting you in mind before <hi>I</hi> paſſe any further, that it is a matter much to be marked
how God dealt in this point with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at the begining, 1. <hi>Règ.</hi> 8. after he
had granted to them, that they ſhould have the ſame government of Kings, that other
Nations round about them had, whoſe Kings did ordinarily reigne by ſucceſſion, as ours
do at this day, and as all the Kings of the <hi>Jewes</hi> did afterwards, and yet this notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
God at the beginning, at the very entrance of their firſt Kings, would ſhew plainly
that this Law of ſucceeding of the one the other, by birth and propinquity of blood,
though for the moſt part, it ſhould prevaile) yet that it was not ſo preciſely neceſſary, but
that upon juſt cauſes it might be altered.</p>
            <p>For proofe whereof, we are to conſider, that albeit he made Saul a true and lawfull
King over the Iewes, and conſequent alſo gave him all Kingly priviledges benefits and
prerogatives belonging to that degree and ſtate, whereof one principal (as you know) is
to have his Children ſucceed after him in the Crowne: yet after his death God ſuffered
not any one of his generation to ſucceed him, though he left behinde him many Children
and among others <hi>Iſboſeth</hi> a Prince of 40. Yeares of age 2. <hi>Reg. 1. and</hi> 21. whom <hi>Abner</hi>
the generall captain of that nation, with eleaven tribes followed for a time, as their
lawfull Lord and maſter by ſucceſſion, untill God cheked them for it, and induced them
to reiect him though heire apparent by diſcent, and to cleave to <hi>David</hi> newly elected
King, who was a ſtranger by Birth, and no King at all to the King deceaſed.</p>
            <p>And if you ſay here that this was for the ſinne of <hi>Saul.</hi> whom God had reiected I do
confeſſe it, but yet this is nothing againſt our purpoſe, for that we pretend not that a
Prince that is next in blood can iuſtly be put back, except it be for his own defects, or
thoſe of his anceſtors. And more over I would have you conſider, that by this it is evident
that the fault of the father may prejudicate the ſonnes right to the Crowne, albeit the
ſonne hath no part in the fault, as we may ſee in this example not only of <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi> that
was puniſhed and deprived for the offence of <hi>Saul</hi> his Father (notwithſtanding he
had been proclaimed King as hath been ſaid) but alſo of <hi>Ionathus Saules</hi> other ſonne, who
ſo good a man, and ſo much praiſed in holy Scripture, and yet he being ſlaine in Warr,
and leaving a ſonne named <hi>Mephiboſeth</hi> he was put back alſo, 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 5. though by neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of blood he had great intereſt in the ſucceſſion and much before <hi>David.</hi>

            <p>But <hi>David</hi> being placed in the Crowne by election, free conſent, and admiſſion of the
people of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> as the Scripture plainly teſtifieth (though by motion and direction of

            </p>
            <p>True it is, that the Scripture recounteth how <hi>Adonias Davids</hi> elder ſonne, that was
of rare beauty &amp; a very goodly young Prince, ſeeing his Father now very ould and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and to lie on his death bed, and himſelfe heire apparent by antiquitie of blood,
after the death of <hi>Abſalon,</hi> his elder brother that was ſlain before, he had determined
to have proclaimed himſelfe heir apparent in Ieruſalem before his Father died, 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 1.
and for that purpoſe had ordained a great aſſembly and banquet, had called unto it both
the high prieſt <hi>Abiather,</hi> and diverſe of the Cleargie as alſo the generall Captaine of all
the army of <hi>Iſraell</hi> named <hi>Ioah,</hi> with other of the Nobillity and with them all the reſt
of his bretheren, that were ſonnes to <hi>King David,</hi> ſaving only <hi>Solomon,</hi> togeather with
many other Princes and great men, both ſpirituall and temporall of that eſtate, and had
prepared for them a great feaſt, meaning that very day to proclaime himſelfe heire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
to the Crowne, and to be Crowned, as indeed by ſucceſſion of blood it appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him: and this he attempted ſo much the rather, by councell of his friends, for
that he ſaw the King his Father very ould and impotent, and ready to die, and had taken
no order at all for his ſucceſſor, and moreover <hi>Adonias</hi> had underſtood, how that <hi>Berſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
Solomons</hi> Mother had ſome hope to have her ſonne Reigne after <hi>David,</hi> upon a certaine
promiſe that <hi>David</hi> in his youth had made unto her thereof, as alſo ſhe had in the ſpeciall

            <p>Vpon theſe reaſons and perſwaſions (I ſay) the good ould King was content that

anoint him, and after that he ſhould be brought back, and placed in the royall Throne
in the palace, and ſo indeed he was, at what time King <hi>David</hi> himſelfe being not able
through impotencie, to riſe out of his bed, did him honour and reverence from the place
where he lay; for ſo ſaith the Scriptures <hi>Adoravit Rex in lectulo ſuo,</hi> king <hi>David</hi> adored
his Sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> thus Crowned, even from his bed, all which no doubt though it
may ſeeme to have been wrought by humane meanes and policy, yet muſt we confeſſe
that it was principally by the ſpeciall inſtinct of God himſelfe, as by the ſequell and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

Majeſtrates, and common wealths, about admitting or refuſing of Princes to Reigne or not
to Reigne ever them, when their deſignements are to good ands, and for juſt reſpects and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

Whereof no one thing can give a more evident proofe, then that which enſued after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to Prince <hi>Roboam,</hi> the Lawfull Sonne, and heire of this King <hi>Salamon,</hi> who after
his Fathers death comming to <hi>Sichem</hi> where all the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
for his Coronation, and Admiſſion, according to his right by ſucceſſion,
3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 12. For untill that time we ſee he was not accounted true King, though his
Father was dead, and this is to be noted, the people began to purpoſe unto him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
conditions, for taking away of ſome hard and heavy impoſitions, laid upon them
by <hi>Salomon</hi> his Father, (an evident preſident of the oath and conditions that Princes
do ſwear unto in theſe dayes at their Coronation) whereunto when <hi>Roboam</hi> refuſed
to yeald ten Tribes of the twelve refuſed to admit him for their King, 3. <hi>Reg</hi> 11.
but choſe rather one <hi>Ieroboam</hi> Robohams ſervant, that was a meere ſtranger and but
of poore parentage, and made him there lawfull King and God allowed thereof as
the Scripture in expreſſe words doth teſtifie: and when <hi>Roboam</hi> that tooke himſelfe to
be openly Injured heereby, would by armes have purſued his Title, and had gathered
together an Army of a hundred and foure-ſcore thouſand choſen ſouldiers (as the
ſcripture ſayth) 5 <hi>Rig. 12. and</hi> 21. to puniſh theſe rebells as he calle them, and to
reduce theſe 10. tribes to their due obedience of their naturall Prince: God appeared
unto one <hi>Semejah</hi> a holy man, and bad him goe to the camp of <hi>Roboam,</hi> and tell them
plainly that he would not have them to fight againſt their Brethren. that had
choſen another King, but that every man ſhould goe home to his houſe, and live
quietly vnder the King, which each party had, and ſo they did, and this was the end of
that tumult which God for the ſins of <hi>Salomon</hi> had permitted and allowed of. And thus
much by the way I thought good to touch ont of holy Scripture, concerning the Iewiſh,
Common-Wealth, even at the begining; for that it may give light to all the reſt which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I am to treate of; for if God permitted and allowed this in his own Common wealth,
that was to he the example and patern of all others, that ſhould enſue: no doubt but that

this mans Son, and <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> the 3. <hi>Don Garzia</hi> and <hi>Don Ordonio</hi> the ſecond, all

to the Crown his elder Son, <hi>Don Ordonio</hi> the 3. of his name, in the yeer of our Savior

29. An. 950. which is the cauſe, why the Kings brother, &amp; not his Son, ſucceeded in

For in very truth we cannot by any other meanes defend the Title of <hi>Hugh Capet</hi>

&amp; liberties, then under you the inheritour by neerneſſe of bloud, in oppreſſing
ſtrange cuſtoms &amp; cruelty. For even as thoſe which are to make a voyage in a ſhip
upon a dangerous Sea, do not ſo much reſpect whether the Pylot which is to guide
the ſtern be owner of the ſhip or no, but rather whether he be skilfull, valiant, &amp; like
to bring them in ſafety to their ways end, or to drown them among the waves: even
ſo our principall care is, that we have a good Prince to lead and guide us happily in
this way of civill &amp; politike life, which is the end why Princes were appointed, for
that this man is fitter to be our King. This meſſage did the States of <hi>France</hi> ſend to
<hi>Charles of Lorrain</hi> in defence of their doings, &amp; with this he loſt his ſucceſſion for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

Kings as have iſſued out of this line of <hi>Hugo Capet us</hi> unto this day.</p>
            <p>And this ſpoken now of the ſecond line of <hi>France,</hi> I take to be ſufficient for proof
of our purpoſe, without going any further, for that if we do but number theſe Kings
already named, that have reigned in this ſecond race, from K. <hi>Pepin</hi> downwards unto
<hi>Hugh Capet</hi> (which are about 17 or 18 Kings in 238 yeeres) we ſhall find that not
ſome few, but the moſt part of them did both enter and enjoy their crowns and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities

Common wealth hath authority to judge of the lawfulneſſe of the cauſes, and
conſidering further that it is in their owne affaire, and in a matter that hath
his whole beginning, continuance and ſubſiſtance from them alone, I meane
from the Common wealth, for that no man is King or Prince by inſtitution of
nature, as before hath been declared, but every King and Kings ſon, hath his
dignity and preheminence above other men, by authority onely of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth: God doth allow for a juſt and ſufficient cauſe in this behalfe,
the onely will and judgement of the weal publick it ſelfe, ſuppoſing alwayes
(as in reaſon we may) that a whole Realme will never agree by orderly way
of judgement (for of this onely I meane and not of any particular faction of
private men againſt the heyre apparent) to exclude or put back the next heyr
in blood and ſucceſſion without a reaſonable cauſe, in their ſight and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurre.
And ſeeing that they only are to be judges of this caſe, we are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
that what they determine, is juſt and lawfull for the time, and if at one
time they ſhould determine one thing, and the contrary at another (as they
did often in <hi>England</hi> during the contention between <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and
in other like occaſions) what can a private man judge otherwiſe, but that
they had different reaſons and motions to leade them at different times, and
they being properly lords and owners of the whole buſines committed unto
them, it is enough for every particular man to ſubject himſelfe to that which
his Common wealth doth in this behalfe, and to obey ſimply without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inquiſition, except he ſhould ſee that open injuſtice were done therin, or
God manifeſty offended, and the Realme indangered.</p>
            <p>Open injuſtice I call when not the true Common wealth, but ſome faction
of wicked men ſhould offer to determine this matter, without lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Realme committed to them, and I call manifeſt offence of God, and
danger of the Realme, when ſuch a man is preferred to the Crowne, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
that he wil do what lyeth in him to the prejudice of them both, I mean
both of Gods glory and the publick wealth: as for example, if a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Moor</hi>
or ſome other notorious wicked man, or tyrant ſhould be offered by ſucceſſion
or otherwiſe to governe among Chriſtians, in which caſes every man (no
doubt) is bound to reſiſt what hee can, for that the very end and intent for
which all government was firſt ordeined, is herein manifeſtly impugned.</p>
            <p>From this conſideration, of the weal publick, are to be reduced all other
conſiderations of moſt importance, for diſcerning a good or evill Prince. For
that whoſoever is moſt likely to defend, preſerve, and benefit moſt his Realme
and ſubjects, he is moſt to be allowed and deſired, as moſt conforme to the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115403:38"/>
end for which government was ordained.</p>
            <p>And on the contrary ſide, he that is leaſt like to do this, deſerveth leaſt to
be preferred, and here doth enter alſo that conſideration, which divers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealths had in putting back oftentimes children and impotent people
(though otherwiſe next in blood) from ſucceſſion, and preferring more able
men though further off by deſcent, for that they were more like to defend wel
their Realme and Subjects then the others were.</p>
            <p>But to proceed more diſtinctly and more perſpicuouſly in this matter, I
would have you call to minde one point among others, out of <hi>Girard</hi> the
French author, <hi>Girard lib. 3. de l' Eſtat. pag.</hi> 242. to wit, that the King of
France in his Coronation is new apparalled three times in one day, once as
a Prieſt, and then as a judge, and laſt as a King armed. Thereby to ſignifie
three things committed to his charge, firſt Religion, then Juſtice, then man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and chivalry, for the defence of the Realme.</p>
            <p>This diviſion ſeemeth to me very good and fit, and to comprehend all that
a weal-publick hath need of, for her happy ſtate and felicity, both in ſoule
and body, and for her end, both ſupernaturall and naturall. For by the firſt
which is Religion, her Subjects do attaine unto their end ſpirituall and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,
which is the ſalvation of their ſoules, and by the ſecond and third,
which are juſtice and defence, they enjoy their felicity temporall, which is
to live in peace among themſelves, and ſafety from their enemies, for which
cauſe it ſeemeth that theſe are the three points which moſt are to be regarded
in every Prince, that commeth to government, and much more in him that is
not yet admitted thereunto, but offereth himſelfe to the Common wealth for
the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>poſe.</p>
            <p>And for that the latter two of theſe three points, which are juſtice and
manhood, hath been often had in conſideration, in the examples of changes
before mentioned, and the firſt point which is Religion, hath rarely or never
at all been talked of, for that in former times the Prince and the people were
alwayes of one and the ſame Religion, and ſcarce ever any queſtion or doubt
fell in that behalfe (which yet in our dayes is the principall difference and
chiefeſt difficulty of all other) for theſe cauſes (I ſay) ſhall I accommodate my
ſelfe to the circu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtance of the time, wherein wee live, and to the preſent

               </gap> us about the ſucceſſion of <hi>England,</hi> and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
aſide thoſe other two conſiderations of juſtice and chivalry in a King,
which are far leſſe important then the other (though yet ſo highly regarded
by ancient Common wealths) I ſhall treate principally of Religion, in this
place, as of the firſt and higheſt, and moſt neceſſary point of all other, to bee
conſidered in the admiſſion of any Prince, for the profit of his Subjects: for
that without this, he deſtroyeth all, and with this, albeit he ſhould have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in the other two points of juſtice and manhood, yet may it be holpen,
or his defect or negligence may be ſupplyed much by others, as after I ſhall
ſhew more in particular, but if he want feare of God, or care of Religion,
or be perverſly perſwaded therein, the domage of the weale publique is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable.
Firſt of all then, for better underſtanding of this point, we are to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115403:38"/>
ſuppoſe, that the firſt chiefeſt, and higheſt end that God and nature appointed
to every Common-wealth, was not ſo much the temporall felicity of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as the ſupernaturall and everlaſting of the ſoule, and this was not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to the Jewes by holy ſcripture, but alſo unto the Gentiles and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
by the inſtinct and light of nature it ſelfe. For by this light of naturall
reaſon, the learned ſort of them came to underſtand the immortallity of the
ſoule, and that her felicity, perfection, and full contentment, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
her finall end, and <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> could not be in this life, not in any
thing created under heaven, but muſt needs be in the life to come, and that by
attaining to enjoy ſome infinite endleſſe and immortall object, which could
fully ſatisfie the appetite of our ſoule, and this could be no other then God,
the maker of all himſelfe. And that conſequently all other things of this
tranſitory life, and of this humane Common-wealth, ſubject to mans eyes,
are ordained to ſerve and be ſubordinate and directed to the other higher end,
and that all mans actions in this world, are firſt of all, and in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
to be imployed to the recogniſing, ſerving, and honoring of this great
Lord that governeth the whole, as author and end of all.</p>
            <p>To this light I ſay, came the Heathens even by the inſtinct and direction of
nature, whereof enſued that there was never yet Pagan Philoſopher that wrot
of framing a good common-wealth as <hi>Socrates, Plato, Plutarch, Cicero,</hi> and
others, neither Lawmaker among them that left Ordinances for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
as <hi>Deucalion, Minos, Zaleucus, Licurgus, Solon, Ion, Numa,</hi> or the like,
which beſides the temporall end of directing things well for the body, had
not eſpeciall care alſo of matters appertaining to the minde, to wit, of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing,
honoring, and rewarding of vertue, and for reſtraining and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
of vice, and wickedneſſe, whereby is evident that their end and butt
was to make their Citizens good and vertuous, which was a higher end, then
to have a bare conſideration of temporall and bodily benefits only, as many
great men of our daies (though Chriſtians in name) ſeeme to have, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
no higher end in their Government then bodily wealth, and a certaine

which was not only to provide for thoſe bodily benefits that are

minde, and above all for the ſerving of that high and ſupreme God, that is the
beginning and end of all the reſt. For whoſe ſervice alſo they learned by the

               </gap>ſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of the law of nature, before the Leviticall law, and the particular
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115403:39"/>
formes of this ſame law, were preſcribed by <hi>Moſes.</hi> For ſo we reade in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis
of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 8. that he made an Altar, and offered ſacrifices to God u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the ſame, of all the beaſts and birds that he had in the Arke, <hi>odoratuſque eſt
Dominus odorem ſuavitatis,</hi> and God received the ſmell of theſe ſacrifices, as a
ſweet ſmell. Which is to ſay, that God was highly pleaſed therewith: and
the like we reade of <hi>Job</hi> that was a Gentile, and lived before <hi>Moſes, Job</hi> 1.
<hi>Sanctificabat filios conſurgenſque diluculo offerebat holocauſta per dies ſingulos.</hi> He
did ſanctifie his children, and riſing early in the morning did offer for them
holocaſtes or burnt ſacrifices every day.</p>
            <p>This men uſed in thoſe dayes, and this they were taught by law of nature,
I meane both to honour God above all things, and to honour him by this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
way of ſacrifices, which is proved alſo evidently by that which at
this day is found and ſeene in the Indians, where never any notice of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
law came, and yet no Nation hath ever been found among them, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
not ſome kinde of God, and offereth not ſome kinde of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
unto him.</p>
            <p>And albeit in the particular meanes of honouring this God, as alſo in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
between falſe gods, and the true God; theſe people of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
have fallen into moſt groſſe and infinite errours, as alſo the Gentiles of
<hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> did, by the craft and ſubtlety of the Divell, which
abuſing their ignorance, did thruſt himſelfe into the place of God, and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and drew thoſe ſacrifices and ſupreame honours unto himſelfe, which
were due to God alone; yet is it evident heereby (and this is ſufficient for
our purpoſe) that by God and nature, the higheſt and chiefeſt end of every
common-wealth, is <hi>Cultus Dei,</hi> the ſervice of God, and religion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that the principall care and charge of a Prince, and Magiſtrate even
by nature is ſelfe, is, to looke thereunto, whereof all antiquity both among
Jewes and Gentiles, were wont to have ſo great regard, as for many yeeres
and ages their Kings and chiefe Magiſtrates were alſo Prieſts: <hi>Genebrard. l.</hi> 1,
<hi>Chronol. de 1. aetate Genes. 25. &amp; 29. Deut. 21. 2. Paral.</hi> 21. and divers learned
men doe hold, that the priviledge and preheminence of <hi>primo genitura,</hi> or the
firſt borne children, ſo much eſteemed in the law of nature, conſiſted princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
in this, that the eldeſt ſons were Prieſts, and had the charge and dignity
of this greateſt action of all other upon earth, which ſome temporall Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
ſo little regard now.</p>
            <p>And this reſpect and reverence towards religion was ſo greatly planted in
the breaſts of all Nations by nature her ſelfe, as <hi>Cicero</hi> pronounced, this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
ſentence in his time. <hi>Cicero li. 1. queſt. tuſc. &amp; de natura deorum lib.</hi> 1.
<hi>Nulla eſt gens tam fera, nulla tam immanis, cujus mentem non imbuerit deorum
colendorum religio.</hi> There is no Nation ſo fierce or barbarous, whoſe mindes
are not indued which ſome religion of worſhipping Gods.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Plutarch</hi> writing againſt a certaine Atheiſt of his time, ſaith thus: <hi>If
you travel far Countreys, you may chance to find ſome Cities without learning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Kings, without riches, without money; but a City without Temples, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Gods and ſacrifices, no man yet hath ever ſeene. Plutarch adverſus Colotem.</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:115403:39"/>
And finally <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his politiques having numbred divers things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to a Common-wealth, addeth theſe words. <hi>Quintum &amp; primum. Circa
rem divinam cultus, quod Sacerdotium ſacrificiumque vocant. Ariſto. l. 7. politi.

to a Common-wealth, the honour and ſervice due unto God, which
men commonly doe comprehend by the words of Prieſt-hood and ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>All this I have alleaged to confute even by the principles of nature herſelf,
the abſurd opinions of divers Atheiſts of our time, that will ſeeme to be great
Politicks, who affirme that Religion ought not to be ſo greatly reſpected in
a Prince, or by the Parliament, as though it were their chiefeſt care, or the
matter of moſt importance in his government, which you ſee how falſe and
impious it is, even among the Gentiles themſelves; but much more among
Chriſtians, who have ſo much the greater obligation to take to heart this
matter of Religion, by how much greater light and knowledge they have of
God, and therefore wee ſee that in all the Princes oathes which before you
have heard recited to be made and taken by them at their admiſſion and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation,
the firſt and principall point of all other, is about Religion and
maintainance thereof, and according to his oath alſo of ſupreame Princes,
not only to defend and maintaine Religion by themſelves in all their States;
but alſo their Livetenants and under governours; wee have in our Civill Law
a very ſolemne forme of an oath which <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour, above a
thouſand and fifty yeeres agone, was wont to give to all his Governours of
Countries, Cities, and other places, before they could be admitted to their
charges, and for that it is very effectuall, and that you may ſee thereby what
care there was of this matter at that time; and what manner of ſolemne and
religious proteſtations, as alſo imprecations they did uſe therein, it ſhall not
be amiſſe perhaps to repeate the ſame in his owne words, which are theſe
following,</p>
            <p>The title in the Civill Law is, <hi>juramentum quod Praeſtatur, iis qui adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones

            <p>This oath did all the Governours of Chriſtian Countries take in old time,

and conſummate, how much more may it ſerve to undoe a bare bethrothing,
which is the caſe of a pretender onely to a Crowne.</p>
            <p>But you may ſay perhaps, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of an Infidel or Heathen,
that denyeth Chriſt plainely, and with whom the other party cannot live,
without danger of ſin and loſing his faith, which is not the caſe of a Chriſtian
Prince though he be ſomewhat different from me in Religion, to which is
anſwered, that ſuppoſing there is but one only Religion that can be true a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Chriſtians, as both reaſon and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth plainely
teach us: and moreover ſeeing, that to me there can be no other faith or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
availeable for my ſalvation then only that which I my ſelfe do beleeve,
for that my owne conſcience muſt teſtifie for me, or againſt me: <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 1.
<hi>Cor. 8. 2. Cor. 5. 1. Pet.</hi> 3. certaine it is, that unto me and my conſcience he
which in any point beleeveth otherwiſe then I doe, and ſtandeth wilfully in
the ſame, is an Infidell, for that he beleeveth not that which in my faith and
conſcience, is the onely and ſole truth, whereby he muſt be ſaved. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.
And if our Saviour Chriſt himſelfe in his Goſpell, doth will certaine men to
be held for heathens, not ſo much for difference in faith and religion, as for
lack of humility &amp; obedience to the Church: how much more may I hold him
ſo, that in my opinion is an enemy to the truth, and conſequently ſo long as I
have this opinion of him, albeit his Religion were never ſo true, yet ſo long
(I ſay) as I have this contrary perſwaſion of him, I ſhall doe againſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and ſin damnably in the ſight of God, to prefer him to a charge where
he may draw many other to his owne error and perdition, wherein I doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
my ſelfe that he remaineth?</p>
            <p>This doctrine (which is common among all Divines <hi>Rom.</hi> 14) is founded
upon that diſcourſe of S, <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Corinthians, 1. Cor.</hi> 1. &amp; 10.
againſt ſuch Chriſtians as being invited to the banquets and tables of Gentils
and finding meats offered to Idols (which themſelves doe judge to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to eate) did yet eate the ſame, both to the ſcandall of other infirme men
there preſent, as alſo againſt their owne judgement and conſcience, which
the Apoſtle ſaith, was a damnable ſin, and this not for that the thing in it ſelfe
was evill or unlawfull, as he ſheweth, but for that they did judge it ſo, and
yet did the contrary, <hi>Qui diſcernit ſi manducaverit damnatus eſt,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.
He that diſcerneth or maketh a difference between this meat and others,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115403:41"/>
as judging this to be unlawfull and yet eateth the ſame, he is damned, that is
to ſay, he ſinneth damnably or mortally. Whereof the ſame Apoſtle yeeldeth
preſently his reaſon, <hi>Quia non ex fide,</hi> for that he eateth not according to his
faith or beleefe, but rather contrary, for that he beleeveth it to be cruell and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
doth notwithſtanding eate the ſame: and hereupon S. <hi>Paul</hi> inferreth this
univerſall propoſition, <hi>Omne autem quod non eſt ex fide peccatum eſt,</hi> all that is not
of faith or according to a mans owne beleefe, is ſin to him, for that it is againſt his
owne conſcience, judgement and beliefe, beleeving one thing, and doing another,
<hi>S. Chryſoſt. hom, 36. in hanc epiſtolam. Orig. l. 10. Theodor. in hunc locum.</hi> And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our owne conſcience muſt be our witnes at the laſt day, to condemne or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us, as before I have ſaid, he muſt needs ſin grievouſly (or damnably as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
here ſaith) who committeth any thing againſt his owne conſcience, though
otherwiſe the thing were not onely indifferent, but very good alſo in it ſelfe, for
that of the doers part there wanteth no malice or will to ſin, ſeeing he doth that
which he apprehendeth to be naught, though in it ſelfe it be not.</p>
            <p>And thus much now for matter of conſcience: but if wee conſider reaſon of
State alſo, and worldly pollicy, it cannot be but great folly and overſight for a
man of what Religion ſoever he be, to promote to a kingdome in which himſelfe
muſt live, one of a contrary Religion to himſelfe; for let the bargains and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be what they will, and faire promiſes and vaine hopes never ſo great, yet
ſeeing the Prince once made and ſetled, muſt needs proceed according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of his owne Religion, it followeth alſo that he muſt come quickly to break
with the other party, though before he loved him never ſo well, (which yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
is very hard if not impoſſible for two of different religions to love ſincerely)
but if it were ſo, yet ſo many jealouſies, ſuſpitions, accuſations, calumniations &amp;
other averſions muſt needs light upon the party that is of different Religion from
the State and Prince, under whom he liveth, as not onely he cannot be capable of
ſuch preferments, honours, charges, governments, and the like, which men may
deſerve and deſire in their Common wealths, but alſo he ſhall bee in continuall
danger and ſubject to a thouſand moleſtations and injuries, which are incident to
the condition and ſtate of him, that is not currant with the courſe of his Prince
and Realme in matters of Religion, and ſo before he beware, he commeth to be
accounted an enemy or backward man, which to remedy he muſt either diſſemble
deeply, and againſt his owne conſcience make ſhew to favour and ſet forward
that which in his heart he doth deteſt (which is the greateſt calamity and miſery
of all other, though yet many times not ſufficient to deliver him from ſuſpicion)
or elſe to avoid this everlaſting perdition, he muſt breake with all the temporall
commodities of this life, and leave the benefits which his Countrey and Realme
might yeeld him, and this is the ordinary end of all ſuch men, how ſoft and ſweet
ſoever the beginnings be.</p>
