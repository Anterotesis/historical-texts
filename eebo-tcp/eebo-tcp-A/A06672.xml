            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

one whom nature had
beautified in euerie externall part of the bodie, and
wiſdome adorned with all internall gifts of the mind,
who from the firſt ſpring of his happy birth, to the ripe

of magnanimous behauiour towards his foes, and
courteous humanitie to his friends, as made him the
<pb facs="tcp:1533:4"/>
wonder of that worlde, being then but newly reduced
from the barbarous behauiour of the ſauage Satires,
to the ciuil gouernement of obedient ſubiects. This
bleſſed prince in the prime of his proſperous yeares,
choſe to wife a Ladie of his owne Countrie called <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabella,</hi>
a woman as vertuous as beauteous, and as
plentiouſly repleniſhed with commendable behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,

that it might bée iudged howe gods and nature had in

of that more then earthly creature, he onely
excepted, nor any beautie of ſuch power as to conquer
his maiden affections, if ſhe to that purpoſe had not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially

bleſſings ouer their heads, and euerie yeare ſéemed to
excéed another, in heaping ſtill renuing pleaſures into
their plentifull lappes, walling them rounde about
with impregnable felicitie, that they might proudlie
oppoſe themſelues againſt the hardeſt brunts of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
extremitie. Amongeſt all which fauours one
eſpecially, not the leaſt, though almoſt the laſt, was
this, that at one birth, this worthie dutches brought
into the worlde two male twins, the right patrons of
their royal parents, whoſe comming was not a little
welcom to the ſecure inhabitants of that very wel go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
Dukedome. In that heauens, and their happie
ſtarres had ſo effectually aunſwered their longing

parents carefully foreſeeing, that their forwarde
children might anſwere their toward growth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable

thought it moſt conuenient, when the ſtealing houres
of euer running time had made them able to conceiue
the principals of learning and knowledge, to prouide

as beſt fitting the humour of gray heades
which he was wonted to ouerpaſſe in delightſom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation,
fitly agréeing with the vnripened thoughts

faintly decayes, and blots the former ſhew
as though it had neuer béene borne: alluding his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
life to the pleaſant trauaile of a waifaring man,
that hauing ouerpaſſed a great deale of the day wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
in a pleaſant dale, at laſt muſt worke vp his
way to the hie top of a wearie hil, from whoſe height
he may againe looke at the ouercome pleaſures of his
forenoones iourney. And thus ſighing to himſelfe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
recites in his aged memorie, the pleaſant daies of
his youthful iolitie: the very thought whereof had bin
ſufficient to haue drowned himſelfe in a gulfe of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,

had not his liuely picture perfectly pourtrayed in
the youthful behauiour of his yong ſonnes perſwaded

And thus feeding his olde conceit with the hope
of his forward children, he ſo pleaſantly ſpent the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
daies of his vnpleaſant age in the verie remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance

beginning of neceſſitie hath his end, euery day by

            <p>And as the firſt and greateſt care that troubled his
wearie minde, he calles before him his two ſonnes,
the pillers that were after to ſupport the heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the good gouernement of that common wealth,
which yet lay vpon his own ſhoulders: who comming
to the bed ſide where their father lay, performing ſuch
dutie as naturally belongeth to parents from the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
and ſorrowful to beholde their old father labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſo earneſtly with the wearie aſſaults of neuer ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
death, ſwelling ſorrowe plentifully flowes out at
the chriſtall condites of their ſtarre like eies in pearle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
droppes of brinie ſalt teares. Which when their
old ſire beheld, giuing charge to ſome of his attendants
there by to ſet him vp in his bed, for by this had the
bloody conflicts of al deuoring death almoſt druncke
vppe al the moiſture of his ſometimes wel moiſtned
members, and vſing ſome perſwaſions to his gréeuing
<pb facs="tcp:1533:5"/>
ſonnes to deſiſt from their wéeping, he thus beginnes
to diſpoſe of his earthly riches. Since (quoth he) the
common courſe of continuall yéeres in the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and fading fruits of our mother Earth daily deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
to our therfore gréeuing thoughts the vnconſtant
ſtate of our here abode may ſufficiently perſwade and
induce you to conceiue the occaſion that hath brought
me your old father to be a weake ſouldior as here you
ſée in the liſts of death, who haue paſt the ſpring of my
growth, the ſummer of my flouriſhing, the Autumne
of my fading muſt nowe like a dried leafe fal in the
comfortleſſe boſome of colde killing winter, at whoſe
end you muſt beginne, whoſe death muſt be your life,
and whoſe fal the ſtep wherein you muſt tread to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe:
then take truce a while with the vnbrideled
courſe of nature, and learne with patience to looſe that
which care can not kéepe, your many teares may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſome hurt to you, but were they more then they
are, they could not al help me, when this conquering
captaine, vnder whoſe cruel hand lieth vanquiſhed
your ſometimes vanquiſhing father, prowdly trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
in the treble victorie of your woorthie grandſire,
to whome my ſelfe was ſole heire, he, though rich, yet
left me poore, and though I ſuccéeded in the poſſeſſion
of much wealth, yet was I then but ſlenderly ſtored
with wiſedome, ſo that what he had carefully got I at
the firſt as careleſly ſpent, til the experience of ſome
few yéeres, though it were ſomewhat long, yet was it
not too late, enriched me with the one, as he had ſtored
me with the other: both which I leaue more amply to
you then I did plentifully receiue them of him. Then
taking in hand his crowne, this heauen, quoth hée,
which I like <hi>Atlas</hi> haue long ſupported, muſt I nowe
lay vpon your ſhoulders, and on you two diſloade this
heauie burthen which hath ſo long béene onely borne
<pb facs="tcp:1533:6"/>
by me. Breake it I may not in twaine, whoſe golden
circle cloſeth ſo manie in one, containing the welfare
of as many people within this ring, as the Atlantike
ſea compaſſes in her gréedie armes. Diuiſion brings
foorth diſcord, diſcord confuſion, confuſion deſolation
which woful end to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by a good beginning, I haue
thus contriued: Twins you are both, and therfore in
birth equal. Thou (quoth hee) <hi>Perſeus</hi> to his eldeſt
ſon art a ſcholler richly adorned with the great gift of
godlike learning, and therefore mighteſt chalenge a
prerogatiue aboue thy brother: but that <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
then to his yongeſt ſonne, hath as farre excéeded
thée in the practiſe of a ſouldiour, as thou him in the
profeſſion of a ſcholler: ſo that being ioyned togither,
you would make one perfect man, but ſeuered, are two
maimed members. It is reported of the Pelican, that
with her owne blood ſhe reuiued her dead yong, and ſo
I though wanting blood to recall you from the dead
pleaſures of yoong ſecure delights, yet ſhal my lateſt
breath counſel you to the careful deſire of vertuous
déedes. The Rauen ſo long as ſhée is able to prouide
meate for her yong, wil neuer let them flie from her
ſight, and ſo fares it with me, willing ſtil to enioy
your deſired companies as long as I might: but ſith
I am now too weake to ſwim againſt ſo great a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
as is this ſea of death, that drowneth in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
obliuion whatſoeuer the worlde hath brought
forth ſince her firſt creation, I muſt here vrged of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
leaue that which willingly I would prolong.
And therefore in a word I bequeath to you this crown
and kingdom, which your forefathers for many yéeres
haue royally vpholden, be as one ſoule in two bodies,
two men, but one minde, two hands gouerned by one
head. Let thy wit direct his weapon, and his weapon
defend thy wit. There is a roote in Libia that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="tcp:1533:6"/>
two bulkes, which as long as they cleaue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proſperouſly flouriſh, but being ſeuered they ſoone
fade. Great ſtreames that forcibly breake forth of the
bowels of mighty mountains, kéeping their courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
within compas of two banks, forcibly preuaile
againſt al oppoſitions, but being ſeparated, their force

his abhominable practiſe, There ſetting downe
the prettie childe. who although his tender yeares had
not yet affoorded him ſo much reaſon, as to gheſſe at the

maner of his carriage, the vnuſual time of the night,
and the vnpleaſant temperature of the colde aire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vrge
vehement the cries of the ſilly infant to yéelde ſuch
dreadful exclamations, from euerie reſounding Eccho
of theſe vnpeopled plaines, as would haue ſtirred the
hatefull hearts of vnrelenting ſauages to haue pitied
his childiſh complaints, til this more then bloodie min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
beaſt, ſtripping the poore infant from the moſt of
his outward attire, as meaning not onely to depriue
him of his life, but alſo to leaue his princely bodie ſo
naked, that no man ſhould by any outwarde appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

attire, when in the middeſt of his troubleſome
buſineſſe he ſuddenly heard, as it had béene the furious
approch of ſome haſtie beaſt. When he looking through
thin branches of a yong leaued Lawrel, might by the
light of the Moone, which by this had climed the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

ſecretly ſearching the hidden bottome of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
ſeueral buſh. For as it ſhould ſéeme the recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of ſome late loſſes, which by the ſequele might bée
iudged none otherwiſe, but that ſome watchful wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
taking the aduauntage of her abſence, had cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
conueyed away her yong whelpes, while ſhée
was iourneying abroad to prouide ſome ſpéedie reliefe
for their ſuſtenance, who returning backe to her deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
denne, and finding herſelfe depriued of her yong,
was wofully ſearching what ſhe had vnwillingly loſt,
with fearefull approch ſo affrighted the guiltie conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of this murdering miſcreant, as that leauing the
yong child to the gréedy prey of this angry beaſt, made
al ſpéedie haſte to ſaue himſelfe from her feareful fury,
which he ſo ſpéedily performed, that in ſhort time he
rid himſelfe from the feare of the forreſt. But as euery
ſinne cannot eſcape his ſeueral puniſhment, ſo had the
iuſt cenſure of all iudging heauen appointed a worthie
reward for this his wicked worke. For euen at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
boundes of the broad plained forreſt, a hungrie
beare ſéeking ſuſtenance, to relieue her inſaciate deſire
of meate, ſuddenly encountered him ſo neare, that
though his footmanſhip was more then ordinarie, yet
it nothing preuayled to helpe him from this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
For ſo neare the bold beaſt followed his ſtil flying
ſteps, that ere he could get almoſt my way from their
firſt méeting place, ſhe had eagrely ſeazed on his nowe
feare-falling bodie. And ſhe now as farre from mercy,
in peecemeale tearing him, as he from pitie in rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
<pb facs="tcp:1533:13"/>
abuſing the other, had in ſhort time buried in
her beaſtly bellie, his ſinful members that had iuſtlie
deſerued ſuch equal meaſure, remunerating him in

By this the woful Lioneſſe for her vnexpected want,
had by trauerſing round about thoſe ſpatious plaines
ſearching euery ſhadow, &amp; boldly ranſacking y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couered
bottom of euerie buſh, egerly folowing her hot purſute,
came at length to the place, where the yong forſaken
infant lay pitifully complaining and weakely ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

infant, whoſe pittiful caſe did, as it ſhould ſéeme,
work more remorce in that reaſonleſſe creature, then
it had done in his neareſt kinne: for after ſhe had with
her féete in the eaſieſt manner that ſhée could, turned
it vp and downe ſadlie ouerlooking this wofull loſſe,
differing from her natural kinde, and forgetting both
the ſorrow and feare of her owne young, making ſhift
as ſhe could to lappe againe the childe in thoſe clothes
which the fugitiue murderer had for feare left behind,
made ſuch meanes, as that taking vp the child by thoſe
clothes, ſhe in her téeth conueied him to a ſorrowfull
denne, meaning to ſupply her former loſſe, by this
new found ſpoile, where we wil a while leaue <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>
ſonne to this the forenamed worthie <hi>Perſeus</hi> in
the vnkindly couert of a lions denne to the tutorage of
a wilde beaſt, that was naturallie deſcended from the
of-ſpring of ciuil men, and returne to ſée their ſorrowe
at the court for this ſodaine loſſe, which was no leſſe
gréeuous than the thing it ſelfe was great. Many poſts
were euery way diſpatched to make enquirie, leſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
by the ſlie deceit of ſome ſubtil enemie hée
<pb facs="tcp:1533:14"/>
might haue béene ſtollen for a pledge: proclamations
in euery place were made, and promiſes of rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

childe, which being without helpe, periſhed without
hope: wherein when they had ſpent much time to ſmal
purpoſe, they ſurceaſed their ſearch, hoping that one
day the length of time would diſcouer the effect of this
trueth.</p>
            <p>In the meane while the ſubtile Quéene, by whoſe
meanes this pretended murther was thus cloſely
wrought, would be nothing behinde in the often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting

many womaniſh teares, to ſéem as it were a great
partaker of her ſorrow, thinking by this meanes to
remooue the blemiſh of ſuſpition from her ſelfe. But
that which troubled her moſt was, that many daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ouerrunne ſince the déede was ſuppoſed to be done,
ſhe heard no word of the returne of her ſeruant, whom
to this end ſhe had appointed. But perſwading herſelf
by many circumſtances, that the thing it ſelfe was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
ſhe grounded her conceit vpon this, the fellow
wiſely foreſéeing howe the hardeſt thing hid is the
eaſieſt found, ſureſt counſell ſometime ſooneſt diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and faithfulleſt truſt prooues manie times the fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt

ſelfe to liue elſe-where, where he might be frée from
whatſoeuer calamitie might come vppon it. From
whome ſhe ſecretly deſired to heare, though ſhe were
out of all hope to ſee him. And thus leauing no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
vnſought into, no deuiſe vndealt withal, no plot
vnperformed, that might remooue from her the enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
eyes of iealous ſuſpition: Shée ſpent many daies
vntill ſuch time as this vntimely loſſe was almoſt
forgotten of them all. Thus hauing brought euery
<pb facs="tcp:1533:14"/>
thing to the bent of her owne bow, and féeding herſelfe
with ſucceſſiue hope of her daughter, who now was
onely heire to that rich dowry, ſhe determined no more
to aſſay any other aſſault, for the quicke diſpatch of her
other brother, thereby the ſooner to poſſeſſe ſolely to
herſelfe, wherin ſhe was ſtrongly counterchecked by an
other. But as in the fading time of drooping Autumne,
no winde ſeldome riſeth without more foule weather,
no cloud that bringeth not with him a preſent ſtorme,
and neither winde nor ſtorme, but are ſtil renuing, til
they haue quite diſarmed trées of their leaues, fields of
their flowers, and flowers of their fruits: So did the
vnconſtant courſe of their maleuolent aſpects, powre
dwne vppon them ſuch winter ſtormes of continuing
calamitie, as neuer left their vnhappie houſe, til it had
quite nipped al their flowers, lopped their leaues, and
almoſt rent vp the original rootes.</p>

the patient let his ſore feſter, becauſe he cannot abide

this diſcontent? It is an olde ſaying, Nothing is née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
the trée then the barke: and ſhoulde there bee any
thing more déere to a man than his wife? Therefore
was ſhe taken out of his breaſt, becauſe ſhe ſhould be

Whereat the wearied king faintly anſwering

My woes (quoth he) more than the ſandes vppon the

were more then the droppes of water in the ſea: the

any thing els that wil worke mine eaſe, I wil (for thy
ſake) heare it, though peraduenture I ſhal not vſe it.
Let me (quoth ſhe) ſée thy diſeaſe, and then ſhalt thou
heare my deuiſe. That (quoth he) can I in a worde,
though it bee as much as a worlde, the diſcontented
harme of an ouer charged heart, hauing al things, and
yet enioying nothing, pleaſed of al except my ſelfe, and
by my ſelfe diſpleaſing al but my ſelfe. Thus haue I

yes, thy ſelf canſt witnes to my woe, with what
griefe I haue ouergone the loſſe of our chiefeſt comfort,
ſo ſtrangely tane away which patience did cure in me:
but greater helpes haſt thou for remedy. Is not ſowre
meate diſgeſted with ſwéete ſawce? cold humours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
with hote ſweates? ſoft yron filed with harde
ſtéele? and ſhal not diſcontentiue diſpaire be diſperſed
with the ſwéet counſel of contented comfort? lets geſſe
(quoth ſhe) at thy malladie, and then I wil giue thée a
ſoueraine remedy: looſly haſt thou let ouerſlip the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of many faire daies by thine owne neglect. Aire
vnmooued ſtraightwaies corrupteth: and water that
ſtandeth quickrly ſtinckes: kéene edges not vſed waxe
dull: and good qualities not exerciſed waxe dead.
Moathes eate the vnworne garment, and graſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly
ouergrowen the vntrodden pauement: better
had we want wit, then not vſe it. The ſouldiour that

heauen and thy forward indeuour indued thée withal?
and ſince then, how little haſt thou employed them?
Oh there is a branch ſprung from thine owne root, that
had he but a ſmall quantitie of thy qualities, a modill
of thy minde, would long ere this haue cured in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
that griefe whereon thou nowe groneſt, and
long ſince haue pleaſed himſelfe by plaguing thee: but
that the iuſt God conſidering thy quiet contented diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that rather deſireſt to ſuffer iniurie then to
chalenge equitie. He is a ſouldier forſooth: what then?
but thou a ſcholler, a thing far more in account among
men. Did <hi>Aiax</hi> his big braues ouerbeare <hi>Vlyſses</hi> his
wiſe words? No. And ſhal thy brothers furious lookes
ouerturne thy friendly dealing? Thy diſpleaſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
is his delightſome content, and thy paſſion his
pleaſure. Rowze then thy ſléeping conceit, ſhake off
the ſad earthly melancholy wight from thy light ayrie
ſpirit, and boldly braue him, that ſo baſely ouerbeares
thée. Happily thou thinkſt theſe words procéed fro ſom
enuious intent forethought by me, but God, and all
good men can witneſſe with me, howe I loued and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
him and his. And therewithall ſheading a few
womaniſh teares, which as bountifully fall from their

drew the moodie mind of this malecontented king in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch a laborinth of wearie thoughts as had almoſt
quite tyred his melancholy imagination, yet wiſely
repreſſing the furious rage of rigorous woes woulde

both, whoſe furies were ſo fierce, that there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
no hope of any reconciliation left betwixt them.
Which when they had done, before they would with
open alarme proclaime the vnciuill ſort of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
they ſent to them many interchaungeable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds,
to certifie them of the vrging occaſions of their
gathered forces, which was in the dutiful defence of
their Countrey, to ſaue as much as in them lay, all, or
the moſt of that their natural blood, which was like in
theſe ciuil tempeſts of home-bred ſtormes to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſpilt. But ſuch was the incenſed furie of theſe
two vnkindly foes, as that neither the loue of their
Countrey, the threates of their foes, nor the intreates
of their friends, could refraine them from their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of reuenge. So that the Countrey men who were
there gathered together, thought it the beſt courſe, both
for the ſafetie of themſelues, and the after quiet of their
Countrey, to ioyne battel with both at once, beeing
more in number then both the kings battels, which
determination they effectually followed. And al confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
without forme ruſhing togither, ioyned their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordred
battels, where ſome laboring for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good of their
Countrey, other for the hateful hope of bloody reuenge,
til in the ende, the battels of the kings, by reaſon of
their confuſion and diſorder, were ſo impoueriſhed,
that for feare of further daunger they were both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to flie.</p>
            <p>After the end of which bloodie battel, the Senatours
gathering togither the bodies of their dead Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as was their dutie, afforded them honourable bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.
And then hauing rid, as they wel hoped, their
quiet Countrey of thoſe ciuill diſſentions, they againe
betooke themſelues to their former ſeueral buſineſſes.
Where we muſt now a while leaue them to their own
gouernment til time and their happie ſtars ſhal again
<pb facs="tcp:1533:24"/>
reduce into the ciuil forme of a peaceable kingdome.</p>
            <p>Old <hi>Radulpho</hi> after his happie reigne in his quiet
