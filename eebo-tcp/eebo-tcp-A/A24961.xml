         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THERE needs no Apology for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
the following Account of
Diſeaſes, and the Medicines for
their Cure, the Title Page telling
the World, <hi>'Tis done for the univerſal Good
and Benefit of all People,</hi> which indeed was
the Motive; but that the excellent Remedies
recommended for their Cure, may not be branded
with the infamous Appellation of <hi>Quack Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi>
ſo deteſtable to all wiſe People (and
indeed not without Reaſon, if it be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
what Riff raff Stuff is ſet Abroad and
vended under the Specious Name of Medicine)
I ſhall take leave to ſay only thus much in their
behalf, that they have all of them been really
<pb facs="tcp:51771:3"/>
experienc'd for many Years, to be of moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Uſes for the Diſtempers to which they are
appropriated; and 'tis preſum'd will be found
upon Tryal, more Efficacious than ſome may be
willing to believe, upon only the bare hearing of
them, or by reading the following Account given
of their Vertues, which have been lagely known,
or elſe had not been recommended: Therefore
'tis hoped, as the intent by publiſhing them was
to <hi>ſerve</hi> and not <hi>deceive</hi> the People, as is too
notorioſluy known, many of the Quack Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
vended Abroad have done, to the bringing
diſrepute on the moſt excellent ones, none will
condemn them, till they have tryed them, which
is the true Teſt, and by which the Author is
content to Stand or Fall, have Credit or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtories of Cures perform'd by them,
might have been enumerated, had not deſign'd
Brevity forbid. The few inſerted 'tis hop'd will
be ſufficient to convince all People till they have
tryed them, that they are Medicines effectual;
and for further Confirmation, ſhould have
mentioned the Names of the Perſons on whom
the Cures were wrought; but that the Author
is obliged to conceal himſelf for the ſake of his
conſtant Buſineſs; beſides, the World is now ſo
<pb facs="tcp:51771:3"/>
Cenſorious, that if the beſt Phyſician recommends
but a Medicine for Publick Good, which he has
experienc'd to be Excellent, he ſhall preſently have
the ſcandalous Epithet of Quack put upon him,
tho' its no more than what the greateſt Phyſicians
in all Ages have done, without thinking it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive;
becauſe they did it, as the Author here
does his, for the common good of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
but now I ſay it cannot be done publickly,
with any tollerable Reputation: For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
does the Author conceal himſelf, and oblig'd
the Seller of them never to let his Name be
known to any, without which ſolemn Promiſe,
they had never been made publick, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the People never been benefitted by
them.</p>
            <p>But becauſe of this, none need to doubt their
Efficacy, neither will any want proper Directions
how to take and uſe them, every thing in that
kind being ſufficiently provided for in the Book,
ſo that none will be at a loſs, or have any need
at any time, upon any pretence, to ſpeak with the
Author concerning 'em; beſides, for their Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
the People that ſell them can give ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
being well aſſur'd both of their Vertues
and the Authors Skill, or elſe had not underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the task of ſelling them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51771:4"/>
And as they are Medicines effectual, ſo are
they laſting; for they will retain their Vertues
many Years, and may be carried beyond the Seas:
For that no Climate, Seaſon of the Year, or Age
will in the leaſt altet or diminiſh them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they be kept from the Air and the
Wet.</p>

FOR THE
SCURVY,
And all other Cutaneous Diſeaſes, or Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

any other Cauſes.</head>
            <p>AMONGST all the Diſeaſes incident to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Bodies, there is none more predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
(tho' leaſt regarded) than the <hi>Scurvy,</hi>
a Diſeaſe that ſeems incident to this Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and which ſpares none of any Age,
Sex or Conſtitution, being a general Malady ſcarcely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Notice of, becauſe it ſeldom kills, tho at the ſame
time it introduces many direful Diſtempers, and proves
the principal and efficient Occaſion thereof.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> is from an acid corroſive
Humour tainting the Blood and Juices of the Body,
incumbred with Earthy Sulphurs of a Nature rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
and ſtubborn, and attended ſometimes (eſpecially
when inveterate) with a very ſtrong Smell or Stench;
which Volatile Saline Acid, irritates the Nerves and
Membranes, ſharpens the Lymph, debauches the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Spirits of the Parts, and perverts the equal Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of the Blood; this is the immediate cauſe of the
<hi>Scurvy:</hi> But the remote Cauſes, are the Sea-Air, and
the Specifick Malignity of the Stagnated Waters and
the Earth, affecting, by their corroſive Effluvium's, alſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51771:6"/>
by infection, an hereditary conveyance from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and from groſs, faeculent and obſtructive Dyet,
eſpecially if over-charged with Salt, or render'd hard
and compact with Smoke, as dry'd Neats Tongues,
Bacon, Sawcages, red Herrings, dry'd Salmon, hung
Beef, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not only contribute Matter, but obtain
alſo a peculiar faculty of impreſſing a Scorbutick Idea
on it: Of the ſame Nature are Melancholick Meats, as
Beef, Pork, Geeſe, Ducks, Salt-fiſh, and all other Fiſh
that are bred in Standing Waters, as Eeles and others;
alſo pickled and marinaded Fiſh, as pickled Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
Anchovies, and the like, which bears a great
part in this Morbifick Production; alſo a Salin Air
render'd thick and conſtipative by Vapours and Damps,
Nitrous Evaporations out of the Earth, filled with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
Steams of Sinks, Gutters, Ditches, muddy and
dirty Streets, and Sulphurous Smokes of Chimneys,
ſtagnating and pent up between narrow Lanes and
Corners, and ſeldom or but little ſerenated, or putrify'd,
by the Rays of a clear ſhining Sun, nor frequently ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated
with Eaſterly Breezes, and ſuch is the Clime
of <hi>London,</hi> where the Air is experienced cloſe, dull,
damp, ſalin and muddy, over-ſpread with denſe,
dark, ſalin Clouds (attracted out of the Sea) for two
Thirds, if not three Fourth Parts of the Year, during
which time the Winds ſeldom blow Eaſterly, or is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd

Aquarum;</hi> Wherein the Author tells us,</p>
            <q>
               <p> That <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
is ſituated on a wicked Bottom of Earth called
blue Clay; this Bottom is many contiguous, tho'
ſeparated Bodies, extends it ſelf round the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
and Lines of Communication ſome Miles in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
and reacheth likewiſe downwards to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51771:6"/>
an enormous Depth towards the Center; for the
boreings that have been frequently made by the
Brewers in queſt of the impregnated Water (called
Spring Liquor) hath been moſtly attempted to thirty
and forty Fathom Depth without ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>As all ſorts of Clay are found by Experience and
Obſervations of Country Farmers and Brewers, to
abound with a Juice or Salt of an Eſurine Acid Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Quality, which vitiates all the Fruits of the
Earth, except it be firſt ſweetned and ſheath'd by Chalk
both crude and calcin'd into Lime; ſo this blue kind
of Glebe more ſcelerous and corroſive than all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
maleficates equally Air and Water, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
all the ſtagnate Waters of the Neighbourhood
eſurine to a very high degree.</p>
               <p>And here it is that the bounty of Nature hath
made it ſelf remarkable to the Eye, in burying this
bottom of Clay near twenty foot in depth under
Ground; and beſides, covering it over and over
with repeated Strata of diffe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent kinds of Moulds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Gravelly Surface of the Earth, left the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere
ſhould be invaded, and the ambient Air
we aſpire, ſhould be thereby exaſperated and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Catarrhous, through the corroſive effluvia ſent
up from below; ſo that till about One Hundred and
Fifty Years ago, when an endleſs number of Perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
began to be made by the common Brewers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Subterranean World, the City of <hi>London</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
its Native State of Health, and was entirely
free from Coughs and Catarrhs, Periodical Fevers,
vulgarly call'd Agues; and in a word, from all the
Symtomatical Branches of the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> hitherto enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated.</p>
               <p>And here it may be obſerved by the by, that the
acrid Effluvia ſent up from the Clayey Bottom, by
reaſon of their volatile Nature, do little harm in
the Summer Seaſon; but during that of the Winter,
whilſt they are weighed down and reverberated back
towards the Bafis of the Atmoſphere by the Fogs and
Froſts; then I may ſay it is, and not till then, that
they begin to Bite even Perſons adult, bur more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51771:7"/>
the unſeaſon'd Bodies of Children and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the <hi>Scelus Aquoe &amp; Loci,</hi> or corrupted or
corroſive Waters, here inſiſted on; ſlept for a long
Succeſſion of Ages, out of Harms way in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of the Subterranean World; and beſides, the
corroſive Waters were not employed either in Bread
or potable Liquors extracted forth of Malt: And, as
I may add, they were only made uſe of for clearing
of the Sight, and for eating away the Kells and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts
off of dim Eyes.</p>
               <p>But about the Acceſſion of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the
Crown (as I am well inform'd) Clay Waters began
to grow into credit with ſuch as Brewed or Baked for
Sale, as a more powerful-Menſtruum, for extracting
the Tincture out of Malt: And at that period of Time,
it was that the Waters of <hi>D AT C.</hi> were Carted from
<hi>Hogſdon</hi> to the ſeveral Brew-houſes in the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,
or City of <hi>London,</hi> at 800 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> Expence;
and at the ſame time a world of Wells were made,
and Pumps erected at every corner of the City and
Suburbs.</p>
               <p>In a word, the <hi>Scelus Aquoe &amp; Loci,</hi> now ſpoken
of, that is to ſay, the acrid Nature and eſurine
Quality of the Stagnate Waters in and about this
City, is ſufficiently evinced a <hi>Poſteriori</hi> from the ill
natur'd Effects thereof in all Domeſtick Uſes. Firſt,
in chopping and ditching of Hands and Face: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
from coagulating of Alcalous Fluids, both
Soap and Barm: Thirdly, from hardening of Peaſe
and redning of Bacon, and all Fleſh Meats, if boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therein; which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> enumerates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ill Signs and Diagnoſtick of Inſalubrity or
Unwholſomneſs: Fourthly, from the killing of
Flowers and deſtroying all manner of Garden-ſtuff,
unleſs the acid Salt be rſt fievaporated by open Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Inſolations on the Surface of the Earth, as
was practiſed by the Ancients, and put in practice
by Gardeners to this Day.</p>
               <p>I had almoſt forgot to add here, that the prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bottom of Clay now ſpoken of, extends it ſelf
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51771:7"/>
from the Metropolis, or City of <hi>London,</hi> all along the
Banks of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> into the Marſhes or Flats
of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which vitiates both Air and Water in the
<hi>Hundreds</hi> to a very high degree, whereby the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
hath been laid of ſuch Chronical Fevers, and
Scorbutick Agues, as inceſſently reign in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricts
of <hi>Dench</hi> and <hi>Rochefort.</hi> In a word, the River
of <hi>Thames</hi> is alſo vitiated by Dyers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that no
Water is fit for Bread and Brewer's uſe, ſave the
New River, which is far more Salubrious or Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than any other Water in or about the City of
<hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>However, the <hi>Scurvy;</hi> whether from immediate or
remote Cauſes, is certainly a Corruption and Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the Blood and Humours; whence the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
being hurt, the Stomach (which is the Index of
Diſeaſes) is depraved, Obſtructions of the Liver and
Spleen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are occaſion'd, bringing, by degrees, a
general Cachexie, or evil Habit of Body; whereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
and complicated Diſtempers are at length intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
which affects all Perſons according to their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and different Tempers and Conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>Such I ſay is the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> that grand Enemy to Health,
and only reigning Diſeaſe of this Kingdom, which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of all Ranks, Ages and Sexes are more or leſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with, it being the original and productive Cauſe
of almoſt all the Diſtempers incident to Humane Bodies;
and from which alone Diſeaſe (if not timely removed)
more eſpecially proceed Rheumatiſms, Gouts, Fevers,
Agues, Jaundice, Green-ſickneſs, Dropſies, Cholicks,
Stone and Gravel, Phtyſicks, Conſumptions, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
Apoplexies, Palfies, Hectick Fevers, Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack
Melancholly, Hyſterick Paſſion, Vapours, Fits
of the Mother, Rickets in Children, Kings-evil, Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sickneſs, and the like, which theſe Pills, if taken,
both prevents and Cures; their Reputation having, by
their manifold Vertues, been kept up for many Years,
and accounted the only Sovereign Medicine in the
whole Art of Phyſick, againſt all Scorbutick Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
whatſoever; they penetrating, in a very ſhort
ſpace, the whole Humane Body from Head to Foot;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51771:8"/>
and tho' they never till now were made publick to
the World, yet many Thouſands of Boxes have been
diſperſed with wonderful Succeſs, not only here in
<hi>England,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Germany, Holland,</hi> and other
remote Countries, where that devouring Diſeaſe, the
<hi>Scurvy,</hi> hath likewiſe predominated, they being ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Cure for that ſtubborn and rebellious Diſeaſe,
that Thouſands have been cured, when the Diſtemper
has grown ſo inveterate and deplorable, as to become a
ſhame and ſcandal to thoſe that have had it, and which
hath been taken by many to be ſome bad Diſtemper;
for the <hi>Scurvy</hi> often cauſes great Pains in the Head,
Noſe, Shoulders, Arms, Hips, Legs, and Bones, with
the Sciatick and other tormenting Pains all over the
whole Body, whereby they ſleep ill, and tumble
and toſs in the Night with great uneaſineſs and
trouble, and are attended with a heavineſs and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
having reddiſh or blueiſh Spots or Breakings out
on the Skin, weakneſs in the Back, Loyns and Knees,
a bad Stomach, and ſometimes loſs of Appetite, ſtrong
or ſtinking Breath, looſeneſs or foreneſs of the Teeth
and Gums, Throat and Mouth, with Itchings, Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Blotches, Boiles, Ulcers, Morphews, Scabs, Scurf,
a general Weakneſs and Faintneſs over the whole Body;
the Scurvy moſt commonly afflicting People after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
means, and ſometimes with Vomitings, Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and the diſguiſe of almoſt innumerable Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
according to their Conſtitutions, different Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Places where they dwell, and ſo reſemble
all manner of Illeſs, too tedious here to enumerate, as
that its no wonder their Diſeaſes are ſo frequently mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
and doth, with ſo much violence and force, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
wander about the Body and affect it, that if
it be neglected, it will at laſt get into the Bones, and
infect the very Marrow thereof, yet notwithſtanding
(ſo famous are theſe moſt excellent Pills) the Cure then
will be performed, by only a few times more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
taking of them.</p>
            <p>Tho' it is advised, that upon the appearance of any
of thoſe Symptoms, you have ſpeedy recourſe to theſe
Pills, which will prevent their increaſe, and carry them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51771:8"/>
off with leſs trouble and difficulty; there being ſcarce
one Diſeaſe which People are afflicted with here in this
Climate, but the principal and efficient Cauſe thereof is
the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> that Diſeaſe carrying Thouſands to their
Graves, when it ſcarcely has been known-of what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
they have dy'd, there being very few that
diſcerns, or indeed will give, themſelves the trouble to
conſider what the original Cauſe or occaſion thereof is,
tho' it too manifeſtly appears (as every judicious Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
may diſcover, if he will,) that it is the <hi>Scurvy.</hi>
Therefore be well advis'd about your Diſtemper, and
run not into the Hands of inconſiderate Practitioners,
who take not due Thoughts about the original Cauſe;
for how many, both Old and Young, are daily carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
off by Fevers, Rheumatiſins, Apoplexies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions,
Convulſions, Rickets, King's-evil, and
the like; which, if the original Cauſe had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted,
and timely recourſe had to theſe famous Pills,
might in all probability have been alive to this day;
theſe Pills being very harmleſs and ſafe, and proves the
only Univerſal, Purgative, Preſervative, Preventative
and Curative Remedy, in the whole Republick of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
            <p>They wonderfully, ſo far as any Purging Medicine
can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prevent and cure the Dropſy and Gout ſpeedily
(thoſe Diſeaſes being the product of the <hi>Scurvy</hi>) taking
away the Water in one, and the Pain in the other, tho'
never ſo great, and not only gives preſent Eaſe, Relief,
and Comfort in the Gout, and that beyond expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but alſo very much leſſens, if not totally prevents
the Pains returning for the future, they working gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Stool and Urine, and ſometimes by Vomit, if the
Stomach be very foul, without the leaſt Griping or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſick; thereby curing moſt curable Diſeaſes, by
ſtirring up and diſcharging thoſe lurking, offending
Humours, ſweetning the Maſs of Blood and Juices,
and bringing the ill and untoward Habit of Body into
a good, ſound and firm Diſpoſition: Theſe Pills having
cured numbers of Perſons both of Dropſies and Gouts,
and that in a very ſhort time; ſome of which have
been given over as incurable, others have gone above
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51771:9"/>
a dozen Years upon Crutches, and never heard to this
Day, that they ever miſt the Cure of one Perſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have been uſed in Practice for above
Twenty Years.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pills are admirably good againſt Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all ſorts, that diſheartning Diſeaſe ſo daily and
apparently dwindling a Perſon to the Grave (and is the
manifeſt product of the <hi>Scurvy</hi>) not ſo much from
their adding of Matter, as by taking away the Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which hinder the Nouriſhment from going to
its reſpective Parts; in which Diſeaſe, whether in Old
or Young, they have done Miracles, making the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
grow plump and full, who but a while before
were reduced to nothing but Skin and Bones; and this
they have generally performed, and ſcarcely been ever
known to fail.</p>
            <p>Alſo in that rebellious, troubleſome and oftentimes
loathſome Diſeaſe, the King's-evil, whether hereditary
or not, which numbers of Perſons of different Ages
and Sexes are infeſted with; they are a wonderful Help
and Cure, whether in the Swellings or running Sores,
diſpoſing the vitiated and ſcorbutick Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
into ſuch a ſtate, that the Diſeaſe is as it were
pulled up by the Roots as never to return again.</p>
            <p>Theſe famous Pills are the moſt excellent Head-purge
in Nature, and that for all Diſeaſes therein, as Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
Megrim or Swimming, Vertigo or Giddineſs, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy,
Frenzy, Madneſs, Melancholy, Diſeaſes of the
Spleen, Dimneſs of Sight, Rheums and all other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
in the Eyes, Deaſneſs, Noiſe in the Ears,
Drowſineſs, Heavineſs or Dulneſs of the Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
(all theſe Diſtempers proceeding originally from Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick
habits) and is a Medicine beyond any ever yet
known, being of ſo Amicable a Property, that none
can pretend to a greater Secret to extirpate the <hi>Scurvy</hi>
and all the effects thereof; there being no Diſeaſe ſo
remote or abſtruſe ſoever in the Body of Man, but theſe
Pills will find out, inſinuate into, and potently and
univerſally expel or throw out.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pills are an admirable help for ſuch Perſons,
who are unhappily afflicted with the <hi>Scurvy</hi> to that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51771:9"/>
degree, as to be exerciſed with Hypochondriack Diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
Hyſterick Paſſions, riſings in the Throat, the
frightful, and as it were dying Diſeaſe, the Vapours
of all ſorts, Fits of the Mother, Cloggings, Stuffings,
Gnawings or Illneſs at Stomach, whether from Wind,
Humours, or the like; alſo for ſuch as grow too fat,
ſweat much, and have nauſeous ſpittings in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Bleeding at Noſe, Cachexies, have coſtive or hot
Bodies, and for all as have loſt their Complexions by
the Green-ſickneſs, Jaundice or otherwiſe, and ſuch
as are overtaken with lingring Diſeaſes, growing worſe
and worſe every Year than other, not knowing well
what they ail, having ill Digeſtions, Stoppages in the
Head and Breaſt, ſhortneſs of Breath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till ſuch
time as they fall into Dropſies, Hectick Fevers, or deep
Conſumptions, pining and waſting away with dry
Coughs, Wheeſings, faint Sweats in the Day or Night,
Weakneſs, fainting Fits, and the like. Theſe admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Pills carry off all thoſe Diſeaſes the right way, by
taking them twice or thrice in a Month, or oftner if
you find occaſion.</p>
            <p>They are the beſt Phyſick in Nature for to take Spring
and Fall, as a Preventative Remedy and to preſerve
Health, as moſt People that have any regard to the
welfare and ſecurity thereof, are mindful to take; and
likewiſe from any Diſorder or Indiſpoſition, whether
from Heats or Colds, Surfeits by eating or drinking,
or the like. If taken as ſoon as your perceive your ſelf
ill, they moſt aſſuredly prevent any Fever or other
Diſeaſe from invading you; and there is as much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in taking Phyſick Spring and Fall, twice or three
times in each Seaſon, to diſcharge the peccant Humours
which are heap'd up in the Stomach and lodge there
(tho' at the ſame time you ſeem to be very well in
Health) thereby to preſerve from, and prevent Diſeaſes
which all Perſons are liable to every Moment, as there
is to take Phyſick for curing thoſe Diſeaſes when they
have ſeized you; and no Perſon that deſires a happy
and healthy State of Body, will be ſo imprudent to
neglect that which is ſo abſolutely and undeniably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for for the preſervation thereof; and I can aſſure
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51771:10"/>
them, from a very large Experience, that no Phyſick
under the Sun will anſwer ſuch a purpoſe beyond
theſe famous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pills.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pills purge by Stool, Phlegm, Choller and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
diſpoſing all old Ulcers, Fiſtula's, running
Sores, Sore Breaſts, Sore Eyes, Scald Head, King's evil,
Swellings or Sores, Wounds, Gangreens, Cankers,
Cancers, Tettars, Ring-worms, Scabs, Salt Humours,
or any other Breakings out, as Puſhes, Boils, Wheals,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to a ſpeedy healing, by purging away the evil
Humours which feed them; and perfectly removes the
cauſe of the Elephantiaſis or Leproſy.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pills are of wonderful uſe for all Travellers,
Seamen and ſuch like Perſons who live on bad Dyet,in
ill Airs and moiſt Places,and near the Sea Coaſt; and for
all ſuch as have ſpoiled their Bodies, and ſurfeited their
Heats and Colds, hard and exceſſive Drinking in their
young Days; and for ſuch as cannot attend upon a
Cure, but are forced to go about their Buſineſs: They
may take them to Sea with them, becauſe they keep
their Vertues many Years, nor do Sea Voyages ſpoil
them. They will will be found to ſtand them in great
ſtead in all Sea-ſickneſſes, ſickly Climates or Seaſons; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentures,
Fevers, Fluxes, Poyſons, Agues, Surfeits,
and the like Scorbutick Diſeaſes, which ſo commonly
afflict ſuch as go to Sea; as that ſcarcely any but are
afflicted in one or more of theſe Diſeaſes, ſo excellent
are theſe Pills, that more cannot poſſibly be done by a
purging Medicine.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pills are incomparable againſt all manner of
Coughs, Colds, Rheums or Diſtillations, difficulty of
Breathing, Vomiting, weakneſs of the Stomach, want
of Appetite, Pleuriſies, Pains of the ſide, ſpitting of
Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> performing every thing of this kind to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
ſuddenly and ſtrangely eaſing of Pains, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from Wind, Humours, Colds, Surfeits or any
other Cauſe whatſoever.</p>
            <p>They cure Fevers and Agues of all ſorts, ſometimes
in three Weeks, ſometimes in fourteen Days, and
ſometimes in leſs time, altho' of 2 or 3 Years ſtanding,
and given over by all Phyſicians, and when almoſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51771:10"/>
every one thought the hopes of Recovery had been
paſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pills kill all ſorts of Worms in Old or
Young, altho' the Patient has been almoſt deſtroyed
with them; they bringing away not only the Worms,
dead or alive, but alſo Slime, Filthineſs, or wormy
Matter, both from the Stomach and Bowels, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates
and breeds them; bring down the great Bellies
of Children and others, which Worms occaſions, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a ſtrong Digeſtion and a ſanative Conſtitution;
and I cannot forbear repeating them to be, as they
are indeed (and which every one that make tryal
will find) the very beſt Remedy in the World againſt
the Dropſy and the Gout; taking away all Swellings
from the Belly, Thighs and Legs, and all manner of
Pains, tho' fixed in the very Bones; and that in Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms
when the Pains have been ſo cruel and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as not to be born without violent Roarings and
Cryings out, they have done wonders, and that when
no other means whatſoever would any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
            <p>They alſo diſſolve the Stone, as much as any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
in the Univerſe is able to do, bringing away,
Slime, Sand and Gravel from the Reins and Bladder,
taking away Stoppage of Urine, and cauſing thoſe to
make Water plentifully and eaſily, who could not do
it in ſome Days before; this they have done in numbers
of People to admiration.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pills are a certain Cure for the Falling-ſickneſs,
Convulſions (that deplorable and fatal Diſeaſe to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
whereby ſeveral Thouſands, and that from a
Scorbutick Cauſe, are carried off in a Year) Apoplexies,
Palſies, Cramps, Lameneſſes, weakneſs of Limbs, loſs
of Memory, Sciatica's and all manner of fixed or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Pains whatſoever in any part of the Body, all
which does moſt certainly proceed from the <hi>Scurvy,</hi>
that Bane and diſtroyer of Health and Life; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that many Bed-rid Perſons, given over in ail ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
as incurable, have, under God, unexpectedly
met with a Cure almoſt to a Miracle; ſo that many
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51771:11"/>
learned Phyſicians could not but admire at their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Vertues.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſamous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pills Cure Barrenneſs effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
whether the fault be in the Man or Woman; they
exalting the Generative Faculty, cleanſing and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Spermatick Veſſels, reſiſting all Foulneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the Act of Generation; bring down the Terms
in Women and Maids, ſtrengthen a weak Back, cure
Ulcers and Stoppages in the Womb, and are wonderful
in all other Diſeaſes belonging to the Female Sex; they
expel Wind, carry off the Wind Cholick to admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſo ſpeedily Cure the Griping of the Guts, that
many who ſeemingly were at the point of Death, have
found them a preſent Remedy, when all other means
have failed.</p>
            <p>They are the moſt powerful Pills in Nature againſt
the Rickets in Children, the pale and wan Countenance,
whether from the Green-ſickneſs or otherwiſe in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
all manner of Stoppages and Pains in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
Head and Brain, Liver, Spleen, Reins, Womb
and Bowels; they purify, cleanſe and ſweeten the
whole Maſs of Blood, rectify all the Diſtempers of the
Head, quicken the Senſes, add a good Colour to the
Face, ſtrengthen the Sight, and ſo wonderfully recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the Natural, Vital and Animal Spirits, as that the
Body thereby is made perfectly able to withſtand and
reſiſt all its Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>They cleanſe the Body of Wind, Water and ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
without the leaſt Griping or making Sick, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
as was ſaid before, the Stomach be very foul) or
any way weakning the Body; which done, they ceaſe
working; for they will work no longer than there is
Diſeaſy Matter to work upon, but contrarywiſe will
help all inward waſtings or decays of Nature, cauſed
through Pains, Wrenches, Bruiſes or over-ſtrainings;
they ſtopping all Weepings, Moiſtures, Whites, Fluxes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> by carrying off the Humours another way, thereby
ſtrengthning the Veſſels, fortifying Nature, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the decay'd Parts even to a wonder.</p>
            <p>In fine, theſe Pills are the chief and real Medicine
now uſed for the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> and the aforeſaid Diſeaſes,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51771:11"/>
which are produc'd there-from, and found to be ſuch
from long Experience, not only here in <hi>England,</hi> but
in many Foreign Countries and Kingdoms; they being
cryed up and prized above all Remedies whatſoever;
inſomuch, that in ſome Thouſands of Families, on moſt
occaſions, they are their only Phyſick; and indeed no
Perſon living, from the higheſt to the loweſt, can have
a better Purging Medicine in the World, let the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
condition be from what cauſe or occaſion ſoever,
they being known to be ſafe in Operation, and certain
in the end propoſed; for no Perſon curable, troubled
with the aforeſaid Diſeaſes ever failed of a Cure, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if they continued them (without delay of time,
or taking of other Phyſick) according to the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and all Perſons that have been known to take
theſe Pills, have found good at the firſt taking, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Hundreds, yea Thouſands of People who have
taken them, have given them as great Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
as it was ever poſſible any Medicine could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p>Their ſafety, and the ſucceſs that has followed upon
the uſe of them, has brought them into the great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
they have have acquired in many parts of the
World; for as much as they that take theſe Pills need
not go under long, dangerous and chargeable Courſes
of Phyſick, nor ſuffer by bad Medicines, or be driven
time after time from one Phyſician to another, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundreds daily are, not knowing where to apply
themſelves ſafe, when only a Box or two of theſe Pills
will do more notable Cures than twenty times that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
expended upon Doctors.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pills are the only Antidote in Nature againſt
all infectious Diſeaſes, contagious Airs, and preſerves
from the miſchief of Fogs, and unwholeſome and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated
Vapours in Marſhy or Fenny Countries, which
ariſe from the Earth or Water; they making old Age
comely, and the Countenance of all that take them to
be chearful and Sanguine; they mundify and cleanſe
the Skin of all its Impurities, reſtores and increaſe
Beauty; and abound with more Vertues than any one
Medicine beſides; for altho' many Diſeaſes have been
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51771:12"/>
mentioned, the labour might have been ſaved; for as
they are Pills of an univerſal Tendency, and I verily
believe the only Purging Medicine in the World, it
might only have been ſaid they are good for every Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe;
and not only for the Diſtempers herein inſerted,
but alſo for many others, known or unknown, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
name or number, even when they are ſo unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
afflicted, as not knowing what they ail. Theſe
Pills being endowed with ſuch excellent Properties, and
are ſo full and effectual a healer, that they deſervedly
merit the Title of the only univerſal Pills in the
World.</p>
            <p>And although they are of ſuch admirable Vertues,
yet I muſt inform you, that when the Diſeaſe is of
long continuance and ſtubborn, a perfect Cure cannot
be expected in a few times taking them, in thoſe Caſes
you may take them in the largeſt Doſe, and that at
leaſt for ten or fifteen times or more, as need requires,
omitting them a day or two, as you ſhall ſee cauſe;
but if any ſhall preſume, upon the commendation of
theſe Pills, that any Diſeaſe, in whatſoever condition
the Patient is in, muſt be infallibly cured, he is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
for I ſpeak here only of ſuch Diſeaſes as by God's
Bleſſing, and the very beſt of Means (as theſe Pills un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
are) they may receive cure for; for in ſome
Caſes no Medicine in the World can prevail, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Lungs themſelves, or the Liver or the Reins
are ulcerated and putrefy'd, and ſometimes other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Parts are conſumed; and what Medicine in Nature
can repair ſuch Ruins, or make new Viſcera when the
old are periſhed?</p>
            <p>Theſe Pills operate extreamly pleaſant, ſafe and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and is Phyſick fit to be taken by Perſons of the
greateſt Rank and Dignity, and that by all Ages and
Sexes from Two Years old to Fourſcore and upwards
at any Seaſon of the Year; and it is obſervable that
theſe Pills after four or five times taking, keep the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
open for a Month together, and leave not the Body
coſtive and bound, as is the Property of all other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
by which good Property, Diſeaſes ſeem to melt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
inſenſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51771:12"/>
Theſe Pills are of an admirable and friendly quality,
performing all its Operations as-Nature-her ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and is diſpoſed to the Action, tho' chiefly by
Stool and Urine, ſo that they are bound to that way of
Operation as beſt ſerves Nature's end in reſtoring
Health: Hence it is, that they cure Diſeaſes with ſo
great ſafety, ſpeed and eaſe, and that without almoſt
any other Medicine, they being (as was ſaid before) fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for all Ages, Sexes and Conſtitutions whatſoever;
and that if there but little Corruption in the Body,
they bring forth but little, if much, they bring forth
much, and in Perſons perfectly well, they will ſcarcely
work at all, becauſe in ſuch they have no Enemy to
meet or contend withal.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pills are not only the ſureſt and moſt certain
Medicine, as well as cheapeſt, for the <hi>Scurvy</hi> and all the
aſoreſaid Diſeaſes, which are the conſequents or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
thereof, of any ever yet publiſhed or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
but doth a thouſand times more excel the beſt
prepared and moſt celebrated ſorts of Spirit of Scurvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs,
ſo highly applauded for the <hi>Scurvy;</hi> they affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is herein propoſed ſo ſtupendiouſly and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the power of any other Remedy, whether ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or extraordinary, as that they never can be vallued
or eſteemed enough; for what Reachings, Strainings,
Vomitings, Gripings, illneſs at the Stomach, ſickneſs
at Heart, Faintings and other very unpleaſing Effects,
many Medicines occaſion, which are here avoided;
this ſingle Medicine gently cleanſing the Stomach and
Bowels of their droſſy, mucilaginous Dregs, ſaluting
the Vital Powers like an Angel of Peace, and piercing
the whole Body like Lightning, doth, as it were by its
Character and benign Beams, ſubdue the Malignant
Powers of Diſeaſes, and throughly overcome the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſick
Matter thereof, and that without the leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbution
of Humours, alteration of Body, change of
Countenance, impair of Health, or any ill attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
they gently removing Obſtructions of all kinds,
exciting an Appetite, and rendering the Body vigorous,
active and ſprightly to the admiration of all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51771:13"/>
And this they do not only by fighting or contending
with the Diſeaſe after a rugged and robuſt manner, but
in a paſſive way, by glancing, as it were, and piercing
of it with the ſubtilty of their Effluviums, and as it
were by charming of it, undoes it in its very Root and
Eſſence, whereby the Diſeaſy Matter being melted and
changed in its Nature, Diſeaſes and the very Seeds of
of them inſenſibly vaniſh away, thereby curing thoſe
Diſtempers which are almoſt incredible to relate.</p>
            <p>But no more need to be ſaid of their Vertues, only
give me leave to add, that theſe Pills are cheap, eaſy
approved helps, free from the leaſt danger upon any
account whatſoever; are ſafe and benign in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
rational in their Preparation, amicable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
to all Conſtitutions, moſt powerful againſt
thoſe Diſeaſes to which they are appropriated; able to
ſtand the teſt of all Tryals, and have an uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Probatum eſt</hi> continually attending them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made of nothing that neither nauſeates the Stomach,
or tortures the Patient, but operates <hi>Cito, Tuto &amp; Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunde,</hi>
even when many other Medicines of far greater
Names, have wofully failed: Their gratefulneſs to the
Senſes and Animal Spirits are ſuch, as will invite as
well as aſſiſt all the Powers of Nature to withſtand
the Diſeaſes, and by the ſubtilty of their Temper, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrate
into thoſe cloſe Receſſes where the Roots of
Diſtempers uſually lodge, and into which the common,
dull and earthy Preparations, ſo frequently uſed in
practice can never poſſibly enter or reach into; but as
Experience is the beſt Schoolmaſter, I leave every one
to make Tryal and judge as they find, and accordingly
to commend or diſpraiſe them to their Neighbours and
Friends, not doubting but they will perform what is
herein aſſerted, without hazard of Body, Purſe or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
as ſome Thouſands in this Kingdom can,
upon their own Knowledge, teſtify, what is ſaid of
them, being no Rhodomontade Story to raiſe a Penny,
nor guilded Buſh to ſet off bad Wine, but Matter of
Fact, back'd with ſuch number of Experiences, as not

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:51771:13"/>
For theſe Pills are no fallacious, emperical Medicine,
repugnant to Art or inconſiſtent with Reaſon, but a
regularly prepared <hi>Arcanum,</hi> much in vogue for their
Vertues, being homogene to Nature, and ſo peculiarly
adapted againſt the <hi>Scurvy</hi> and its Conſequents, as that
no Medicine in the Univerſe can poſſibly tranſcend
them, they being a Medicine, tho' very difficult, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive
and tedious in preparing, yet are of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
as to retain their Vertues for numbers of Years,
and that to work all good effects, as well after a length
of time as at their firſt preparing. I ſhall now cloſe
all with Advice that you take your Diſeaſe in time, and
not render it incurable by delay, an Error daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,

            <p>A <hi>Cancer</hi> is as much as to a Crab, and is a hard pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tumour, either Whole or Ulcerous, and is ſaid to
have its riſe from many Cauſes; ſome ſay from ill Diet,
Meats of ill Juice, of a hot quality, and thick and
glutinous ſubſtance, and that Onions, Leeks, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
Veniſon and hot Spic'd Meats, eat too plentifully,
and hot fiery Liquors, that burn and make aduſt the
Blood and Humours, ſuch as Brandy, ſtrong Wines,
&amp;c. immoderately drank, breed them. Others, that
the Air, perturbations of the Mind, Melancholly, ill
Habits of Body, hot, ſharp Humours, where there is
a diſcraſſys of the Blood and Lympha, being fill'd with
an Acrimonious Salt, and a malign Sulphur is their
occaſion. Others, that they ſeldom proceed but from
Blows, Strokes, Punches, or ſuch external Violence,
ill handling, Tumours from curdled Milk upon Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in, Impoſthumes, &amp;c. by which means there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an acid Ferment in the Blood, or it may be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
of the Terms, or ſome other illneſs, which
oftentimes cauſes Humours to flow thither, where co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating,
is capable to produce a Cancerous Germen,
eſpecially upon ill management, ſo as in time it increaſes
and arrives to to that degree of inveteracy, which we
ſometimes find them to be.</p>
            <p>Having now accounted for the cauſe of Cancers in
the Breaſts, we come to their Definitions, and are preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Tumours of a hard, lumpy, round or unequal
Subſtance; of a livid or black Colour, having great
Veins every way round it, which the Blood extends and
makes turgid and viſible, reſembling the Feet of a
Crab, from whence it took its Name, and is full of
Pain, and very hot, and of a cruel and horrid Aſpect;
and ſometimes riſes to ſuch a hight of Malignity, that
the Matter it contains when it is broke, is as ſharp and
as corroſive as <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51771:15"/>
They are, as ſaid at firſt, Whole or Ulcerous; in the
beginning, growing or increaſing, they are generally
whole, but when come to ripeneſs, they break, run or
gleet, and are then called <hi>Cancer Ulceratus,</hi> or <hi>Ulcus
Canceratum.</hi> This Humour being fixt upon ſome
one or more of the Glands of the Breaſt, from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Cauſes mentioned, and being ſharp and
corroſive, is apt to convert whatever comes to it of
Blood, into the ſame Acrimony with it ſelf, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes
apace, while the Skin is whole; but much more
when upon the breaking of the Skin, for then the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Airs adds to the vigour of the Ferment,
when it grows fierce or enraged, and ſo ſhoots forth
it ſelf in the nature of a Fungus, or Excreſcences, or
Tubercles, &amp;c. This part being deprav'd, and a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Ferment therein, the Humours that flow thither,
are ſtill farther changed, till at length they partake of
a malign and poiſonous Nature, vehemently delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
conſiſting of a ſtinking Arſenical Sulphur, and
a Catheretick, or highly corroſive Salt, extreamly ſubtle
and penetrating.</p>
            <p>This malign Humour, when ſo from whatever
Cauſes, chiefly take up its ſeat in parts that are
Glandulous, beginning in the Glandule of a Part, and
moſt often affects Womens Breaſts, by reaſon of their
looſeneſs, great Humidities, and ſtrong Ferment they
contain, and at firſt is very difficult to be known; for
it at firſt exceeds not the bigneſs of a Pea or a Bean,
which in time increaſes ſlowly to the bigneſs of an Egg
or a Melon, or as ſometimes it has been known as big
as a Pompion, tho again in ſome, according as is the
Cauſe, it grows big of a ſudden, and diſcovers its evil
Nature by the grievous Symptoms that appear, and a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it
increaſes in bigneſs, it increaſes in malignity.</p>
            <p>In the Cure of Cancers, various Succeſſes have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
which have divided the Opinions of Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
concerning the Cauſes of them. The Ancients ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
that Women were moſt troubled with Cancers,
upon the ſtopping of their Monthly Viſits, and that
when at any time they had ſwellings in their Breaſts,
upon the provocation of that Evacuation, the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51771:16"/>
either ſunk or left thin, from whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that the ſtopping of that Courſe in Women,
was the only Cauſe thereof; and this they endeavour'd
to explain, by ſaying that the Blood, by ſuch ſtoppages
being not purify'd from the Atribilious Humour or
Acids, which ſeparate themſelves from it, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
flowing of the Courſes, diſcharge themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome one of the Glandulous Parts, and thoſe of the
Breaſt, more generally, from the Communication there
is between them and the Womb, which Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Experience confirms, becauſe we ſee that juſt upon,
or a little before the coming down of the Courſes, the
Breaſts of Women are tender; that is, the Glandules or
Kernels of them, ſo as not to be handled or preſs'd with
eaſe, which upon the flowing of the Courſes, that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
leaves them, and they may be felt and handled
without any manner of uneaſineſs, ſo that it is plain,
that upon the ſtoppage of the Courſes in Women, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
are oftentimes occaſion'd, eſpecially where the
Blood abounds with Atrabilious Humours or Acids. I
ſay ſometimes it is ſo, for it muſt not be ſaid to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſo, becauſe we have inſtances without number,
of Women that have had them by Blows, Bruiſes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before we have made mention of; and as was
the caſe of a Gentlewoman, whoſe Husband after a
Drunken Bout was thrown into a Fever, and being
delirious, upon her giving him ſomething to drink, he
hit her Left Breaſt with his Hand, which caus'd it to
Cancerate, of which ſhe ſoon after dy'd. We are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
by many obſervations, that Cancers ſometimes
have proceeded from the ſtopping of the Monthly Viſits,
by Frights, violent Grief, and by letting of Blood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably
at the times of the Courſes actually running,
which are dangerous ſtopping them, and care ſhould
be forthwith taken to bring them to flow again, or elſe
the Breaſts may be affected, eſpecially if the Blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with Atrabilious Humours or Acids as before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>The hardneſs of Cancers is from the thickneſs of the
Humour; the pain of them is from the conjoyn'd Cauſe,
it being ſharp and corroſive; the Heat of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51771:16"/>
from the extremity of Pain; the livid or blackſh
colour is from the Malignity and Poiſon, which even
diſcolours the pureſt Metals, if touch'd with it; the
roundneſs of the Cancers is from the thickneſs of the
Matter, which cannot ſpread it ſelf abroad as Humours
do that are more fluid; the inequality of ſhape of the
Cancerous Tumour, as ſometimes 3 or 4 ſquare, or
longiſh proceeds from the Ferment of the Humour, and
becauſe ſometimes it is contain'd in ſeveral little Glands;
and its turgid Veins, like to Crab's Claws, is cauſed
from the Recrements of the Blood filling thoſe Parts,
which by reaſon of Matter obſtructing or preſſing upon
them, hinders its getting forth.</p>
            <p>Cancers are known in part by the Places they fix on,
which are the Glands, tho' they may breed in almoſt
all parts of the Body; and this <hi>Aegineta</hi> confirms, who
ſays, a Cancer may happen to ſundry Places, as the
Lips, Tongue, Cheeks, Womb, and other looſe Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
Parts; but were One has a Cancer in any part
beſides, Twenty have them in their Breaſts; and ſo
ſays <hi>Galen,</hi> That Cancerous Tumours are chiefly in
Women's Breaſts, which have not their Purgations
according to Nature, and the reaſon ſeems to be from
the conſent of the Parts, as before obſerved; for that
the <hi>Mammariae</hi> Veins, or Veins of the Breaſts, meet
with the <hi>Uterinae,</hi> or Veins of the Womb under the
<hi>Muſculi recti</hi> of the Belly, by which means there is a
tranſlation of the Matter from the Womb to the
Breaſts.</p>
            <p>Where Cancers in the Breaſts are painful, there is
alſo attending a Pulſation, or beating like a Pulſe,
together with a Heat more than ordinary; and where
the Pains are very ſharp, ſo as if the Part was ſtruck
with a Dart, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Matter is very corroſive, and
will certainly in a little time break forth in a Gleeting
or ſome dangerous ſtinking Ulcer; and when they are
Ulcerated, as frequently they are, from the breaking of
ſome of the Tubercls lying under the Skin, whether
the Matter that runs be much or little, the Ulcer is
painful and very ſtinking, and not only diſcharge a
ſtinking Gleety Humour, but alſo there thruſts forth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51771:17"/>
hard and painful Lips, which in time, if not rightly
managed, fixes to the Ribs (that is, if the Cancer be
in the Breaſt or ſide of it) becoming, by the quick
progreſs it makes, of a horrible and frightful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Such Cancers ſometimes bleed, either through the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of ſome Veſſels, or from the ſharp corroſive
Nature of the Humour, which gnaws the Veſſels aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
tho' I have known them to bleed while they have
been whole, the Blood iſſuing through the Nipple, or
ſome ſmall Pin-hole. Some Cancers again, that are
Ulcerated, ſend forth a Fungus or fleſhy Excreſcencies;
other conſume and eat away all the Fleſh about them,
after a wonderful, and indeed dreadful manner; and
both theſe often bleed, and that in great quanties ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
becauſe the Capillary Veſſels are by the corroding
quality of a Cancer, eaten aſunder, whence the flux
of Blood is ſo great, that the ſtrength of the Patient is
quickly ſpent, and the Spirits being exhauſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
they ſoon dye; as a poor Woman did that I
knew, after labouring under a Cancerated Breaſt very
painful, for near two Years, and could all that while
have no Remedy; for indeed ſuch are very rarely to be
cur'd, and if at all, it is by Surgery; that is, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the Breaſt in time, which the Woman I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was by many Surgeons advis'd to, but would not
ſubmit to the Operation.</p>
            <p>Thoſe inveterate and dangerous Cancers but ſeldom
happen, and is frequently more from want of timely
and proper Applications than the Nature of them; for
they are oftentimes aggravated and enraged, and the
Humour, by wrong Applications inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
made corroſive and ſharp, as we frequently
find it to be; and the Humour is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> corroſive, it is

St <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Hoſpital in <hi>Southwark,</hi> who at the cutting
off of a large Cancerated Breaſt, had (after the Breaſt
was off) a Curioſity to taſte the Juice, or Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51771:17"/>
in one of the little Cyſtis's or Glands of the ſame,
which he did by touching it with one of his Fingers,
and then taſting it from the ſame with his Tongue, the
Taſte of which he proteſted did immediately like a
Gaſs, pierce through the whole ſubſtance of his Tongue,
and paſſed down his Throat not leſs ſharp or biting
than Oyl of Vitriol, Spirit of Nitre, or <hi>Aquae Fortis,</hi> or
ſome vehement Catheretick, or Cauſtick Salt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
he preſently ſpit out, and waſh'd his Mouth with
Water, and that oftentimes, and alſo with Wine, and
drank preſently very freely of Wine after it, yet could
not get rid of the Taſte thereof, but it continued with
him, and brought him (who was a very ſtrong Man)
into a Conſumption, or waſting pining Condition,
attended with ſeveral other ill Symptoms, which in a
few Months after killed him, the Taſte thereof never
going off from his Tongue to his dying Hour; and that
the Taſte of the Juice, or Matter of that Cancerated
Breaſt, he declared upon his Death-bed, and near the
laſt Moments of his Life, to be the true and only Cauſe
of his languiſhing Condition and Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> tells us, and the ſame is confirmed by daily
Experience, that Cancers in the outward Parts, as in
the Breaſt, may in the beginning be cur'd, but when
they are come to a conſiderable bigneſs, oftentimes will
yield to no Remedy but extirpation; indeed a palliative
Cure may be preſcrib'd, which, if the Cancer be not
Ulcerated, may make the Patient eaſy, and prolong
Life, ſo as not to dye the ſooner, becauſe of that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer;
but when it is Ulcerated, it can never be cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſed,
but as long as it ſo remains, the Patient will
live in continual Pain and Filthineſs, and at laſt dye
miſerably, unleſs it is cur'd by Uſtion, Cautry, or
Extirpation, and then may prove but a doubtful
Cure.</p>
            <p>If a Cancer in the Breaſt proceeds from malignant
Humours or corroſive Salts in the Blood, it is generally
incurable, by reaſon of its malignant and poyſonous
Ferment, which ſeldom yields to any internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Remedies, whether Vomiting, Purging, Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Sweating, Dyet-drink; nay Salivations, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51771:18"/>
of Annodines, Suppuratives, or any other
kind of Medicine; or if in ſome it ſhould ſeem to yield,
or indeed ſeem to be cur'd, while it proceeds from thoſe
corroſive Humours, they many times breed again, and
break forth afreſh, either in the ſame place, or in ſome
other parts of the Body.</p>
            <p>But if a Cancer proceeds from external Cauſes, as
Bruiſes, Blows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and be taken in time, and the
hurt lies not very deep, a Cure, with good Succeſs,
may be undertaken, yea oftentimes tho' they lie deep;
but then muſt be with proper Applications; for wrong
Medicines apply'd, tho' the Injury be but ſmall, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
to what, of it ſelf it might never have came to,
therefore is a caution worthy to be taken notice of;
many Women, by undue tampering, and ill advice
and Medicines, having been ruin'd, and loſt their Lives,
which otherwiſe, in all likelihood, might have been
preſerv'd: Therefore before external Applications be
made to a Cancerated Breaſt, or ſuppoſed Cancerated
Breaſts, it ought to be conſider'd whether it be recent
and ſmall, or inveterate and great; if the firſt, it will
by proper Applications, admit of Cure, (I ſay proper
Applications, becauſe by and by I ſhall come to relate
what is the moſt proper to apply to a true Cancer, or
an imagin'd Cancer of the Breaſt) if the ſecond, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
will admit of Cure without cutting. A pallative
Cure may be had, if it be not ulcerated, as ſaid before,
where, by proper Remedies, Eaſe may be had and Life
prolong'd, and that done by divers Medicines, at leaſt
every Nurſe, or good Woman has a Medicine, and that
if you will believe them, they ſay will cure; but thoſe
hap-hazzard Remedies I have known fatal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
adviſe none to give Ear to them. But I would
not have it underſtood, that I deſign here to direct to
the Cure of Cancerated Breaſts of all ſorts, I mean
thoſe that are running and ulcerate, which require a
skilful Surgeon's attendance and care; but only thoſe
that are Swell'd and Tumefy'd, as well ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
or only intermittingly painful, and whether
proceeding from Blows, Falls, Strokes, ill Habits of
Body, Tumours from Milk, hardneſſes of the Breaſts,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51771:18"/>
by Impoſthumes after Lyings-in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which oftentimes
by ill management, and preſſing and handling, turn to
Cancers; I ſay from what ever cauſe they proceed from,
ſo they be whole and taken in time, may be cur'd by
proper Applications; and if they be broken or ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to prevent its increaſe, and remove the hardneſs
and ſwelling about it; a Medicine or two may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
that will (if any thing will) not fail of proving
ſucceſsful: But as I ſaid before, every ſwell'd Breaſt
being not always Cancerous, it may be neceſſary in two
or three Words more to explain which hard or painful
Breaſts can juſtly be ſaid to be Cancerous, and which
not ſo.</p>
            <p>A Cancer in the Breaſt at its firſt appearance looks
like a ſmall round ſwelling, more or leſs deep in the
Glandulous Subſtance of the Part, with little or no
Pain; and when the hardneſs increaſes, the Pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
ſharp, and its obſerv'd to be uneven, and as the
ſwelling increaſes, it becomes of a livid, or blueiſh, or
blackiſh Colour, the Nipples at the ſame time often
ſinking in, round about which alſo there ariſes hard,
uneven, heavy Protuberances, or little Swellings,
which, as they grow big, do at laſt pierce the Skin,
and diſcover the Cancerous Maſs, from whence an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration
proceeds in its Subſtance; the running Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of which is reddiſh, the edges of the Sore broken
or ragged, the tops ſpungy, and when it comes to a
cadaverous Smell or Stench, it ſhews the utmoſt ſtate
of a Cancer in the Breaſt, which will not yield for Cure
to the beſt Remedies in Practice.</p>
            <p>Now in order to compaſs the Cure of a Cancer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a good Underſtanding in the nature of them,
without which nothing can rightly be done; and
if every hard, ſwel'd, tumify'd or painful Breaſt
were known at firſt whether Cancerous or not, many
ſucceeding miſchiefs might be prevented; but it is ſo
common a thing for almoſt every Practitioner, and every
tatling Goſſip, preſently to declare upon ſight of a hard
or ſwell'd Breaſt, that it is Cancerous, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make Applications to it as ſuch, that ſcarce one
Breaſt in twenty they look upon or manage, but is made
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51771:19"/>
Cancerous, tho' it had at firſt no manner of relation to
it: Therefore that none may be deceiv'd that reads this
in time, and fall a Sacrifice to the Ignorance, or Avarice
of ſuch and many others abroad, that undertake what
they know nothing of; and to ſet People in a clear
light, as to the Matter of a Concern ſo dangerous in
it ſelf, as is a Cancer, was the occaſion of this Tract,
recommending to them a Medicine for outward Uſe,
and another for inward, that will ſoon diſcover whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
Swelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be Cancerous or not; for if not
Cancerous, by the uſe of this it will ſoon diſappear,
and the Patient be well; and if it be truly Cancerous,
the continuing them, if not too far gone, will effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
cure; almoſt wonders having been done by them,
by others as well as by my ſelf, in my Practice in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
with only uſing them as directed, and as by and
by ſhall be related, and as the following inſtances of
Cures perform'd make appear.</p>
            <p>A young Laſs of about Fifteen Years old, by a Blow
which ſhe receiv'd upon one of her Breaſts, had a great
hardneſs and Pain, which was cur'd by the Liniment
I ſhall by and by mention, altho' the hardneſs and
Pain was ſo great, that ſhe was in the utmoſt danger
of a Cancer, tho' it was not a Cancer, as ſhe was told
by others that ſhe apply'd to before ſhe came to me,
it was. I order'd her to bathe her Breaſt warm with the
Liniment every Night and Morning, applying a piece
of Flannel over it; by which means, and before ſhe
uſed all of what I gave her, ſhe was perfectly cur'd,
which might be in Three Weeks time, and never
then, or after did any thing elſe to it.</p>
            <p>A poor Working-Woman, by a Blow upon her
Right Breaſt with the Key of a Door, which ſhe run
againſt, had a great Pain in it that ſhe could not Reſt
Night not Day; the Bruiſe inflam'd and Swell'd, ſhe
ran from one to another for help, till at length ſhe was
told it was a Cancer, and muſt be cut off, ſhe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
by one that had us'd the Liniment in a Swell'd
Breaſt, to come to me, which ſhe did. The Symptoms
were ſo bad, that I very much queſtion'd her Cure,
yet I undertook her, and order'd her to anoint with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51771:19"/>
the Liniment, which ſhe had not us'd above a Week,
but the Pain much abated, and Swelling began to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and ſhe continued it conſtantly Night and Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and in about Two Months time, was at well as
ever ſhe was in her Life.</p>
            <p>A Gentlewoman, a particular Friend of mine, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Lying-in had a ſore Breaſt, which, altho' broke,
continued hard and ſometimes painful, at length is
turn'd to a Gleety Humour, running out at a place
near the Nipple like a Fiſtula, the Humour that run
being ſometimes yellow, and ſometimes of other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
and ſometimes thick, at other times thin, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it did not run at all, at other times burſt our
again, ſtill continuing hard, tender and ſomething
painful, which put her in fear of a Cancer, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
did ſomething reſemble a Fiſtulous Cancer; but
notwithſtanding, upon bathing all the Swelling with
the Liniment before ſpoken of, ſhe in about Sixteen
Weeks got cur'd of it, and is now perfectly well,
tho' it be Four Years ſince it was perform'd, only
at times ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pills before-mentioned,
were given her inwardly to purge a little, which are
moſt proper, when Humours abound, and the Body
be groſs, or foul, to purge now and then, in order
to the quicker and more certain amendment.</p>
            <p>A Gentlewoman by a punch upon her Breaſt by a
Man's ruſhing by her in the Street, had ſuch a Pain,
throbbing, and at length Inflamation and Swelling,
that ſhe was told it was a Cancer, and had divers
things of divers Perſons for Cure, but all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
rather aggravating than abating the Symptoms.
She took inwardly Wood-lice, for a Month together
us'd Bleeding, Purging, and to the Breaſt Poultices,
Ointments, Oyls, Suphs, and even every thing ſhe
had heard commended: At length ſome Body told
her of my Liniment, ſhe came to my Houſe and had
it, by the uſe of which, and now and then purging
with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pills aforeſaid, ſhe became, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well in about Nine Weeks time, tho' I was at
firſt jealous, whether ever it would be cured or
not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51771:20"/>
I could give many other inſtances, were it not
needleſs; theſe two or three I think ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
if not, more will not do it; which however,
the uſe of the Liniment will, that it is really the
only Medicine I believe upon the Earth, for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Swellings on the Breaſts of Women, whether
Cancerous or not, and whether broken or whole, to
anoint the hardneſs or Swelling; but to the Sores it
muſt not be apply'd, but muſt be manag'd by ſome
Surgeon; either do I believe any Medicine whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
will do like it; for it diſperſes all the hard and
tumify'd Kernels, takes off all Pain, Bruiſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations;
for if inflam'd, it preſently abates it, if
the Breaſt be cold, as ſome have obſerv'd it to be, it
warms and comforts it; and in fine, does every thing
Nature in that Matter requires to be done, curing
all Indiſpoſitions of the Breaſts curable. Therefore
for the ſakes of thoſe that ſtand in need, I wiſh they
were as ſenſible of its Effects as I am, and then none
under that Calamity but would uſe it, and where
now there are Twenty Cancerated Breaſts, there
would not be Three, as I am verily perſwaded; ſuch
is the great force, power and vertue of this Liniment,
which is ſo innocent that it may be eat, and yet
of ſuch wonderful Effects, that if any ſore Breaſt be
to be cur'd, 'twill infallibly do it, and if incurable,
will no more injure it than applying upon it only a
piece of Flannel or Cloth.</p>
            <p>By this time the Reader may be in expectation, or
at leaſt wiſe deſirous of knowing what this Liniment
is compounded of, which I muſt beg pardon for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing;
and ſhall proceed to direct the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of uſing it, which is thus; Anoint the Swell'd
or Pain'd Breaſt with a little of it, with a warm
Hand every Night and Morning, for almoſt a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an Hour together, applying a Piece of Flannel
over; and this muſt be done daily for a conſiderable
time; for it is frequently obſerv'd, that the Glands
in the Breaſts are very hard, and it cannot be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
they ſhould ſoften preſently; but this every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51771:20"/>
may depend upon, that if they continue uſing it,
without once omitting it, it will infallibly cure; ſome
People are cur'd ſooner by it, in others it is longer firſt,
according to the Condition of the Breaſt and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Patient; but the Rule muſt be this, to
perſiſt in the uſe of it, till the Pain, Swelling, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all gone, which infallibly will be,
ſometimes in a Month (as have been done in very bad
Breaſts) have been cured by it, and ſome ſooner;
others again have taken up two or three Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have been well; but then they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
found an Amendment, which I affirm by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
under God, every one, that keeps ſtrictly to
its uſe, without wavering, or being weary, and I
think none ſhould be tired on ſuch an account; for
what would one give to be cur'd of an incurable
Cancer? Let every one but conſider that, and they
will not be a weary of doing that which will reſtore
them to their Health, and preſerve their Lives, which,
I ſay, under God, this Liniment will do, if uſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as is directed.</p>
            <p>But, as ſaid before, it is neceſſary in ſome Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
to uſe a little Purging alſo, during the uſe
of the Liniment, eſpecially in Bodies that are groſs
or ſoul, and where the Humours flow to the Breaſt
to cauſe Inflammation, Pain or more Swelling, or if
the Habit of the Body be but indifferent; in ſuch
Caſes, and indeed moſt caſes of ſore Breaſts, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to Purge, to do which, nothing can be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
or more adapted to correct or carry off thoſe ſort
of Humours, whether Cancerous or otherwiſe, than
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scorbutick Pill, ſo largely before ſpoken of,
the taking of two, three, four, five or ſix of which,
according as is the ſtrength of the Patient, every third
or fourth Morning, oftner or ſeldomer, as there may be
occaſion, keeping warm thoſe days, and drinking Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-drink,
Broth or Gruel warm as they operate, and
as is directed in the account given, will be of excellent
uſe, and contribute greatly to the benefit of the Patient;
ſo that the Pills inwardly and the Liniment outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51771:21"/>
will do more I verily believe in Cancerated, Swell'd,
Sore or hard Breaſts, than any ſort of Medicines or
Methods, that can by all the Phyſicians in the World
be preſcrib'd or advis'd to; for I ſpeak it from large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and where it not ſo, I ſhould not be ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
in the Matter as I am; therefore all People may
depend upon it, which when they have tryed, will
eſteem it, as many others do, to be the only Remedies
in that caſe in the whole World.</p>
            <p>The Price of this Liniment is Five Shillings the
Gallipot. To be had only at the Place aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>

Diſeaſes which do very frequently deceive numbers of
Perſons that are afflicted therewith, ſo as that they

benefits, before I come to treat of the aboveſaid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
for the Cure, deſcribe the Symptoms and
Cauſes thereof, and begin firſt with the Vapours.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, the Vapours, otherwiſe called Hyſterick
Fits, or Fits of the Mother, is a Diſeaſe which more
generally afflicts Humane Kind than any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
and <hi>Proteus</hi> like, transforms it ſelf into the
Shape and Repreſentation of almoſt all Diſtempers, thoſe
who are troubled therewith, generally perceiving them
approach in the following manner: Firſt, they feel a
heavineſs upon their Breaſt, a grumbling in their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they belch up, and ſometimes Vomit ſowr, ſharp,
inſipid, or bitter Humour; they have a difficulty in
breathing, and think they feel ſomething come up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Throat, which is ready to choak them, they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51771:22"/>
ſtruggle, cry out, make odd and inarticulate Sounds
or Mutterings, they perceive a Swimming in their
Heads, a Dimneſs come over their Eyes, they turn
Pale, are ſcarce able to ſtand, their Pulſe is weak, they
ſhut their Eyes, cry, ſhriek out, groan, foam at the
Mouth, and remain Senſeleſs for ſome time, afterwards
by little and little their Pulſe returns, their Face re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
its natural colour, their Body grows hot, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they open their Eyes, and by degrees come to
themſelves.</p>
            <p>Some moreover, have their Bellies ſwell'd and
ſtretched like a Drum, their Hypochondria's diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and they fancy they feel ſomewhat within them
rowl from place to place, which the Ancients ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
to be the Womb changing from place to place,
whereas the Ligaments which tye it down render
that impoſſible; beſides that, Men are alſo afflicted
with this Symptom as well as Women; their Pulſe
is almoſt imperceptible, they feel a violent Cold
run up their Backs, which afterwards ſtrikes through
their whole Body, their Head-achs, and ſometimes
there enſues a Palpitation of the Heart and a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away; there are many, who when theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
are over, come quietly to themſelves by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and in others when the violent cold is ended a
no leſs violent Heat ſucceeds, which caſts them again
into many of the former accidents, as Palpitation of
the Heart, Head-achs, Giddineſs, difficulty in Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and into ſome new ones, as Fluſhings of the Face,
Raving, Convulſions, foaming at the Mouth, violent
beating of the Muſcles and Arteries, and a tingling Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
in the Thighs, which are Paralitick, during the
cold Fit; nay, ſometimes the Palſie will continue in
the hot Fit too, ſometimes the cold with which the Fit
begins is hardly perceptible, and then the Patient has
no remarkable accidents whilſt the cold laſts; but when
the hot Fit comes on, it is accompanied with ſeveral of
the above-numbred accidents, but the Pulſe beats high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and quicker than in the foregoing ſtate, and if no
coldneſs was to be perceived at all before the hot Fit,
then many of the ſame accidents will happen, but only
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51771:22"/>
in a more violent degree, and ſtill more frequent and
beats higher.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the Patients in this Diſtemper fall into
ſuch violent Fits of Struggling, that they can hardly
be held; they mutter odd and inarticulate Sounds,
grate their Teeth, foam at their Mouths, and ſtrike
their Breaſts; others ſuffer much violent, and long

            <p>One complains of a violent Pain on the top of
her Head, which is frequently accompanied with Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting.</p>
            <p>Another is troubled with a Pain under her Heart,
and a reaching to Vomit, or Vomits a mixture of
Porraceous and Cholerick Humours, and it ends in a
Jaundice.</p>
            <p>A third lyes with her Jaws preſs'd together with all
the violence imaginable, and her Noſtrils drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo cloſe that ſhe is in danger of being ſuffocated,
and ſometimes remains for a conſiderable while as if ſhe
were dead.</p>
            <p>A fourth upon the ſmell of Civit, Musk, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergreaſe,
or any ſuch ſweet Scent, ſhall fall into
Fits.</p>
            <p>A fifth ſhall be moleſted with them upon any
Anger, Paſſion or Diſturbance of Mind, which is
immediately followed with great quantity of pale
Urine.</p>
            <p>A ſixth is very thoughtful, bluſhes or grows pale
on a ſudden, has a deprav'd Appetite, ſometimes to
craving, at other times to loathing all ſorts of uſual
Meats, and is pleaſed only with the eating of abſurd
things, as Chalk, Charcole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſeventh will on a ſudden fall into extravagant Fits
of Crying or Laughing, without being provok'd by any
external Cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:51771:23"/>
Beſides all theſe, ſeveral other accidents happen to
People troubled with this Diſeaſe, as a Pain in the
Bladder and Kidneys, like that of the Stone and Gravel,
violent Cholicks, Swellings in the Jaws, Shoulders,
Legs, Hands or Thighs, which yield not to the Finger
that preſſes, nor retain any Mark; Pain in the Back,
which all feel more or leſs, as alſo in ſeveral Parts of
the Body ſo violent, that the Place affected cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
touching for a long while afterwards; they breath
ſhort and with Pain, yawn and ſtretch, their Sleep is
diſturb'd, and their Dreams are frightful, their Eyes
are fixt and ſtaring, ſometimes they remember what
happen'd in their Fit, ſometimes they do not, they
cough without intermiſſion, ſpit in vaſt quantities for
ſeveral Weeks, as if they were in a Salivation, with
many other accidents too tedious to enumerate.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we obſerve that thoſe who have labour'd
long under this Diſtempe are oppreſs'd with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Anguiſh of Mind, and a deep Melancholly, always
reflecting on what can perplex, terrifie and diſorder
them moſt, ſo that at leaſt they think their Recovery
impoſſible, and are very angry with thoſe that pretend
there is any hopes of it; the leaſt contradiction to their
will, caſt them into violent Paſſions; they are fickle,
wavering and unconſtant, now reſolving on one thing,
and immediately changing to ſomething elſe, which
they as preſently quit, and by indulging their Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
decline all ſorts of Diverſions.</p>
            <p>But Note, that all theſe accidents do not happen to
every one that has Vapours, or Hyſterick Fits, but ſome
to one ſome to another: This Perſon ſhall be moleſted
with a great many, that with but a few of thoſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
and it ſuffices, that any two or three of them
return by intervals, to have them term'd Vapours.</p>
            <p>It is alſo obſerv'd, that this Diſtemper comes by Fits,
and has its intervals like an Ague, tho' the return be
not exactly Periodical like it, and that in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſm
the ſame accidents happen as did in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
provided the Patient committed no exceſs in

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:51771:23"/>
Thus much for the Symptoms, the next thing to
be conſider'd, is the Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, which is
neceſſary to be taken notice of, the better to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as much as is poſſible, and which ſome aſſign to this,
others to that, and others different to both, which,
tho' all plauſible Notions, fall ſhort of the real cauſe,
wanting Reaſon back'd by Experience and Matter of
Fact to ſupport them; but forbearing to enumerate
their ſeveral imaginary Notions, I ſhall in ſhort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelf to ſhew the true and only Cauſes thereof,
which are Crudities and Indigeſtions of the Stomach,
nothing elſe being to be found within the Stomach and
the Guts capable of producing thoſe Symptoms, unleſs it
be the Aliments we take, but theſe we know when well
concocted and digeſted, are ſo far from producing any
ill effects upon Humane Bodies, that they alone ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
and preſerve them in a capacity of exerciſing their
Natural and Animal Functions: However, if they by
any vitious Concoction turn into Crudities and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions,
then their laudable Qualities are chang'd into
quite oppoſite ones, and they produce the many Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and Symptoms of this Diſtemper; for when by
the vitious qualification of the Ferment of the Stomach,
the Aliments are not well digeſted, they turn into
Crudities, theſe Crudities by little and little gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the wrinkles and ſolds of the Stomach and
Guts, where they lye for ſome time without much ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
motion or fermentation within themſelves, till at
laſt by the Circumjacent Parts, their groſſer Salts are
divided and put into motion, which Fermentation is
augmented by the various Juices that flow into the Guts,
from the many Glands which are placed in the lower
Belly, and by this means they are diſſolv'd and liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
as to enter by the Milky Veins into the Blood,
where they produce all the accidents of this Diſtemper,
which the only way to prevent in all Perſons, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in ſuch where the Vapours are fear'd, is to
cleanſe the Stomach and Bowels of the Saburra which
lies in them; and that frequently, <hi>viz.</hi> once in a
Month, oftner or ſeldomer, as there may be occaſion,
with ſome proper, gentle, abſterſive Vomit or Purge,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51771:24"/>
than which nothing can exceed the famous <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Pills aforegoing, taking them as you ſee occaſion; thus
much for the Symptoms, Cauſes, and Prevention of
the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>But perfectly to cure the Vapours or Hyſterick Fits,
or Fits of the Mother, in ſuch that are ſo unhappily
afflicted, the Cauſe muſt be eradicated, and the Blood
reſtored to its Natural Conſtitution, without which the
effect can never ceaſe, and that the common Medicines
in Practice are not capable of performing it, is daily ſeen
by the few (if any) that are cured therewith, they only

in Men, which is a ſort of Cachexie that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reigns in our Northern Climates, whoſe Symptoms
appearing moſtly in the Hypochondria, is term'd the
Hypochondriack Diſeaſe, and when its Symptoms are
very fierce and exalted, 'tis entitule the Scurvy, a
Name given it by the <hi>Saxons</hi> in Nor<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Germany,</hi> who
are moſt liable to it; the better part of Authors upon
this Subject being amus'd with its Symptoms and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
have vainly fancy'd to eſtabliſh its Original Seat
in ſeveral Bowels that are only accidentally concern'd;
but if they trac'd it to its ſtate of Infancy and firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
they muſt have pitch'd upon the Stomach for
the Place of its Nativity, and upon the Acid viſcous
Cruditie, that a faulty digeſtion occaſion for its Cauſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:51771:24"/>
For our further ſatisfaction in this matter, we ſhall
briefly run over its Symptoms, and if we find that they
owe their Being to an Acid Crudity in the Stomach,
ſhall reckon that we have made our point good. In the
firſt place then, the Appetite is over-keen in Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack
Perſons, their Digeſtion being weak, and follow'd
by Convulſive or weighty Pains in the Stomach, belching
Wind and Noiſe, eſpecially in the left ſide of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
where the Gut-Colon is ſtraitned; they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Coſtive, and Laxatives operate better in them
than Purgatives; if an Artificial or Natural Vomiting
happen, they throw up Acid Matter, which ſtupfiies,
or ſets the Teeth on edge, and which will corrode a
Copper Veſſel ſo as to render it ruſty. After Eating,
they are oft-times ſeiz'd with a gnawing Pain in the
Stomach, reaching along the Back from the lower part
to the Neck of the Gullet (which ſome miſcal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phritick
Pains) as alſo with ſudden fluſhings in the
Face, wringing Pains in the Guts, palpitation of the
Heart, perturbation of Mind, and a difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
occaſion'd either by viſcous Crudities diſtending
the Stomach or Convulſions of the Midriff, and Muſcles
of the Breaſt, or Wind in the Abdomen, hindring the
deſcent of the Midriff; while their Stomach is empty,
they are apt to be giddy and dull, they are liable to
periodical Exaſperations; frequently they are ſenſible
(as it were) of Fumes riſing up from the Belly, and the
Paroxiſm reſembles an Hyſterical Fit, in the Paroxiſm
the colour and conſiſtence of their Urine is inconſtant,
but when 'tis over, returns to a Natural order. Theſe
are the Symptoms of Hypochondriack Perſon, but
all of them are rarely to be ſeen in one Perſon, the moſt
certain Symptoms that always attend, are Gripings and
Wind in the Guts, a weak Stomach, Coſtiveneſs, and
Perturbation of the Head.</p>
            <p>The Symptoms being thus premis'd, we come now
to enquire after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, the firſt and
original of which is a vicious Acid in the Stomach en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
the Appetite, but unfit for Digeſtion, hence
enſues an Acid Crudity in the firſt Paſſages, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praves
the craſis of the Blood, prevents the due ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51771:25"/>
of volatil Spirits, upon which the Lymph becomes
Acid, and the Bile inactive.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Sources of all the preceding Symptoms,
ſince Wind, Noiſe, Griping of the Guts and Coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
are the natural reſult of a vicious Acid in the firſt
Paſſages, as fluſhings in the Face ariſe from its effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence
with the Bile, the Convulſions of the nervous
Membranes in ſeveral Parts of the Body are the effect
of its Iritation; its Crudity impairs the due Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Blood, and cauſes a palpitation of the
Heart, and difficulty of Breathing; it depraves the
Nutritious Juice of the Bowels which ſettles into hard
Swellings, and occaſions a degeneracy and auſterity in
the Spirits; hence Fear, Melancholly, irregular Thoughts
and uncouth emotions enſue.</p>
            <p>The remote Cauſes that promote Crudities are Acid
Liquors or Salt Victuals, or ſuch as are dried in the
Smoak, ſince both partake of the Acid Spirit of Salt or
Soot; alſo want of motion to promote digeſtion, and
the ſpeedy aſſimilation of the Chyle; likewiſe Noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Study and over thoughtfulneſs and care, exhauſt
the Spirits, impoveriſh the Blood, and render the Lymph
acid; Thus much for the Symptoms and Cauſe of this
Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Cure, its conſiſts in correcting and
evacuating the Crudities of the firſt Paſſages, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Stomach, retrieving the due craſis of the
Blood, and reſtoring all wonted Evacuations to their
former courſe, in order to compaſs which ends, let the
following Rules be heedfully minded.</p>
            <p>1ſt, That a Doſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pills aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
be taken ſo often as you find occaſion, with a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
regular Diet, and uſing a moderate quantity of true
natural red Wine mix'd with Water inſtead of Malt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinks,
which, with the uſe of the Suffumigating
Powder I ſhall by and by give directions about, never
fails ſetting them to rights, as numbers in very deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conditions have happily experienced.</p>
            <p>2dly, Their way of living both in the Vapours and
Hypochondriack Melancholly, as to Dyet, ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
chiefly of cooling refreſhing Nouriſhments, Food of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51771:25"/>
good Juyce, eating Water-gruel, Barley and Rice-Broths,
Rice-milk, boil'd and roaſt Veal and Mutton,
Veal or Chicken-Broths not made ſo ſtrong as uſually,
eating no Salt or ſpiced Meats.</p>
            <p>3dly, They muſt ſleep not too much, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
Melancholly or thoughtfulneſs, but be cheerful
and uſe diverſions, keeping in company that is mirthful
and talkative, ride and take the freſh Air; which, with
the variety of different Company and Objects which they
ſee, concur to pleaſure the Mind and remove all anxious
Thoughts, and thereby contribute much towards the
Cure.</p>
            <p>And for all Diſeaſes of the Nerves, Fits of all ſorts,
whether Convulſions, Falling Sickneſs, Apoplexies,
Lethargies, Palſies or other Diſorders of the Animal
Spirits and Brain, Spaſms, Tremblings, Contractions,
Relaxations of the Limbs, Numbneſs, Coldneſs, or
the like, a Doſe now and then of the aforeſaid <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Pills, and uſing the Suffumigating Powder, as I ſhall
preſently direct, nothing will be found more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
eſpecially if the contracted or relaxed Limbs be
anointed every Night with Oil of Amber, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Diet-drink be made and drank conſtantly of,
which is alſo excellent in Vapours and Melancholly.</p>
            <p>Take Muſtard Seeds, 4 Ounces buiſed, Horſe-radiſh
Roots two Ounces, Scurvy-graſs two Handfuls, Aaron
Roots half an Ounce, Bryony Roots two Ounces, boil
all in a Gallon of Spring Water till a Quart be boil'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
then ſtrain it, and drink half a Pint three times
a day.</p>
            <p>Uſe the Suffumigating Powder thus, put a Paper of
it upon ſome live Coals in a Chaſing-diſh or ſome ſuch
a thing, and put in under a Chair with a Hole in it,
clapping a Funnel upon the Coals, ſo that the Smoak
will go through the Funnel, and the Patient ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the Chair bare, will receive it up the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which muſt be ſo done every Night going to Bed,
or once in 2 or 3 Nights, according as there is occaſion,
whereby in Fits, Vapours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is inſtant Relief.
The Price of this Powder is 3 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> the four Papers.
To be had at the Place aforementioned.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a ſhort hint of the Blood, its changes A
nalitically prov'd, and the <hi>Rationale</hi> of the Gout,
its Nature and Cauſes from thence explicately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.</p>
            <p>The Blood of Man is made up of a mixture of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Principles, to wit, a Bitter, a Sweet, a Salt, an
Acid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the mixture and temperaments of which,
while mutual, preſerves the Body in a ſtate of Health,
and conſequently creates no trouble or uneaſineſs: But
when any one of theſe Principles is divided or ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the reſt, and exiſts by it ſelf, then the effects
plainly ſhew what great Trouble, Perplexity, and Pain
it creates in the Body.</p>
            <p>Now nothing more conduces to the ſeparation of
thoſe Homogene Principles of of the Blood, than a fault
in either ſome, or all of the ſix Non-naturals, as Air;
Meat and Drink; Sleep and want of Sleep; the Motion
and Reſt of the Body; the retaining and diſcharging of
the Excrements; and the Paſſions of the Mind; but
the chief error is in Meat and Drink, in pampering
the Body with more plenty than is needful; by which
means the Particles of the Blood are not ſo exactly mix'd
with the reſt of the Maſs, but are blended and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
ſo as to become Heterogeneous (the Principles
jarring one with another) occaſioning ſuch a perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and preternatural Fermentation, as evidently ſhew
Sanguification to be vitiated, and the whoſe Maſs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
thereby forcing the Sharp and Foreign Juices,
together with part of the Serum, by what way it finds;
as for inſtance, if they get into the Guts, they are eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated
by a watery Looſeneſs; if into the Kidneys, by
plenty of Urine; if into the habit of the Body, by the
Pores of the Skin; but if they fall upon the Joynts,
they pierce into the innermost receſles and interſtices of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51771:27"/>
the Nervous Parts, and cauſe the Gout; and as the Salt
in the Serum is the thicker or thinner, it much alters its
Nature; ſo that when the Extremities of the Muſcles,
Tendons, Ligaments, Fibres, and other Nervous parts
of the Joynts are twitched by them, more or leſs Pain,
Heat and Violence are occaſion'd, and it proves to be a
Fit of a longer or ſhorter duration.</p>
            <p>This Serum, tho' it be thin and ſharp, is at firſt but
very ſmall, occaſioning but little Pain; but that little
Pain, if the Cauſe of it be timely remov'd, grows great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
at every Fit, and the more violent the Pain is,
greater ſtore of Serum abounds, and very often a flood
of other Humours is carried along with it; which
cauſes that Swelling, Heat, Throbbing and Uneaſineſs
every one afflicted with it feels, which leaves not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
till the Humour is ſpent, at which time that Fit of
the Gout is at end.</p>
            <p>I ſaid before that a fault in ſome of the ſix Non-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals
nam'd, was the cauſe of the Gout, and that pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
the Body with plenty, was the Chief, I mean
thereby Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, eſpecially upon
eating ſuch Meats as are ſtor'd with ſharp Matter, not
to be ſufficiently ſeparated or diſcharg'd, or that can be
eaſily mix'd or temper'd with the other Juices of our
Bodies; as alſo drinking too plentifully of Wines
which have much Tartar in them: For not only that
Tartar, but the Spiritous part breeds the Gout; which
Spirit conſiſts of an Oil, an Acid and a Volatile Salt,
in which the ſtrength of Wine conſiſts. Yet as Exceſs
therein hurts, ſo Temperance preſerves the Health:
For thoſe Wines which moſt abound with Tartar, are
much more homogene to our Bodies, than other Wines
that have little Tartar in them, and ſhould be made
choice of; and are the beſt with Moderation for all
Conſtitutions and Temperaments, and the Red of all
ſorts, is far more preferrable than the White.</p>
            <p>And not only is it manifeſt that the Gout is bred by
Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, but alſo other innumerable
inconveniencies are caus'd thereby, for by that means
the Appetite is deſtroy'd, the Digeſtions vitiated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
the conſequences of which every one may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51771:27"/>
and time, (if not prevented) will moſt certainly
and fatally determine: For a good Appetite and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Digeſtions, are ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary to the
ſupport and preſervation of Humane Life, that we can
no more <hi>well</hi> ſubſiſt without the one, than we can <hi>long</hi>
without the other; the one indicates Diſeaſes preſent,
the other threatens Diſeaſes to come, and frequently
brings the whole Humane Oeconomy into diſorder and
confuſion: For when there is a depravitty of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae
Viae,</hi> the Chyle into which the Food is converted in
the Stomach, is deprav'd alſo; and according as is the
Chyle, ſo muſt the Blood of neceſſity be, whether it be
good or whether it be bad, and according to which the
Body ſuffers more or leſs.</p>
            <p>And as ſome forts of Meats and Drinks, and Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
therein are hurtful, ſo alſo the Eating of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
are more than ordinary pernicious, for they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the functions of the Body, and injure the mind;
and then at thoſe Seaſons to eat too plentifully, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
much more to the ſpoiling of the Blood, as
every one that has for any time followed the Practice
has obſerv'd; few things being more detrimental and
ruinous to the Health, as all Phyſicians allow; and

not a little; for it weakens the Strength, hurts the

            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Levinus Lemnius</hi> likewiſe ſays, if a Man intends

            </p>
            <p>That is, make light Meals, uſe Exerciſe, and preſerve
his Seed, which is the vital and principal Part of Life,
and certainly nothing more aſſuredly breeds the Gout

and led thither by the interſtices of the Nervous
Parts.</p>
            <p>The ſign of its coming, or being preſent, are ſometimes
wandring Pains, eſpecially in the Joynts of the Feet or
Hands: That it is at hand, is ſhewn by a ſtretching,
yawning, painful wearineſs; Catarrhs, Pains in the
Limbs and Joints, and ſometimes a heavineſs in the
Head, a kind of Feveriſh heat, a pricking Pain in the
Joints, cauſing ſtarting, with inability to move; and
after that comes a Swelling, uſually red, attended with
Watching, loſs of Strength, ſtiffneſs of the Parts, and
ſeveral other complaints, not alike to all at all
times, yet is what Gouty People well know, and
are more acquainted with than is conſiſtent with their
Eaſe.</p>
            <p>The way to remedy this untoward Evil, is firſt to
remove the Cauſe, that is, that which aggravates the
Paroxiſm; and ſecondly to preſerve the Patient from
the return of a Fit, or at leaſtwiſe to render it when it
comes, more eaſy, and not ſo intollerable as we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
find it to be; for when it has once feiz'd a Man,
it will (if not prevented by proper Medicines) return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at certain ſeaſons and diſtances of Time, as the
Gouty Matter in the Blood is a freſh increas'd, gather'd
and led down to the Joints, which diſtances are longer
or ſhorter, and the Paroxiſms greater or leſſer, according
as the Patient live Regular or Irregular, and according
as is the ſtrength or weakneſs of his Conſtitution; for
if it be weak or broke, or the Patient in <hi>Mala Stamina
Vitae,</hi> it occaſions its coming oftener, pains him worſer,
and holds him longer than if the ſame Conſtitution
was ſtronger, and the Patient in <hi>Bona Stamina Vitae;</hi> and
alſo acccording as he takes proper Medicines to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
that Humour, by leading it away by the proper
Paſſages.</p>
            <p>I know ſome Phyſician's Doctrine is to let Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
take her free Courſe, adviſing their Patients to
bear under the burden of that intolerable Miſery
as well as they can. Indeed, in the Knotted Gout the
Advice may hold good, for there, no Cure can be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51771:29"/>
expected, according to that known ancient, but true
<hi>Axiom,</hi>
               <q>Solvere nodoſam neſcit Medicina Podagram.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt the knotted Gout no Medicine can prevail.</p>
            <p>But even there a Cure, as to the Fit, may be obtain'd, as
well as in other Fits of the Gout; for the longer a Patient
lies under its ſeverity the more the Humours of the Body
flow down, which keeps the Part more lax and weaker,
and the Patient longer confin'd, which may be prevented;
and when a Remedy to Eaſe, by carrying thoſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
away by Urine and Perſpiration, which would
crowd down upon thoſe weakned Joints, may ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be had; for a Patient to reject it, and not to hearken
to ſuch a Remedy, ſhews his willingneſs to retain his
Miſery, and is like ſuffering an Ague to ſhake him for
a Year, or ſome certain time, before he'll prevail'd with
to take Medicines to cure it.</p>
            <p>But the common ſaying among all being, That there's
no Cure for the Gout, makes every one's Propoſals look
Prepoſterous, even where there is but the bare menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
of doing it: But if any thing I ſay be found out
that manifeſtly carries off the Gouty Cauſe by Urine
and Perſpiration, which would otherwiſe flow down
to the Joints, ſo that the Patient is ſav'd from the Pain,
I fee not why any ſhould be offended, or that a Gouty
Patient would rather bear his Pain than be ſo incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
as not to make experiment of it, when the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Medicine is ſuch, and the Operation ſo ſafe,
that every one that has any knowledge of things, muſt
allow that it cannot poſſible be hurtful, for that no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation
is more to advantage than by Urine and
Peripiration, and that with ſuch a Medicine as makes a
regular ſeparation by the ſtrainers, by firſt carrying
them away ſmoothly and freely throughly the Uteters,
which always of neceſſity would have been thrown
upon the Joints and conſequently cauſe a Fit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Dieureticks being what all Phyſicians allow to be
the moſt effectual Evacuations to diveſt the Blood of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51771:29"/>
thoſe peccant Salts, which, if not remov'd, would
prove injurious to the Patient.</p>
            <p>And to do this, nothing is more prevalent than the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Pills aforemention'd, whoſe admirable Virtues
are ſuch, that thoſe who never try'd them, will ſcarce
believe; who yet after taking them, will to every one
of their Friends recommend them. Therefore to ſay
more would be needleſs; nothing being ſo like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
a Man of their Efficacy, as making tryal, which
is the truſt Teſt; and by whoſe Succeſs the Reputation
both of the Medicine and the Author deſires to depend,
and by which he is content either to ſtand or to
fall.</p>
            <p>The Pills are taken as directed in the Account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
given of them, and that oftener or ſeldomer, as
there may be occaſion. And to give preſent Eaſe and
remove wholly the Pain, the Cataplaſm is to be apply'd
warm to the Part every Night and Morning, till the
Pain is quite gone, which will ſoon be.</p>
            <p>The Price of the Ingredients is Five Shillings the
Gallipot, which are to be boiled with fix Ounces of
Crumbs of White Bread and a Pint of Milk, to the
conſiſtence of a Cataplaſm, or Poultice, which is to
be ſpread upon Linnen Cloath, as thick as two

True Balſamick Electuary
FOR
All manner of Weakneſſes in Women, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THIS is ſuch a wonderful Medicine that I think
it cannot be equal'd, its Vertues being ſuch
in the Diſtempers to which it is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
as every one that ſhall take it muſt own are
not ordinary, it being a far different thing than what
by its appearance may be taken for by moſt, or the
Medicine makers now adays, would have it to be;
being an Electuary which has done, and (by the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God) will do much more benefit in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
particular Caſes, than any other Medicine of what
kind ſoever, numbers of both Sexes having with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
obſerv'd its Effects, and been cured by it, who for
many Months together have been under Courſes of
Phyſick, by Advice of Eminent Practitioners to no
purpoſe.</p>
            <p>It infallibly and expeditiouſly cures Weakneſſes of
the Back in both Sexes, and all Pains of the Back
whatſoever, whether occaſioned from Bruiſes, Falls,
Wrenches, Strains by lifting, carrying, or by Sickneſs
and Weakneſs, or from Womens Miſcarriages, Lyings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
Frights, Grief, or the like. And for Bearings down,
or falling down of the Womb, by weakneſs or relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51771:30"/>
of the Lagaments, caus'd by hard Travel, or by
violent occaſions, as Blows, Falls, lifting or carrying
heavy Burdens, Over-walking, Running, or the like;
'tis a preſent Remedy, by comforting, eaſing, healing
and ſtrengthning the Parts.</p>
            <p>It effectually prevents Miſcarriages, tho' you have
miſcarried never ſo many times; and this it does by
ſtrengthening and nouriſhing the Womb and weak
Foetus therein; for it corrects the Blood and Humours
that affords Nouriſhment, and if the Symptoms or
danger at any time of Miſcarrying appears, the taking
immediately of this Electuary, certainly ſecures you,
if not too far let alone before you begin.</p>
            <p>It wonderfully corrects and alters the heat, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſharpneſs of the Blood, which occaſions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
or over-flowing of the Courſes of Nature, by
which many are reduc'd to a very low and dangerous
condition, and that more eſpecially in Elderly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
upon whom, they ought naturally to ſtop, which
if neglected, and not timely remedied, will occaſion
Bearings down, bring the Whites, and other weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and ſoulneſs of the Womb, introducing in time
Ulcers, Cancers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for prevention of which, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuary
is a moſt admirable Remedy, only the better
to correct and thoroughly to evacuate the vitious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
'twill be neceſſary that you Purge twice or
thrice in the time of taking it with our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pills
aforegoing</p>
            <p>And alſo for the Whites, a Diſeaſe very troubleſome
and ſpending, and which moſt Women are incident
to, both Old and Young, but more eſpecially Elderly
Women, after their Courſes have left them, or are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to leave them, and that generally more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
for want of taking proper Medicines to ſettle
their Bodies at the time of their Termes leaving them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
'tis an excellent Remedy, perfecting the Cure, tho'
of never ſo many Years ſtanding, and the Patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by the length of time and greatneſs of the Flux,
to ſo weak a condition as ſcarcely able to go about, only
twice or thrice, in the time of taking the Electuary,
you muſt alſo Purge with our Pills aforeſaid; but
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51771:31"/>
if the Whites be neglected or not timely cured, they will
bring great pain and weakneſs in the Back and whole
Body, and occaſion many other dangerous Maladies,
as Cachexies, Dropſies, Conſumptions, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> which may
prove fatal.</p>
            <p>Such Women therefore that have regard to their own
welfare, will have recourſe to this Electuary at ſuch time
as the Courſes of Nature are about to leave them, and
not as many do, take little or no care concerning it,
notwithſtanding Nature is always ſo kind to let them
know, that ſhe wants the help of Art at that Juncture,
by their Courſes dodging them, and their flowing but
poorly, and ſometimes not at all, ebbing and flowing
untimely and irregular, ſometimes paler and thinner,
at other times in ſmaller quantity and foul, which is
warning ſufficient, that ſhe ſtands in need of help, and
that they ought at that time to be ſettled and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
after a particular manner, and not be neglected as
many Women to their Sorrow have done, who for
want of ſuch care, are now complaining of either Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
Fluſhings all over the Body, the Whites in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
purſineſs at Stomach, loſs of Appetite, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
Faintings, or other the like Weakneſſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions,
which if not timely remedied, brings
Ulcers or Cancers in the Womb, Dropſies, Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or other fatal Diſtempers; but Women that are
wife will in time prevent thoſe inconveniencies, by
making uſe of this Electuary, which will be of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
advantage; who in the time of taking it
(if Plethorick or full of Blood and not much reduc'd)
muſt once be let Blood, and purge with our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Pills aforegoing, once, juſt before you begin with the
Electuary, and twice or thrice more in the time that
your are taking it, by which means they will aſſuredly
be preſerved and ſecured from thoſe Dangers.</p>
            <p>Alſo for ſuch Women that are afflicted with a Flux
of their Courſes and the Whites together, as numbers
of them are, and reduc'd extreamly low with the ſame,
this Electuary is a Remedy that cannot be equall'd;
only for correction of Humours and the better to cleanſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51771:31"/>
the Womb, 'tis convenient to Purge alſo once or twice
with our Pills aforegoing.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe for all Looſneſſes, Bloody-fluxes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Bleedings, Bleedings at Noſe, Spitting or Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Blood, bloody Urine, and the like, whether
from the ſharpneſs of the Blood, a Vein broke, Falls,
Bruiſes, or any manner of cauſe or occaſion, there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the like preſent Remedy in the whole Republick of
Medicine, it retrieving in ſuch caſes, many times when
all hopes of Life have been diſpair'd of, and diſſolves
congeal'd or coagulated Blood remaining in any part of
the Body; tho' indeed in all thoſe caſes (if ſtrength
will permit) 'twill alſo be neceſſary to Purge now and
then with our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pills aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>And as this Electuary has cured many in the aforego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diſtempers, ſo likewiſe has it perfectly cured ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Children and others of riper Years of incontinency
of Urine, Piſſing in Bed, and the Diabetes, and that

and when multitudes of Medicines have been uſed to

others of the falling down of the Fundament and
Ruptures where the Rim or <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> has not been

            <p>In fine, 'tis ſo excellent a Medicine, that it corrects
and amends all ill Vices, Weakneſſes, Foulneſſes and
diſorders of the Womb, Bowels and Reins, that tend
to corrupt and deſtroy them, whether it be from any
preternatural Fluxes, or abounding of virious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which happening upon the Womb, is
moſt times the cauſe or occaſion of Barenneſs, and will

            <head>OF THE
CAUSES
OF THE
FISTULA in Ano:
OR,
The Fundament,
With its certain Cure by an Injection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Cutting or Burning, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Cauſes of Fiſtula's proceed chiefly from
Plegmons and Hemorrhoids, or Piles, broken or
ill cur'd, or that are not cur'd in a long time;
as alſo from the application of Horſe-leeches to the Pileſ,
which are commonly done, and not well cur'd, they
leaving ſome Venemous Matter behind them, which in
time creates a malignant or corroſive Indiſpoſition, that
in time makes a Sinus, or Hollowneſs, becoming, if neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
Callous; alſo Bruiſes or Hurts on thoſe Parts
cauſe Swellings and Fiſtula's. I ſay often thoſe are the
cauſes of Fiſtula's in the Fundament; but there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cauſe not much taken notice of, or at leaſt wiſe is
what few People care to own, and that is, proceeding
from, an ill cur'd Clap, which is more frequently the
cauſe of Fiſtula's than any other, I having obſerv'd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51771:33"/>
that where one Fiſtula is occaſion'd by any other means,
ten proceeds from that, tho' it may be ſo many Years
after, as to give reaſons to the contrary, yet is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo; eſpecially if the Patient had been for Cure of
that Clap in the Hands of ſome Pretender, or was too
haſtily cur'd, which is what now adays, tho' very
wrongful to the Patient, moſt endeavour to be valu'd
upon, when a true Cure is <hi>gradatium,</hi> and ought to be
no more hudled up, than it ſhould be prolong'd, as
all true Artiſts in ſuch Cures well know.</p>
            <p>The Fiſtula generally comes on gradually, its Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
paſſing at firſt between the Tunicles of the <hi>Inteſtinum
Rectum,</hi> and is of a thin gleety Nature, which makes
its way out near the verge of the Fundament, through
as it were at firſt of a ſmall Pin-hole, and is perceiv'd
by its ſtaining the Shirt or Shift of the Patient without
any Pain, and is thought (tho' miſtakenly) to be rather
a kind of Sweating Moiſture than a real Fiſtulous
Matter.</p>
            <p>But in time, if not remedied, this Humour occaſions
an itching, and ſubjects the Patient to excoriation or
galling of the Part by it continual moiſtneſs and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Humour, which alſo in longer time cauſes
ſeveral kinds of ſmall Pimples or Puſtles to break out;
and ſometimes Rhagades, Fiſſurae or Chops, which at
length cauſes the Sinus to ſpread outwards, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of the Orifice to grow hard, callous and ſo
contracted, as not to admit the paſſing in of a ſmall
Probe.</p>
            <p>Sometimes thoſe Fiſtula's paſs deep among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtitia
of the Muſcles, according to the ſharp Matter
can make its way; ſometimes they penetrate through
the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum</hi> to the very neck of the Bladder,
may, ſometimes into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> or amongſt the <hi>Muſculi
Glut<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i</hi> and other Parts, being then very painful, and
ſends forth a purulent ſanious Matter, ſharp, ugly and
ſtinking, and that in greater or leſs quantity, as the
hollowneſs reaches, which in time grows very Callcus,
and makes its twiſting and twining like a Coney Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow,
which are the very worſt ſort of Fiſtula's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:51771:33"/>
There are two ſorts of Fiſtula's <hi>in Ano,</hi> one pierces
through the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum,</hi> or Gut, into the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament,
and the other not, and both of them are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhallow or deep, which you may eaſily come to
find out. If it paſſes into the Fundament, you will,
upon breaking Wind, find part of it make its way
through the Sinus of the Fiſtula; alſo if the Excrements
appear mingled with the Quittour of the Fiſtula, or if
the Quittour that comes from the outer Orifice of the
Fiſtula ſmells like the Excrements, it is a certain ſign
it paſſes into the Fundament. If by injecting any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
at the outer Orifice of the Fiſtula, part of it paſſes
through into the Fundament, or if by paſſing a pliable
Probe into the outer Orifice of the Fiſtula, you can
feel the end of the Probe bare to your Finger put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Fundament, they are infallible ſigns the Fiſtula
goes into the Fundament.</p>
            <p>As for the Preſages or Prognoſticks of Fiſtula's,
it is allow'd by all that they are not eaſy of Cure; for
the Parts being depending, and as it were the Sink of
the Body, ſo great plenty of Humours and Impurities,
and much ſuperfluous Moiſture ſlows naturally down,
and always hinders the Cure.</p>
            <p>The Curative part of Fiſtula's, Authors tell us, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on five means, <hi>viz.</hi> Diet, internal Medicaments,
Inciſion, Deligation, and Topical Applications. As
for Diet and internal Medicaments, they are what is
abſolutely neceſſary, as alſo ſome Topical means; but
for Inciſion or Cutting, or applying Cauſticks or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives,
ſo frequently now adays advis'd, and almoſt as
frequently perform'd (but with what Succeſs the Patients
themſelves are beſt able to relate) I by no means agree
to, unleſs in ſome particular Caſes, where the Patients
Life is in danger, and where no other means whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
will avail. Such I ſay, for to ſave Life, cutting or
applying Cauſticks <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are and ought to be us'd, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in ſome ſuperficial Fiſtula's that run upwards by the
<hi>Inteſtinum Rectum;</hi> but to make Inciſien in all promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly,
has been the ruine of many, and the one cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
which the Patient was told would be ſufficient
for Cure, has occaſioned more Sinus's by the Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51771:34"/>
and Pain, and the f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uxion of Humours thereby upon
thoſe depending Parts, ſo that cutting again and again
has been done, to the utter ſpoiling of the Patient, cauſing
the Fiſtula to be inveterate, to run much, to the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating
the Body, decaying the Strength, whence loſs or
debilitation of Stomach enſues, and at length Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
cold Sweats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which brings the Fiſtula and
whole Body into ſuch a State, as that all hopes of Cure
are paſt, eſpecially if the Fiſtula was deep, or penetrated
beyond the <hi>Muſculi Ani,</hi> for by cutting ſuch, if they
are cur'd, the Patients will ſcarcely ever retain their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
but with great difficulty, if no worſe accidents
happen; and if they reach beyond the Sphincter, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the excrements will be impoſſible, ſo that
great care ought to be taken, and a Skilful Surgeon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
with, before the Patient ſubmits to be cut at
all.</p>
            <p>It is allow'd by all, that Fiſtula's that are very Sinous,
and have been of long ſtanding, are dangerous and of
difficult Cure, eſpecially if they diſcharge a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Pus, and lie ſo far diſtant, as that there is no
coming at the bottom, but the nearer they are to the
<hi>Anus,</hi> the more eaſie they are of Cure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Anus,</hi> or Fundament, is more ſubject to Fiſtula's
than any other part in the whole Body, becauſe the
great quantity of Fat, with which the <hi>Inteſtinum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi>
is loaded, and the Evacuation of the Excrements
(this being the common Sink where all the filth of the
Body is brought down to be carried off) from its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Humidity and numerous Veſſels, as Branches of

Aſceſſes, Ulcers, Piles; or external, as Blows,
Contuſions, impure Embraces, Falls, Leeches ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which happening more or leſs to meet there,
as being a Part more diſpos'd, it is no wonder to find
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51771:34"/>
Fiſtula's ſo ſoon form'd and ſo frequent as we obſerve
them to be.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Fiſtula's that are not noiſome nor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
troubleſome or painful, and that ſometimes are open
and run, at other times cloſe, and the Patient is dry,
and thus they do for many Years without any great
inconveniency, and is what is found expedient for the
Health of the Patient; for thereby the Body is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
of ſuperfluous Humours, which otherwiſe
might breed great diſorders, and endanger the Patient's
Life. I have known many People have ſuch Fiſtula's
which have contributed greatly to their Health, and
continued on them to the end of their Lives.</p>
            <p>But enough has been ſaid as to the Nature, Cauſe
and Conſequence of this troubleſome and oftentimes
dangerous Indiſpoſition. I ſhall now come to ſpeakof
its Cure, which is what was chiefly at firſt aim'd at,
and what I preſume is by the Patient expected.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid already that cutting is not neceſſary in all,
and ſhew'd wherein it is, and is not for the Patients
ſafety, and where it is not I ſhall recommend a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
which if follow'd according to directions, will
be found more beneficial than many Phyſicians and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
will be ready or willing to believe.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, the Patient is gently to purge with
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pills herein recommended, and to repeat
them oncein a Week, oftner or ſeldomer as the Body
is groſs, or Humours abound, but not to take too large
a Doſe; for gentle Purging is beſt; and he is alſo at the
ſame time to make the following Dyet-drink, which he
is conſtantly to drink of till he is perfectly well; and is
this.</p>
            <p>Take Burdock Roots 8 Ounces; Elecampane Roots
3 Ounces; Tormentil and Biſtort Roots, of each an
Ounce; Sanicle 2 handfuls; Germander, Ground-Ivy
and Agrimony, of each 2 handfuls; Sarſaparilla 6
Ounces; China Roots 3 Ounces; Saſſaphras 3 Ounces;
Guaiacum 4 Ounces; Raiſons of the Sun and Figs, of
each 4 Ounces, Liquoriſh 3 Ounces; boil all in 12
Pints of Lime Water, till 2 Pints are boil'd away, then
ſtrain it and drink half a Pint every Morning, and 4 or 5
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51771:35"/>
in the Evening, and at Night going to Bed, a little
warm'd.</p>
            <p>Upon the uſe of this Dyet-drink, and now and then,
(but not too often) purging with the aforeſaid Pills, and
uſing at the ſame time the Injection into the Fiſtula, the
Patient will find the Cure will come on; for the Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gently carries off the Humonrs, the Dyet-drink dries
up the ſuperfluous Moiſture, and nouriſhes and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
the Body, and the Injection, which I am now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to mention, will cleanſe and cicatrize the Fiſtula,
that the Patient, if he continues the Courſe long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
which he muſt be ſure to do, if he expects to
be well (for thoſe things will take up time, in ſome
more in ſome leſs, according as is the Indiſpoſition)
will find it to anſwer his expectation, without the pain
and danger of cutting, which has ruin'd many.</p>
            <p>The Injection for this purpoſe is neither corroſive or
will cauſe pain; it is to be injected into the Fiſtula eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Night and Morning warm with a Syringe, two Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes
full each time, which upon caſting in, he will
find (if the Fiſtula goes into the Fundament) to come
ſome of it out at the Fundament; but he is not to put
the point of the Syringe into the Fiſtula too far, but
juſt ſo much in, as that the Liquor will be forc'd into
the Orifice;</p>
            <p>By this means I have cur'd ſeveral, and moſt, if
not all that uſe the method, will have the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
for the Injection takes away all Calloſity; and
yet I ſay, without pain, cleanſes, aſtringes, dries up
and cicatrizes the Part, that by degrees the Fiſtula will
cloſe and heal up from end to end to the great pleaſure
and ſatisfaction of the before terrify'd Patient, who
cou'd hear nothing from his Surgeon but Cutting, Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
which News is receiv'd by ſome as unwelcome as
an <hi>Old-Baily</hi> Sentence to a Criminal.</p>
            <p>The Price of the Injection is 5s. the Bottle. To be
had only at the Place before-mentioned.</p>

Thirſt in ſuch is but ſmall, the Urine white or thin,
and watery, or thick and troubled; and the hot Fit
generally laſts eighteen Hours, and ſometimes with
Vomiting of Phlegm. Theſe Fits oftentimes ſeize the
Patient in the Night-time, and is frequently dangerous,
becauſe its continuance being long, is more ſubject to
degenerate into a Cachexie, Dropſy or Lethargy.
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, That it is more dangerous if it comes
in the Day-time, than if it comes in the Night. It is
the Stomach that is for the moſt part afflicted in theſe
Agues, becauſe, as ſaid before, the Patient in the Fit

gives relief.</p>

Diſeaſe, and more particularly into a Dropſy.</p>
            <p>Others are Tertian Agues, or Agues of the third Day,
and comes with vehement cold or rigorous ſhaking Fit,
as tho' the Patient were pricked, follow'd with a hot
Fit and other Symptoms; the Pulſe is equal, and anon
a violent heat increaſeth, with great Thirſt, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
vomiting of Choler, with reddiſh Urine; giving
the Patient very great uneaſineſs, dreading every Fit,
which oftetimes is more than other, ſhifting as to times,
keeping no periodical Paroxiſms, but comes ſo uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
that the Patient knows not in that Day what
time to expect it. The ſhaking coldneſs at firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is vehement and ſharp, the heat and burning in
the hot Fit is alſo violent and ſtrong, ſpreading it ſelf
over the whole Body in the heigtht of the Fit; and
towards the end of the hot Fit, the whole Body is in
a gentle Sweat. Theſe ſort of Agues holding not above
the fourth Fit, other times not above the ſeventh, each
Fit holding not above Twelve Hours, and is without
much danger, unleſs Malignity be joyn'd with it;
and if breakings out on the Lips, Scabs or a Looſneſs
happens, it is very healthful, becauſe they are critical,
tho' theſe are Malign and Peſtilential Tertians, which,
tho' they have evident Intermiſſions as the others, yet
do often kill the Patient; beſides, many accidents may
fall in upon a Tertian Ague, ſuch as a Surfeit, violent
Cold, &amp;c. which may breed danger, tho' the Ague
may have none of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Other Agues there are called Semi-tertian, which
whether they be exquiſite, that is, where Choler and
Phlegm equally abound, vexing the Patient continually,
but the third Day with a ſhaking Fit, or Spurious,
wherein either Choler or Phlegm moſt abounds; if the
firſt, repreſent chiefly a Tertian, if the latter, a Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51771:41"/>
of which we have ſpoken before; yet theſe cauſe
no great Thirſt or Burning, but ſometimes is attended
with an inflamation of ſome Viſcera, or Bowels, as
Stomach, Liver, Spleen, or Parts adjacent, which is
caus'd when the Feveriſh Matter is carried thither with
the Blood. The Semiter-tian Ague, both exquiſite and
ſpurious (for they differ chiefly in degree) are both
dangerous, becauſe thereby the Stomach and Nervous
Parts are very much affected, and is attended with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
a continuil burning Fever; but eſpecially the
exquiſite, being there is a dryneſs of the Tongue, Thirſt,
Swooning, Watching, and ſometimes raving and dead
Sleep, and is what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> account amongſt acute
Diſeaſes, and continues long; <hi>Avicen</hi> ſays ſeven
Months, and at laſt ends frequently in a Hectick.</p>
            <p>There is alſo the double Tertian Ague, which comes
once or twice a Day, two Days together, leaving the
Patient free one Day between. Some Authors menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a triple Tertian, where there are three Fits in two
Days, and one Day clear between; but is reckon'd to be
ſeldom ſeen, and leſs eaſie to be diſcover'd by a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
tho' he had <hi>Argus</hi>'s Eyes. Theſe Agues are
chiefly of Humours gather'd together in the Liver, Gall,
Stomach, Meſentery, Pancreas, or in the Veins of thoſe
Parts. In this Ague it is a hard Matter to get a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
time for the giving Medicine to Cure, becauſe
oftentimes there is no long; ſpace beetween the two Fits;
for ſometimes the Fits hold ſo long, that the one begins
before the other is ended, being thereby much more
dangerous than a Semi-tertian, becauſe it comes from a
reduplication of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The next is the Quarian Ague, or Ague that comes
every fourth Day, and is accompanied with vehement
Cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if it would nip and break the Bones; the Pulle
is flow in the beginning of the Fit, and afterwards the
Melancholly Humour by little and little is inflam'd,
whence comes a burning or hot Fit; the Urine is white,
thin and watery, with two Days intermiſſion each Fit;
and when the Fit is coming, it cauſes reachings and
yawning, with a ſhaking Fit: at firſt ſmall, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
extream, yet not ſo much pricking, as rendring the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51771:41"/>
Patient as if he were beat or bruiſel; the Cauſe is
from Melancholly and adult Humours, known by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying
the Appetite, cauſing great Chirſts, and Head
and Back ach. Theſe ſort of Agues are of all of them,
of longeſt continuance, handling a Patient ſometimes
half a Year or a Year, or if it happen in the fall of the
Leaf, two Years or longer; and is ſometimes dangerous,
eſpecially if it degenerates into a continual Quartan,
or happens to afflict People of Sixty Years of Age or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</p>
            <p>There is alſo the Compound Quartan Ague, which
is either double or triple: in the double, the Fit leaves
the Patient two Days free, and comes the next two
Days; in the triple, the Paroxiſm returns three Days
together, leaving two Days free after them, as in a
Quotidian and double Tertian; theſe come of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly.
Putrifying in divers parts of the Body, and are
dangerous, if not in time cured, being elſe apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
into chronick, inveterate and incurable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
and that becauſe the Fit ſo often returns; it ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates
and waſtes the Body exceedingly, conſuming the
radical Moiſture, depreſſing the Spirits, obſtructing the
Natural, Vital and Animal Functions, and at laſt
brings the Body into an incurable Hectick, Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Dropſy: But if the Ague be taken in time,
and it happens to a young ſtrong Perſon, and proper
Medicines be exhibited, there may be no great doubt of
a Cure; but if it happens to an old Perſon, who is
weak of Nature, and that in the Winter alſo, it is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
and if cannot ſoon be got off, but contiues
long, will prove Mortal.</p>
            <p>Thus have I run through the Nature and Cauſes of
the diſtinct ſorts of Agues, and which, as all Authors
obſerve, are generally to be cured by the ſame Claſs of
Medicines, only regarding the Strength and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Patient.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Vegetable and Plaiſters, at firſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
ſeldom or never fail, if us'd together, to cure
the moſt inveterate and chronick ſort, provided they
both be made uſe of in time, before Nature is too
much depreſs'd by the ſeverity of the Diſeaſe, and yet
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51771:42"/>
even in People that were Young, and not Old,
they have effected the Cure, which before had baffled
Jeſuits Powder, the Bitters, Alteratives, &amp;c. And
in thoſe Agues of late ſtanding, the Vegetable alone
has cured without the Plaiſter, and in ſome the Plaiſter
without the Vegetable; but where the Caſe is ſevere,
to expedite the Cure, I generally uſe both; but ſome,
(eſpecially Children) cannot be gotten to take any
inward Medicine at all, and there the applying the
Plaiſters moſt commonly does, only muſt be renewed
more times than there would be occaſion, if the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

compreſſing the Belly with the Fingers, it pits and
leaves the print of them thereon; and if the Patient
turns from ſide to ſide, a Noiſe like the murmuring or
