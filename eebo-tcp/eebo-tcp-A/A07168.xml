            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honorable, among all ſciences that may bee lightly obtayned, and among many goodly exerciſes and experiences for men, there is none (among the reaſt) more meete and requiſite, or that more doth refreſh the vital ſpirits of men, nor more engender admiration in the effectes of nature, or that is cauſe of greater recreation to the wearie and traueyled ſpirite of man, or more profitable to mans life, than is the ſkil of planting and graffing, the which not only we may ſee with our eyes, but alſo feele with our handes in the ſecret workes of nature: yea, nothing more diſcouereth vnto vs the great &amp; incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible worke of god, that of one litle Pepin ſede, Nut or ſmall plant, may come the ſelfeſame herb or tree, &amp; to bring forth infinite of the ſame fruit, which alſo doth ſhine and ſhew forth it ſelfe vnto vs, eſpecially in the ſpring time, by their diuerſitie of ſhootes, bloſſoms &amp; buds, in diuers kindes of nature, by the goodneſſe and mightie power of the great Lorde and Creator to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his people, in ſuch thinges as commeth forth of the naturall earth, to nouriſhe, to ſuſtayne and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our lyues. What greater pleaſure can there be, than to ſmell the ſweete odour of herbes, trees, and fruites, and to beholde the goodly colour of the ſame, which in certaine tymes of the yeare commeth foorth of the wombe of their mother and nourſe, and ſo to vnderſtande the ſecrete operation in the ſame. And to be ſhort, of this labour (in our lyues) we do take part therof with great gaines and reuenues that come ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, where as through ydleneſſe there commeth none:
<pb facs="tcp:12683:3"/>
therefore to augment the ſame, it ſhall be good to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe and mittigate all fond delightes and vaine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, with ſuch lyke vanities, and cleane put out and aboliſh the delightes of all vices. Wherefore the Poet ſayth: let vs prayſe the true labouring houre of the true labourer. Therevpon many great Lordes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſonages, haue left their theatres, pleaſant ſtages, goodly paſtimes, forſaking and deſpiſing their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, not much regarding rich Diademes, and coſtly perfumes, but haue giuen themſelues to Planting and Graffing, and ſuch like. In ſuch ſort, that if we ſhould diligently ſearch, and recite all the diſcourſe of aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Hiſtories, as of late dayes we ſhould finde, that the moſt noble perſonages through their vertue, hath ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed many goodlye examples, as in one Theatre a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme degree honorable: nor haue had nothing more deare, more requiſite, or more greatly in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, than Planting &amp; Graffing of fruit. <hi>Cyrus</hi> a great king of the Perſians (as witneſſe <hi>Xenophon,</hi>) did ſo much delite in the Art of planting &amp; graffing, (which did ſhew a great prayſe and glorie vnto his perſonage,) that he had no greater deſire or pleaſure, than when he might occupy himſelfe in Planting &amp; Graffing to garniſh the earth, to place and order thereon certaine number of trees. The Emperour <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> (as doth recite, <hi>Sextus Aurelius Victor,</hi>) of his owne good will without any conſtraynt, did leaue the ſcepter of his Empire for to remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the fieldes. So much pleaſure did he take in planting of fruit, in making of Orchardes &amp; Gardens, which he did make, garniſh, and finiſhe with his owne handes. The Senatours, Dictatours, and Conſuls of the Romaynes, among all other things haue commended Planting and Graffing to bee one of the moſt flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing labours in this worlde for the common wealth, the which was celebrated and counted a great vertue:
<pb facs="tcp:12683:3"/>
yea, they did ſo much eſteeme it, that they did hang ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thereof in diuers places, neuer thinking the tyme more aptly ſpent, than in Pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting &amp; Graffing, nothing more contenting themſelues, nothing more deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any other affayres for the common wealth, than in ſetting, ſowing or planting on the earth. How much we may prayſe of late dayes and commend our trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers from other countreys, it is eaſie to be perceyued and knowne, but of Lords, Gentlemen, &amp; Merchants, which haue had (as it doth appeare) a great regarde in theſe latter dayes, howe they might folow the example of others: Wherby it hath repleniſhed this our realme with diuers ſtraunge Plants, Herbes, and Trees, very good and neceſſarie for the common wealth, not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore commonly knowne. And beholde, aboue all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (for the common wealth) we ought to giue a ſure and certaine iudgement, that Planting and Graffing is more highly to be commended and prayſed, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other worthie and noble things in this worlde: for this Art hath not onely from tyme to tyme, beene put in vſe and practiſe of labour through kings and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but alſo it hath bene put in writing of many great and worthie perſonages, in diuers kinde of languages, as in Greke by Philometor, Hieron, Acheleus, Orphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Muſceus, Homer, Hoſiode, Conſtantine, Ceſar: and in Latin, by Verron, Caton, Columella, Paladius, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill, Amilius Macer, and in the Portingall tongue by king Attalus and Mago, (the which reciteth the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes) that after their death, the bookes of planting and graffing were brought to Rome, ſoone after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Carthage. Likewiſe howe many ſince haue written onely of zeale and loue for their countrey and common wealth, of the fruitfull arte of planting and graffing: yea of late dayes howe many worthie men by their learning haue written likewiſe thereof, ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:12683:4"/>
ſeeme that it hath come from their aunceſters, as the greateſt honour, through the noble inuention of the ſame. Lykewiſe I dare boldely affirme, not onely the learned haue written, but alſo haue bene practiſers and inuenters of the ſame, (as witneſſeth diuers hyſtories) in diuers and many ſecrete thing, wherein I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, they haue not ſo learnedly, nor ſo exactly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but they haue more exactly taught and left in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng things ſo certaine, that their ſucceſſours may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily marke, obſerue, and keepe the ſame: for euery one hath written according to the nature of his countrey. The Greekes for Greece, the Barbarians for Barbarie, the Italians for Italy, the French men for Fraunce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. which writing without the order and practiſe, doth very ſmall profite for this our Realme of England, the which I can blame nothing more than the negligence of our nation, which hath had ſmall care heretofore in planting and graffing, in ſome places of this realme (as I haue knowne) where as good and well diſpoſed haue graffed, the euill and malicious perſon hath ſone after deſtroyed them againe: but if we would endeuor our ſelues thervnto (as other countreys doe,) we might floriſh, and haue many a ſtraunge kinde of fruit (which now we haue oftentimes the want thereof) that might greatly pleaſure and ſerue manye wayes both for the rich and poore, as well as in Grece, Barbarie, Italy, or Fraunce, if our nation were giuen ſo well that way as they are.</p>
            <p>Right honourable, for ſo much as I haue bene long in declaring of our predeceſſours, I will nowe leaue, (troubling your honour any further) and reſt from the other things accompliſhing my deſire, beſeching your Lordſhip to take this my ſimple traueile in good part, requeſting no other recompence for my paine herein, but wiſhing it might be put in a generall practiſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

this realme, whereby in ſmall tyme it would grow vnto a great profite and commoditie both to the riche and poore, wherein I ſhould thinke my ſelfe not onely happie, but alſo to haue a iuſt tribute for my deſertes, and alſo this Realme might thereby receyue no ſmall benefite, with prayſe of other countreys, in folowing our predeceſſours in this arte of planting and graffing: ſome places of this Realme are greatly commended and prayſed among others, as Kent for the chiefeſt, which vertue (notwithſtanding) can not be cleane put out or forgoten, ſpecially, when ſuch as your honour ſhall ſeeme to fauour the ſame, and alſo to ſee the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde doyngs thereof, in ſuch groundes and Lordſhips as ye doe poſſeſſe, the which at this time hath onely mooued me to attempt vnto your honor this my ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple trauaile, which is not the only dutie that I owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your honour, but as a dewe deſert, not thinking my ſelfe halfe able to recompence your vertuous liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor ſhewing otherwayes howe to recompence the ſame, hath boldned me at this time to commende this my ſimple and rude worke vnto your Lordſhip, not according vnto your eſtate and honour, the which had bene more mete &amp; requiſite to haue had the finiſhing of ſome better worke. Therfore beſeching your honor to wey and accept this mine intent &amp; good will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which thing ſo doing, I ſhall thinke my ſelfe not onely happie, but it ſhall encourage me the more hereafter to take in hande the like or better worke.

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle reader thou ſhalt vnderſtande, I haue taken out of diuerſe Authors this ſimple worke, into our Engliſhe tongue, praying thee for to accept it in good part: in ſo doyng thou ſhalt bolden me to trauail further therin: &amp; thus ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my good will in declaring of diuers wayes of planting and graffing, &amp; how in the meeteſt times of the yeare, with ſhewing of diuers commodities and ſecretes herein, howe to ſet or plant with the roote, and without the roote. Howe to ſow or ſet Pepines or curnelles, with the ordering thereof. Alſo howe to clenſe your graffes and cions, howe to helpe barren and ſicke trees, howe to kill wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and vermin, and to preſerue and keepe fruit: how to plant and proyne your Vines, and to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and preſſe your grape: how to clenſe &amp; moſſe your trees, how to make your Syder and Perry, howe to ſet, chooſe, order and kepe Hoppes, with many other ſecrete practiſes, which ſhall appeere in the table following, that euery perſon may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceyue in theſe our dayes more largely of the art of planting and graffing than heretofore hath bene ſhewed. Which thing is not an exerciſe only to the minde, but likewiſe a great profit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes, with maintenaunce of health vnto the bodie. Therefore ſpare not the bodie to ſhewe ſo great goodneſſe therevnto, &amp; alſo to the common wealth. In theſe dayes (among the reſt) ye may ſee many, whiche be of the baſe and abiect ſort of

the common wealth, as thoſe which wil not ſtick to ſay. Fie on thee ſlaue, what thing is now coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more filthy in theſe days (amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g faire perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) than labooring of the earth which we muſt al liue by. Wel, theſe be dainty perſons: yet thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, what thing is more beautifull to the eye, more profitable to the purſe, or more healthful vnto the body? &amp; herein to put away all nouriſhing of vice and idleneſſe, it is eaſie to recite infinite &amp; many worthy Lordes and Gentlemen, which haue had a greate care to followe the example of others. Wherefore gentle Reader, let vs nowe leaue of from al wanton games and idle paſtimes, and be no more as children whiche ſeeke but their owne gaine and pleaſure, let vs therfore ſeeke one of vs for another in all good woorkes for the common wealth, whereby thoſe that doe come after vs may ſo enioye our workes and trauell herein, as we haue done of our predeceſſours, that therein God may be glorified, prayſed and honored in all our workes of planting and graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing: and we therefore maye be thankefull, from age to age, during this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall lyfe. </p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lwayes before ye do intend to plant or graffe, it ſhal be meete to haue good experience in thinges meete for thys Arte, as in knowing the Natures of all trees and fruites, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Clymates, which be contrarie in euery land: alſo to vnderſtand the Eaſt and Weſt win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, with aſpectes and Starres, to the ende yee maye beginne nothinge that the winde or rayne may oppreſſe, that your labour be not loſt, and to marke alſo and conſider the diſpoſition of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that preſent yeare, for all yeares be not of lyke operation, nor yet after one ſorte, the Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Winter doe not beare one face on the earth, nor the ſpring time alwayes rayny, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne alwaies moyſt: of this none haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, without a good and liuely marking ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, fewe or none (without learning) may diſcerne of the varieties &amp; qualities of the earth, &amp; what he doth aſke or refuſe. Therefore it ſhall be good to haue vnderſtanding of the ground where ye do plant, either Orchard or garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with fruite, firſt it behooueth to make a ſure defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, that not only rude perſons and children may be kept out, but all kinde of hurtfull cattell indomaging your plantes or trees, as Oxen, kyne, Calues, Horſe, Hogges &amp; ſhepe, as the rubbing of Sheepe doth greatly burne the ſappe, and often doth kyll yong

trees and plantes, and where they are broken or bruſed with cattel, it is doubtful to grow after. It ſhal be good alſo, to ſet, plant or graffe trees all of lyke nature and ſtrength togither, that the great and hye trees, may not ouercome the lowe and weake, for when they be not lyke of heyght, they growe, nor rype not your fruit ſo wel at one time but the one before the other: that earth whiche is good for Vynes, is good alſo for other fruite. Ye muſt digge your holes a yeare before ye plant that the earth may be better ſeaſoned, mortifyed and waxe tender, both by rayne in Winter, and heate in Sommer, that therby your plants may take roote the ſooner, if ye will make your holes, and plant both in a yeare, at the leaſt, ye ought to make your holes two monethes before ye plant, and as ſoone as they be made, then it ſhal be good to burne of ſtrawe or ſuch lyke therin, to make your grounde warme: the further ye make them aſunder, the better your trees ſhall beare: make your holes lyke vnto a fornayce, that is, more ſtraight in the mouth than beneath, whereby the rootes may haue the more roome, and by ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the mouth, the leſſe raine or colde ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by in Winter, and alſo leſſe heate to the roote in So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer.

fruite ſo wel: ſome loweth fourtie foote, ſome thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie betweene euery tree: your plantes ought to be greater than the handle of a ſhouell, and the leſſer the better: ſee they be ſtraight, without knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes or knobbes, hauing a long ſtraight graine or barke, which ſhall the ſooner be apt to take graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes, and when ye ſet braunches or boughes of old trees, chooſe the yongeſt and ſtrayteſt braunche therof, and thoſe trees which haue borne yearely good fruite before, take of thoſe which be on the ſunny ſide, ſoner than thoſe that grow in the court or ſhadowe, and when ye take vppe or alter your plantes, ye ſhal note to what winds your plant is ſubiect, and ſo let them be ſette agayne, but thoſe which haue growne in dry groundes, let them be ſet in moyſt ground: your plantes ought to be cut of three foote long. If ye will ſette two or three plantes togither in a hole, ye muſt take heede the roote of one touche not one another, for then the one will periſhe and rot the other, or dye by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes or other varmen, and when ye haue placed your plantes in the earth, it ſhall be good to ſtrike downe to the botto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery hole two ſhort ſtakes as great as your arme, on either ſide your hole one, &amp; let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appeare but a little aboue the earth that ye may (therby in Sommer) giue water vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rootes if neede be.

Firſt ye muſt prepare &amp; make a great bedde or quarter well repleniſhed, blend or mixt with good fat earth, and placed well in the Sunne, and to be well laboured &amp; digged a good time before you do occupie it: and if ye can by any meanes, let it be digged very déepe the Winter before, in blending or mixing it well togither with good fat earth, or elſe to be mixed almoſt the halfe with good dong: and ſo let it rot and ripe togither with the earth. And ſée alwaies that plot be cleane vnto the preſſyng of Syder, that no wilde cions or plantes do ſpring or grow thereon. Then in the moneth of September, December, or thereabouts, take of the pepins or pomes of the ſaide fruite at the firſt preſſing out of your licour, before the Curnels be marred or bruſed: then take out of them, and rub a few at once in a cloth, and dry them betwixt your handes, and take ſo many therof as you ſhall thinke good: then make your bed ſquare, faire and plaine, and ſowe your ſéedes thereon, then take and couer them with a rake lightly, or with earth, not puttyng to muche earth vpon them. This done, deuide your beddes into qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drantes or ſquares of foure foote brode or thereabout, that when ye liſt ye may cleanſe them from the one ſide to the other, without treading thereon.

                  <p>THe ſeconde maner to graffe, is ſtraunge ynough to many: this kinde of graffing is on the toppes of bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of trées, which thing to make them grow light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is not ſoone obtayned: whereſoeuer they be graffed, they do onely require a fayre yong wood, a great Cion or twig, growing hyeſt in the trée toppe, which cions ye ſhall chooſe to graffe on, of many ſortes of frutes if ye wil or as ye ſhal thinke good, which order followeth.</p>
                  <p>TAke graffes of other ſortes of trées which yée woulde graffe in the top thereof, then mount to the toppe of the trée which ye woulde graffe, and cut of the toppes of all ſuch braunches or as many as ye woulde graffe on, and if they be greater than the graffes, which ye would graffe, ye ſhall cut and graffe them lower, as ye doe the ſmall wilde ſtocke aforeſayde. But if the cions that you cut, be as great as your graffe that you graffe on, ye ſhall cut them lower betwixt the olde wood and the newe, or a little more higher, or lower: then cleaue a little and chooſe your graffes in the like ſorte which ye woulde plant, whereof ye ſhall make the inciſion ſhort, with the barke on both ſides lyke, and as thicke on the one ſide as the other, and ſet ſo iuſt in the cleft, that the barke maye be euen and cloſe, as well aboue as beneath, on the one ſide as the other, and ſo bynde him as is aforeſayde. It ſhall ſuffice that euery graffe haue one oylet, or eye, or two at the moſt, without the ioynt, for to leaue them to long if ſhall not be good, and ye muſt dreſſe it with clay and moſſe, and binde it as is aforeſayde. And likewiſe ye may graffe theſe as ye do the little wild ſtocks which ſhould be as great as your graffes and to graffe them as ye do thoſe with ſappe lyke on both ſides, but then ye muſt graffe them in the earth, as thrée fingers off, or there abouts.</p>

Therefore ſuch as are minded to beſtow labour on the grounde, may haue as good hoppe growing in this countrey, as is in other countries: but if ye will not go to the coſt, to make hoppe yardes, ye may with a light charge haue hoppes growe in your hedge rowes, to ſerue as well as the other, and ſhalbe as good for the quantitie as the other in all reſpects: ye may (for lacke of grounde) plant hoppe rootes in hedge rowes, when ye doe quicke ſette vp poles by them when time ſhal require in the ſpring, and to beſtowe euery winter after the gathering your hoppe, on euery hill heade, a ſhouel full of dung to comfort the earth, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will they beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more plentie of hoppe the next yeare following: to conclude, you that haue groundes maye well practiſe in all thinges afore mencioned, and ſpecially to haue hoppe in this ordering, for your ſelues and others, alſo ye ſhall giue encouragement for other to followe hereafter.
