            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am ſurpriz'd at the unbelief which your Letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
me, has ſeiz'd ſome of your Neighbours, who
after a publication in Print, that in the Year 1670<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
there was a League concluded between <hi>Lewis</hi> the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
and <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, for the Introducing of
Popery into <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by overturning
the Fundamental Laws of the Land, have the face ſtill to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
where the ſo much talk'd of League is, between <hi>Lewis</hi>
the Fourteenth, and <hi>James</hi> the Second. They complain, ſay
you, that thoſe who had given them hopes of ſeeing the
Original Treaty, have not been as good as their words. To
ſpeak the truth, Sir, I find ſomething in this their unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proceeding, that at once ſurprizes and confounds me. I
never knew that our Nation had the ill repute in the world
of being ſenſeleſs and ſtupid: Our behaviour in a caſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
our Religion and Liberty, has made it conſpicuous to
all <hi>Europe,</hi> that we know the importance of the one and the
other, and that we are not inſenſible when ſuch dear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
lye at ſtake. But in the mean time, what will all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96043:4"/>
think, when they hear that ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> men do ſtill
doubt of a matter ſo evident, and are reſolved to continue ſo,
till they ſee the Original of that League produc'd, and have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to peruſe it. King <hi>James</hi> ſay they, has flatly denied that
he had made any ſuch League with <hi>France.</hi> Firſt, By the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>d' Albyville</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> 5. <hi>Octob.</hi> 1688. in the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
he preſented to the Deputies of the <hi>States General.</hi> Secondly,
ſince the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration had renewed this Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
againſt him, the Earl of <hi>Sunderland</hi> hath lately writ from
<hi>Holland,</hi> that he knew nothing of any ſuch League.</p>
            <p>Theſe, forſooth, are the two convincing proofs they
relye upon, who will needs doubt of this matter of
fact, and who by theſe doubts againſt all ſenſe and reaſon,
endeavour to make this truth paſs for ſuſpected. Well,
ſuppoſe for once, that my Lord of <hi>Sunderland</hi> knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, and if that which he pretends of his continual
oppoſing himſelf againſt the Popiſh party be true, 'tis no
ſtrange thing, if they were loath to commit their Secrets to
him. But can his ignorance in a caſe which without impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
was not to be communicated to him, becauſe of his
great zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, and the intereſt of the
State, be a ſufficient ground for us to call the matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
King <hi>James</hi> the II. poſitively denies it, in the Memorial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the <hi>States</hi> by the Marquis <hi>d' Albyville,</hi> and after that
in the Anſwer which a Popiſh Lord has writ in his name to the
Declaration of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> And one would think
all this might paſs for a palpable proof, and inconteſtable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the falſeneſs of this pretended League. Will you
give me leave, Sir, plainly to tell you, what my thoughts
are of thoſe upon whom this Declaration of King <hi>James</hi> makes
ſuch an Impreſſion, in ſpite of the Evidence they may have
to the contrary. They ſeem plainly to me to renounce the
uſe of their Reaſon, and to be willing that the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
ſhould in complaiſance to them, do ſo likewiſe. They
cannot be ignorant, that King <hi>James</hi> II. has for many years
been of the Jeſuits Fraternity, or at leaſt that he has been
continually under the conduct of their Councils.</p>
            <p>I can't believe their Memory is ſo ſhort to forget how
at the time of his Shipwrack in going for <hi>Scotland,</hi> he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
many Perſons of great Quality to periſh, that he might
ſave ſome of his Fraternity of the Jeſuits Order, diſguis'd one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96043:4"/>
of them in the Habit of a <hi>Valet de chambre,</hi> and the other in
that of a Cook. They know, that after he had made himſelf
the Head of their Conſpiracy againſt this Kingdom, whilſt
he was yet only Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the effect of this his being
guided by the Jeſuits, proved no leſs than the total over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of all the Laws which he had Sworn to maintain, at
his coming to the Crown, as ſoon as he had got an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to Execute thoſe Projects with Authority, which the
Love of his own Quiet, and fear of hazarding all, had made
King <hi>Charles</hi> his Brother to Suſpend: And yet after all this
they can by no means induce themſelves to believe that
<hi>James</hi> II<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould dare to deny by his Miniſter, that he was
engaged in any League with <hi>France.</hi> Pray let us take a view
of what he did, and therefore durſt do, in contempt of the
Laws of the Land, which he had Sworn to obſerve; he
ſends his Ambaſſador to <hi>Rome,</hi> to teſtifie his Obedience to
the Pope. He gives way to a Nuncio from thence, to reſide
at his Court, in order to advance the Intereſt of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he could not do without being Perjur'd and
Cruel; he makes a Jeſuit one of his Privy Council, in the
Face of all <hi>England,</hi> yea, of all the World, that is a Perſon
guilty of High Treaſon, for having ſet his foot on) Engliſh
ground, and a Member of that Bloody Society, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
liable to the Puniſhment inflicted on Traitors, becauſe
of their Equivocations, Perjuries, and Conſpiracies, which
are the diſtinguiſhing Character of that Fraternity. And yet
in ſpite of all this, we will believe <hi>James</hi> II. ſo ſcrupulous, as
not daring to hide, or diſguiſe a Truth, in a caſe, which the
Intereſt of the Roman Church, and the deſigns he had For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for that End with his Jeſuits, did oblige him to keep
moſt ſecret. Well, if it were ſo indeed, we muſt ſuppoſe it
was a very difficult thing for that Prince to obtain a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
diſpenſation of the Pope, for this concealing of the
Truth, if the general one, he had already obtain'd of him,
for breaking his Coronation Oath, as made to Hereticks,
would not ſerve the turn.</p>
            <p>But pray, Sir, is not this a willful hoodwinking of our
ſelves to lay any ſtreſs upon this Negation of <hi>James</hi> II.
whileſt we have a certain knowledg that there always was
a ſtrict League between the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and the <hi>French</hi>
King; and to aſſure us, that this League has continued ſince
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96043:5"/>
the Duke of <hi>York</hi> has been advanced to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
We have an Authentick Declaration of the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
at the <hi>Hague</hi> very expreſs to that purpoſe. I ſay
we cannot in the leaſt doubt, but that there always was a ſtrict
League between the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King. To
be convinced of this, we need only to caſt an Eye upon
the War of <hi>Holland</hi> in 1670. 'Tis certainly known 'twas
a War of Religion undertaken meerly for the propagation
of <hi>Popery.</hi> The <hi>French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Miniſter manifeſted plainly in his
Speech to the Emperours Council, which has been ſince Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>French,</hi> that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> being Hereticks, who had
forſaken their God, all good Chriſtians are bound to joyn
and unite to extirpate them, and to implore Gods Bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo good a Work. But how cunningly did they proceed
in the Dukes Cabal, to diſſemble the part they had in ſuch
a Deſign. 1. They reformed the <hi>Cabinet Council,</hi> and turn'd
at once out of the <hi>Committee</hi> for Forreign Affairs, Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Lord <hi>Keeper, Trevor</hi> the firſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State, that was ever kept out of a Commiſſion of
that nature. 2. They adviſed His Majeſty to Prorogue the
Parliament according to the <hi>French</hi> Kings deſire. 3. They
ſought a Quarrel againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by ſending a Yatch with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to Sail through the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, and require ſtriking to His
Majeſties Flag: Although the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet was then at Anchor,
not far from their own Coaſt. 4. They fell upon the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Fleet of <hi>Smyrna</hi> without any Declaration of War, when the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadours had offerred all poſſible ſatisfaction to
the King upon this affected Quarrel. 5. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet
fought for the <hi>French</hi> ſo bravely, and interpriſed themſelves
between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> with ſo good a ſucceſs,
that when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, the Strength of our Nation, which
was to be leſſen'd for the execution of their Deſignes, was
reduced into a ſad condition, the <hi>French</hi> Squadron came off
as freſh and as entire as when they firſt Sailed out of their
Ports. 6. When they ſent the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and my
Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> they gave their inſtructions for
the inſiſting in the behalf of the <hi>French,</hi> altho' the ſecond
head of the <hi>French</hi> demands was upon a publick Exerciſe of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> the Church to
be divided, and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts to have a maintainance
out of the Publick Revenue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96043:5"/>
After this we ſhall do well to make ſome reflections upon
<hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters to Sir <hi>W. Throgmorton,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s
Agent at the Court of <hi>France.</hi> See how he expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in one of them dated <hi>February,</hi> 1674/5. <q>For you know
well, that when the Duke comes to be Maſter of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
the King of <hi>France</hi> will have reaſon to promiſe
himſelf all things that he can deſire. For, according to
the mind of the Duke, the Intereſt of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the King of <hi>France,</hi> and his own, are ſo cloſe bound up
together, that it is impoſſible to ſeparate them, the one
from the other, without ruine to all three; but being
joined, they muſt notwithſtanding all oppoſition, become
invincible.</q> Thoſe who knew nothing of the League con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in the Year 1670. were
extreamly at a loſs what to make of thoſe words of <hi>Coleman,</hi>
words ſo expreſs and preciſe, as nothing could be ſaid more.
But they who have ſeen the extract of that League,
publiſhed by the Abbot <hi>Primi,</hi> eaſily conceive, that they
referred to the ſecret League of 1670. and that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court has been ſo induſtrious to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and cultivate the Union with <hi>France,</hi> was only in
order to preſerve thoſe hidden Intereſts, they judged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable,
though the true Intereſt of the State was indeed
diametrically oppoſite to the entertaining any Union with
a Crown, all whoſe deſigns were level'd at the ruine of
<hi>England</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>We find much the ſame ſtile in a Letter of Father
<hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> Jeſuit and Confeſſor to <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. to <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
He ſaith, Page 110. <q>That the <hi>French</hi> King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
his own Intereſt, and the Intereſt of the Duke
of <hi>York,</hi> as one and the ſame thing; and that if the
Duke would undertake to Diſſolve the Parliament, the
<hi>French</hi> King would aſſiſt him, with his Power and Purſe,
to procure ſuch an one afterwards, as might be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their deſigns.</q> Now I ſhould think, that when
one offers ones Power and Purſe to a Prince, that this
ſuppoſes a Treaty with him, and that Prudence would not
permit a King to write to a Prince to employ his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
for Diſſolving a Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> without
knowing himſelf engaged in the greateſt confidence with
him. Some, it may be, will imagine that this was only
an ordinary Treaty. But <hi>Coleman</hi> has expreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96043:6"/>
ſo clearly in the Caſe, that he has not left us room
to miſtake him. See what he writes to Father <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi>
               <q>We have here a mighty work upon our hands, no leſs
than the Converſion of three Kingdoms, and by that
perhaps the ſubduing of a Peſtilent Hereſſe, which has do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer'd
over a great part of the Northern World a long time.
There were never ſuch hopes of Succeſs, ſince the Death
of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> as now in our days, when God has given
us a Prince, who is become (may I ſay to a Miracle)
zealous of being the Author and Inſtrument of ſo glorious
a work, <hi>pag.</hi> 118. collect. of Letters.</q> This was the grand
deſign carried on in 1675, which makes it evident that
the Treaty made by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi> was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
but that the ſame was inviolably obſerv'd, and ſtuck
to. Had we the other Letters of <hi>Coleman</hi> and Father <hi>la
Chaiſe,</hi> as well as of the reſt of the Agents of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Court, which <hi>Coleman</hi> declar'd were ſtill in <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
when he was examin'd, where the reſt of theſe Letters were,
it would be eaſie to judge, that matters have been ſtill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on in the ſame ſtrain, between the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and
the <hi>French King.</hi> There are Men enough that know, that
the choice was made of the Letters that were to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed:
they eclips'd and ſuppreſs'd thoſe, wherein the Court
and Duke of <hi>York</hi> were more particularly concern'd. But
without putting our ſelves to the trouble of gueſſing, we
have but too many Evidences, to leave us the leaſt Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of a Doubt. Can we in <hi>England</hi> forget the things
that paſt, at the time, when the Popiſh Plot was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by <hi>Oates, Bedlow, Prince, Everard, Smith,</hi> &amp;c?
Can we forget the indefatigable Pains the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
took, to turn the Conſpiracy, in which he was ſo
deeply concerned, upon the Presbyterians; as appears from
<hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Diſcovery, publiſhed <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1678.
Can we forego the remembrance of thoſe remarkable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
which happened ſoon after the Aſſaſſination of
Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> the Sham put upon Mr. <hi>Roderick
Manſell,</hi> the Depoſitions of <hi>William Lewis</hi> and <hi>Laurence
Moubray:</hi> The Oaths of Secrecy and the <hi>Litany</hi> of the
Papiſts, publiſh'd by <hi>Robert Bolron?</hi> Can we forget the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
of the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſubject that Kingdom to
the <hi>French</hi> King, as long as we have before our Eyes the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of <hi>Thomas Sampſon</hi> Printed 1680. and the Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Mac-namara, Fitzgerald</hi> and <hi>Naſh,</hi> beſides the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96043:6"/>
about the ſame Subject, ſent in 1680. by the Duke
of <hi>Ormond</hi> to the Court. All theſe particulars appeared
ſo evident to the Parliaments of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi>
that they judged it impoſſible to reſerve for the Duke of
<hi>York</hi> any hopes of his Succeſſion to the Crown; and that
the Court Party and Favourers of the Duke, would have
thought themſelves to have gain'd much, if the Duke, who
was lookt upon as the Author of all theſe Intriegues might
only have retain'd the Title of King, with leaving the
whole Adminiſtration of the Government to the Prince of
<hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Engliſhmen, having ſince that, been ſo good natur'd,
as to admit the Duke to the Crown, after the Death of
King <hi>Charles</hi> II. whom the Papiſts had conſpir'd to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
on purpoſe to make place for the Duke: Let any
one judge whether there be any likelihood, he ſhould have
renounced his League with <hi>France,</hi> which he had always
lookt upon as abſolutely neceſſary for the making his
deſigns to bear: notwitſtanding a publick Neutrality that
was to be heldwith <hi>France,</hi> as he was Guarantee of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Nimeguen.</hi> After all this, a Man muſt have loſt
both Senſe and Memory to ſuppoſe that he broke this
Treaty ſince his coming to the Crown. Moreover we
have ſeen <hi>James</hi> II. an unconcern'd ſpectator of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV.
ſeizing of <hi>Orange,</hi> and of the Deſolation of his Son-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Law's
Subjects, who were forced to embrace the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Religion, by the Violence of Dragoons. All <hi>Europe</hi> have
ſeen the accomodation of the Buſineſs of <hi>Bantam</hi> ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
without any other Reaſon, but the deſign of having
a Pretence in reſerve to break with the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> as alſo
there were equal pains taken in 1670, to find out a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
one, to unite with <hi>France,</hi> and to ruine a State, which
endeavour'd to preſerve the Liberty of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion.</hi> We have ſeen <hi>JAMES</hi> II. affording the
<hi>Algerines</hi> a free retreat into his Havens, and the Convoy
of his Frigats, that they might ſafely carry away with
them the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> they had taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> We have ſeen <hi>JAMES</hi> II.
take the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> from the Earl of <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
to put it into the hands of the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> to
the end he might new model the Army, by putting out
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96043:7"/>
Proteſtants, and ſupplying their Places with Papiſts, as
being more ſuited to carry on his Deſigns againſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland.</hi> We have ſeen him ſend Prince <hi>George</hi>
into <hi>Denmark,</hi> to hinder that Crown from joining with
the Proteſtant Princes, and from quitting his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
with <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Aſſiſtance and Power
were of abſolute neceſſity to him. And within his
own Kingdom, what is it he hath not attempted, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his Deſigns and overthrow the Government in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to his Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> and the Directions of
<hi>Barillon,</hi> his Ambaſſador? He has put all places of
Strength into the Hands of <hi>Papiſts;</hi> he has kept on foot
a numerous Army, to ſuppreſs all thoſe who might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his Deſigns; he has, againſt Law, eſtabliſhed an High
Commiſſion-Court for Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, to violate the
Rights of the Clergy and the Univerſities. He has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
Popiſh Biſhops into <hi>England:</hi> He has allowed a free
exerciſe of that Religion in all Places: All which things
he durſt never have undertaken ſo openly, and with ſo
high a Hand, had he not been ſupported with Hopes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the Treaty he had with <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. whoſe
Arms he lookt upon as able to bring about the Deſigns he
had projected ſo long ſince.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me, that theſe Proceedings are an abundant
proof, that he was engaged in a League with <hi>France:</hi>
But beyond all this, behold here another Argument, which
cannot be gain-ſaid:</p>
            <p>The French Ambaſſadour, the Count <hi>d' Avaux,</hi> was a
publick Perſon at the <hi>Hague,</hi> he ſpoke, with order from
the King his Maſter, and that in the Aſſembly of the
States General; he there peremptorily declares the Ninth
of <hi>September</hi> laſt, That there was an Alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King his Maſter and <hi>James</hi> the Second; he
makes uſe of this League to interpoſe himſelf, by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
Command, upon an occaſion; when <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
that the States were forming ſome Enterpriſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>James</hi> the Second: He delivers his Memorial to
the States, and communicates it to the reſt of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
at the <hi>Hague, Sept.</hi> the 9th. The Memorial was
conceiv'd in theſe Terms:</p>

            <p>This Memorial pleaſured the World with a fit of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to ſee it ſo contrary to the Memorial of the <hi>French</hi>
Embaſſador, notwithſtanding he was very well acquainted
with the Contents of the Memorial preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the Count <hi>de Avaux.</hi> But for all that, both the
Marquiſs <hi>de Albyville,</hi> and thoſe who had dictated the
<hi>French</hi> Memorials, ſpake nothing but the Truth. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96043:8"/>
maintains, in the Name of the King, that there was
no Treaty between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but thoſe that are
in Point; the Count <hi>de Avaux</hi> Aſſerts, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the
Fourteenth is engaged in an Alliance with <hi>James</hi> the
Second, and both of them ſpeak true. The Count <hi>de
Avaux</hi> ſpeaks with reſpect to the Treaty of 1670. betwixt
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, and ſuppoſes,
as indeed it cannot be doubted, that the ſaid Treaty has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ever ſince, with deſign to deſtroy <hi>England</hi> and the
Proteſant Religion, which at firſt gave birth to the ſaid
League. He builds upon this Principle, That the D. of <hi>York,</hi>
who was the great Promoter of it, and who, whilſt he was
in that Station, acted in Conformity with the ſaid ſecret
Treaty, had ſufficiently ratified the ſame ſince his coming to
the Crown; which Promotion of his was therefore ſo Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
deſired, to the end he might more vigorouſly execute
the ſaid Treaty, which <hi>Charles</hi> II. did not, for fear of troubling
his own Repoſe. The Marquiſs <hi>de Albyville,</hi> knowing that this
Treaty had been Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> 1682. in the Hiſtory of the
War of <hi>Holland</hi> by the <hi>Abbot Primi,</hi> but ſoon after ſuppreſt
at the Inſtances of my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> ſuppoſed he might
ſay with a good Conſcience, with reſpect to the ſelf-ſame
Treaty, That his Maſter had no Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> but
what was in Print. So that the ſeeming Contradiction va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth,
as ſoon as we conſider the Perſons that ſpeak. The
one is the Miniſter of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. who is not at all careful
to husband the Intereſts of his Allies, and who thinks he
may ſpeak whatſoever pleaſes him, as he thinks he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
whatſoever he wills, and accordingly declares the Truth
with a great deal of Frankneſs and Liberty: The other is
the Miniſter of <hi>James</hi> II. whom the Society of the Jeſuits
and their Maxims, have model'd for diſguiſing the Truth;
and therefore dares not expoſe it, but under covert of an
Equivocation; by which means, if he owns that which is
true, he reſerves himſelf always the means, and the right
of denying it, when the owning of it might prove a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to him.</p>
            <p>But not to make any further Enlargement here upon
the Jeſuitical Character, of which the Marqueſs <hi>d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byville</hi>
had a competent ſhare, without which Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
he would ſcarcely have been made choice of for
an Extraordinary Envoy: For my part, I cannot ſee
how any thing could more evidently confirm the Truth,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96043:9"/>
than the foreſaid Memorial of the Count <hi>d' Avaux,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he poſitively declares, that there was an Alliance
between <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. and <hi>James</hi> II. And I cannot ſee,
how the moſt reſolved Prejudice can object ought againſt
this Proof, beſides theſe Three Things, which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ridiculous:</p>
            <p>The Firſt is, That King <hi>James</hi> II. is not bound to make
good the Words of a <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpoke at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Reaſon why the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador
did not more punctually contradict the <hi>French</hi> Memorial,
proves only at the moſt, That he was willing enough
to ſee the <hi>Hollanders</hi> affrighted with the Apprehenſion of
this Secret Alliance between both thoſe Kings, though
he did not think fitting to confirm the Belief of that
League, by the Memorial he preſented to the <hi>States
General</hi> the 5th. of <hi>October;</hi> whence it follows, That it may
be there was no ſuch League at all, notwithſtanding the
<hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador thought neceſſary to advance ſuch a
thing, contrary to Truth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third,</hi> is, That if the Marquiſs <hi>d' Albyville,</hi>
were Guilty of ſome Fault on this occaſion, that it is
not juſt to lay the blame of it upon his Maſter; and
the rather, becauſe he was never look'd upon as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
able, and refin'd Miniſter.</p>
            <p>But in anſwer to theſe, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The World knows, That
the Memorial of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, was contrived at
<hi>Paris,</hi> with the Concurrence of Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> the Ambaſſador
of <hi>James</hi> II. So that we cannot pretend, that this Declaration
was made by the <hi>French</hi> King, without knowledge of the
K. of <hi>England.</hi> And tho Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> upon his return from
<hi>France,</hi> was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> for having had a hand
in that Memorial, yet we know this was only a Pretext,
being ſet at Liberty a few days after, and made Colonel of
a Regiment; and not long after, returning thither, not
as a Priſoner, but to be the Governour of it: All which
makes it as clear as the Sun, that this was only a feigned Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
and not the Puniſhment of an unfaithful diſcharge
of a Truſt. <hi>2dly,</hi> I can no way conceive, how any can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that the <hi>French</hi> K. ſhould take the Liberty peremptorily
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96043:9"/>
to aſſert an Alliance, when there was nothing at all of it, only
becauſe he thought it was his Intereſt ſo to do; and that at
the ſame time it was not permitted to <hi>James</hi> II. to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in a Caſe where ſuch a Diſſimulation was of uſe to him.
But I go further, and ſay, That for to diſcover the Myſtery
of the affected Diſſimulation of the Engliſh Ambaſſador
about the League with <hi>France,</hi> we need only to examine
the Behaviour of <hi>James</hi> II. after that Declaration of the
<hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador to the <hi>States General.</hi> If the <hi>French</hi>
Ambaſſador, or the King his Maſter, had advanced an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
in declaring that there was an Alliance between
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. and <hi>James</hi> II. which could not be without an
Infraction of the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> of which the King
of <hi>England</hi> was declared Guarantee, was it not of abſolute
neceſſity for K. <hi>James</hi> to diſavow that Untruth, as ſoon as
he was inform'd what had paſt at the <hi>Hague?</hi> Ought he
not to have made Reparation of the Fault the Marqueſs
<hi>d' Albyville</hi> had committed, by ordering him to explain
himſelf fully about the falſe Suppoſal of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador?
Was it not viſible, that his Honour was extreamly
concern'd in the Declaration of <hi>France;</hi> and that it was
contrary to his Word given to the <hi>States General,</hi> after his
arrival to the Crown, and which he had ſo often ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
to their Ambaſſador in Ordinary? Was it not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
for him to expreſs himſelf plainly, inſtead of ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Fact, as it was done in the <hi>Engliſh Gazette,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
by the Authority of the Court, and reviewed by his
Miniſters; where we find indeed the Memorial of the
Marqueſs <hi>d' Albyville,</hi> given into the <hi>States</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> of
<hi>October,</hi> but not a word of the Memorial of the Count
<hi>d' Avaux,</hi> preſented before. Who ſees not that this
his Silence, after the Declaration of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,
is an evident and ſolid Conviction of the Truth of
the League between him and <hi>France?</hi> For any one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the Objection, by ſaying, that K. <hi>James</hi> II. did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow
the thing openly, in his Anſwer to the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration, is to ſay nothing that may ſatisfy a
Man of Reaſon. Every Thing hath its Time; a Man that
holds his peace, when he ought to ſpeak in his own Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
is preſum'd to be convict of the Thing laid to his
Charge. 'Tis a Maxim of the Civil Law, that <hi>to evident
Preſumption, Proofs muſt be oppos'd:</hi> Wherefore in the Caſe
he was indiſpenſibly obliged to deny the Fact whereof he
was accuſed, and to refute it, at that Time, and in thoſe
Circumſtances; for that Opportunity being once let ſlip,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96043:10"/>
his denying cannot be look'd upon otherwiſe, than as the
Effect of Fears, and extream Neceſſity, which often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
Men to diſguiſe and deny the Truth. And ſurely if
we only pleaſe to caſt an Eye upon the Deſign he had of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
<hi>Portſmouth</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> and ſuffering ſeveral of
their Regiments to take poſſeſſion of it; which Affair took
up much of the Time of the Secret Council in <hi>October</hi> and
<hi>November</hi> 1687. we cannot with any Reaſon doubt of
the Truth of this Secret League between <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, and
<hi>James</hi> II. The Thing was not ſo ſecretly carried, but that
the different Advices given thereupon, came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of ſome, as well as the Names of the Authors of
them, and the Reaſon which hindred the King from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them in that Circumſtance. The Hopes which he
had of getting a Parliament to his mind, that is, ſuch an
one as might overthrow the Laws of the Government, that
was oppoſite to Popery and Tyranny, was the chief Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as is well known to many Perſons of Quality, that
hindred him from taking a Reſolution to make us feel the
Effects of that League, before it was declared in Publick.</p>
            <p>Let us alſo caſt an Eye upon all the Proceedings of
<hi>James</hi> II. till his retiring to <hi>France,</hi> as well as upon thoſe of
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, in favour of him, and we ſhall find them all
but ſo many Effects and Conſequences of the Secret League.
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, always influenc'd the Court of <hi>England</hi> in the
Time of <hi>Charles</hi> II, during whoſe Reign <hi>England</hi> could
not but be ſenſible of the Effects of the Secret Treaty of
1670,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Memorandum,</hi> about the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made to the <hi>States</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, 1672.</note> by the War againſt the <hi>Hollander,</hi> by the frequent
Diſſolutions of her Parliaments, and at length ſaw the
whole Myſtery laid open, in the Conſpiracy of <hi>Coleman,</hi>
Secretary to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who acted nothing without
expreſs Order of his Maſter. Since this, it is become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
to all, that <hi>Charles</hi> II. who went under the Name
of a Proteſtant, and who, notwithſtanding his outward
Profeſſion, did, by Secret Treaties, deſign the overthrow
of the Proteſtant Religion within his three Kingdoms, died
a profeſt Papiſt: And after all this, cannot we perſwade our
ſelves to believe that <hi>James</hi> II. a declared Papiſt, who had
a <hi>Nuncio</hi> to prompt him, and a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> to counſel him, did
confirm or renew a Treaty with <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Proteſtant Religion in the Kingdom, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when all his three Kindoms are Witneſs, that for the
advancing of Popery, he has neither had any regard to the
Laws of the Land, nor to the Oaths he had taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them. Thus much I aſſert boldly, that ſince it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96043:10"/>
be deny'd, but that there was a Secret Treaty betwixt <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, and <hi>James</hi> II,
we can leſs doubt, but that the End and Aim of the Treaty, was the Ruin of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion.</p>
            <p>1. We muſt needs conclude ſo from the Secret Treaty manag'd by the Dutcheſs of
<hi>Orleans,</hi> between <hi>Charles</hi> II. and <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. publiſhed by Abbot <hi>Primi,</hi> in his Hiſtory
of the War with <hi>Holland,</hi> with priviledg of the French King. This Treaty expreſly
tells us, that the French King did promiſe <hi>Charles</hi> II. to ſubject his Parliament to him,
and to re-eſtabliſh the Romiſh Religion in his Kingdoms. We may eaſily gueſs whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe Things could be accompliſh'd any other way than by Force of Arms, that
is, by the Violence and Cruelty of his Dragoons.</p>
            <p>2. Who is, ſo blind as not to ſee that K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. had ever ſince that Treaty, caſt
about to furniſh himſelf with Foreign Force to enſlave his Subjects to his Arbitrary
Power? Thoſe who find difficulty to believe this, need only to conſider the Secret
Treaty he had made with <hi>Spain,</hi> who was to furniſh him with 8000 Men upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and it was to aſſure himſelf of their good Service, that <hi>Charles</hi> II. demanded
Mony of his Parliament in 1680.</p>
            <p>3. Can we be ſo wilful, as not to trace the Current of the Deſign throughout all
<hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, which contain nothing elſe but the Conſpiracy of the Jeſuits and
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> againſt the Government, and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>4. After that <hi>James</hi> II. came to the Crown, notwithſtanding the Juſt Oppoſitions
of the Commons in the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliaments, who eaſily foreſaw all that
is ſince come to paſs; did not he give undoubted Evidence, that he ſtill followed the
ſame Meaſures, when after the Defeat of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> he declared to the Parliament,
that for Time to come, he would make uſe of Popiſh Officers, as well as keep an
Army on foot, contrary to the Laws?</p>
            <p>5. Have we not ſeen the whole bottom of his Deſigns unravell'd, by the Care he took
to fill that Army with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts at the ſame time that he disbanded all that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Army and Souldiers that ſerved him in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he might always have an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
at hand in that Kingdom for to invade <hi>England.</hi> It appears beyond a poſſibility
of doubting, that all theſe Proceedings were only founded on the Continuation of a
Deſign, which could never be executed without a ſecret League with <hi>France,</hi> and
without a very expreſs Aſſurance of being vigorouſly ſupported from thence when the
nick of time ſhould come. I do not here ſet down only Suppoſals and Gueſſes in the
Air, when I aſſert that this League was to prove of moſt fatal Conſequence to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Proteſtant Religion. For, pray tell me what elſe can be ſuppoſed from
a Union with <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, when we have ſeen him, after having violated the Laws of
his Kingdom, and the Oaths he had taken, exerciſing ſo outragious and barbarous a
Cruelty againſt his own Proteſtant Subjects, as well as againſt thoſe of his Neighbours
in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the Principality of <hi>Orange.</hi> Give me leave to make one other Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is altogether incredible, if <hi>James</hi> II had not been ſtrictly
leagued with <hi>France</hi> by ſuch a League as they were pleaſed to term Sacred, but that he
muſt have acted after another manner in favour of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
were oppreſt by the French King, and his Principality ravaged, in order to the
rooting out of the Proteſtant Religion there. His ſoft way of treating this matter with
the Court of <hi>France</hi> was ſo publick a Teſtimony of the Intelligence he held with <hi>Lewis</hi>
about deſtroying the Proteſtant Religion, that we muſt of force conclude that <hi>James</hi> II.
was conſcious to a Treaty which was of greater Concern to him, than all the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Blood or Alliance, which ought otherwiſe to have made him the Protector of
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> his Nephew and Son-in-Law, and conſequently the Husband of
the Preſumptive Heireſs of the Kingdom. I only touch at theſe Points, and I paſs
over many others that evince the ſame Truth. As for thoſe affected doubts which you
tell me do remain ſtill in the Minds of ſome of your Friends; they ſeem to me to be
of the nature of thoſe that troubled the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and of whom we ſay, that ſeeing
they ſee and do not perceive, becauſe they are reſolved not to yield to the moſt clear
and inconteſtable Truths. I bewail their Condition who ſo wilfully blind and hoodwink
themſelves, and I wiſh they may never be undeceived if nothing leſs will do it than by
the <hi>French</hi> King's ſending over his booted Apoſtles with the Original of the League he
has with <hi>James</hi> II into <hi>England,</hi> as he has already done into <hi>Ireland,</hi> of which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
by this time, neither Papiſt nor Proteſtant has the leaſt doubt.</p>
