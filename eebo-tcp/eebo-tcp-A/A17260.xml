            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and determined, to ſend to the ſayde Tartars a good aſſyſtance of fifteene thouſand fighting men, and alſo for this purpoſe, he hath ſent to the Sea ten Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to paſſe them ouer.</p>

In this ſo mighty an hoſt and armie, is alſo <hi>Baſcet</hi> the Sonne of the great Turke, by meanes whereof all in thoſe partes is in great trouble, as well as heere. It ſeemeth that the <hi>Ianiſſaries</hi> bring him the lot of <hi>Turkie,</hi> as <hi>Baduget, Zermonia, Alepo,</hi> and all the Regions lying neere to the <hi>Soſſi</hi> is reuolted, all the which particularities ſhall be vnderſtood more at large.</p>
            <p>This newes is great, &amp; hath made the great Turk to muſe enough vpon it, but aboue all theſe maruelous and dreadfull newes which are hapned, there is yet chanced another, which hath greatly feared and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all men, which although it ſeemeth to bee incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet vpon my credit it is moſt true, and that is, that a people heretofore vnknowne, mighty, ſwift, &amp; maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous nimble, hath taken weapon in hand, to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage and loſſe of the houſe of <hi>Ottoman.</hi> They ſaye that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great did in times paſt driue beyond the mountaine <hi>Caſpe</hi> nine tribes and a halfe of the <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> which worſhipped the Calfe &amp; Serpent of Gold and draue them away, that neuer ſince there was no newes of them, neither knew any man if they were in the Worlde or not: becauſe the Sea of ſande, or the ſandy Sea, by a certaine inconuenience of ſand Grauel or Beche, ſwelled and roſe ſo high, that it vtterly took from them the way into this our Region. But now by
<pb facs="tcp:25197:5"/>
the meane of the new Nauigation that the Pollanders haue made, they are arriued in their country, and haue eſpied out all their dooings: and after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſayd Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers had inſtructed and taught them in the ſcience and knowledge to artillery, and gun-powder for Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſhes &amp; dags, whereunto they are maruelous apt and ready, they are become in all thinges very perfit. After this they egged them forward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to take weapon in hand, and paſſe the ſayd Mountaine by Land. And becauſe the ſandy Sea did hinder their paſſage, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome Dutchman or Italian, which yet men knewe not, but notwithſtanding ſome great Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian or Coſmographer taught them the way, making ſome hill plaine with fire, whereby they might eaſilye paſſe, which is a thing of great wonder.</p>
            <p>Theſe people haue two mighty great armies, and infinite ſtore of victualles, by reaſon of the fruitfulneſſe of their Country, they are alſo well prouided of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of preparation for war, and cunning in the practiſe of their Weapons. They ſay they will come &amp; recouer the land of Promiſe, towards the which the firſt army is already very neere, to the great terror and dread of euery man which hath either ſeene or hearde of them. The ſpyes which haue beene ſent out by the great Turke to deſcry them, do affirme, that beſide a hundred and two Armies, there followe an infinite number of people, as well foot-men as horſe-men, and theyr firſt army is already arriued vppon the limmits of Turky, putting all to fire and ſword. Theyr language is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Hebrew: and becauſe men ſpeake much of it here, I will not forgette to ſpeake alſo ſomething thereof woorthy to bee noted, and well vnderſtoode: The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes of Conſtantinople ſay, that they haue certaine
<pb facs="tcp:25197:5"/>
propheſies, among the which one maketh mention, that ftom the foure parts of the world, ſhall riſe a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and come into Gog and Magog, and then ſhall appeare (as they perſwade themſelues) their <hi>Meſsias</hi> in might and power, and then they ſhall haue dominion and rule in the world, whereof they ſecretly reioyce, and are wonderous glad. They ſay moreouer, that there is a prophecie grauen in a piller ſet at <hi>Podromo</hi> which ſaith thus: A mighty Prince ſhall riſe, whoſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhall be of ſmal reputation, who by his Iſſue ſhal wax of ſuch force and ſtrength (with the helpe of God) that he ſhall bring to nothing, the empire and rule of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and ſhall be the right poſſeſſor and inheritor of the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> &amp; they beleeue all that ii ſhall be this Emperor and duke of <hi>Muſcouia.</hi> which is already in great eſtimation among the Greeks.</p>
            <p>The Turkes haue a prophecie, which they ſing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and weepe bitterly the while, for it betokeneth and denounceth vnto them, their vtter ruine and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And although it ſeeme ſtraunge, to ſay that the Turkes haue prophecies, it is no meruaile: for Balam was a falſe Prophet: the <hi>Sybilles</hi> alſo prophecied and were Pagans. For all theſe cauſes the great Turke hath forbidden wine, &amp; will that all men goe fiue times in a day to the <hi>Moſchea,</hi> and pray to GOD for theyr helth and ſafetie. And ſo he prepareth three great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, one againſt the <hi>Muſcouites,</hi> another againſte the Soffie, and the third for to goe againſt the Haebrewes of the Mountaines of <hi>Caſpij.</hi> Within theſe fewe dayes you ſhal haue other newes, wherefore thus making an end, I commend me vnto your good Lordſhip: From <hi>Rome,</hi> the firſt day of Iune, 1606.
