         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAD I not when I first undertook this
Poem promis'd my self a better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
from the Attempt, then I find
upon a review of it now it is done, it had
never been design'd for you, who deserve
much better than the best endeavour of a
more happy Translator than I pretend to be:
But if I had before too good an opinion of
my self, I do yet retain such a respect for
you, as would defend your name from so mean
a Dedication as this; did I not find my self
oblig'd by a vain and imprudent promise to
present you what I might have foreseen would
at the best prove very unfit to kiss your hands,
who ever entertain your self with the best
things, and in that discover the best judgment
to choose them. However seeing I have made
you a promise of this Play, that I want the
<pb facs="tcp:48678:3"/>
Art or the Patience to mend it, and that
you are only to suffer a private injury, since
it is never to be made publick: let me beg of
you to accept it, with the same sweetness you
usually entertain the applications of other
your Friends and Servants, who admire and
love you: by which acceptance (besides the
honour and obligation you will multiply upon
me) you will do a great justice to your self, in
being favourable to a man, that (if he could
write equal to the best) would lay his labours
at your feet with the same humility, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that he now subscribes himself,</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IT is evident enough without further Apology,
both by the Epistle before this Tragedy, and by
the Date that Dedication bears, that neither at
that time, nor of several years after, it was ever intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the publick View; and if it was a piece of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
to conceal it then, it had been a much greater
to have supprest it now, that the same Play is already
extant from a far better hand; I mean that of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Mrs. <hi>Philipps,</hi> to whose vertuous memory
I shall ever pay so great a respect, that I should take him
for a friendly Interpreter, who would conceive I had
publish'd this to no other end, than to do her honour;
that is, to make the excellency of her Poem more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by the imperfections of this of mine: But in truth
I am so far from doing it out of any kind of design,
that I am no more concern'd in this Impression, than
my consent comes to, and that rather out of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
to some, who have great authority with me, than
out of any satisfaction in my own judgment, that I
ought in prudence to do it.</p>
            <p>It was long since writ for the private divertisement of
a fair young Lady, and ever since it had the honour first
<pb facs="tcp:48678:4"/>
to kiss her hands, so entirely hers, that I did not reserve
so much as the <hi>Broüillon</hi> to my self; so that her leave,
as principally necessary, was first to be obtain'd: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it without some difficulty, that she was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
upon to give her consent, she being at the first
proposal (either out of modesty (of which vertue no
one has a more commendable share) or out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to her own reputation, or to mine) not very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have it printed: But at last (I know not how)
she being overcome, and I (who had before parted with
my Title) having now nothing to do to oppose it, it was
condemn'd to the Press.</p>
            <p>Upon these terms then you have it openly expos'd
for every one to read, or let alone, like, or dislike at his
own pleasure, or fancy: neither shall I say more of it
than this, that I have seen some undertakings as ill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
and that if this were to do again, I should
think to do it much better; only I think it fit to acquaint
my Reader, that the Songs and Chorus to the Acts are
all wholly my own; which whether the best, or worst
part of the Book, he has free liberty to judge.</p>
            <p>However the world will please to receive it, I shall be
as indifferent as any man in such a case can be; neither
shall I be angry with any one for telling me my faults,
provided he do it after such a manner, as shall discover
he has a desire I should mend them; his reproof will
otherwise degenerate into reproach, and that is never,
even by the best natur'd people, to be very kindly taken.</p>
            <p>To conclude, and to say something for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the Readers, such as sometimes use to throw
<pb facs="tcp:48678:4"/>
away an hour upon a Play (however this shall succeed in
their opinion) they can complain of no extraordinary
loss of time; and as to the rest, the price of the Book
will be so moderate, as can arise to no great matter of
repentance.</p>

Apparent joy doth on his forehead sit,</l>

                     <l>It is in such a deplorable case</l>

                     <l>Their brutish vertue in this shock of fate,</l>
