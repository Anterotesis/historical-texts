            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If we could giue thee our bodies, and soules, they should bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by it: but thou were neuer the richer for them. All is our dutie and all of vs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not performe it: therefore thy sonne died, and thy spirit discended, and thy Angels guide, and thy Ministers teach, to help the weakenes of men. All things call vpon vs, to call vpon thee, and we are prostrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18038:3"/>
thee before wee knowe how to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe thee: euen since we rose, we haue tasted many of thy blessings, and thou hast begun to serue vs, before we beginne to serue thee. Why shouldest thou bestow thy health and wealth, and rest, and libertie vpon vs more then other? we can giue no reason for it, but that thou art mercifull.</p>
               <p>And if thou shouldest drawe all backe againe, wee haue nothing to saie, but that thou art iust. Our sinnes are so greeuous and infinite, that we are faine to say with Iudas, <hi>I haue sinned:</hi> and there stoppe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee cannot reckon them. All things serue thee, as they did at first, onely men are the sinners in this world.</p>
               <p>Our hart is a roote of corruption, our eyes are the eyes of vanity, our eares are the eares of follie, our mouthes are the mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes of deceit, our hands are the handes of iniquitie, and euery part dooth dishonour thee, which wold be glorified of thee. The vnderstanding which was giuen vs to learn vertue, is apt nowe to apprehende nothing but sinne; the will which was giuen vs to affect righteousnes, is apt now to loue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wickednes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:18038:3"/>The memory which was giuen vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member good things, is apt nowe to keepe nothing but euill things.

               <p>And that which shoulde get pardon at thy handes for all the rest, that is, (our prayer) is so full of toyes and fancies, for want of fayth and reuerence, that when we haue prayed, we had neede to pray againe that thou woldest forgiue our prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we think least of thee when we pray vnto thee. What Father but thou, coulde suffer this contempt, &amp; be contemned stil? Yet when we think vpon thy sonne, al our feare is turned into ioy, because his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse for vs, is more then our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes against our selues. Settle our fayth in thy beloued, and it sufficeth for all our iniquities, necessities, and infirmities.</p>

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:18038:4"/>Now Lord we goe forth to fight against the world, the flesh, and the deuill: and the weakest of our enemies, is stronger then we: therefore we come vnto thee, for thy holy spirite to take our parte; that is, to chaunge our mindes, and wils, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which we haue corrupted, to remoue all the hinderances which lets vs to serue thee: and to direct all our thoughts, spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches &amp; actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to thy glory, as thou hast di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected thy glory to our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Although we be sinners (O Lord) yet we are thine, &amp; therefore wee beseech thee to separate our sinnes from vs, which woulde separate vs from thee, that wee may be ready to euery good, as wee are to euill. Teach vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our sinnes, that thou mayest for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gette them, and lette our sorrowe heere, preuent the sorrowe to come. Wee were made lyke thee, let not flesh and bloode turne the Image of GGD to the image of sathan: our foes are thy foes, let not thine enemies preuaile against thee to take vs from thee, but make thy worde vnto vs, like the starre which ledde vnto Christ: make thy benefites, like the piller which brought to the lande of promise: make thy

crosse, like the messenger which compelled guests vnto the banquet: that wee may walke before men like examples, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way looke vppon thy sonne, how he would speake and doe, before we speake or doe any thing.</p>
               <p>Keepe vs in that feare of thy Maiesty, that we may make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of all that we doe, and that wee may count no sinne smal, but leaue our lying, and swearing, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting, and coueting, and boasting, &amp; flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp; inordinate gaming, &amp; wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, because they draw vs to other sins, &amp; are forbidden as straightly as other. Let not our hearts at any time be so dazled, but that in all temptations, we may discern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene good and euill, betweene right and wrong, betweene truth and error: and that we may iudge of all things as they are, and not as they seeme to bee; let our mindes be alwaies so occupied, that we may learn som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of euery thing, &amp; vse all those crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as meanes and helpes prepared for vs to serue thee. Let our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s grow so to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one another, that we may loue thee as much for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prosperity of other as if it were our owne: let our faith, &amp; loue, and prayer
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18038:5"/>
be alwaie so ready to goe vnto thee for our help, that in sicknes we may find pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in prison we may finde ioy, in pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wee may finde contentment, and in all troubles we may finde hope. Turne al our ioyes to the ioy of the holy Ghost, &amp; al our peace to the peace of consciences, and all our feares to the feare of sinne, that we may loue righteousnes, with as great good will as euer we loued wickednes: and goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other in thankfulnes towards thee, as farre as thou goest in mercy towards vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; taking all that thou sendest as a gift, &amp; leauing our pleasures before they leaue vs, that our time to come, may bee a repentance of the time past, thinking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the ioyes of heauen, the paines of hell, our owne death, and the death of thy sonne for vs.</p>
               <p>Yet Lord let vs speake once againe like Abraham, one thing more we will beg at thy hands, our resolutions are variable, and we cannot performe our promises to thee, therefore settle vs in a constant forme of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that we may serue thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys houre, with those duties which the vvorld, the deuill, and the flesh, vvoulde haue vs

deferre vntill the point of death.</p>
               <p>Lord we are vnworthy to aske any thing for our selues, yet thy fauour hath prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs to be peticioners for other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we beseech thee to heare vs for them, and them for vs, and thy son for all. Blesse thy vniuersall Church, with trueth, vvith peace, and thy holy discipline. Strengthen all them which suffer for thy cause, and let them see the Spirite of comfort comming towards them, as thy Angels came to thy sonne, when he was hungry.</p>
               <p>Be mercifull vnto all those which lye in anguish of conscience, for remorse of their sinnes: as thou hast made them examples, so teach vs to take example by them, that we may looke vpon thy Gospell, to keepe vs from despayre: and vppon thy lawe, to keepe vs from presumption. Prosper the Armies which fight thy battayles, &amp; shew a difference betweene thy seruaunts &amp; thy enemies, as thou didst betweene the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites and the Egiptians, that they which serue thee not, may com to thy seruice, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that no God dooth blesse besides thee. Make vs thankfull for our peace, vvhom thou hast sette at libertie, while thou hast

laid our dangers vpon others, which migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test haue laid their dangers vpon vs: And teach vs to build thy Church in our rest, as <hi>Salomon</hi> built thy Temple in his peace. Haue mercy vpon this sinfull Land, which is sicke of long prosperitie, let not thy blessings rise vppe against vs, but indue vs with grace as thou hast with riches, that wee may goe before other Nations in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as wee goe before them in plentie; giue vs such harts as thy seruaunts should haue: that thy will may be our will; that thy Lawe may be our Law; and that wee may seeke our kingdome in thy kingdom.

that wee may all be loued of thee.

and expectation of iudgement, while wee might haue had peace of conscience, ioy of hart, and all the graces which come with the holy spirite. Some haue beene wonne by thy word, but we woulde not suffer it to change vs: some haue beene reformed by thy crosse, but we would not suffer it to purge vs: some haue beene mooued by thy benefites, but wee woulde not suffer them to perswade vs: nay we haue giuen consent vnto the deuill, that we wil abuse all thy gifts, so fast as they come: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy blessings make vs proude, thy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches couetous, thy peace wanton, thy meates intemperate, thy mercy secure, and all thy benefits are weapons to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, that if thou looke into our harts, thou maist say our Religion is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, our zeale enuie, but wisedome pollicie; our peace securitie, our life rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: our deuotion endes with our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and wee liue, as though wee had no soules to saue.</p>
               <p>What shall we aunswer for that which our conscience condemnes? Wee are one day neerer to death since we rose, when we shall giue account howe euery day hath

               <p>And if thou shouldest aske vs nowe, what lust asswaged, what affection qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, what passion expelled, what sinne repented, what good performed, since wee began to receiue thy benefits thys day, we must confesse against our selues, that all our works, words, &amp; thoughts, haue beene the seruice of the world, the flesh and the deuill: we haue offended thee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned thee all the day, and at night wee pray vnto thee, Father forgiue vs all our sinnes, which haue dishonoured thee, while thou didst serue vs: run from thee while thou didst call vs: &amp; forgotten thee whilst thou didst feede vs; so thou sparest vs, so wee sleepe, and to morrow we sin againe: this is the course of all our pilgrimage, to leaue that which thou commaundest, and doe that which thou forbiddest. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou mightest iustly forsake vs, as we forsake thee, &amp; condemne vs, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science condemnes our selues; But who can measure thy goodnes which giuest all, and forgiuest all?</p>

            <p>I Owe to God a death, as his sonne dyed for me. Euer since I was borne I haue been sayling to this Hauen, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring patience to comfort this houre: therfore shal I be one of those guests now, that would not come to the banquet when they were inuited. What hurt is in going to Paradise? I shall-loose nothing but the sence of euill: and anon I shall haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ioyes then I feele paines: for my head is in heauen already, to assure mee that my soule and body shall follow after. O death where is thy sting? why should I feare that which I wold not escape, because my chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest happines is behinde, and I cannot haue it, vnlesse I goe vnto it? I wold go through hell to heauen, and therfore if I march but through death, I suffer lesse then I woulde suffer for God. My paines doe not dismay me, because I trauell to bring foorth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, my sins doe not fright me, because I haue Christ my Redeemer; the Iudge
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18038:12"/>
doth not astonish mee, because the Iudges sonne is mine aduocate; the deuill dooth not amaze me, because the Angels pitch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me. The graue doth not greeue mee, because it was my Lords bed: ô that Gods mercy to me, might mooue other to loue him: for the lesse I can expresse it, the more it is. The Prophets and Apostles are my fore-runners; euery man is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, or els he will follow after me, if it please God to receiue me into heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them which haue serued him better, I owe more thankfulnes vnto him. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue deferred my repentance till this houre, whereby my saluation is cut off if I should die suddainlie, loe how my God in his merciful prouidence, to preuent my destruction, calleth me by a lingering sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which staieth till I be readie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth me to my ende, like a Preacher, and makes me by wholesome paines wearie of this beloued world, least I shold depart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, like them whose death is their damnation. So he loueth me while he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me, that hys stripes are plasters to saue me, therfore who shal loue him if I despise him? This is my whole office nowe, to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18038:12"/>
strengthen my body with my hart, and be contented as God hath appointed, vntill I can glorifie him, or vntill he glorifie me. If I liue, I liue to sacrifice, &amp; if I die, I die a sacrifice, for his mercie is aboue mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. Therefore if I should feare death, it were a signe that I had not faith, nor hope as I professed, but that I doubted of Gods truth in his promise, whether he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue his penitent sinner or no: it is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let him doe what seemeth good in his sight: <hi>Come Lord Iesus,</hi> for thy seruant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>BEloued, I meruell not that you haue paine, for you are sick: but I maruell that you couer it not for offence, because the wisdom of a man is to bite in his griefe, and alwaies to shew more comfort in God, than paine in suffering. Now God calleth to repetitions, to see whether you haue learned more constancie than others; if
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18038:13"/>
sicknes be sharp: make it not sharper with frowardnesse but know that this is a great fauour to vs, when we die by sicknes, which maketh vs readie for him that calleth vs. Now you haue nothing to thinke vppon but God, and you cannot thinke vpon him without ioy: your greefe passeth, but your ioy wil neuer passe. Tell me (patient) how many stripes is heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worth? Is my freend only sick in the world, or his faith weaker than others? You haue alwaies praied <hi>Thy will be doone,</hi> and nowe are you offended that Gods will is doone? Howe hath the faithfull man forgotten that all thinges (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen death) turne to the best to them that loue God? Teach the happie (ô Lord) to see his haippinesse through troubles. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paine is a preuention of the paines of hell, and euery ease in paine, is a foretast of the ease and peace and ioyes in heauen.</p>
            <p>Therefore remember your owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to others before, &amp; be not impatient, when there is most neede of patience, but as you haue euer taught vs to liue, so nowe giue vs an example to die: and deceiue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than as <hi>Job</hi> did.</p>
