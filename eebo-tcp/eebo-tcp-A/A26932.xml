            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

When the Lord had awakened his Miniſters in this County, and ſome neighbouring parts to a ſenſe of their duty in the work of Catechizing, and private Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all in their Pariſhes that would not obſtinately refuſe their help, and when they had ſubſcribed an Agreement containing their Reſolutions for the future performance of it, they judged it unmeet to enter upon the work, without a ſolemn humbling of their ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, for their ſo long neglect of ſo great and neceſſary a duty: And therefore they agreed to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at <hi>Worceſter, Decemb. 4. 1655.</hi> and there to joyn in ſuch Humiliation, and in earneſt Prayer to God for the pardon of our neglects, and for his ſpecial Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the work that we had undertaken, and for the ſucceſs of it with the People, whom we are engaged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct: At which time among others, I was deſired by them to Preach: In anſwer to their deſires I prepared the following Diſcourſe; which though it proved longer then could be delivered in one or two Sermons, yet I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have entred upon it at that time, and to have delivered that which was moſt pertinent to the occaſion, and to have reſerved the reſt to another ſeaſon. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the meeting, by the increaſe of my ordinary pain and weakneſs, I was diſabled from going thither: To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence which unwilling omiſſion, I eaſily yielded to the requeſts of divers of the Brethren, forthwith to publiſh the things which I had prepared, that they might <hi>ſee</hi> that which they could not <hi>hear.</hi> If now it be objected, that <hi>I ſhould not have ſpoken ſo plainly or ſharply againſt the ſins of the Miniſtry, or that I ſhould not have publiſhed it to the view of the world, or at leaſt that I ſhould have done it in another tongue, and not in the ears of the vulgar, eſpecially at ſuch a time when</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99578:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Quakers and Papiſts are endeavouring to bring the Miniſtry into contempt, and the people are too prone to harken to their ſuggeſtions:</hi> I confeſs I thought the Objection very conſiderable; but that it prevailed not to alter my reſolutions, is to be aſcribed to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſons. <hi>1.</hi> It was a purpoſed ſolemn Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we were agreed on, and that this was prepared and intended for. And how ſhould we be humbled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a plain Confeſſion of our ſin? <hi>2.</hi> It was principally our <hi>own</hi> ſins that the Confeſſion did concern; and who can be offended with us for confeſſing our own, and taking the blame and ſhame to our ſelves, which our conſciences told us we ought to do. <hi>3.</hi> I have excepted in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions thoſe that are not guilty: and therefore hope that I have injured none. <hi>4.</hi> Having neceſſarily prepared it in the Engliſh tongue, I had no ſpare time to tranſlate it. <hi>5.</hi> Where the ſin is open in the ſight of the world, it is in vain to attempt to hide it. <hi>6.</hi> And ſuch attempts will but aggravate it, and increaſe our ſhame. <hi>7.</hi> A free Confeſſion is a condition of a full Remiſſion; and when the ſin is publike, the Confeſſion muſt be publike. If the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> had ſinned only in Latine, I would have made ſhift to have admoniſhed them in Latine, or elſe have ſaid nothing to them. But if they will ſin in Engliſh, they muſt hear of it in Engliſh. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned ſin will never let us reſt or proſper, though we be at never ſo much care and coſt to cover it: Our ſin will ſurely find us out, though we find not it. The work of Confeſſion is purpoſely to make known our ſin, and freely to take the ſhame to our ſelves: And if he that confeſſeth and forſaketh be the man that ſhall have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, no wonder then if he that covereth it, proſper not, <hi>Prov. 28. 13.</hi> If we be ſo tender of our ſelves, and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:99578:4"/>
loath to confeſs, God will be the leſs tender of us, and he will indite our Confeſſions for us. He will either force our Conſciences to confeſſion, or his Iudgements ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim our iniquities to the world. Know we not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny malicious adverſaries are day and night at work againſt us? Some openly revile us, and ſome in ſecret are laying the deſigns, and contriving that which others execute and are in expectation of a fuller ſtroak at us, which may ſubvert us at once. What is it but our ſins that is the ſtrength of all theſe enemies? Is not this evil from the ordering of the Lord? Till we are reconciled unto him we are never ſafe: He will never want a rod to ſcourge us by. The tongues of Quakers, and Papiſts, and many other ſorts, are all at work to proclaim our ſins, becauſe we will not confeſs them our ſelves: Becauſe we will not ſpeak the truth, they will ſpeak much more then the truth. Yet if we had man only to plead our cauſe with, perhaps we might do much to make it good: but while God accuſeth us, how ſhall we be juſtified? and who ſhall hide our ſins, when he will have them brought to light? And God is our Accuſer, till we accuſe our ſelves: but if we would Iudge our ſelves, he would not Iudge us. <hi>8.</hi> The fire is already kindled which reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our ſin: Iudgement is begun at the houſe of God. Hath the Miniſtry ſuffered nothing in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Ireland?</hi> and have there been no attempts for their overthrow? Hath it not been put to the Vote in an Aſſembly that ſome called A Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> whether the whole frame of the ſtabliſhed Miniſtry, and its legal maintenance ſhould be taken down? and were we not put to plead our Title to that maintenance, as if we had been falling into the hands of Turks, that had thirſted for our ſubverſion, as reſolved enemies to the
<pb facs="tcp:99578:4"/>
Chriſtian cauſe? And who knows not how many of theſe men are yet alive? and how high the ſame ſpirit yet is, and buſily contriving the accompliſhment of the ſame deſign? Shall we think that they have ceaſed their enterpriſe, becauſe they are working more ſubtilly in the dark? What are the ſwarms of Railers at the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, ſent abroad the Land for, but to delude, exaſperate and diſ-affect the peeple, and turn the hearts of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from their Fathers, that they may be ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the main deſign? And is it not then our wiſeſt courſe to ſee that God be our friend, and to do that which tendeth moſt to engage him in our defence? I think it is no time now to ſtand upon our credit, ſo far as to neglect our duty, and befriend our ſins, and ſo provoke the Lord againſt us. It rather beſeems us to fall down at the feet of our offended Lord, and to juſtifie him in his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and freely and penitently to confeſs our tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to reſolve upon a ſpeedy and through reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before wrath break out upon us, which will leave us no remedy. Its time to make up all breaches between us and Heaven, when we ſtand in ſuch neceſſity of the Divine Protection? For how can an impenitent unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed people expect to be ſheltered by Holineſs it ſelf? It is a ſtubborn child, that under the rod will refuſe to confeſs his faults; When it is not the leaſt uſe of the rod to extort confeſſion. We feel much: we fear more; and all's for ſin: and yet are we ſo hardly drawn to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion? <hi>9.</hi> The world already knows that we are <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> As none can ſuppoſe us perfect, ſo our particular ſins are too apparent to the world: And is it not meet then that they ſhould ſee that we are <hi>Penitent</hi> ſinners? It is ſure a greater credit to us to be Penitent ſinners, then impenitent ſinners: and one of the two we ſhall be
<pb facs="tcp:99578:5"/>
while we are on earth. Certainly as Repentance is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the recovery of our Peace with God, ſo is it alſo to the reparation of our credit with wiſe and godly men: It is befriending and excuſing our ſin that is our ſhame indeed, and leadeth towards everlaſting ſhame; which the ſhame of Penitent confeſſion would prevent. <hi>10.</hi> Our Penitent Confeſſion and ſpeedy Reformation are the means that muſt ſilence the reproaching adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. He is impudently inhumane that will reproach men with their ſins, that bewail them and penitently charge them upon themſelves. Such men have a promiſe of pardon from God; and ſhall men take us by the throat when God forgiveth us? Who dare condemn us, when God ſhall juſtifie us? Who ſhall lay that to our charge, which God hath declared that he will not charge us with? When ſin is truly Repented of by Goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, it ceaſeth to be ours. What readyer way then can we imagine to free us from the ſhame of it, then to ſhame our ſelves for it in Penitent Confeſſions, and to break off from it by ſpeedy reformation? <hi>11.</hi> The Leaders of the Flock muſt be exemplary to the reſt; and therefore in this duty as well as in any other. It is not our part only to teach them Repentance, but to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in the exerciſe of it our ſelves: As far as we excell them in Knowledge and other Gifts, ſo far ſhould we alſo excell them in this and other Graces. <hi>12.</hi> Too many that have ſet their hand to this ſacred work do ſo obſtinately proceed in Self-ſeeking, Negligence, Pride, Diviſion, and other ſins, that it is become our neceſſary duty to admoniſh them. If we could ſee that ſuch would reform without reproof, we could gladly forbear the publiſhing of their faults. But when reproofs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do prove ſo uneffectual, that they are more offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the reproof then at the ſin, and had rather that we
<pb facs="tcp:99578:5"/>
ſhould ceaſe reproving, then themſelves ſhould ceaſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I think it is time to ſharpen the remedy. For what elſe ſhould we do? To give up our Brethren as uncure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able were cruelty, as long as there are further means to be uſed. We muſt not hate them, but plainly rebuke them, and not ſuffer ſin upon them, <hi>Lev. 19. 17.</hi> And to bear with the vices of the Miniſters, is to promote the ruine of the Church. For what ſpeedyer way is there for the depraving and undoing of the people, then the pravity of their Guides? And how can we more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally further a Reformation, (which we are ſo much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do) then by endeavouring the Reforming of the Leaders of the Church? Surely Brethren, if it be our duty to endeavour to caſt out thoſe Miniſters that are Negligent, Scandalous and Unfit for the work, and if we think this ſo neceſſary to the reformation of the Church (as no doubt it is) it muſt needs be our Duty to endeavour to heal the ſins of others; and to uſe a much gentler remedy to them that are guilty of a leſs degree of ſin: If other mens ſin deſerveth an ejection, ſure ours deſerve and require plain reproof. For my part I have done as I would be done by: and it is for God and the ſafety of the Church, and in tender Love to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren whom I do adventure to reprehend; Not (as others) to make them contemptible and odious, but to heal the evils that would make them ſo: That ſo no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may find this matter of reproach among us. But eſpecially becauſe our faithful endeavours are of ſo great neceſſity to the welfare of the Church and the ſaving of mens ſouls, that it will not conſiſt with a love to either (in a predominant ſort) to be negligent our ſelves, or ſilently to connive at, and comply with the negligent. If thouſands of you were in a leaking ſhip, and thoſe that

ſhould pump out the water and ſtop the leaks, ſhould be ſporting or aſleep, yea or but favour themſelves in their labours, to the hazarding of you all, would you not awake them to their work, and call out on them to labour as for your lives? and if you uſed ſome ſharpneſs and importunity with the ſloathful, would you think that man were well in his wits that would take it ill of you, and accuſe you of pride, ſelf-conceitedneſs, or unmannerly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to preſume to talk ſo ſawcily to your fellow work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? or ſhould tell you that you wrong them by diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their reputation? Would you not ſay, <hi>The work muſt be done, or we are all dead men: is the ſhip rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſink, and do you talk of Reputation? or had you rather hazard your ſelf and us, then hear of your ſloathfulneſs?</hi> This is our caſe, Brethren! The work of God muſt needs be done! ſouls muſt not periſh while you mind your worldly buſineſs, or obſerve the tide and times, and take your eaſe, or quarrel with your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren! nor muſt we be ſilent while men are haſtened by you to perdition, and the Church to greater danger and confuſion, for fear of ſeeming too uncivil and unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with you, or diſpleaſing your impatient ſouls! Would you be but as impatient with your ſins as with reproofs, you ſhould hear no more from us, but we ſhould be all agreed! But neither God nor good men will let you alone in ſuch ſins. Yet if you had betaken your ſelves to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calling, and would ſin to your ſelves only, and would periſh alone, we ſhould not have ſo much neceſſity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſting you, as now we have: But if you will enter into the office, which is for the neceſſary preſervation of us all, ſo that by letting you alone in your ſin, we muſt give up the Church to apparent loſs and hazard; blame us not if we talk to you more freely then you would have us
<pb facs="tcp:99578:6"/>
do. If your own body be ſick, and you will deſpiſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, or if your own houſe be on fire, and you will be ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or quarrelling in the ſtreets, I can poſſibly bear it, and let you alone (which yet in charity I ſhould not eaſily do.) But if you will undertake to be the Phyſician of an Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, or to all the Town that is infected with the plague, or will undertake to quench all the fires that ſhall be kindled in the Town, there is no bearing with your remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how much ſoever it may diſpleaſe you: Take it how you will, you muſt be told of it: and if that will not ſerve, you muſt be yet cloſelyer told of it: and if that will not ſerve, if you be rejected as well as reprehended, you muſt thank your ſelves. I ſpeak all this to none but the guilty: And thus I have given you thoſe Reaſons which forced me even in plain Engliſh to publiſh ſo much of the ſins of the Miniſtry as in the following Treatiſe I have done. And I ſuppoſe the more penitent and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble any are, and the more deſirous of the trueſt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, the more eaſily and fully will they approve ſuch free confeſſions and reprehenſions.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond ſort of objections againſt this free Confeſſion of ſin, I expect to hear from the ſeveral parties whoſe ſins are here confeſſed. Moſt of them can be willing that others be blamed, ſo they might be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themſelves. I can truly ſay, that what I have here ſpoken hath been as impartially as I could, and not as a party, nor as ſiding with any, but as owning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſtian cauſe, and as ſomewhat ſenſible of the apparent wrongs that have been offered to common truth and godlineſs, and the hinderances of mens ſalvation, and
<pb facs="tcp:99578:7"/>
of the happineſs of the Church. But I find it impoſſible to avoid the offending of guilty men. For there is no way of avoiding it, but by our ſilence, or their patience: And ſilent we cannot be, becauſe of Gods commands: and Patient they cannot be, becauſe of their guilt and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and the intereſt that their ſin hath got in their affections: I ſtill except thoſe humble men, that are willing to know the worſt of themſelves, and love the light, that their deeds may be made manifeſt, and long to know their ſins that they may for ſake them, and their duty that they may perform it.</p>
            <p>Some its like will be offended with me, that I blame them ſo much for the neglect of that Diſcipline, which they have diſputed for ſo long. But what remedy? If Diſcipline were not of God, or if it were unneceſſary to the Church, or if it were enough to diſpute for duty, while we deliberately refuſe to perform it, then would I have given theſe Brethren no offence.</p>
            <p>Some its like will be offended that I mention with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowance the Separatiſts or Anabaptiſts, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſome are offended much that I ſo mentioned them in an Epiſtle before the Quakers Catechiſm, as if they opened the door to the Apoſtacy of theſe times; and they ſay that by this it appeareth that while I pretend ſo much Zeal for the Unity of the Church, I intend and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the contrary. To which I anſwer: <hi>1.</hi> Is it indeed a ſign that a man loveth not the Unity of the Saints, becauſe he loveth not their diſ-union and diviſion? Who can eſcape the cenſure of ſuch men, but he that can unite the Saints by dividing them? <hi>2.</hi> I never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in urging the Peace and Unity of the Saints, to approve of any thing which I judged to be a ſin, nor to tye my own tongue or other mens from ſeaſonable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
<pb facs="tcp:99578:7"/>
it. Is there no way to peace but by participating of mens ſin? The thing I deſire is this: <hi>1.</hi> That we might all conſider how far we may hold Communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, even in the ſame Congregations, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our different opinions; and to agree not to withdraw where it may poſſibly be avoided. <hi>2.</hi> But where it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, that yet we may conſult how far we may hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in diſtinct Congregations: and to avoid that, no further then is of meer neceſſity. And <hi>3.</hi> and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to conſult and agree upon certain Rules, for the management of our differences in ſuch a manner, as may be leaſt to the diſadvantage of the common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an truths which are acknowledged by us all. Thus far would I ſeek peace with Arminians, Antinomians, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, or any that hold the foundation. Yea and in the two laſt, I would not refuſe to conſult on accomodation with moderate Papiſts themſelves, if their Principles were not againſt ſuch conſultations and accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and I ſhould judge it a courſe which God will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter approve of, then to proceed by carnal contrivances to undermine their adverſaries, or by cruel murders to root them out, which are their ordinary courſes. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Godly, Orthodox, Peaceable man, Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> (lately deceaſed) tels us in his Sermon at <hi>Wanſted,</hi> for the Unity of the Church, that he made a motion to the Papiſt, Prieſts in <hi>Ireland;</hi> that, becauſe it was ignorance of the common principles that was like to be the undoing of the common people, more then the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the points which we differ in, therefore both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould agree to teach them ſome Catechiſm contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe common principles of Religion which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by us all: But jealouſies and carnal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels would not permit them to harken to this motion.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:99578:8"/>
               <hi>3.</hi> And as concerning that Epiſtle before my papers to the Quakers, I further anſwer; that by <hi>Separatiſts</hi> there I plainly mean Church-dividers: even all that make unneceſſary Diviſions in or from the Churches of Chriſt; whom the Apoſtle ſo earneſtly beſeecheth us to mark and avoid, <hi>Rom. 16. 17.</hi> and which he calleth them carnal for, and ſo earneſtly contendeth againſt, <hi>1 Cor. 1.</hi> and <hi>2.</hi> and <hi>3.</hi> and in many other places in his Epiſtles. And if this be a tolerable ſin, then the Unity of the Church is not a neceſſary thing; and then the Apoſtles would never have condemned this ſin as they have done. Do we all ſo ſenſibly ſmart by the effects of theſe ſins, and is the Church of Chriſt among us brought into ſuch a torn and endangered condition by them, ſo that we are in no ſmall danger of falling all into the hands of the common adverſaries? Is ſo hopeful and chargeable a Reformation ſo far fruſtrated by theſe men; and yet muſt we not open our mouths to tell them of it? May we not tell them of it, when we are bleeding by their hands? Is it tolerable in them to cut and wound, and let out our blood, and is it unpeaceableneſs in us to tell them that we ſuffer by them, and to beſeech them to repent and to have compaſſion on the Church of Chriſt? Muſt we be patient to be ruined by them, and have they not the patience to hear of it? What remedy? Let them be ſilent that dare; for I profeſs I dare not. I muſt tell them that this height of Pride hath been in their Anceſtors a Concomitant of Schiſm. A poor Drunkard or Swearer will more patiently hear of his ſin, then many that we hope are godly will of theirs, when once they are tainted with this ſin. But godlineſs was never made to be the credit of mens ſins: Nor is ſin to be let alone, or well thought of, when it can but get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:99578:8"/>
a godly man. Shall we hate them moſt, whom we are bound to love beſt? and ſhall we ſhew it by forbearing our plain rebuke, and ſuffering their ſin upon them? It muſt not be: How ever they take it in their ſick diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it muſt not be. No man that erreth doth think that he erreth: Theſe men are confident themſelves that they are in the right. But the ſober prudent ſervants of Chriſt, that have eſcaped their diſeaſe, do ſee their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and <hi>England</hi> feeleth it, and that at the very heart: What, muſt we die by their hand, and our very heart blood be let out, and the Goſpel delivered up to the adverſaries, before they will believe that they have done us wrong, or before they will endure to hear us tell them of it? If the ages to come do not ſay more againſt the waies of theſe miſtaken men, then I have done in that Epiſtle: and if either Mercy or Iudgement do not bring them one day to think or ſpeak more ſharply of themſelves; then I muſt confeſs my ſelf quite out in my prognoſticks.</p>
            <p>Another ſort that will be offended with me, are ſome of the Divines of the Prelatical way: whom I had no mind to offend, nor to diſhonour: But if neceſſary duty will do it; What remedy? If they cannot bear with juſt admonition, I muſt bear with their impatience. But I muſt tell them, that I ſpoke not by hear-ſay, but from ſight and feeling. Its more tolerable in an Engliſh-man to ſpeak ſuch things, that hath ſeen the ſad work that was made in <hi>England,</hi> the ſilencing of moſt godly, able men, the perſecution even of the peaceable, the diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of godlineſs, and the inſulting ſcorn of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſt in the Land, then for a forrainer that hath known of this but by hearſay. When we remember what a ſort of Miniſters the Land abounded with, while the
<pb facs="tcp:99578:9"/>
ableſt and moſt diligent men were caſt out, (of which matters we cannot be ignorant, if there were no records remaining of their atteſted accuſations) we muſt needs take leave to tell the world that the ſouls of men and the welfare of the Church were not ſo contemptible in our eyes, as that we ſhould have no ſenſe of theſe things, or ſhould manifeſt no diſlike of them, nor once invite the guilty to repent. And if you think my language harſh, I will tranſcribe ſome words of a far wiſer man, and leave it to your conſideration how far they concern the preſent caſe, or juſtifie my free and plain expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

            <p>If the Engliſh tranſlation of this book (for tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it is long ago) do fall into the hands of the vulgar, they will ſee what language the Brittiſh Clergy received from one that was neither a cenſorious railer, nor ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically ſelf-opinionated.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome will ſay, that the matter is not much amended, when in former times we were almoſt all of a mind, and now we have ſo many Religions, that we know not well whether we have any at all. <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> Every different opinion is not another Religion. <hi>2.</hi> This is the common Popiſh argument againſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as if it were better that men believed nothing <hi>fide divina,</hi> then enquire after truth, for fear of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief: And as if they would have all ungodly, that they might be all of a mind. I am ſure that the moſt of the people in <hi>England</hi> where ever I came, did make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the reading of Scripture, or ſpeaking of the way to heaven, the matter of their bitter ſcorn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. And would you have us all of that mind again, for fear of differences! A charitable wiſh! <hi>3.</hi> If others run into the other extream, will that be any excuſe to you? Chriſts Church hath alwaies ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered between profane Unbelievers, and Heretical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viders, as he ſuffered himſelf on the Croſs between two thieves. And will the ſin of one excuſe the other?
<pb facs="tcp:99578:11"/>
               <hi>4.</hi> And yet I muſt ſay, (leſt I be impiouſly blind and ungrateful) that through the great mercy of God, the matter is ſo far amended, that many hundred drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſwearing, ignorant, negligent, ſcandalous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are caſt out; and we have many humble, godly, painful teachers in a County for a few that we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This is ſo viſibly true, that when the godly are feaſted, who formerly were almoſt famiſhed, and beaten for going abroad to beg their bread, you can hardly by all your arguments or Rhetorick perſwade them that the times are no better with them then they were; though men of another Nation may poſſibly believe you in ſuch reports. I bleſs God for the change that I ſee in this Countrey; and among the people, even in my own charge; which is ſuch as will not permit me to believe, that the caſe is as bad with them as formerly it hath been. I ſay with <hi>Minutius Foelix,</hi> p. <hi>401.</hi> (mihi) <hi>Quid ingrati ſumus? quid nobis invidemus? Si veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas divinitatis noſtri temporis aetate maturuit. Frua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur noſtro bono; Et recti ſententiam temperemus: cohibeatur ſuperſtitio: impietas expietur: religio ſervetur.</hi> It is the ſinful unhappineſs of ſome mens minds, that they can hardly think well of the beſt words or waies of thoſe whom they diſaffect: And they uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſaffect thoſe that croſs them in their corrupt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and plainly tell them of their faults: And they are ready to judge of the reprovers ſpirit by their own, and to think that all ſuch ſharp reproofs proceed from ſome diſaffection to their perſons, or partial oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the opinions which they hold: And therefore they will ſeldom regard the reproofs of any, but thoſe of their own party; who will ſeldom deal plainly with them, becauſe they are of their party. But plain dealers are
<pb facs="tcp:99578:12"/>
alwaies approved in the end: And the time is at hand when you ſhall confeſs, that thoſe were your trueſt friends. He that will deal plainly againſt your ſins, in uprightneſs and honeſty, will deal as plainly for you againſt the ſins of any that would injure you: For he ſpeaks not againſt ſin, becauſe it is <hi>yours,</hi> but becauſe it is <hi>ſin.</hi> It is an obſervable paſſage that is reported by many, and Printed by one, how the late King <hi>Charls,</hi> (who by the Biſhops inſtigation had kept Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> ſo long in priſon, and twice cropt his ears, for writing againſt their Masks and Plaies, and the high and hard proceedings of the Prelates) when he read his notable voluminous ſpeech for an acceptance of the Kings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and an agreement with him thereupon, did, not long before his death deliver the Book to a friend that ſtood by him, ſaying, <hi>Take this Book: I give it thee as a Legacy: and believe it, this Gentleman is the</hi> Cato <hi>of the Age.</hi> The time will come when plain dealing will have a better Conſtruction, then it hath while prejudice doth turn the heart againſt it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſtand no longer on the Apologetical part: I think the foregoing Objections being anſwered, there is no great need of more of this. The Title of the Book it ſelf is Apologetical (which if I tell you not, I may well expect that ſome of my old ingenuous Interpreter; ſhould put another ſenſe upon it) I pretend not to the Sapience of <hi>Gildas,</hi> nor to the Sanctity of <hi>Salvian</hi> (as to the degree:) but by their names I offer you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for plain dealing. If it was uſed in a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure, by men ſo wiſe and holy as theſe, why ſhould it in a lower meaſure be diſ-allowed in another? At leaſt from hence I have this encouragement, that the plain dealing of <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Salvian</hi> being ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb facs="tcp:99578:12"/>
by us now they are dead, how much ſoever they might be deſpiſed or hated while they were living, by them whom they did reprove, at the worſt I may expect ſome ſuch ſucceſs in times to come.</p>
            <p>But my principal buſineſs is yet behind. I muſt now take the boldneſs, Brethren, to become your Monitor concerning ſome of the neceſſary duties, of which I have ſpoken in the enſuing diſcourſe: If any of you ſhould charge me with arrogancy or immodeſty, for this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, as if hereby I accuſed you of negligence, or judged my ſelf ſufficient to admoniſh you; I crave your candid interpretation of my boldneſs, aſſuring you that I obey not the counſel of my fleſh herein, but diſpleaſe my ſelf as much as ſome of you; and had rather have the eaſe and peace of ſilence, if it would ſtand with du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Churches good. But it is the meer neceſſity of the ſouls of men, and my deſire of their ſalvation, and the proſperity of the Church, which forceth me to this Arrogancy and Immodeſty, if ſo it muſt be called. For who that hath a tongue can be ſilent, when it is for the honour of God, the welfare of his Church, and the everlaſting happineſs of ſo many perſons?</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> And the firſt and main matter which I have to propound to you, is, Whether it be not the unqueſtionable duty of the generality of Miniſters in theſe three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to ſet themſelves preſently to the work of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing, and Perſonal Inſtructing all that are to be taught by them, who will be perſwaded to ſubmit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? I need not here ſtand to prove it, having ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently done it in the following diſcourſe. Can you think that holy wiſdom will gain-ſay it? Will zeal for God, will delight in his ſervice, or love to the ſouls of men gain-ſay it? <hi>1.</hi> That people muſt be taught the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb facs="tcp:99578:13"/>
of Religion, and matters of greateſt neceſſity to ſalvation, is paſt doubt among us. <hi>2.</hi> And that they muſt be taught it in the moſt edifying advantagious way, I hope we are agreed? <hi>3.</hi> And that perſonal Conference, and Examination, and Inſtruction, hath many excellent advantages for their good, is beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and afterward manifeſted. <hi>4.</hi> As alſo that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Inſtruction is commended to us by Scripture, and the practices of the ſervants of Chriſt, and approved by the godly of all ages, ſo far as I can find without contradiction. <hi>5.</hi> It is paſt doubt that we ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this great duty to all the people, or as many as we can: For our love and care of their ſouls muſt extend to all. If there be a <hi>1000.</hi> or <hi>500.</hi> ignorant people in your Pariſh, it is a poor diſcharge of your duty now and then occaſionally to ſpeak to ſome few of them, and let the reſt alone in their ignorance, if you are able to afford them help. <hi>6.</hi> And it is as certain that ſo great a work as this is, ſhould take up a conſiderable part of our time. <hi>7.</hi> And as certain is it, that all duties ſhould be done in order, as far as may be, and therefore ſhould have their appointed times. And if we are agreed to practiſe according to theſe commonly acknowledged truths, we need not differ upon any doubtful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> We teach them in publike; and how then are we bound to teach them man by man beſides?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You pray for them in Publike: Muſt you not alſo pray for them in private? <hi>Paul</hi> taught every man, and exhorted every man, and that both publikely and from houſe to houſe, night and day with tears. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and benefits afterward mentioned prove it to be your duty. But what need we add more, when experience
<pb facs="tcp:99578:13"/>
ſpeaks ſo loud? I am daily forced to admire, how la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably ignorant many of our people are, that have ſeemed diligent hearers of me this ten or twelve years, while I spoke as plainly as I was able to ſpeak! Some know not that each perſon in the Trinity is God; Nor that Chriſt is God and man; Nor that he took his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature into heaven; Nor many the like neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principles of our faith. Yea ſome that come con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to private meetings are found groſly ignorant: Whereas in one hours familiar inſtruction of them in private, they ſeem to underſtand more, and better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, then they did in all their lives before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But what obligation lyeth on us to tye our ſelves to certain daies for the performance of this work?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is like the Libertines plea againſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer. They ask, where are we bound to pray morning and evening? Doth not the nature and end of the duty plainly tell you that an appointed time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to the orderly ſucceſsful performance of it? How can people tell when to come if the time be not made known? You will have a fixed day for a Lecture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe people cannot elſe tell when to come without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice for each day: And it is as neceſſary here, becauſe this muſt be a <hi>conſtant</hi> duty, as well as that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But we have many other buſineſſes that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may interrupt the courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Weightyer buſineſs may put by our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even on the Lords day; but we muſt not therefore neglect our conſtant obſervance ordinarily of that day: And ſo it is here. If you have ſo much greater buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that you cannot <hi>ordinarily</hi> have time to do the Miniſterial work, you ſhould not undertake the office:
<pb facs="tcp:99578:14"/>
For Miniſters are men <hi>ſeparated to the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and muſt <hi>give themſelves wholly to theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> All the Pariſh are not the Church, nor do I take the Paſtoral charge of them, and therefore I am not ſatisfied that I am bound to take this pains with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will paſs by the queſtion, Whether all the Pariſh be to be taken for your Church: becauſe in ſome places it is ſo, and in others not. But let the negative be ſuppoſed: Yet <hi>1.</hi> The common maintenance which moſt receive, is for <hi>Teaching</hi> the whole Pariſh, though you be not obliged to take them all for a Church. <hi>2.</hi> What need we look for a ſtronger obligation, then the common bond that lyeth on all Chriſtians, to further the work of mens ſalvation, and the good of the Church, and the honour of God, to the utmoſt of their power: together with the common bond that is on all Miniſters, to further theſe ends by Miniſterial teaching to the utmoſt of their power? Is it a work ſo good, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently conducing to ſo great benefits to the ſouls of men, and yet can you perceive no obligation to the doing of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But why may not occaſional Conference and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions ſerve the turn?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I partly know what occaſional conferences are compared to this duty, having tryed both. Will it ſatisfie you to deal with one perſon of <hi>20.</hi> or <hi>40.</hi> or an hundred, and to paſs by all the reſt? Occaſional con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences fall out ſeldom, and but with few; and (which is worſt of all) are ſeldom managed ſo throughly, as theſe muſt be. When I ſpeak to a man that cometh to me purpoſely on that buſineſs, he will better give me
<pb facs="tcp:99578:14"/>
leave to examine him, and deal cloſely with him, then when it falls in on the by: And moſt occaſional con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences fall out before others, where plain dealing will not be taken ſo well. But ſo much is ſaid afterward to theſe and ſeveral other Objections, that I ſhall add no more.</p>
            <p>I do now in the behalf of Chriſt, and for the ſake of his Church, and the immortal ſouls of men, beſeech all the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, that they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and effectually fall upon this work. Combine for an unanimous performance of it, that it may more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procure the ſubmiſſion of your people. But if there ſhould be found any ſo blind or vile as to oppoſe it, or diſſent, God forbid that other Miniſters ſhould becauſe of that forbear their duties. I am far from preſuming to preſcribe you Rules or Forms, or ſo much as to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you to tread in our ſteps, in any circumſtances where a difference is tolerable, or to uſe the ſame Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm or Exhortation as we do: Only fall preſently and cloſely to the work. If there ſhould be any of ſo proud or malicious a mind, as to withdraw from ſo great a duty, becauſe they would not ſeem to be our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, or drawn to it by us, when as they would have approved it, if it had riſen from themſelves; I adviſe ſuch, as they love their everlaſting peace, to make out to Chriſt for a cure of ſuch cankered minds; and let them know that this duty hath its riſe neither from them nor us, but from the Lord; and is generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by his Church: And for my part, let them, and ſpare not, tread me in the dirt, and let me be as vile in their eyes as they pleaſe, ſo they will but harken to God and reaſon, and fall upon the work, that our hopes of a more common ſalvation of men, and of a true Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:99578:15"/>
of the Church may be revived. I muſt confeſs I find by ſome experience that this is the work that muſt Reform indeed; that muſt expell our common prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorance; that muſt bow the ſtubborn hearts of men; that muſt anſwer their vain objections; and take off their prejudice; that muſt reconcile their hearts to faithful Miniſters; and help on the ſucceſs of our publike preaching; and muſt make true godlineſs a commoner thing, through the Grace of God, which worketh by means. I find that we never took the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt courſe to demoliſh the Kingdom of Darkneſs till now. I do admire at my ſelf, how I was kept off from ſo clear and excellent a duty ſo long. But I doubt not but other mens caſe is as mine was. I was long convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of it, but my apprehenſions of the difficulties were too great, and my apprehenſions of the duty too ſmall, and ſo I was hindred long from the performance. I thought that the people would but have ſcorned it, and none but a few that had leaſt need would have ſubmitted to it: and the thing ſeemed ſtrange: and I ſtayed till the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were better prepared; and I thought my ſtrength would never go through with it, having ſo great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens on me before: and thus I was long detained in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, which I beſeech the Lord of mercy to forgive. Whereas upon tryal, I find the difficulties almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (ſave only through my extraordinary bodily weakneſs) to that which I imagined; and I find the benefits and comforts of the work to be ſuch, as that I profeſs I would not wiſh that I had forborn it, for all the Riches in the world (as for my ſelf.) We ſpend <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> and <hi>Tueſday</hi> from morning to almoſt night in the work; (beſides a Chappelrie catechized by another aſſiſtant) taking about <hi>15.</hi> or <hi>16.</hi> families in a week
<pb facs="tcp:99578:15"/>
(that we may go through the Pariſh (which hath above <hi>800.</hi> families) in a year:) and I cannot ſay yet that one family hath refuſed to come to me, nor but few perſons excuſed and ſhifted it off. And I find more outward ſigns of ſucceſs with moſt that come, then of all my publike preaching to them. If you ſay, It is not ſo in moſt places: I anſwer, <hi>1.</hi> I wiſh that be not much long of our ſelves. <hi>2.</hi> If ſome refuſe your help, that will not excuſe you for not affording it to them that would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. If you ask me, what courſe I take for order and expedition; I have after told you: In a word; at the delivery of the Catechiſms, I take a Catalogue of all the perſons of underſtanding in the Pariſh: and the Clark goeth a week before to every family to tell them when to come, and at what hour (one family at <hi>8.</hi> a Clock, the next at <hi>9.</hi> and the next at ten, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> And I am forced by the number to deal with a whole family at once; but admit not any of another to be preſent (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily.)</p>
            <p>Brethren, do I now invite you to this work, without God, without the conſent of all antiquity, without the conſent of the Reformed Divines or without the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of your own conſciences? See what our late Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſpeak occaſionally, in the Directory, about the viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſick, <hi>It is the duty of the Miniſter not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to teach the people committed to his charge in publike, but</hi> Privately <hi>and</hi> Particularly <hi>to admoniſh, exhort, reprove and comfort them upon all ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occaſions, ſo far as his time, ſtrength, and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſafety will permit. He is to admoniſh them in time of health to prepare for death: And for that purpoſe, they are often to confer with their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter about the eſtate of their ſouls,</hi> &amp;c. Read this
<pb facs="tcp:99578:16"/>
over again and conſider it. Harken to God if you would have peace with God: Harken to conſcience if you would have peace of conſcience. I am reſolved to deal plainly with you, if I diſpleaſe you: It is an unlikely thing that there ſhould be a heart that is ſincerely devoted to God in the breaſt of that man, that after advertiſements and exhortations, will not reſolve on ſo clear and great a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as this is. As it is with our people in hearing the word, ſo it is with us in teaching: An upright heart is an effectual perſwader of them to attend on God in the uſe of his Ordinances; and an upright heart will as effectually perſwade a Miniſter to his duty: As a good ſtomach needs no arguments to draw it to a feaſt, nor will eaſily by any arguments be taken off: And as a child will love and obey his parents, though he could not anſwer a Sophiſter that would perſwade him to hate them: ſo I cannot conceive that he that hath one ſpark of ſaving Grace, and ſo hath that love to God, and delight to do his will, which is in all the ſanctified, ſhould poſſibly be drawn to contradict or refuſe ſuch a work as this: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept under the power of ſuch a temptation as <hi>Peter</hi> was when he denyed Chriſt, or when he diſſwaded him from ſuffering, and heard an half excommunication, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou favoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men, Mat. 16. 22, 23.</hi> You have put your hand to the plough of God: You are doubly ſanctified or devoted to him, as Chriſtians, and as Paſtors; and dare you after this draw back and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his work? You ſee the work of Reformation at a ſtand; and you are engaged by many obligations to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it: and dare you now neglect that means by which it muſt be done? Will you ſhew your faces in a Chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:99578:16"/>
Congregation, as Miniſters of the Goſpel, and there pray for a Reformation, and pray for the Converſion and Salvation of your hearers, and the proſperity of the Church: and when you have done, refuſe to uſe the means by which it muſt be done? I know carnal wit will never want words and ſhews of reaſon to gain-ſay that truth and duty which it abhors: It is eaſier now to cavil againſt duty then perform it: but ſtay the end, before you paſs your final judgement. Can you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly make your ſelves believe that you ſhall have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable review of theſe neglects, or make a comfortable account of them unto God? I dare prognoſticate from the knowledge of the nature of Grace, that all the Godly Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> will make conſcience of this duty, and addreſs themſelves to it (except thoſe that by ſome extraordinary accident are diſabled, or thoſe that are under ſuch temptations as aforeſaid:) I do not hopeleſly perſwade you to it, but take it for granted that it will be done: And if any lazy, or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, or malicious hypocrites, do cavil againſt it, or hold off, the reſt will not do ſo: but they will take the opportunity, and not reſiſt the warnings of the Lord. And God will uncaſe the hypocrites ere long, and make them know to their ſorrow, what it was to play faſt and looſe with God. Wo to them, when they muſt be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the blood of ſouls! The Reaſons which ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them here againſt duty, will then be manifeſted to be the effects of their folly, and to have proceeded radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally from their corrupted wills, and carnal intereſt. And (unleſs they be deſperately blinded and ſcared to the death) their conſciences will not own thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at a dying hour which now they ſeem to own. Then they ſhall feel to their ſorrow, that there is not that
<pb facs="tcp:99578:17"/>
comfort to be had for a departing ſoul in the reviews of ſuch neglected duty, as there is to them that have wholly devoted themſelves to the ſervice of the Lord. I am ſure my arguments for this duty will appear ſtrongeſt at the laſt, whatever they do now. And again I ſay, I hope the time is even at hand when it ſhall be as great a ſhame to a Miniſter to neglect the private Inſtructing and overſight of the Flock, as it hath been to be a ſeldom Preacher; for which men are now juſtly ſequeſtred and ejected: And if God have not ſo great a quarrel with us as tendeth to a removal of the Goſpel, or at leaſt to the blaſting of its proſperity and ſucceſs in the deſired reformation, I am confident that this will ſhortly be. And if theſe lazy worldly hypocrites were but quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their duty by a Sequeſtring Committee, you ſhould ſee them ſtir more zealouſly then all arguments fetcht from God and Scripture, from the Reward or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or from the Neceſſity and Benefits of the work can perſwade them to do. For even now theſe wretched men, while they pretend themſelves the ſervants of Chriſt, and are asking, What Authority we have for his work? and if we could but ſhew them a command from the Lord Protector or Council, it would anſwer all their ſcruples, and put the buſineſs beyond diſpute, as if they had a deſign to confirm the accuſation of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that their Miniſtry only is Divine, and ours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on the will of men. Well! for thoſe godly zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Miniſters of Chriſt, that labour in ſincerity, and denying their worldly intereſt and eaſe, do wholly devote themſelves to God, I am confident there needs not much perſwaſion. There is ſomewhat within that will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry them to the work: And for the reſt, let them cenſure this warning as ſubtilly as they can, they ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:99578:17"/>
not hinder it from riſing up againſt them in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs it be by true Repentance and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And let me ſpeak one word of this to you that are my dear fellow-labourers in this County, who have engaged your ſelves to be faithful in this work. It is your henour to lead in ſacred Reſolutions and Agreements: but if you ſhould any of you be unfaithful in the performance, it will be your double diſhonour. Review your ſubſcribed Agreement, and ſee that you perform it with diligence and conſtancy. You have begun a happy work: ſuch as will do more to the welfare of the Church then many that the world doth make a greater ſtir about. God forbid now, that imprudence or negligence ſhould fruſtrate all. For the generality of you, I do not much fear it, having ſo much experience of your fidelity in the other parts of your office. And if there ſhould be any found among you, that will ſhuffle over the work, and deal unfaithfully in this and other parts of your office, I take it for no juſt cauſe of reproach to us that we accept of your ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, when you offer to joyn with us. For Catechizing is a work not proper only to a Miniſter; and we cannot forbid any to engage themſelves to their unqueſtionable duty: But in our Aſſociation for Diſcipline we muſt be ſomewhat more ſcrupulous, with whom we joyn. I earneſtly beſeech you all in the name of God, and for the ſake of your peoples ſouls, that you will not ſlightly ſlubber over this work; but do it vigorouſly and with all your might, and make it your great and ſerious buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Much judgement is required for the managing of it. Study therefore how to do it beforehand, as you ſtudy for your Sermons. I remember how earneſt I was with ſome of the laſt Parliament, to have had them
<pb facs="tcp:99578:18"/>
ſettle Catechiſts in our Aſſemblies; But truly I am not ſorry that it took not effect (unleſs for a few of the larger Congregations.) For I perceive that all the life of the work under God, doth lie in the prudent effectual management; in ſearching mens hearts, and ſetting home the ſaving truths: and the ableſt Miniſter is weak enough for this, and few of inferiour place or parts would be found competent: for I fear nothing more, then that many Miniſters that preach well, will be found too unmeet for this work; eſpecially to manage it with old, ignorant, dead-hearted ſinners: And indeed if the Miniſters be not reverenced by the people, they will rather ſlight them and conteſt with them, then humbly learn and ſubmit: how much more would they do ſo by infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour men? Seeing then the work is caſt upon us, and it is we that muſt do it or elſe it muſt be undone, let us be up and doing with all our might, and the Lord will be with us. I can tell you one thing for your encouragement; It is a work that the enemies of the Church and Miniſtry do exceedingly vex at, and hate and fear more then any thing that yet we have undertaken. I perceive the ſigns of the Papiſts indignation againſt it. And me thinks it hath the moſt not able character of a work extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and unqueſtionably good: For they ſtorm at it, and yet have nothing to ſay againſt it. They cannot blame it, and yet they hate and fear it, and would fain undermine it, if they knew how. You know how many falſe rumours have been ſpread abroad this Country to deter the people from it: as that the Lord Protector and Council were againſt it: That the ſubſcribers were to be ejected: That the Agreement was to be publikely burnt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when we have ſearcht after the authors, we can drive it no higher then the Quakers, the Papiſts Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries;
<pb facs="tcp:99578:18"/>
from whom we may eaſily know their minds. And yet when a Papiſt ſpeaks openly as a Papiſt, ſome of them have ſaid, that it is a good work, but that it wants authority, and is done by thoſe that are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it: Forſooth, becauſe we have not the Authority of their Pope or Prelates: And ſome that ſhould be more ſober have uſed the ſame language: as if they would rather have thouſands and millions of ſouls neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, then have them ſo much as Catechized and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, without Commiſſion from a Prelate. Yea and ſome that differ from us about Infant Baptiſm, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, repine at it; and ſay that we will hereby inſinuate our ſelves into the people, and hinder them from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the truth. A ſad caſe that any that ſeem to have the fear of God, ſhould have ſo true a Character of a partial, dividing, and ſiding mind, as to grudge at the propagation of Chriſtianity it ſelf, and the common truths which we are all agreed in, for fear leaſt it ſhould hinder the propagation of their opinions. The common cauſe of Chriſtianity, muſt give place to the cauſe of theſe lower controverted points: and they grudge us our very labour and ſuffering for the common work, though there be nothing in it which medleth with them, or which they are able with any ſhew of reaſon to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay. I beſeech you Brethren let all this, and the many motives that I have after given you, perſwade you to the greater diligence herein! When you are ſpeaking to your people; do it with the greateſt prudence and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and be as earneſt with them as for life or death; and follow it as cloſe as you do your publike exhortations in the Pulpit. I profeſs again, it is to me the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable work, except publike preaching (for there I speak to more, though yet with leſs advantage to each
<pb facs="tcp:99578:19"/>
one) that ever I yet did ſet my hand to: And I doubt not but you will find it ſo to you, if you faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> MY ſecond requeſt to the Reverend Miniſters in theſe Nations is, that at laſt they would without any more delay, unanimouſly ſet themſelves to the practice of thoſe parts of Chriſtian Diſcipline, which are unqueſtionably neceſſary, and part of their work. It is a ſad caſe that good men under ſo much liberty, ſhould ſettle themſelves ſo long in the conſtant neglect of ſo great a duty. The common cry is, <hi>[Our people be not ready for it: they will not bear it.]</hi> But is not the meaning, that <hi>you will not bear</hi> the trouble and hatred which it will occaſion? If indeed you proclaim our Churches uncapable of the Order and Government of Chriſt, What do you but give up the cauſe to them that withdraw from them? and encourage men to look out for better ſocietties where that Diſcipline may be had? For though preaching and Sacraments may be omitted in ſome caſes, till a fitter ſeaſon, and accordingly ſo may Diſcipline be; yet it is a hard caſe to ſettle in a conſtant neglect, for ſo many years together as we have done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there were a flat impoſſibility of the work: And if it were ſo, becauſe of our uncapable materials, it would plainly call us to alter our conſtitution, that the matter may be capable. I have ſpoke plainly afterward to you of this, which I hope you will bear, and conſcionably conſider of. I now only beſeech you that would make a comfortable account to the chief Shepherd, and would
<pb facs="tcp:99578:19"/>
not be found unfaithful in the houſe of God, that you do not wilfully or negligently delay it, as if it were a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thing; nor ſhrink not from duty becauſe of trouble to the fleſh that doth attend it: For as that's too ſad a ſign of hypooriſie; ſo the coſtlyeſt duties are uſually the moſt comfortable; and be ſure that Chriſt will bear the coſt. I could here produce a heap of teſtimonies, of Fathers and Reformed Divines, that charge this duty with great importunity. I ſhall only now give you the words of two of the moſt godly, laborious, judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that moſt ever the Church of Chriſt had ſince the daies of the Apoſtles.</p>

The great Objection that ſeemeth to hinder ſome from this work, is becauſe we are not agreed yet, who it is that muſt do it? Whether only a Prelate? or whether a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie? or a ſingle Paſtor? or the People? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let ſo much be exerciſed as is out of doubt. <hi>1.</hi> Its granted that a ſingle Paſtor may expound and apply the word of God: He may rebuke a notorious ſinner by name. He may make known to the Church that God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, with ſuch a one no not to eat? and require them to obey this command, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more of this now, then to cite the words of two learned, godly, moderate Divines, impartial in this cauſe. The one is Mr. <hi>Lyford</hi> a maintainer of Epiſcopacy, in his Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Admiſſion to the Lords Supper: who pag. <hi>55.</hi> ſaith, [Q. <hi>In which of the Miniſters is this power placed?]</hi> Anſw. <hi>Every Miniſter hath the power of all Chriſts Ordinances to diſpenſe the ſame in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or Flock, over which the Holy-Ghoſt hath made him Overſeer; yet with this difference: he may preach the word, baptize, and adminiſter the holy Supper alone of himſelf without the aſſiſtance or conſent of the People: But not excommunicate alone</hi> (he means not without the people, though of that more muſt be ſaid:) <hi>becauſe excommunication doth preſuppoſe an offence to the Congregation, a convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and proof of that offence, and witneſſes of the parties obſtinacy: and therefore hereunto is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the action of more then one,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation comprizeth ſeveral acts: Admonition, private, publike: the laſt act is, the caſting out of a wicked obſtinate perſon from the ſociety of the faithful. 1. By the authority of Chriſt. 2. Diſpenſed and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the Miniſters of the Goſpel. 3. With the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99578:23"/>
               <hi>aſſiſtance and conſent of the Congregation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>2. If you ask by whoſe office and Miniſtry this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is denounced? I anſwer, by the Miniſters of the Goſpel: we bind and looſe doctrinally, in our preaching peace to the godly and curſes to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: But in excommunication we denounce the wrath of God againſt this or that particular perſon (Thou art the man! thou haſt no part with us:) and that not only declaratively, but judicially: It is like the ſentence of a Judge on the bench,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>3. If you ask, Whether this be done by the Miniſter alone? I anſw. No; it muſt be done by the aſſiſtance and conſent of the Congregation, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>5. 4. Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication muſt not be done in a corner, by the Chancellor and his Regiſter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But whoſoever doth by his offences loſe his right to the holy things of God, he muſt loſe it in the face of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that after proofs and allegations, as is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: the people hear and ſee the offence, complain of it, and are grieved at his ſociety with them, and judge him worthy to be caſt out. This concurrence and conſent being ſuppoſed, every Miniſter is</hi> Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Gregis, <hi>a Biſhop in his own Pariſh</hi> (N. B.)

Beſides every Miniſter is veſted with this authority at his Ordination, Whoſe ſins thou doſt forgive, they are forgiven: whoſe ſins thou doſt retain,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:99578:23"/>
               <hi>2. Every Miniſter is veſted with this authority by the Laws of this Land: The words of the Rubrick for the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper which do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us thereto are theſe [If any of thoſe which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be partakers of the holy Communion, be an open notorious evil liver, ſo that the Congregation by him is offended, or have done wrong to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by word or deed, the curate having knowledge thereof, ſhall call him, and advertiſe him in any wiſe not to preſume to the Lords Table, until he have openly declared himſelf to have truly repented and amended his former naughty life, that the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation may thereby be ſatisfied, which afore were offended; and that he have recompenced the parties whom he hath done wrong to, or at leaſt declare himſelf to be in full purpoſe ſo to do as ſoon as he conveniently may: Beſides this our Authority in this particular is, confirmed by an Ordinance of the Lords and Commons in Parliament,</hi> &amp;c.! So far Mr. <hi>Lyfords</hi> words.</p>
            <p>The other is Mr. <hi>Tho. Ball</hi> of <hi>Northampton</hi> in his late Book for the Miniſtry, where Part <hi>3.</hi> Cap. <hi>4.</hi> he bringeth many Arguments to prove it the Miniſters duty to exerciſe Diſcipline as well as to preach: and the ſeventh Argument is this, <hi>[What was given by the Biſhops unto ſuch Miniſters as they ordained and laid their hands upon, ſhould not be grudged or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to them by any body: for they were never accounted laviſh or over liberal unto them, eſpecially in point of Juriſdiction: that was alwaies a very tender point, and had a guard and centry alwaies on it: for conceiving themſelves the ſole poſſeſſors of it, they were not willing to admit of partners:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99578:24"/>
               <hi>Whatever they indulged in other points, as</hi> Pharaoh <hi>to</hi> Ioſeph <hi>[Only in the throne I will be greater then thou] Yet Biſhops granted to all that they ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Presbyters, the uſe and exerciſe of Diſcipline as well as Doctrine, as appears in the Book of ordering Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, whereof the Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories propounded to the party to be ordained is, [Will you then give your faithful diligence alwaies ſo to Miniſter the Doctrine and Sacraments, and the Diſcipline of Chriſt as the Lord hath commanded, and as this Realm hath received the ſame according to the Commandments of God, ſo that you may teach the people committed to your care and charge with all diligence to keep and obſerve the ſame:] Which a Reverend and Learned Brother, not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving would confine all juriſdiction to Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> &amp;c. Argu. <hi>8. What is granted and allowed to Miniſters by the Laws and Cuſtoms of this Nation cannot reaſonably be denyed: for the Laws of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>have never favoured uſurpation in the Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the Laws and cuſtoms of this Nation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to the Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>the uſe and exerciſe of Diſcipline as well as Doctrine: for ſuch of them as have Parſonages or Rectories, are in all proceſs and proceedings called Rectors,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> And as to the point of the Peoples intereſt, the moderate ſeem to differ but in words. Some ſay the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are to Govern by Vote: I confeſs if this were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as it is ſpoken, according to the proper ſenſe of the words, and practiſed accordingly, it were contrary to the expreſs commands of Scripture, which Command the Elders to Rule well, and the people to obey them as their Rulers, in the Lord: And it ſeems to me to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb facs="tcp:99578:24"/>
to the Being of a Political Church, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive parts are the <hi>Ruling</hi> and the <hi>Ruled</hi> parts: as every School conſiſteth of Maſter and Scholars, and every common-wealth of the <hi>Pars imperans, &amp; pars ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita:</hi> And therefore thoſe that rigidly ſtick to this, do caſt out themſelves from all particular Political Churches Communion of Chriſts inſtitution. (Which becauſe I have formerly ſaid, or ſomewhat to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, a late nameleſs Writer makes me cruel to his party, while I ſeem for them, and ſo ſelf-contradicting: as if it were cruelty to tell a Brother of his ſin, and not to leave it on him: Or as if I underſtood not my ſelf, becauſe he underſtands me not!) But I perceive the moderate mean not any ſuch things as theſe words in their proper ſenſe import. They only would have the Church Ruled as a free people (as from unjuſt impoſitions) and in a due ſubordination to Chriſt. And we are all agreed that the Paſtors have the <hi>Judicium Directionis,</hi> the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Directing Power, by Office: and that the People have <hi>Judicium Diſcretionis;</hi> and muſt try his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not obey them when they lead to ſin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot expect that the people ſhould execute any of our Directions except their Iudgement lead them to execute them. (Though if their Iudgement be wrong, God requireth them to rectifie it) And as for the <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Deciſive power</hi> (about which there is ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending) in the ſtricteſt ſenſe it is the Prerogative of Chriſt, and belongeth to neither of them: For only Chriſt is proper Law-giver, and Iudge of the Church, whoſe Law and Iudgement is Abſolute, of it ſelf Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative, and not ſubjected to our tryal of its equity or obligation. So that we muſt as much conclude that there is no final Iudge of Controverſies in a Particular
<pb facs="tcp:99578:25"/>
Church, as we do againſt the Papiſts, that there is none in the Church in general. And therefore the Churches Iudicial Deciſive Power is but improperly ſuch, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to the former, which ſeeing we are agreed in, we are as far in ſenſe agreed in this. A Paſtor is Iudge as a Phyſician in an Hoſpital, or as <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Zeno</hi> was in his School, or any Tutour in a Colledge of voluntary Students. For any more, it belongeth to Chriſt, and to the Magiſtrate. Why then do we ſtand quarreling about the names? One ſaith, <hi>The people have a Power of Liberty, and the Miniſters only the Power of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And what's this more then we yield them; <hi>viz.</hi> That the guiding Authority being only in the Guides, and the people commanded to obey them in a due ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to Chriſt, there is a Liberty belonging to all the Saints; from any other kind of Miniſterial Rule, that is, from a <hi>ſic volo, ſic jubeo,</hi> a Rule without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority: and therefore the people muſt firſt try and judge, whether the Direction be according to God, and ſo obey: And this in Church cenſures as well as other caſes. So that, <hi>1.</hi> As the people ought not to diſſent, or diſobey their Guides, unleſs they lead them to ſin (and therefore muſt ſee a danger of ſin before they ſuſpend obedience.) So <hi>2.</hi> the Guides cannot bring the people to execute their Cenſures or Directions, but by procuring their conſent. And therefore though he muſt do his duty, and may paſs his Directive cenſure though they diſſent, and Miniſterially require them in the name of the Lord, <hi>e. g.</hi> to avoid a notorious obſtinate offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo to obey the command of God; that is, though we may charge them in the name of the Lord to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and obey, and do their duty, yet if their Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments remain unconvinced in a caſe which is to them
<pb facs="tcp:99578:25"/>
obſcure, we have no more to do, but ſatisfie our ſelves that we have done our duty. So that when we have quarrelled never ſo long, what is it but the <hi>Peoples conſent</hi> that the moderate men on one ſide do require? and <hi>conſent</hi> the other ſide requireth alſo: Call it what elſe you will, whether a <hi>Government,</hi> or an <hi>Authority,</hi> or a <hi>Liberty; Conſent</hi> is the thing which both require! And are we not then in the matter agreed? Peruſe for this Mr. <hi>Lyfords</hi> words before cited. See alſo what the leading men for Presbyterian Government do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge but maintain as effectually as others: as <hi>Dav. Blondellus de Jure plebis in Regim. Eccleſ. Calvin Inſtitut. l. 4. c. 12. ſect. 4. Ne quis tale judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium ſpernat, aut parvi aeſtimet ſe</hi> Fidelium ſuffragiis <hi>damnatum, teſtatus eſt Dominus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ita Zanchius ubi ſup.</hi> and many more. Indeed this Conſent of the people is not <hi>ſine qua non</hi> to the Paſtors performance of his own part; <hi>viz.</hi> Charging the Church in Chriſts name to avoid the Communion of ſuch a notorious obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate offender, and ſuſpending his own acts towards him: and ſo charging them to receive the innocent or penitent.] (For if the people conſent not to avoid ſuch, and ſo would exclude all Diſcipline, yet the Paſtor muſt charge it on them, and do his part.) But it is <hi>ſine qua non</hi> to their actual rejecting and avoiding that offender. In a word, we muſt Teach them their duty and require it and they and we muſt obey and do it: and neither they nor we may oblige any to ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But we are not agreed about the matter of the Church that muſt be Governed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Peruſe the qualifications required in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members in the writings of the moderate on both ſides, and ſee what difference you can find! Are not both
<pb facs="tcp:99578:26"/>
agreed, that Profeſſors of true faith and holineſs, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting and conſenting, are a true Church? and when they contradict that Profeſſion by wicked actions, (Doctrine or life) they are to be dealt with by Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Though I confeſs in our practiſe we very much differ; moſt that I know running into one of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, of looſneſs or rigor.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> MY third and laſt Requeſt is, that all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of Chriſt would without any more delay Unite and Aſſociate for the furtherance of each other in the work of the Lord, and the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Unity and Concord in his Churches. And that they would not neglect their Brotherly meetings to thoſe ends, nor yet ſpend them unprofitably, but improve them to their edification, and the effectual carrying on the work. Read that excellent Letter of <hi>Edmond Grindal</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial meetings and exerciſes (ſuch Biſhops would have prevented our contentions and wars:) You may ſee it in <hi>Fullers</hi> new Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let none draw back that accord in the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of faith and godlineſs: Yea if ſome ſhould think themſelves neceſſitated (I will not ſay to Schiſm, leaſt I offend them; but) to ſeparate in publike worſhip from the reſt, me thinks, if they be indeed Chriſtians, they
<pb facs="tcp:99578:26"/>
ſhould be willing to hold ſo much Communion with them as they can, and to conſult how to manage their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the leaſt diſadvantage to the common truths and Chriſtian cauſe which they all profeſs to own and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
            <p>And here I may not ſilently paſs by an uncharitable ſlander which ſome Brethren of the Prelatical Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have divulged of me far and near: viz. That while I perſwade men to Accommodation, it was long of me that the late Proclamation or Ordinance was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for ſilencing all Sequeſtred Miniſters; viz. by the late <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> Petition, which they ſay was the occaſion of it (and they falſly report that I altered it after the ſubſcription.) To which I ſay. <hi>1.</hi> It was the Petition of many Iuſtices, and the grand Iury, and thouſands of the County, as well as me. <hi>2.</hi> There is not a word in it, nor ever was, againſt any godly man, but only that the notoriouſly inſufficient and ſcandalous ſhould not be permitted to meddle with the myſteries of Chriſt (ſpecially the Sacraments;) which we deſired ſhould have impartially extended to all parties alike. And ſo much of this as was granted, we cannot but be thankful for, whoever grudge at it; and wiſh it had been fully granted. <hi>3.</hi> I deſire nothing more, then that all able, godly, faithful Miniſters of what ſide ſoever in our late State differences, may not only have liberty, but encouragement: For the Church hath not any ſuch to ſpare, were they ten times more. In a word; I would have thoſe of what party ſoever to have Liberty to preach the Goſpel, whoſe errours or miſcarriages are not ſo great, as that probably they will do as much hurt as good.</p>
            <p>Brethren, I crave your pardon for the infirmities of
<pb facs="tcp:99578:27"/>
this addreſs: and earneſtly longing for the ſucceſs of your Labours, I ſhall daily beg of God, that he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to thoſe duties which I have here requeſted you to perform, and would preſerve and proſper you therein, againſt all the Serpentine ſubtilty and rage that is now engaged to oppoſe and hinder you.</p>

But becauſe my time and ſtrength is ſo uncertain, that I know not whether I may live to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh my yet-imperfect preparations on this ſubject, I dare not let this firſt Part come into your hands, without a word of caution and advice, leſt you ſhould miſunderſtand or miſapply it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The caution that I muſt give you, is in two parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Entertain not any unworthy
<pb facs="tcp:99578:28"/>
thoughts of your Paſtors, becauſe we here confeſs our own ſins, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate them in order to our humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reformation. You know it is men and not Angels that are put by God in the office of Church-guides! And you know that we are imperfect men: Let Papiſts and Quakers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a ſinleſs perfection; we dare not do it; but confeſs that we are ſinners. And we ſhould heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to find the ſigns of imperfect ſincerity, in them that ſo confidently pretend to ſinleſs perfection; yea if in ſome of them we could find but common honeſty, and a freedom from ſome of the crying abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ungodly, ſuch as cruel bloodineſs, lying, ſlandering, railing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it would make a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to ſay he is perfect, and if it would deliver a man from ſin, to ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:99578:29"/>
I have no ſin, I confeſs this vvere an eaſie vvay to perfection.</p>
            <p>There is one <hi>Richard Farnworth</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Quaker, that hath lately publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> againſt our Agreement for Catechizing; and the ſubſtance of it is this: becauſe vve confeſs that by neglecting that vvork of the Lord, vve have ſinned, and do beg pardon of our miſcarriages, and ſay that by Nature vve are children of vvrath, and prone to do evil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore he vvill prove us deceivers and no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, as from our ovvn Confeſsion. As if they that are Dead by Nature, may not be made alive by Grace! And as if <hi>Are</hi> is not as proper a term as <hi>Were,</hi> when we ſpeak of the ſtate of all mankind in their natural condition, wherein the moſt do ſtill abide! And as if the confeſsing our ſin would prove us to
<pb facs="tcp:99578:29"/>
be ungodly! O ſhameleſs men! God ſaith, He that confeſſeth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh his ſin ſhall have mercy. And the Quaker maketh it a matter of his reproach. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, If we confeſs, he is faithful and juſt to forgive: And the Quaker maketh it a ſign that we are not forgiven. God will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us, if we refuſe to confeſs: And the Quaker makes us unpardoned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do it. What would this wretch have ſaid to <hi>David, Ezra, Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. if he had lived in their daies, who made ſuch full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsions of their ſins! God hit them not in the teeth with them; but the Quakers will! Chriſt did forgive even <hi>Peters</hi> denyal of him! but it ſeems the Quaker would have condemned him for the penitent lamenting of it: Is <hi>Paul</hi> damned for confeſsing himſelf the chief of ſinners <hi>(of whom I am</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99578:30"/>
               <hi>chief,</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.) and that formerly he was a perſecutor, blaſphemer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or becauſe he ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Vnto me, who am leſs then the leaſt of Saints.</hi> Or for crying out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death! What I would that I do not, and what I hate that do I. I find a Law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 7. 24. 15. 21. Or is <hi>Iſaiah</hi> a wicked man, and no Prophet of God, for ſaying, <hi>Wo is me, I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 6. 5. Or <hi>Jacob,</hi> for ſaying, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy mercies,</hi> &amp;c. Or <hi>Job</hi> for abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf in duſt and aſhes, <hi>Iob</hi> 42. 6. It irketh me to ſpend words upon ſuch Impudent revilers! But in this much you have a ſufficient Reply to his book.</p>
            <p>But for our parts we believe that he
<pb facs="tcp:99578:30"/>
that ſaith he hath no ſin, deceiveth himſelf, and the truth is not in him, <hi>I Iohn</hi> 1. 8. and that in many things we offend all, <hi>I am.</hi> 3. 2. and we profeſs to know but in part, and to have our treaſure in earthen veſſels, and to be inſufficient for theſe things. And therefore ſee that you love and imitate the holineſs of your Paſtors, but take not occaſion of diſ-eſteeming or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching them for their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I take it to be my duty as a watchman for your ſouls, to give you notice of a train that is laid for your perdition. The Papiſts who have found that they could not well play their game here with open face, have mask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and taken the vizards of ſeveral ſects; and by the advantage of the licence of the times, are buſily at work abroad this Land, to bring
<pb facs="tcp:99578:31"/>
you back to <hi>Rome.</hi> What names or garb ſoever they bear, you may ſtrongly conjecture which be they by theſe marks following. 1. Their main deſign is to unſettle you, and to make you believe that you have been all this while miſled, and to bring you to a loſs in a matter of Religion, that when they have made you diſlike or ſuſpect that which you had (or ſeemed to have) you may be the more reſpective of theirs. 2. To which end their next means is to bring you to ſuſpect firſt, and then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and reject your Teachers. For ſaith <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> one of their Writers, <hi>Not one of ten among the people indeed do ground their faith on the Scripture, but on the credit of their teachers,</hi> &amp;c. therefore they think, if they can but bring you to ſuſpect your teachers, and ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them, they may deal with the
<pb facs="tcp:99578:31"/>
ſheep without the Shepherds, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute with the Scholars without their Teachers, and quickly make you ſay what their liſt. To this end their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is partly to cry them down as falſe teachers (but how are they baffled when it comes to the proof?) and partly to perſwade you that they have no calling to the work; and urge them to prove their calling (which how eaſily can we do?) and partly to work upon your covetous humour, by crying down tythes, and all eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed maintenance for the Miniſtry. And withal they are buſie yet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving how to procure the Governors of the Nation, to withdraw their publique countenance and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſacrilegiouſly to deprive the Church of the remnant that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to it for God, and to leave the Miniſtry on equal terms with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:99578:32"/>
or all other ſects (which in <hi>Spain, Italy, France,</hi> &amp;c. they will be loth to do.) And time will ſhew you, whether God will ſuffer them to prevail with the Governors of this ſinful land to betray the Goſpel into their hands, or not? but we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope for better things. 3. Their next deſign, is to diminiſh the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſufficiency of Scripture: and becauſe they dare not yet ſpeak out, to tell us what they ſet up in its ſtead, ſome of them will tell you of New Prophets, and Revelations, and ſome of them will tell you, that in that they are yet at a loſs themſelves: that is, they are of no Religion; and then they are no Chriſtians. I ſhall now proceed no further in the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: but only warn you, as you love your ſouls, keep cloſe to Scripture and a faithful Miniſtry! and deſpiſe not
<pb facs="tcp:99578:32"/>
your Shepherds if you would eſcape the wolves. If any queſtion our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſend them to our writings where we have fully proved them; or ſend them to us, who are ready to juſtifie them againſt any Papiſt or Heretick upon earth. And let me tell you, that for all the ſins of the Miniſtry which we have here confeſſed, the known world hath not a more able, faithful, godly Miniſtry then <hi>Brittain</hi> hath at this day. If at the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> the <hi>Clerus Anglicanus</hi> was called <hi>ſtupor mundi,</hi> before all thoſe Ignorant and Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ones were caſt out; what may we now call it? Brethren, let me deal freely with you! The ungrateful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of a faithful Miniſtry, is the ſhame of the faces of thouſands in this Land! and if through-Repentance prevent it not, they ſhall better know in hell, whether ſuch Miniſters were
<pb facs="tcp:99578:33"/>
their friends or foes, and what they would have done for them, if their counſel had been heard. When <hi>the Meſſengers of God were mocked, and his words deſpiſed, and his Prophets abuſed, the wrath of the Lord aroſe on the Iſraelites themſelves: and there was no remedy,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 36. 16. Shall Miniſters ſtudy, and preach, and pray for you, and ſhall they be deſpiſed? When they have the God of Heaven and their own conſciences to witneſs, that they deſire not yours but you, and are willing to ſpend and be ſpent for your ſakes, and that all the wealth in the world would not be regarded by them in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your ſalvation, and that all their labours and ſufferings is for your ſakes; if yet they ſhall be requited with your contempt, or ſcorn, or dicourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unteachableneſs, ſee who will prove the loſers in the end: When God
<pb facs="tcp:99578:33"/>
himſelf ſhall Juſtifie and Condemn them, with a <hi>Well done good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant;</hi> let thoſe that reproached, deſpiſed, and condemned them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their faces from ſhame, and their conſciences from the accuſations of their horrid ingratitude, as well as they can! Read the Scripture and ſee, whether they that obeyed Gods Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, or they that deſpiſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed them ſped beſt? And if any of the Seducers will tell you, that we are not the Miniſters of Chriſt, leave them not, till they tell you, which is his true Church and Miniſtry, and where they are? and by that time they have well anſwered you, you may know more of their minds.</p>
            <p n="3">3. My laſt advice to you is this. See that you Obey your faithful Teachers, and improve their help for your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation while you have it; and take
<pb facs="tcp:99578:34"/>
heed that you refuſe not to learn when they would teach you. And in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſee that you refuſe not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them in this duty of Private Inſtruction, which is mentioned in this Treatiſe. Go to them when they deſire you, and be thankful for their help. Yea and at other times when you need their advice, go to them of your own accord, and ask it. Their office is to be your guides in the way to life: If you ſeek not their Direction, it ſeems you either deſpiſe ſalvation it ſelf, or elſe you are ſo Proud as to think your ſelves ſufficient to be your own Directors. Shall God in mercy ſend you Leaders to Teach you and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you in the way to Glory, and will you ſtoutly ſend them back, or refuſe their aſsiſtance, and ſay, We have no need of their Direction? Is it for their own caſe or gain that they
<pb facs="tcp:99578:34"/>
trouble you, or is it for your own everlaſting gain? Remember that Chriſt hath ſaid to his Meſſengers, He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me! If your obſtinate refuſal of their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, do put them to bear witneſs againſt you in Judgement, and to ſay, <hi>Lord, I would have taught theſe ignorant ſinners, and admoniſhed theſe worldly impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent wretches; but they would not ſo much as come to me, nor ſpeak with me!</hi> look you to it, and anſwer it as you can: For my part I would not be then in your caſe for all the world. But I ſhall ſay no more to you on this point, but only deſire you to read and conſider the exhortation, which is publiſhed in our <hi>Agreement</hi> it ſelf, which ſpeaks to you more fully: And if you read this book, remember that the Duty which you find to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Miniſters, doth ſhew alſo
<pb facs="tcp:99578:35"/>
what belongs to your ſelves. For it cannot be our duty to Teach, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize, Adviſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it be not yours to Hear, and Learn, and ſeek Advice. If you have any temptation to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our office, read the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters <hi>Ius Divinum Miniſter. Evang.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tho. Balls</hi> book for the Miniſtry: If you doubt of the duty of learning the Principles, and being Catechized, read the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters late Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Catechizing, and Mr. <hi>Zach. Croftons</hi> book for Catechizing (now newly publiſhed.)</p>

               <p>NAY thirdly, there will be little matter of doubt or controverſie, but that private, frequent, ſpiritual conference betwixt fellow-Chriſtians, but eſpecially (and in matters of high concernment and difficulty) between the Presbyter and thoſe of his charge, even in the time of health; and peculiarly, that part of it, which is ſpent in the diſcuſsion of every mans ſpecial ſins and infirmities and inclinations may prove very uſeful and advantagious (in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſpiritual directions, reproof and comfort) to the making the man of God perfect. And to tell truth, if the Pride and ſelf conceit of ſome, the wretchleſneſs of others, the baſhfulneſs of a third ſort, the nauſeating, and inſtant ſatiety of any good in a fourth, the follies of men, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices of Satan had not put this practice quite out of faſhion among us, there is no doubt but more good might be done by Miniſters this way, then is now done by any other means ſeparated
<pb facs="tcp:99578:36"/>
from the uſe of this particularly, then by that of Publike Preaching (which yet need not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the more when this is uſed) which hath now the fate to be cryed up, and almoſt ſolely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on, it being the likelyer way, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaith, (comparing Publike and private teaching of youth) to fill narrow mouth'd bottles (and ſuch are the moſt of us) by taking them ſingle in the hand, and pouring in water into each, then by ſetting them altogether, and throwing never ſo many bottles of water on them.</p>

               <p>THE ignorant ſoul feels no ſuch ſmart: If the Miniſter ſtay till he ſends for him to inſtruct him, he may ſooner hear the bell go for him than any Meſſenger come for him: You muſt ſeek them out, and not expect that they will come to you. Theſe are a ſort of people that are afraid more of their Remedy, than their diſeaſe, and ſtudy more to hide their ignorance, then how to have it cured; which ſhould make us pitty them the more, becauſe they can pitty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo little. I confeſs it is no ſmall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs to ſome of us, who have to do with a multitude, that we have neither time nor ſtrength to make our addreſſes to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon in our Congregations, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on them as their needs require; and yet cannot well ſatisfie our conſciences other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But let us look to it, that though we
<pb facs="tcp:99578:37"/>
cannot do to the height of what we would, we be not found wanting in what we may. Let not the difficulty of our Province make us like ſome, who when they ſee they have more work upon their hands, than they can well diſpatch, grow ſick of it, and ſit down out of a lazy deſpondency, and do juſt nothing.—O if once our hearts were but filled with Zeal for God and compaſſion to our peoples ſouls, we would up and be doing, though we could but lay a brick a day; and God would be with us. May be, you who find a people rude and ſottiſhly ignorant, like ſtones in the quarry and trees unfell'd, ſhall not bring the work to ſuch perfection in your daies as you deſire!

That this was <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement, I need no other proof, then this rowſing heart-melting exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Elders: A ſhort Sermon; but not ſoon learnt. Had the Biſhops and Teachers of the Church but throughly learned this ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, though with the neglect of many a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn which hath taken up their time, and helpt them to greater applauſe in the world, how happy had it been for the Church and them!</p>
               <p>Our preſent ſtraits of time will allow me to touch upon no part of it but my Text; which, ſuppoſing <hi>Paul</hi> the ſpeaker, and the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Elders his hearers, containeth, 1. A two-ſold duty. 2. A four-fold motive to enforce it.</p>
               <p>The firſt duty is to <hi>Take heed to themſelves.</hi> The
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99578:42"/>
ſecond is, <hi>to take heed to all the Flock.</hi> And the main work for the Flock which is thus heedfully to be done, is expreſſed, even <hi>to feed them, or play the Shepherds for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The motives cloſely laid together are theſe. 1. From their engagement and Relation: They are the Over-ſeers of the Flock; It is their office. 2. From the efficient cauſe; even the authority and excellency of him that called them to it: which was the Holy Ghoſt. 3. From the dignity of the object, which is the matter of their charge; It is the Church of God: the moſt excellent and honourable ſociety in the world. 4. From the tender regard that Chriſt hath to this Church, and the price it coſt him: He purchaſed it with his own blood. This Motive is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubordinate to the former. The terms of the Text have no ſuch difficulty as to allow me the ſpending of much of our little time for their explication. <gap reason="foreign">

Of whom more anon. The verb <gap reason="foreign">

deſignation of theſe Elders or Biſhops to their charge: for we muſt not limit and exclude without neceſsity. The Holy Ghoſt did by all theſe three waies make them Over-ſeers of their Flocks. 1. By qualifying them with ſuch gifts as made them fit for it. 2. By directing the minds of thoſe that Ordained them to the miniſtery. 3. By diſpoſing both their own minds, and the Ordainers, and the peoples for the affixing them to that particular Church rather then another. <hi>Dicit eos conſtitutos à ſpiritu ſancto,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grotius, quia conſtituti erant ab Apoſtolis plenis ſpiritu ſancto, quanquam approbante plebe:</hi> But no doubt, in thoſe times the Holy Ghoſt did give ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al directions as by internal oracle, for the diſpoſal of particular teachers, as we read in the caſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and for the proviſion for particular Congregations.</p>

               <p>BUT it is neceſſary before we proceed to Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Application, that we be reſolved more clearly who thoſe Elders or Biſhops be that <hi>Paul</hi> doth here exhort.

This Text was wont to be thought moſt apt to awaken the Miniſters of the Goſpel to their duty: but of late the negligent are gratified with the News, (for news it is) that only Biſhops in a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pereminent ſenſe, whom we uſually call Prelates are ſpoken to in this Text; and not only ſo, but that no other Text of Scripture doth ſpeak to any other Church Presbyters (certainly) but them; yea, that no other were in being in Scripture times. Here are two Queſtions before us to be reſolved. 1. Whether the Elders here mentioned were the Elders of one Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or of all that part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that is, of every Church one. This is but in order to the ſecond, which is, whether theſe Elders were only Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99578:44"/>
or ſuch Biſhops as among us have carried that name.</p>
               <p>The reaſons that may be brought to prove theſe to be the Prelates of the ſeveral Cities of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that the <gap reason="foreign">

There might be many Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> preſent, though ſome from the neereſt Cities were there alſo: which is all that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirms. 2.

He that reſideth ordinarily at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> though he thence make frequent excurſions to the neighbour parts, may well be ſaid to abide ſo long at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> And the Epheſian Elders might well be acquainted with his induſtry round about them, though here is no certainty that he mentioneth any more then what he did with them. For what he did in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he did in <hi>Aſia,</hi> as that which is done in <hi>London</hi> is done in <hi>England. Obj.</hi> 3. But it is meant of all <hi>Aſia;</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>among whom I have gone,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As though <hi>Paul</hi> might not <hi>go preaching the Goſpel</hi> in <hi>Epheſus?</hi> 2. If he went further, the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Elders might accompany him. <hi>Ob. Epheſus</hi> was the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, and therefore all <hi>Aſia</hi> might be thence denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It muſt be proved that it was ſo denominated. All <hi>France</hi> is not called <hi>Paris,</hi> nor
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99578:44"/>
all <hi>England London.</hi> 2. It is not whole Countries, but a Church that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of; and it is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved that the Church of one City had then any ſuch dependance on the Church of another City, as leſſer Cities had upon the Metropolis.</p>
               <p>Our Reaſons that make us think that either all or many of theſe Elders or Biſhops were over the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> are theſe. 1. It is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid in the Text, that they were Elders of the Church, referring to <hi>Epheſus</hi> next before mentioned. <hi>He ſent to</hi> Epheſus, <hi>and called the Elders of the Church.</hi> And it cannot be proved in all the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament that the Biſhops of other Churches and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are called Biſhops of a greater City, becauſe it is the Metropolis. 2. Here is mention but of one Church and one Flock in the ſingular number, and not of many: when yet it is acknowledged that he ſpeaketh not of the Univerſal Church (for then that language were not ſtrange) but of a particular Church. And it is the uſe of the Apoſtles to ſpeak ſtill in the plural number when they mention the particular Churches of many Cities, and not to call them all one Church or Flock. 3. And it may ſeem elſe that the Elder of each one of theſe Cities hath a charge of all the reſt. For they are required to take heed of all the Flock: which though it may poſſibly be by taking every one his part, yet if one ſhould fail, the reſt ſeem to have his charge upon them, which is more then they can do. 4. <hi>Paul</hi> was now in ſo great haſt in his journey to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>Luke</hi> meaſureth it out by the daies. And it is not like that <hi>Paul</hi> could in ſuch haſt call the Elders from the ſeveral Cities of <hi>Aſia.</hi> If he had paſſed through
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99578:45"/>
the Brittiſh Seas in ſuch haſte, and lodged at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and had thence called to him the Elders of <hi>Paris,</hi> he muſt have ſtaid many dayes or weeks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could have gathered alſo the Biſhops of <hi>Rhemes, Arles, Orleance,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>France.</hi> 5. The numbers of Prophets and gifted men in thoſe times, and the ſtate of other particular Churches, doth give us ſufficient reaſon to conjecture that <hi>Epheſus</hi> was not ſo ſcant of help, as to have but one Presbyter. <hi>Grotius</hi> thought that <hi>Timothy</hi> with his Com-Presbyters made this appearance; but others have given very probable reaſons that <hi>Timothy</hi> was none of them. 6. The Judgement of Expoſitors antient and modern running ſo commonly the other way, commandeth ſome reſpect from us.</p>
               <p>But 1. I confeſs the matter ſeemeth but conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral on both ſides, and neither part to have a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but if probability may carry it, there ſeems to be many of the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> though poſſibly ſome of the neighbouring Cities might be with them. 2. But let this go how it will, it maketh not much to the main matter in hand. What if <hi>Epheſus</hi> and each other City or Church had then but one Presbyter? will it follow that he was a Prelate? No; but the contrary: It will prove that there was then none ſuch at all, if there were no ſubject Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. For there is no King without ſubjects; nor maſter without ſervants. 1. The ſtream of antient and modern Expoſitors do take this Text to ſpeak of Presbyters in the common ſenſe. And we muſt be cautelous before we be ſingular in the expounding of ſo many texts as ſpeak the ſame way. 2. If men be put now in the end of the world to find out a new
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99578:45"/>
foundation for Prelacy, ſuppoſing that it hath been amiſs defended till now, and all theſe Texts (except by one or two) amiſs expounded, it will occaſion the ſhaking of the frame it ſelf. 3. But the beſt is, we begin to be pretty well agreed, at leaſt about the whole Government that. <hi>de facto</hi> was in being in Scripture-times. For 1. It is now at laſt confeſſed, that the word Presbyter is not certainly taken any where in the New Teſtament, for one that is ſubject to a Biſhop, having not power of Ordination or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; and that no ſuch Presbyters were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Scripture-times. And by what authority they are ſince erected let them prove that are concerned in it. 2. We are agreed now that they were the ſame perſons who in Scripture are called Biſhops &amp; Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. 3. And that theſe perſons had the power of Ordination &amp; Juriſdiction 4. And that theſe perſons were not the Biſhops of many particular Churches, but one only: They ruled not many Aſſemblies Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily meeting for Church Communion: for there could no ſuch meetings be kept up without a Biſhop or Presbyter to adminiſter the Ordinances of Chriſt in each. And if there were in a Dioceſs but one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and no other Presbyters in Scripture times, then it muſt needs be that a Dioceſs contained but one ordinary Church Aſſembly, and that <hi>de facto</hi> no Biſhip in Scripture-times had under him any Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters nor more ſuch Aſſemblies then one. That is, they Ruled the particular Churches juſt as our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Paſtors do. So that we are ſatisfied that we go that way that the Apoſtles eſtabliſhed and was uſed <hi>de facto</hi> in Scripture-times: And if any will prove the lawfulneſs of latter mutations, or will prove that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99578:46"/>
the Apoſtles gave power to theſe particular Paſtors to degenerate into another ſort of officers hereafter, according to the Cogency of their Evidence, we ſhall believe it. In the mean time, deſiring to be guided by the word of God, and to go upon ſure ground, and take only ſo much as is certain, we hold where we are, and are glad that we are ſo far agreed. Yet not preſuming to cenſure all ſuperiour Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, nor refuſing to obey any man that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to do our duty, but reſolving to do our own work in faithfulneſs and peace.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I have ever thought it eaſier to be Governed then to Govern; and I am ready (as the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> told <hi>Auſtin)</hi> to be obedient to any man in and for the Lord: Nor can I think that any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment can be burdenſom, which Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth; but all beneficial to us; as making our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lighter and not heavyer, and helping and not hindering us in the way to heaven. Were Chriſts work but throughly done, I ſhould be the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt in contending, who ſhould have the doing of it. Let us agree but on this one thing which is plain here in my Text, That the Churches or Flocks ſhould be no greater then the Paſtors can perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over-ſee, ſo that they may <hi>Take heed to all the Flock;</hi> and then let but able faithful men be the Over-ſeers, that will make the word of God the Rule, and lay out themſelves for the ſaving of mens ſouls, and I am reſolved never to contend with ſuch about the buſineſs of ſuperiority; but cheerfully to obey them in all things lawful, if they require my obedience. If the difference were not more about the matters commanded, and the work it ſelf to be done,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99578:46"/>
then, Who ſhould command it: me thinks humble men ſhould be eaſily agreed. Would they but lay by all needleſs humane impoſitions and obtruſions, and be contented with the ſufficient word of God, and not make new work to neceſſitate, new Canons and Authorities to impoſe it, but be content with the Goſpel ſimplicity, and let us take that for a ſufficient way to heaven, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> went thither in, I think I ſhould not diſobey ſuch a Biſhop, though I were not ſatisfied of his differing Order or Degree. Yea, if he were addicted to ſome encroaching uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of more power then is meet, would he but forbear the <hi>Ecce duo gladii,</hi> and come to us only with the ſword of the ſpirit, which will admit of fair de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and works only upon the conſcience, I know no reaſon much to fear ſuch power, though it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due. But enough of this.</p>

And here I may well for brevity ſake adjoyn the Application to the Explication, it being about the matter of our Practiſe, that I may be put to go over as little as may be of the ſame things again. Take therefore I beſeech you all this Explication, as ſo much Advice and Exhortation to the duty, and let your hearts attend it as well as your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed to your ſelves, leſt you ſhould be void of that ſaving Grace of God which you offer to others, and be ſtrangers to the effectual workings of that Goſpel which you preach; and leſt while you proclaim the neceſſity of a Saviour to the world, your own hearts ſhould neglect him, and you ſhould miſs of an intereſt in him and his ſaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits? Take heed to your ſelves, leſt you periſh, while you call upon others to take heed of periſhing! and leſt you famiſh your ſelves while you prepare their food. Though there be a promiſe of ſhining as the ſtars to thoſe that turn many to righteouſneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3. that is but on ſuppoſition that they be firſt turned to it themſelves: Such promiſes are meant, <hi>caeteris paribus, &amp; ſuppoſitis ſupponendis.</hi> Their own ſincerity in the faith is the condition of their glory ſimply conſidered, though their great miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial labours may be a condition of the promiſe of their greater glory; Many a man hath warned others
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99578:48"/>
that they come not to that place of Torment, which yet they haſted to themſelves: Many a Preacher is now in hell, that hath an hundred times called upon his hearers to uſe the utmoſt care and diligence to eſcape it. Can any reaſonable man imagine that God ſhould ſave men for offering ſalvation to others, while they refuſed it themſelves: and for tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling others thoſe truths which they themſelves neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and abuſed? Many a Taylor goes in raggs, that maketh coſtly cloathes for others: And many a Cook ſcarce licks his fingers, when he hath dreſſ't for others the moſt coſtly diſhes. Believe it Brethren, God never ſaved any man for being a Preacher, nor becauſe he was an able Preacher: but becauſe he was a juſtified, ſanctified man, and conſequently faithful in his maſters work. Take heed therefore to your ſelves firſt, that you <hi>be</hi> that which you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your hearers to <hi>be,</hi> and believe that which you perſwade them daily to believe: and have heartily entertained that Chriſt and Spirit which you offer unto others.

To preach a Sermon I think is not the hardeſt part; and yet what skill is neceſſary to make plain the truth, to convince the hearers; to let in unreſiſtible light into their conſciences, and to keep it there, and drive all home! to ſcrue the truth into their minds, and work Chriſt into their affections; to meet with every objection that gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaies; and clearly to reſolve it; to drive ſinners to a ſtand, and make them ſee that there is no hope, but they muſt unavoidably be converted or condemned: and to do all this ſo for language and manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeems our work, and yet as is moſt ſuitable to the capacities of the hearers, this and a great deal more that ſhould be done in every Sermon, ſhould ſure be done with a great deal of holy skill.

How many ſleep under us, becauſe our hearts and tongues are ſlepy: and we bring not with us ſo much skill and zeal as to awake them!</p>
               <p>Moreover what skill is neceſſary to defend the truth againſt gain-ſayers, and to deal with diſputing Cavillers according to their ſeveral modes and caſe!

MOreover take heed to your ſelves, leſt your example contradict your Doctrine, and leſt you lay ſuch ſtumbling blocks before the blind, as may be the occaſion of their ruine. Leſt you unſay that with your lives, which you ſay with your tongues; and be the greateſt hinderers of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of your own labours. It much hindereth our work when other men are all the week long contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting to poor people in private, that which we have been ſpeaking to them from the word of God in publike becauſe we cannot be at hand to manifeſt their folly: But it will much more hinder, if we contradict our ſelves, and if your actions give your tongue the lye, and if you build up an hour or two with your mouths, and all the week after pull down with your hands! This is the way to make men think that the word of God is but an idle tale: and to make preaching ſeem no better then prating. He that means as he ſpeaks, will ſure do as he ſpeaks. One proud ſurly Lordly word, one needleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, one covetous action may cut the throat of many a Sermon, and blaſt the fruit of all that you have been doing. Tell me Brethren, in the fear of God: Do you regard the ſucceſs of your labours, or do you not? Do you long to ſee it upon the ſouls of your hearers? If you do not, What do you preach for! What do you ſtudy for! and what do you call your ſelves the Miniſters of Chriſt for? But if you do, then ſure you cannot find in your
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99578:52"/>
heart to mar your work for a thing of nought! What, do you regard the ſucceſs of your labours, and yet will not part with a little to the poor, not put up an injury or a ſoul word, nor ſtoop to the meaneſt, nor forbear your paſſionate or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is a palpable errour in thoſe Miniſters that make ſuch a diſproportion between their preaching and their living, that they will ſtudy hard to preach ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, and ſtudy little or not at all to live exactly: All the week long is little enough to ſtudy how to ſpeak two hours: and yet one hour ſeems too much to ſtudy how to live all the week. They are loth to miſplace a word in their Sermons or to be guilty of any notable infirmity (and I blame them not, for the matter is Holy and of weight;) but they make nothing of miſplacing affections, words and actions in the courſe of their lives. O how curiouſly have I heard ſome men preach! and how careleſly have I ſeen them live! They have been ſo accurate as to the wordy part in their own preparations, that ſeldom preaching ſeemed a vertue to them, that their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage might be the more polite, and all the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical jingling writers they could meet with, were preſt to ſerve them for the adorning of their ſtile, (and gawds were oft their chiefeſt ornaments.) They were ſo nice in hearing others, that no man pleaſed them that ſpoke as he thought, or that drowned not affections, or dulled not, or diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99578:53"/>
not the heart by the predominant ſtrains of a phantaſtick wit. And yet when it came to matter of practice, and they were once out of Church, how incurious were the men, and how little did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what they ſaid or did, ſo it were not ſo palpably groſs as to diſhonour them! They that preached preciſely, would not live preciſely! What difference between their pulpit ſpeeches and their familiar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe? They that are moſt impatient of Barbariſms, Soleciſms, and Paralogiſms in a Sermon, can eaſily tolerate them in their converſations.</p>
               <p>Certainly Brethren, we have very great cauſe to take heed what we do, as well as what we ſay: If we will be the ſervants of Chriſt indeed, we muſt not be tongue-ſervants only, but muſt ſerve him with our deeds, <hi>and be doers of the work, that in our deed we may be bleſſed, Iam.</hi> 1. 25. As our people muſt be <hi>Doers of the word, and not hearers only;</hi> ſo we muſt be Doers and not ſpeakers only, leaſt we be <hi>deceivers of our ſelves, Iam.</hi> 1. 22. A practical Doctrine muſt be practically preached. We muſt ſtudy as hard how to live well, as how to preach well. We muſt think and think again how to compoſe our lives as may moſt tend to mens ſalvation, as well as our Sermons. When you are ſtudying what to ſay to them, I know theſe are your thoughts (or elſe they are naught and to no purpoſe) <hi>How ſhould I get within them? and what ſhould I ſay that is likely moſt effectually to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, and convert them, and tend to their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> And ſhould you not as diligently bethink your ſelves, <hi>How ſhall I live, and what ſhall I ſay and do, and how ſhall I diſpoſe of all that I have, as may moſt probably tend to the ſaving of mens ſouls?</hi> Brethren,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99578:53"/>
if ſaving ſouls be your end, you will certainly intend it as well out of the pulpit as in it! If it be your end, you will live for it, and contribute all your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to attain it: And if you do ſo, you will as well ask concerning the money in your purſe, as the words of your mouth, <hi>Which way ſhould I lay it out for the greateſt good, eſpecially to mens ſouls?</hi> O that this were your daily ſtudy, how to uſe your wealth, your friends, and all you have for God, as well as your tongues? and then we ſhould ſee that fruit of your labours that is never elſe like to be ſeen. If you intend the end of the Miniſtery in the pulpit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then it ſeems you take your ſelves for Miniſters no longer then you are there. And then I think you are unworthy to be eſteemed ſuch at all.</p>

Beſides all your common engagements as Chriſtians, you have many more as Miniſters. How oft have you proclaimed the evil and danger of it, and called ſinners from it? how
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99578:58"/>
oft have you declared the terrors of the Lord? all theſe did imply that you renounced it your ſelves. Every Sermon that you preacht againſt it, every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Exhortation, every Confeſſion of it in the Congregation, did lay an engagement upon you to forſake it. Every child that you have baptized, and entred into the Covenant with Chriſt: and every adminiſtration of the Supper of the Lord, wherein you called men to renew their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, did import your own renouncing of the fleſh and the world, and your engagement unto Chriſt. How oft and how openly have you born witneſs of the odiouſneſs, and damnable nature of ſin? and yet will you entertain it againſt all theſe profeſſions and teſtimonies of your own? O what treachery is it to make ſuch a ſtir in the Pulpit againſt it, and after all to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in the heart, and give it the room that is due to God, and even prefer it before the glory of the Saints?</p>
               <p>Many more ſuch aggravations of your ſins might be mentioned: but as we haſte over theſe, ſo we muſt paſs them by through our preſent haſte.</p>

The neerer men ſtand to God the greater diſhonour hath he by their miſcarriages: and the more will they be imputed by fooliſh men, to God himſelf. The heavy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was threatned and executed on <hi>Eli</hi> and on his houſe, becauſe they <hi>kicked at his ſacrifice and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 29. <hi>For therefore was the ſin of the young men great before the Lord, for men abhorred the offering of the Lord; verſ.</hi> 17.

If you are indeed Chriſtians, the glory of God is dearer to you then your lives. Take heed therefore what you do againſt it, as you would take heed what you do againſt your lives. Would it not wound you to the heart to hear the name and truth of God reproached for your ſakes!

your iniquities in the face of the Holy God, and in the face of the Goſpel, and of all that deſire to fear the Lord? would it not break your hearts to think on it, that all the poor godly Chriſtians about you ſhould ſuffer reproach for your miſ-doings? why, if one of you that is a Leader of the Flock ſhould but once be enſnared in a ſcandalous crime, there is ſcarce a man or woman that ſeeketh diligently after their ſalvation, within the hearing of it but beſides the grief of their hearts for your ſin they are likely to have it caſt in their teeth by the ungodly about them, though they never ſo much deteſt it and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it. The ungodly husband will tell the wife, and the ungodly parents will tell their children, and neighbours and fellow ſervants will be telling one another of it, and ſaying, <hi>Theſe are your godly Preachers? you may ſee what comes of all your ſtir; are you any better then others? you are even all alike.</hi> Such words as theſe muſt all the godly in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey perhaps hear for your ſakes.

               <p n="8">8. TAke heed to your ſelves; for the ſouls of your hearers, and the ſucceſs of all your labours do very much depend upon it. God uſeth to fit men for great works, before he will make them his inſtruments in accompliſhing them. He uſeth to exerciſe men in thoſe works that they are moſt ſuited to. If the work of the Lord be not ſoundly done upon your own hearts, how can you expect that he ſhould bleſs your labours for the effecting it in others? He may do it if he pleaſe, but you have much cauſe to doubt whether he will. I ſhall here ſhew you ſome particular Reaſons under this laſt, which may ſatisfie you, that He that would be a means of ſaving others, muſt take heed to himſelf, and that God doth more ſeldom proſper the labours of unſanctified men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Can it be expected that God ſhould bleſs that mans labours (I ſtill mean comparatively,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99578:60"/>
as to other Miniſters) who worketh not for God, but for himſelf? why this is the caſe of every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified man. None but the upright do make God their chief end, and do all or any thing heartily for his honour: They make the Miniſtery but a trade to live by: They chooſe it rather then another call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe their parents did deſtinate them to it, and becauſe it is a pleaſant thing to know, and it is a life wherein they have more opportunity to furniſh their intellects with all kind of ſcience; and becauſe it is not ſo toylſom to the body, to thoſe that have a will to favour their fleſh; and becauſe it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſome reverence and reſpect from men, and becauſe they think it a fine thing to be Leaders and Teachers, and have others depend on them, and receive the Law at their mouth, and becauſe it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth them a competent maintenance. For ſuch ends as theſe are they miniſters, and for theſe do they preach; and were it not for theſe, and ſuch as theſe, they would ſoon give over. And can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that God ſhould much bleſs the labours of ſuch men as theſe? It is not him they preach for, but themſelves, and their own reputation or gain: It is not him but themſelves that they ſeek and ſerve, and therefore no wonder if he leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the ſucceſs, and if their labours have no greater a bleſſing then themſelves can give them, and the word reach no further then their own ſtrength is able to make it reach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Can you think that he is likely to be as ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul as others, that dealeth not heartily and faithfully in his work, &amp; never ſoundly believeth what he ſaith, &amp; never is truly ſerious when he ſeemeth to be moſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99578:61"/>
ligent? And can you think that any unſanctified man can be hearty and ſerious in the miniſterial work? It cannot be. A kind of ſeriouſneſs indeed he may have, ſuch as proceedeth from a common faith or opinion that the word is true, and is actuated by a natural ſervour, or by ſelfiſh ends: But the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs and fidelity of a ſound believer that ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately intendeth God and mens ſalvation, this he hath not. O Sirs, all your preaching and perſwading of others will be but dreaming and trifling hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, till the work be throughly done upon your ſelves. How can you ſet your ſelves day and night to a work that your carnal hearts are averſe from? How can you call out with ſerious ſervour upon poor ſinners to repent and come in to God, that never Repented or came in your ſelves? How can you heartily follow poor ſinners with importunate ſollicitations, to take heed of ſin, and to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a holy life, that never felt your ſelves the evil of ſin, or the worth of holineſs? I tell you, theſe things are never well known till they are felt, nor well felt till they are poſſeſſed: And he that ſeeleth them not himſelf, is not ſo like to ſpeak feelingly to others, nor to help others to the feeling of them. How can you follow ſinners with compaſſion in your hearts, and tears in your eyes, and beſeech them in the name of the Lord to ſtop their courſe and return and live, that never had ſo much compaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion on your own ſouls as to do this much for your ſelves? What, can you love other men better then your ſelves? and have pitty on them that have none up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelves? Sirs, do you think they will be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diligent to ſave men from hell, that be not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99578:61"/>
heartily perſwaded that there is a hell? Or to bring men to heaven, that do not ſoundly believe that there is ſuch a thing? As <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith on my Text; <hi>Neque enim aliorum ſalutem ſedulo unquam curabit qui ſuam negligit.</hi> He that hath not ſo ſtrong a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the word of God, and the life to come, as will take off his own heart from the vanities of this world, and ſet him upon a reſolved diligence for ſalvation, I cannot expect that he ſhould be faithful in ſeeking the ſalvation of other men. Sure he that dare damn himſelf, dare let others alone in the way to damnation; and he that will ſell his maſter with <hi>Iudas</hi> for ſilver, will not ſtick to make merchandize of the flock; and he that will let go his hopes of heaven rather then he will leave his worldly and fleſhly delights, I think will hardly leave theſe for the ſaving of others. In reaſon we may conceive, that he will have no pitty on others, that is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cruel to himſelf; and that he is not to be truſted with other mens ſouls, that is unfaithful to his own, and will ſell it to the Devil for the ſhort pleaſures of ſin. I confeſs that man ſhall never have my conſent to have the care and charge of others, and to over-ſee them in order to their ſalvation, that takes not heed to himſelf, but is careleſs of his own (except it were in caſe of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſsity, that no better could be had.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do you think that it is a likely thing, that he will fight againſt Satan with all his might, that is a ſervant to Satan himſelf? And will he do any great harm to the Kingdom of the Devil, that is himſelf a member and ſubject of that Kingdom? And will he be true to Chriſt that is in Covenant
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99578:62"/>
with his enemy, and Chriſt hath not his heart? why this is the caſe of every unſanctified man, of what cloth ſoever his coat be made. They are the ſervants of Satan, and the ſubjects of his Kingdom; It is he that ruleth in their hearts: And are they like to be true to Chriſt that are ruled by the Devil? What Prince will choſe the friends and voluntary ſervants of his enemy to lead his Armies in war againſt him? This is it that hath made ſo many Preachers of the Goſpel to be enemies to the work of the Goſpel which they Preach: No wonder if ſuch be ſecretly girding at the Holy obedience of the faithful; and while they take on them to preach for a holy life, if they caſt reproaches on them that uſe it! O how many ſuch Traytors have been in the Church of Chriſt in all ages, that have done more againſt him under his colours, then they could have done in the open field! That have ſpoken well of Chriſt and Scripture, and godlineſs in the general, and yet ſlily and cloſely do what they can to bring it into diſgrace, and make men believe that thoſe that ſet themſelves to ſeek God with all their hearts, are but a company of hypocrites, or ſelf-conceited fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical fellows: And what they cannot for ſhame ſpeak that way in the Pulpit, they will do it in ſecret amongſt their companions. How many ſuch Wolves have been ſet over the ſheep, becauſe they had ſheeps cloathing; pretending to be Chriſtians and as good as others. If there were a Traytor among the twelve in Chriſts family, no marvel if there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now. It cannot be expected that a ſlave of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>whoſe God is his belly, and who mindeth earthly things,</hi> ſhould be any better then <hi>an enemy to the</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:99578:62"/>
                  <hi>Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> What though they live civilly, and preach plauſibly, and have the out-ſide of an eaſie cheap Religiouſneſs? They may be as faſt in the Devils ſnares by worldlineſs, pride, a ſecret diſtaſte of a diligent godlineſs, or by an unſound heart that is not rooted in the faith, nor unreſervedly devoted to God in Chriſt, as any others are by drunkenneſs, uncleanneſs and ſuch diſgraceful ſins. Publicans and Harlots do ſooner come to heaven then Phariſees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſooner convinced of their ſin &amp; miſery.</p>
               <p>And though many of theſe men may ſeem excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Preachers, and cry down ſin as loud as others, yet is it all but an affected fervency, and too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly but a meer uneffectual bawling. For he that cheriſheth it in his own heart, doth never fall upon it in good ſadneſs in others. I know that a wicked man may be more willing of anothers reformation then his own, and may thence have a kind of real earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in diſſwading them from it; becauſe he can preach againſt ſin at eaſier rates then he can forſake it, and another mans reformation may ſtand with his own enjoyments of his luſts. And therefore many a wicked Miniſter or Parent may be earneſt with their people or family to amend, becauſe they loſe not their own ſinful profits or pleaſures by anothers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, nor doth it call them to that ſelf denyal as their own doth. But yet for all this, there is none of that zeal, reſolution and diligence, as is in all that are true to Chriſt. They ſet not againſt ſin as the enemy of Chriſt, and as that which endangereth their peoples ſouls. A trayterous Commander, that ſhooteth nothing againſt the enemy but powder, may cauſe his Guns to make as great a ſound or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99578:63"/>
as ſome that are laden with bullets: but he doth no hurt to the enemy by it. So one of theſe men may ſpeak as loud, and mouth it with an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fervency: but he ſeldom doth any great execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt ſin and Satan. No man can fight well, but where he hateth, or is very angry: Much leſs againſt them whom he loveth, and loveth above all. Every unrenewed man is ſo far from hating ſin to purpoſe, that it is his deareſt treaſure; though not as ſin, yet the matter of it is, as it affordeth delight to his ſenſual deſires. So that you may ſee, that an unſanctified man is very unfit to be a Leader in Chriſts Army, who loveth the enemy; and to draw others to renounce the world and the fleſh, who cleaveth to them himſelf as his chiefeſt Good.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And it is not a very likely thing that the people will regard much the Doctrine of ſuch men, when they ſee that they do not live as they preach. They will think that he doth not <hi>mean</hi> as he ſpeaks, if he <hi>do</hi> not as he ſpeaks. They will hardly believe a man that ſeemeth not to believe himſelf. If a man bid you run for your lives, becauſe a Bear, or an enemy is at your backs, and yet do not mend his pace him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſame way, you will be tempted to think that he is but in jeſt, and there is really no ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as he pretends. When preachers tell people of a neceſsity of Holineſs, and that without it no man ſhall ſee the Lord, and yet remain unholy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the people will think that they do but talk to paſs away the hour, and becauſe they muſt ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for their money, and that all theſe be but words of courſe. Long enough may you lift up your voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99578:63"/>
againſt ſin, before men will believe, that there is any ſuch harm or danger in it as you talk of, as long as they ſee the ſame man that reproacheth it, to put it in his boſom, and make it his delight. You rather tempt them to think that there is ſome ſpecial good in it, and that you diſpraiſe it as gluttons do a diſh which they love, that they may have it all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As long as men have eyes as well as ears, they will think they <hi>ſee</hi> your meaning as well as <hi>hear</hi> it; and they are apter to believe their ſight then their hearing, as being the more perfect ſenſe. All that a Preacher doth is a kind of preaching; And when you live a covetous or a careleſs life, you preach theſe ſins to your people by your practice. When you drink, or game, or prate away your time in vain diſcourſe, they take it as if you told them, <hi>Neighbours, this is that life that you ſhould all live: you may venture on this courſe without any danger.</hi> If you are ungodly, and teach not your families the fear of God, nor contradict not the ſins of the company you come into, nor turn the ſtream of their vain talking, nor deal with them plainly about the matters of their ſalvation, they will take it as if you preacht to them that ſuch things are needleſs, and they may boldly do ſo as well as you. Yea, and you do worſe then all this, for you teach them to think ill of others that are better. How many a faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter &amp; private man is hated and reproached for the ſake of ſuch as you? What ſay the people to them? <hi>You are ſo preciſe, and tell us ſo much of ſin, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and duty, and make ſuch a ſtir about theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; When ſuch or ſuch a Miniſter that is as great a Scholar as you, and as good a Preacher as you, will be</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:99578:64"/>
                  <hi>merry and jeſt with us, and let us alone, and never trouble themſelves or us with ſuch diſcourſe. Theſe buſie fellows can never be quiet, but make more ado then needs; and love to fright men with talk of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when (ober, learned, peaceable Divines can be quiet, and live with us like other men.</hi> This is the very thoughts and talk of people, which your negligence doth occaſion. They will give you leave to preach againſt their ſins as much as you will, and talk as much for godlineſs in the pulpit, ſo you will but let them alone afterwards, and be friendly and merry with them when you have done, and talk as they do, and live as they, and be indifferent with them in your conſcience and your converſation. For they take the Pulpit to be but as a ſtage; a place where Preachers muſt ſhew themſelves and play their parts; where you have liberty to ſay what you liſt for an hour: and what you ſay they much regard not, if you ſhew them not by ſaying it perſonally to their faces, that you were in good earneſt, and indeed did mean them. Is that man likely therefore to do much good, or fit to be a Miniſter of Chriſt, that will ſpeak for him an hour, and by his life will preach againſt him all the week beſides; yea and give his publike words the lye?</p>
               <p>And if any of the people be wiſer then to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the examples of ſuch men yet the loathſomneſs of their lives will make their Doctrine the leſs effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. Though you know the meat to be good and wholſom yet it may make a weak ſtomach riſe againſt it, if the Cook or the ſervant that carryeth it have pocky, or leprous, or dingy-hands. Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to your ſelves, if ever you mean to do good to others.</p>

5. Laſtly, conſider, Whether the ſucceſs of your labours depend not on the grace and bleſſing of the Lord; And where hath he made any promiſe of his aſſiſtance and bleſsing to ungodly men? If he do promiſe <hi>his Church</hi> bleſsing even by ſuch, yet doth he not promiſe <hi>them</hi> any bleſsing. To his faithful ſervants he hath promiſed that he will be with them, that he will put his Spirit upon them, and his word into their mouthes, and that Satan ſhall fall before them as lightening from heaven. But where is there any ſuch promiſe to the ungodly, that are not the children of the promiſe? Nay, do not you rather by your abuſe of God, provoke him to forſake and blaſt your endeavours? at leaſt, as to your ſelves, though he may bleſs them to his choſen. For I do not all this while deny but that God may often do good to his Church by wicked men, but not ſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily nor eminently as by his own.</p>
               <p>And what I have ſaid of the wicked themſelves, doth hold in part of the godly while they are ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and back-ſliding, proportionably according to the meaſure of their ſin. So much for the Reaſons.</p>

Though a Miniſter be an Officer in the Univerſal Church, yet is he in a ſpecial manner the Overſeer of that particular Church which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge: As he that is a Phyſitian in the Common-wealth may yet be the <hi>Medicus vel Archiater cujuſdam Civitatis,</hi> and be obliged to take care of that City, and not ſo of any other: ſo that though he may and ought occaſionally to do any good he can elſe where that may conſiſt with his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to his ſpecial charge, (when an unlicenced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99578:66"/>
may not) yet is he firſt obliged to that City, and muſt allow no help to others that muſt occaſion a neglect of them, except in great extraordinary caſes, where the publike good requireth it. So is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Paſtor and his ſpecial Flock. When we are Ordained Miniſters without a ſpecial charge, we are licenced and commanded to do our beſt for all, as we ſhall have a call for the particular exerciſe: but when we have undertaken a particular charge, we have reſtrained the exerciſe of our gifts and guidance ſo ſpecially to that, that we may allow others no more then they can ſpare, of our time and help, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where the publike good requireth it, which muſt be firſt regarded. From this Relation of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and Flock, ariſe all the duties which mutually we owe. As we muſt be true to our truſt, ſo muſt our people be faithful to us, and obey the juſt Directions that we give them from the word of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When we are commanded <hi>to Take heed to all the Flock;</hi> it is plainly implyed, that <hi>the Flocks muſt be no greater regularly and ordinarily then we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Over-ſeeing or taking heed of.</hi> That particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches ſhould be no greater, or Miniſters no fewer, then may conſiſt with a Taking heed to <hi>all.</hi> For God will not lay upon us natural impoſſibilities: He will not bind men on ſo ſtrict account as we are bound, to leap up to the Moon, to touch the Stars, to number the ſands of the Sea. If it be the Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral work to Over-ſee and Take heed to all the Flock, then ſure there muſt be ſuch a proportion of Paſtors aſsigned to each Flock, or ſuch a number of ſouls in the care of each Paſtor, as he is able to take ſuch heed to as is here required. Will God require of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99578:66"/>
one Biſhop to take the charge of a whole County, or of ſo many Pariſhes or thouſands of ſouls, as he is not able to know or to over-ſee? Yea and to take the ſole Government of them, while the particular Teachers of them are free from that undertaking? Will God require the blood of ſo many Pariſhes at one mans hands, if he do not that which ten or twenty, or an hundred, or three hundred men can no more do then I can move a Mountain? Then wo to poor Prelates? This were to impoſe on them a natural or unavoidable neceſsity of being damned. Is it not therefore a moſt doleful caſe that learned ſober men ſhould plead for this as a deſirable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? or draw ſuch a burden wilfully on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? and that they tremble not rather at the thoughts of ſo great an undertaking? O happy had it been for the Church, and happy for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops themſelves, if this meaſure that is intimated by the Apſtole here had been ſtill obſerved: and <hi>the Dioceſs had been no greater then the Elders or Biſhops could Over-ſee and Rule,</hi> ſo that they might have <hi>Taken heed to all the Flock?</hi> Or that Paſtors had been multiplyed as Churches multiplyed, and the number of Over-ſeers proportioned ſo far to the number of ſouls, that they might not have let the work be undone, while they aſſumed the empty ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and undertook impoſsibilities! And that they had rather prayed the Lord of the harveſt to ſend forth more Labourers, even ſo many as had been proportioned to the work; and not to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken all themſelves. I ſhould ſcarce commend the prudence or humility of that Labourer (let his parts in all other reſpects be never ſo great) that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99578:67"/>
would not only undertake to gather in all the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt in this County himſelf, and that upon pain of death yea of damnation, but would alſo earneſtly contend for this prerogative.</p>

But is not Government of great concernment to the good of ſouls, as well as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? If not, then what matter is it for Church-Governors?

If only preaching be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, let us have none but meer Preachers: what needs there then ſuch a ſtir about Government? But if Diſcipline (in its place) be neceſſary too, what is it but enmity to mens ſalvation to exclude it? and it is unavoidably excluded, when it is made to be his work that is naturally uncapable of performing it. He that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99578:67"/>
the Lords Supper, or to be the Teacher of the Church: No more may he commit the Government of it to another. Otherwiſe by ſo doing he makes that man the Biſhop, if he make him the immediate Ruler and Guid of the Church: And if a Biſhop may make each Presbyter a Biſhop, ſo he do but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the power from him, then let it no more be held unlawful for them to Govern, or to be Biſhops. And if a Prelate may do it, it is like Chriſt or his Apoſtles might and have done it; for as we are to preach in Chriſts name, and no in any mans; ſo its likely that we muſt Rule in his name. But of this ſomewhat more anon.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill it muſt be acknowledged that in caſe of neceſsity, where there are not more to be had, one man may under take the charge of more ſouls then he is able well to over-ſee particularly. But then he muſt only undertake <hi>to do what he can</hi> for them, and not to do all that a Paſtor ordinarily ought to do.

               <p>HAving told you theſe two things that are here implyed. I come next to the duty it ſelf that is expreſt. And this Taking heed to All the Flock in general is, <hi>A very great care of the whole and every part, with great watchfulneſs and diligence in the uſe of all thoſe holy actions and Ordinances which God hath required us to uſe for their ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More particularly, this work is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect to the <hi>ſubject</hi> matter of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect to the <hi>object.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In reſpect to the work it ſelf, or the <hi>Actions</hi> which we muſt do.</p>
               <p>And 4. In reſpect to the <hi>End</hi> which we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. Or it is not amiſs if I begin firſt with this laſt, as being firſt in our intention, though laſt as to the attainment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ultimate end of our Paſtoral over-ſight, is that which is the ultimate end of our whole lives; Even the Pleaſing and Glorifying of God, to which is connext the Glory of the humane nature alſo of Chriſt, and the Glorification of his Church,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99578:68"/>
and of our ſelves in particular: And the neerer ends of our office, are, the ſanctification, and holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the people of our charge, their unity, order, beauty, ſtrength, preſervation and increaſe; and the right worſhipping of God, eſpecially in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>By which it is manifeſt, that before a man is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being a true Paſtor of a Church according to the mind of Chriſt, he muſt have ſo high an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of theſe things, that they may be indeed his ends.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That man therefore that is not himſelf taken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up with the predominant love of God, and is not himſelf devoted to him, and doth not devote to him all that he hath and can do; that man that is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the pleaſing of God, and maketh him not the Center of all his actions, and liveth not to him as his God and Happineſs: That is, that man that is not a ſincere Chriſtian himſelf, is utterly unfit to be a Paſtor of a Church.</p>
               <p>And if we be not in a caſe of deſperate neceſſity, the Church ſhould not admit ſuch, ſo far as they can diſcover them. Though to inferiour common works (as to teach the Languages, and ſome Philoſophy, to tranſlate Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> they may be admitted. A man that is not heartily devoted to God, &amp; addicted to his ſervice &amp; honour, will never ſet heartily about the Paſtoral work: nor indeed can he poſſibly (while he remaineth ſuch) do one part of that work, no nor of any other, nor ſpeak one word in Chriſtian ſincerity. For no man can be ſincere in the means, that is not ſo in his intentions of the end. A man muſt heartily Love God above all,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99578:69"/>
before he can heartily ſerve him before all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No man is fit to be a Miniſter of Chriſt that is not of a publike ſpirit as to the Church, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth not in its beauty, and longeth not for its fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity: As the good of the Common-wealth muſt be the end of the Magiſtrate (his neerer end) ſo muſt the felicity of the Church be the end of the Paſtors of it. So that we muſt rejoyce in its welfare, and be willing to ſpend and be ſpent for its ſake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No man is fit to be a Paſtor of a Church that doth not ſet his heart on the life to come, and regard the matters of everlaſting life, above all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this preſent life: and that is not ſenſible in ſome meaſure how much the ineſtimable riches of glory are to be preferred to the trifles of this world. For he will never ſet his heart on the work of mens ſalvation, that doth not heartily believe and value that ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that delighteth not in holineſs, hateth not iniquity, loveth not the Unity and Purity of the Church, and abhorreth not diſcord and diviſions, and taketh not pleaſure in the Communion of Saints, and the publike worſhip of God with his people, is not fit to be a Paſtor of a Church. For none of all theſe can have the true ends of a Paſtor, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot do the works. For of what neceſſity the end is to the Means, and in Relations, is eaſily known.</p>
            </div>

               <head>SECT. III.</head>
               <p n="2">II. THE <hi>ſubject</hi> matter of the Miniſterial work, is in general, ſpiritual things, or matters that concern the Pleaſing of God, and the Salvation of our people. It is not about temporal and tranſitory things. It is a vile uſurpation of the Pope and his Prelates to aſſume the management of the temporal ſword, and immerſe themſelves in the buſineſſes of the world; to exerciſe the violent coertion of the Magiſtrate, when they ſhould uſe only the ſpiritual weapons of Chriſt. Our buſineſs is not to diſpoſe of Common-wealths, nor to touch mens purſes or perſons by our penalties: but it conſiſteth only in theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In revealing to men that Happineſs, or chief Good, which muſt be their ultimate end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In acquainting them with the right means for the attainment of this end, and helping them to uſe them, and hindring them from the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the firſt and great work of the Miniſters of Chriſt to acquaint men with that God that made them, and is their Happineſs: to open to them the treaſures of his Goodneſs, and tell them of the Glory that is in his preſence, which all his choſen people ſhall enjoy: That ſo by ſhewing men the <hi>Certainty</hi> and the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the promiſed felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the perfect bleſſedneſs in the life to come, compared with the vanities of this preſent life, we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99578:70"/>
may turn the ſtream of their cogitations and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and bring them to a due contempt of this world, and ſet them on ſeeking the durable treaſure. And this is the work that we ſhould lie at with them night and day: could we once get them right in regard of the end, and ſet their hearts unfeignedly on God, and heaven, the chiefeſt part of the work were done: for all the reſt would undoubtedly follow.</p>
               <p>And here we muſt diligently diſgrace their ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſual felicity, and convince them of the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe pleaſures which they prefer before the delights of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Having ſhewed them the right end, our next work is to acquaint them with the right means of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it. Where the wrong way muſt be diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the evil of all ſin muſt be manifeſted, and the danger that it hath brought us into, and the hurt it hath already done us, muſt be diſcovered. Then have we the great myſterie of Redemption to diſcloſe; the Perſon, Natures, Incarnation, Perfection, Life, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, Burial, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Glorification, Dominion, Interceſſion of the bleſſed Son of God. As alſo the tenor of his promiſes, the conditions impoſed on us, the duties which he hath Commanded us, and the Everlaſting Torments which he hath threatned to the final Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent neglecters of his grace. O what a treaſury of his bleſſings and Graces, and the priviledges of his Saints have we to unfold! What a bleſſed life of Holineſs and Communion therein have we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to the ſons of men: And yet how many temptations, difficulties and dangers to diſcloſe, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99578:70"/>
aſſiſt them againſt! How many precious ſpiritual duties have we to ſet them upon, and excite them to, and direct them in! How many objections of fleſh and blood, and cavils of vain men, have we to confute! How much of their own corruptions and ſinful inclinations to diſcover and root out! We have the depth of Gods bottomleſs Love and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the depth of the myſteries of his Deſigns and Works, of Creation, Redemption, Providence, Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification, Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the depth of Satans temptations, and the depth of their own hearts, to diſcloſe. In a word, we muſt teach them, as much as we can of the whole <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of God. O what two volumns are there for a Miniſter to Preach upon! how great, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, how wonderful and myſterious! All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are Diſciples or Schollars of Chriſt, the Church is his School; we are his Uſhers, the Bible is his Grammer: This is it that we muſt be daily teaching them. The Papiſts would teach them without book, leſt they ſhould learn hereſies from the Word of truth; leaſt they learn falſhood from the Book of God, they muſt learn only the books or words of their Prieſts. But <hi>Our</hi> buſineſs is not to teach them without Book, but to help them to undrſtand this Book of God. So much for the ſubject matter of our work.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">

               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <p n="3">III. THE <hi>Object</hi> of our Paſtoral care is, <hi>All the Flock:</hi> That is, the Church and every member of it. It is conſidered by us, 1. In the whole body or ſociety. 2. In the parts or indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual members.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our firſt care muſt be about the whole. And therefore the firſt duties to be done are publike du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are done to the whole. As our people are bound to prefer publike duties before private, ſo are we much more. But this is ſo commonly confeſſed, that I ſhall ſay no more of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But that which is leſs underſtood or conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, That <hi>All</hi> the Flock even each individual mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our charge muſt be taken heed of and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over by us in our Miniſtery. To which end, it is preſuppoſed neceſſary, that (unleſs where abſolute neceſſity forbiddeth it, through the ſcarcity of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and greatneſs of the Flock) <hi>We ſhould know every perſon that belongeth to our charge.</hi> For how can we take heed to them, if we do not know them? Or how can we take that heed that belongeth to the ſpecial charge that we have undertaken, if we know not who be of our charge, and who not (though we know the perſons?) Our obligation is not to all neighbour Churches, or to all ſtraglers, as great as it is to thoſe whom we are ſet over. How can we tell whom to exclude, till we know who are includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Or how can we refel the accuſations of the offended, that tell us of the ungodly or defiled mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99578:71"/>
of our Churches, when we know not who be members, and who not? Doubtleſs the bounds of our Pariſhes will not tell us, as long as Papiſts and ſome worſe do there inhabit. Nor will bare hearing us certainly diſcover it, as long as thoſe are uſed to hear that are members of other Churches, or of none at all. Nor is meer participation of the Lords Supper a ſure note, while ſtrangers may be admitted, and many a member accidentally be kept off. Though much probability may be gathered by theſe, or ſome of theſe, yet a fuller knowledge of our charge is neceſſary where it may be had, and that muſt be the fitteſt expreſſion of Conſent, becauſe it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that is neceſſary to the Relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the Flock</hi> being thus <hi>known,</hi> muſt afterward be <hi>Heeded.</hi> One would think all reaſonable men ſhould be ſatisfied of this, and it ſhould need no further proof. Doth not a careful Shepherd look after every individual Sheep? And a good School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter look to every individual Scholler, both for inſtruction and correction? And a good Phyſitian look after every particular Patient? And good Commanders look after every individual ſouldier? Why then ſhould not the Teachers, the Paſtors, the Phyſitians, the Guides of the Churches of Chriſt, take heed to every individual member of their charge? Chriſt himſelf the great and good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and maſter of the Church, that hath the whole to look after, doth yet take care of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual. In the 15. of <hi>Luke</hi> he telleth us that he is as the Shepherd that <hi>leaveth the ninety and nine ſheep in the Wilderneſs to ſeek after one that was loſt:</hi> or as the <hi>woman that lighteth a Candle, and ſweepeth</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:99578:72"/>
                  <hi>the houſe, and ſearcheth diligently to find the one groat that was loſt; and having found it, doth rejoyce, and call her friends and neighbours to rejoyce.</hi> And Chriſt telleth us, that <hi>even in heaven there is Ioy over one ſinner that repenteth.</hi> The Prophets are oft ſent to ſingle men. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is made a watch man over indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals: and muſt ſay to the wicked, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely dye, Ezek.</hi> 3. 18, 19. and 18 And <hi>Paul</hi> taught them <hi>publikely and from houſe to houſe,</hi> which was meant of his teaching particular families; for even the publike teaching was then in houſes; and <hi>publikely</hi> and <hi>from houſe to houſe,</hi> ſignifie not the ſame thing. The ſame <hi>Paul warned every man, and taught every man, in all wiſdom, that he might preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Ieſus, Col.</hi> 1. 18. Chriſt expounded his publike parables, to the <hi>twelve a part, Mark</hi> 4. 34. Every man muſt <hi>ſeek the Law at the mouth of the Prieſt, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l.</hi> 2 7. We muſt <hi>give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of our watching for the ſouls of all that are bound to obey us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. Many more paſſages in Scripture aſſure us that it is our duty to Take heed to every individual perſon in our Flock. And many paſſages in the antient Councils do plainly tell us, it was the practice of thoſe times, till Churches began to be crowded, and to ſwell ſo big that they could not be guided as Churches ſhould be (when they ſhould rather have been multiplyed, as the Converts did increaſe.) But I will paſs over all theſe, and mention only one paſſage in <hi>Ignatius</hi> or whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was I matter not much ſeeing it is but to prove what was then the cuſtom of the Church) <hi>ad Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp.</hi>

The Reaſons of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of this I ſhall paſs over now, becauſe ſome of them will fall in when we come to the duty of Catechizing and perſonal inſtruction in the end.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But the Congregation that I am ſet over is ſo great that it is not poſſible for me to know them all, much leſs to take heed of all individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Is it neceſsity or not that hath caſt you upon ſuch a charge? If it be not, you excuſe one ſin with another: How durſt you undertake that which you knew your ſelf unable to perform, when you were not forced to it? It ſeems then you had ſome other ends in your undertaking, and never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make it good, and be faithful to your truſt. But if you think that you were neceſsitated to it, I muſt ask you, 1. Might not you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have procured aſsiſtance for ſo great a charge? Have you done all that you could with your friends and neighbours to get maintenance for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to help you? 2. Have you not ſo much main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance yourſelf as might ſerve your ſelf and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? What though it will not ſerve to maintain you in fulneſs? Is it not more reaſon that you ſhould pinch your fleſh and family, then undertake a work that you cannot do, and neglect the ſouls of ſo many men? I know it will ſeem hard to ſome that I ſay; But to me it ſeems an unqueſtionable thing:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99578:73"/>
That if you have but an hundred pounds a year, it is your duty to live upon part of it, and allow the reſt to a competent aſsiſtant, rather then the Flock that you are over ſhould be neglected. If you ſay, That this is hard meaſure; your wife and children cannot ſo live. I anſwer, 1. Do not many families in your Pariſh live on leſs? 2. Have not many able Miniſters in the Prelates daies been glad of leſs, with liberty to preach the Goſpel? There are ſome yet living (as I have heard) that have offered the Biſhops to enter into bond to preach for nothing, ſo they might but have had liberty to preach. 3. If ſtill you ſay, that you cannot live ſo neerly as poor people do, I further ask; Can your Pariſhoners better endure damnation, then you can endure want and poverty? What, do you call your ſelves Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, and yet are the ſouls of men ſo baſe in your eyes that you had rather they did eternally periſh, then your ſelves and family ſhould live in a low and poor condition? Nay, ſhould you not rather beg your bread, then put ſuch a thing as mens ſalvation upon a hazard, or diſadvantage? Yea or hazard the damnation but of one ſoul? O Sirs, it is a miſerable thing when men ſtudy and talk of Heaven and Hell, and the fewneſs of the ſaved, and the difficulty of ſalvation, and be not all this while in good ſadneſs! If you were, you could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſure ſtick at ſuch matters as theſe, and let your people go to damnation, that you might live at higher rates in the world? Remember this, the next time you are preaching to them, <hi>that they cannot be ſaved without knowledge:</hi> and hearken whether conſcience do not conclude, <hi>Its likely they</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:99578:73"/>
                  <hi>might be brought to knowledge, if they had but diligent inſtruction and exhortation privately man by man;</hi> and then <hi>were there another miniſter to aſſiſt me, this might be done:</hi> and then <hi>if I would live neerly and deny my fleſh, I might have an aſsiſtant:</hi> and then it muſt conclude, <hi>Dare I let my people live in that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which I my ſelf have told them is damning; rather then put my ſelf and family to a little want?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I muſt further ſay, that indeed this poverty is not ſo ſad &amp; dangerous a buſineſs as it is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be. So you have but food and rayment, muſt you not therewith be content? and what would you have more then that which may enable you for the work of God? And it is not purple and fine linnen, and faring deliciouſly every day, that you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as that which muſt content you. <hi>A mans life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not in the abundance of the things that he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth.</hi> So your cloathing be warm, and your food be wholſom, you may as well be ſupported by it to do God ſervice, as if you had the fulleſt ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to your fleſh: A patcht coat may be warm, and bread and drink is wholſom food. He that wanteth not theſe, hath but a cold excuſe to make for hazarding mens ſouls, that he may live on a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler dyet in the world.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>If this Doctrine be received, then it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men from medling with great places; and ſo all Cities, Market-Towns, and other great Pariſhes will be left deſolate.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It will diſcourage none but the carnal and ſelf-ſeeking, and not thoſe that thirſt after the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſouls, &amp; are wholly devoted to the ſervice of

God, and have taken up the Croſs and follow Chriſt in ſelf-denyal. And for others, they are ſo far from being good Miniſters, that they are not his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or true Chriſtians. Chriſt would not forbear to tell the world of the abſolute neceſſity of ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and reſigning up all, and bearing the Croſs, and mortifying the fleſh, for fear of diſcouraging men from his ſervice; but contrarily telleth them that he will have no other ſervants but ſuch, and thoſe that will not come on theſe terms, may go their waies, and take their courſe, and ſee who will loſe by it, and whether he do more want their ſervice, or they want his protction and favour.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But I am not bound to go to a charge which I cannot perform, and to take a greater place, when I am fit but for a leſs.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If you would undertake it but for want of maintenance, then it is not unfitneſs, but poverty that is your diſcouragement: and that is no ſufficient diſcouragement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are all bound to diſpoſe of our ſelves to the greateſt advantage of the Church, and to take that courſe in which we may do God the greateſt ſervice; and we know that he hath more work for us in greater Congregations then in leſſer, and that the neglect of them would be the greateſt injury and danger to his Church and intereſt: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt not refuſe, but chuſe the greateſt work, though it be accompanied with the greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſuffering. It muſt be done, and why not by you as well as others?</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But no man muſt undertake more then he can do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will add the reſt of my enquiries, which will anſwer this objection. 3. Would the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the place ſerve two others, that have leſs neceſſity, or ſmaller families then you? If it will, try to get two ſuch as may accept it in your ſtead. 4. If this cannot be done, nor addition be procured, and there be really ſo little that you cannot have aſſiſtance, then theſe two things muſt be done. 1. You muſt take the charge with limitation, with a profeſſion of your inſufficiency for the whole work, and your undertaking only ſo much as you can do; and this you do for the neceſſity of the place that cannot otherwiſe be better ſupplyed. 2. You muſt not leave off the work of perſonal Over-ſight, nor refuſe to deal particularly with any, becauſe you cannot do it with all: But take this courſe with as many as you are able: and withall put on godly neighbours, and ſpecially parents and maſters of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to do the more. And thus doing what we can, will be accepted.</p>
               <p>And in the mean time let us importune the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Common-wealth, for ſuch a proportion of maintenance to great Congregations, that they may have ſo many Miniſters to watch over them, as may perſonally as well as publiklely inſtruct and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them. It may pleaſe God at laſt to put this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearts of Governors, and to give them a love to the proſperity of his Church, and a conſcience of their duty for the promoting of mens ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Some more of theſe Objections we ſhall anſwer anon, under the Uſes. So much for the diſtribution of the work of the Miniſtery, drawn from the Object materially Conſidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:99578:75"/>
We are next to conſider of it in reference to the ſeveral qualities of the object. And becauſe we ſhall here ſpeak ſomewhat of the Acts with the Object, there will be the leſs afterward to be ſaid of them by themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt part of our Miniſterial work lyeth <hi>in bringing unſound Profeſſors of the faith to ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that they who before were Chriſtians in name and ſhew, may be ſo indeed. Though it belong not to us as <hi>their Paſtors,</hi> to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>rt profeſſed Infidels to the faith, becauſe they cannot be members of the Church while they are profeſſed Infidels; yet doth it belong to us as their Paſtors, to convert theſe ſeeming Chriſtians to ſincerity, becauſe ſuch ſeeming Chriſtians may be viſible members of our Churches. And though we be not abſolutely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this or that man in particular is unſound, and unſanctified, yet as long as we have a certainty that many ſuch are uſually in the Church, and have too great probability that it is ſo with ſeveral indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals whom we can name, we have therefore ground enough to deal with them for their converſion. And if we be certain by their notorious Impiety that they are no Chriſtians, and ſo to be ejected from the Communion of Chriſtians; yea if they were profeſſed Infidels, yet may we deal with them for their converſion, though not as <hi>Their Paſtors,</hi> yet as Miniſters of the Goſpel. So that upon theſe terms we may well conclude that, The work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is the great thing that we muſt firſt drive at, and labour with all our might to effect.</p>
               <p>Alas, the miſery of the unconverted is ſo great that it calleth lowdeſt to us for our compaſſion. If
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99578:75"/>
truly converted ſinner do fall, it will be but into ſin which will ſure be pardoned, and he is not in that hazard of damnation by it as others be. Not (as ſome unjuſtly accuſe us to ſay) That God hateth not their ſins as well as others, or that he will bring them to heaven, let them live never ſo wickedly: but the ſpirit that is within them will not let them live wickedly, nor to ſin as the ungodly do; but they hate ſin habitually, when through temptation they commit it actually; and as they have a General Repentance for all, ſo have they a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for all that is known; and they uſually know all thats groſs and much more, and they have no iniquity that hath dominion over them. But with the unconverted it is far otherwiſe. They <hi>are in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity, and have yet no part nor fellowſhip in</hi> the pardon of their ſins, or the hopes of glory; We have therefore a work of greater neceſſity to do for them, even <hi>to open their eyes, and turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among the ſanctified by faith in Chriſt, Acts</hi> 26. 18. To ſoften and open their hearts to the entertainment of <hi>the truth, if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the acknowledging of it, that they may eſcape out of the ſnare of the Devil, who are taken Captive by him at his will,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25 That ſo <hi>they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and their ſins may be forgiven them, Mark</hi> 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. He that ſeeth one man ſick of a mortal diſeaſe, &amp; another only pained with the tooth-ach, will be moved more to compaſſionate the former, then the latter, and will ſure make more haſte to help him,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99578:76"/>
though he were a ſtranger, and the other were a Son. It is ſo ſad a caſe to ſee men in a ſtate of damnation, wherein if they ſhould dye they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſly loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that me thinks we ſhould not be able to let them alone, either in publike or private, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other work we have to do. I confeſs, I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced frequently to neglect that which ſhould tend to the further encreaſe of knowledge in the godly, and may be called ſtronger meat, becauſe of the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table neceſsity of the unconverted. Who is able to talk of Controverſies or nice unneceſſary points, yea or truths of a lower degree of neceſsity, how excellent ſoever, while he ſeeth a company of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, carnal, miſerable ſinners before his face, that muſt be chang'd or damn'd? Me thinks I even ſee them entring upon their final woe! Me thinks I even hear them crying out for help, and ſpeedyeſt help. Their miſery ſpeaks the lowder, becauſe they have not hearts to ſeek or ask for help themſelves. Many a time have I known, that I had ſome hearers of higher fancies, that lookt for rarities, and were addicted to deſpiſe the Miniſtery, if he told them not ſomewhat more then ordinary; and yet I could not find in my heart to turn from the obſervation of the neceſsities of the impenitent, for the humouring of theſe, nor to leave ſpeaking to the apparently mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for their ſalvation, to ſpeak to ſuch noveliſts, for the clawing of their ears; no nor ſo much as otherwiſe ſhould be done, to the weak for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and increaſe in grace. Me thinks as <hi>Pauls Spirit was ſtir'd within him, when he ſaw the</hi> Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>ſo addicted to Idolatry, Acts</hi> 17. 16. ſo it ſhould caſt us into one of his paroxiſms, to ſee ſo many
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99578:76"/>
men in great probabilitie of being everlaſtingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; and if by faith we did indeed look upon them as within a ſtep of hell, it ſhould more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally untye our tongues, then they tell us that <hi>Croeſus</hi> danger did his ſons. He that will let a ſinner go to hell for want of ſpeaking to him, doth ſet leſs by ſouls then the Redeemer of ſouls did, and leſs by his neighbour then rational Charity will allow him to do by his greateſt enemy. O therefore Brethren, whomſoever you neglect, neglect not the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable! Whatever you paſs over, forget not poor ſouls that are under the condemnation and curſe of the Law, and may look every hour for the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal execution, if a ſpeedy change do not prevent it. O call after the impenitent, and ply this great work of converting ſouls whatever elſe you leave undone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next part of the Miniſterial work, is for the building up of thoſe that are already truly converted. And according to the various ſtates of theſe, the work is various. in general, as the perſons are either ſuch as are young and weak, or ſuch as are in danger of growing worſe, or ſuch as are already declining, ſo our work is all reducible to theſe three, <hi>Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Progreſs, Preſervation</hi> and <hi>Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We have many of our flock that are young and weak; though of long ſtanding, yet of ſmall proficiency or ſtrength, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11, 12. And indeed it is the moſt common condition of the godly: Moſt of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ick in weak and low degrees of grace: And it is no eaſie matter to get them higher. To bring them to higher and ſtricter opinions, is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99578:77"/>
very eaſie; that is, to bring them from the truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to error, on the right hand as well as on the left: but to encreaſe their knowledge and gifts is not eaſie; but to encreaſe their graces is the hardeſt of all. It is a very troubleſom thing to be weak: It keepeth under dangers, it abateth conſolation, and delight in God, and taketh off the ſweetneſs of his waies, and maketh us go to work with too much backwardneſs, and come off with little peace or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: It maketh us leſs ſerviceable to God and man, to bring leſs honour to our Maſter and profeſsion, and do leſs good to all about us. We find ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the means we uſe: we too eaſily play with the Serpents baits, and are inſnared by his wiles. A Seducer will eaſily make us ſhake, and evil may be made appear to us as Good, truth as falſhood, ſin as a duty; and ſo on the contrary; we are leſs able to reſiſt and ſtand in an encounter; we ſooner fall; we hardlier riſe; and are apter to prove a ſcandal and reproach to our profeſſion; We leſs know our ſelves, and are more apt to be miſtaken in our own eſtate not obſerving corruptions when they have got advantage: we are dſhonourable to the Goſpel by our very weakneſs, and little uſeful to any about us; and in a word, though we live to leſs profit to our ſelves or others, yet are we unwilling and too unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to dye.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing the caſe of weaklineſs is comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo ſad, how diligent ſhould we be to cheriſh and encreaſe their grace? The ſtrength of Chriſtians is the honour of the Church. When men are inflamed with the Love of God, and live by a lively working ſaith, and ſet light by the profits and honours of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99578:77"/>
world, and love one another with a pure heart fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, and can bear and heartily forgive a wrong, and ſuffer joyfully for the cauſe of Chriſt, and ſtudy to do good, and walk in offenſively and harmleſly in the world, as ready to be ſervants of all men for their good, becoming all things to all men to win them, and yet abſtaining from the appearances of evil, and ſeaſoning all their actions with a ſweet mixture of Prudence, Humility, Zeal and Heavenly ſpirituality; O what an honour are ſuch to their profeſſions? What ornaments to the Church? and how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſerviceable to God and man! Men would ſooner believe that the Goſpel is indeed a word of truth and power, if they could ſee more ſuch effects of it upon the hearts and lives of men. The world is better able to read the nature of Religion in a mans life then in the Bible. They that obey not the word, may be won by the converſations of ſuch as theſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. It is therefore a neceſſary part of our work, to labour more in the poliſhing and perfecting of the Saints, that they may be ſtrong in the Lord, and fitted for their maſters uſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another ſort of Converts that need our ſpecial help, are thoſe that labour under ſome particular diſtemper, that keeps under their graces, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them temptations and troubles to others, and a burden to themſelves. For alas too many ſuch there are. Some that are ſpecially addicted to Pride, and ſome to worldlineſs, and ſome to this or that ſenſual deſire, and many to frowardneſs, and diſturbing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. It is our duty to ſet in for the aſsiſtance of all theſe, and partly by diſſwaſions and clear diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the odiouſneſs of the ſin, and partly by ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99578:78"/>
directions about the way of remedy, to help them to a fuller conqueſt of their corruptions. We are leaders of Chriſts Army againſt the powers of darkneſs, and muſt reſiſt all the works of darkneſs wherever we find them, though it be in the children of light. We muſt be no more tender of the ſins of the godly then the ungodly, nor any more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend them or favour them. By how much more we love the perſons above others, by ſo much the more muſt we expreſs it in the oppoſition of their ſins. And yet we muſt look to meet with ſome tender perſons here, eſpecially when iniquity hath got any head, and made a party; and many have fallen in love with it; They will be as pettiſh and impatient of a reproof as ſome worſer men, and intereſt piety it ſelf into their faults, and ſay that a Miniſter that preacheth againſt them, doth preach againſt the godly; A moſt haynous crime! to make God and godlineſs acceſſory to their ſins; When all the world beſides hath not the thouſandth part of that enmity and oppoſition againſt them. But the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt muſt do their duties, for all mens peeviſhneſs; and muſt not ſo far <hi>hate their Brother, as to forbear the plain rebuking of him, or ſuffer ſin to lie upon his ſoul, Levit.</hi> 19. 17. Though it muſt be done with much prudence, yet done it muſt be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another ſort that our work is about, is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Chriſtians, that are either fallen into ſome ſcandalous ſin, or elſe abate their zeal and diligence, and ſhew us that they have loſt their former Love! As the caſe of back-ſliders is very ſad, ſo our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence muſt be great for their recovery. Its ſad to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99578:78"/>
them to loſe ſo much of their Life, and peace, and ſerviceableneſs to God: and to become ſo ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Satan &amp; his cauſe. It is ſad to us to ſee that al our labour is come to this, and that when we have taken ſo much pains with men, and bad ſo much hopes of them, all ſhould be ſo far fruſtrate. It is ſaddeſt of all to think that God ſhould be ſo abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe that he hath ſo loved, and done ſo much for, and that the enemy ſhould get ſuch advantage upon his graces, and that Chriſt ſhould be ſo wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the houſe of a friend, and the name of God evil ſpoken of among the wicked through ſuch; and all that fear God ſhould be reproached for their ſakes. Beſides that partial back-ſliding hath a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency to total Apoſtacie, and would effect it, if ſpecial grace prevent it not.</p>
               <p>The ſadder the caſe of ſuch Chriſtians is, the more lieth upon us for their effectual recovery, to reſtore thoſe that are but overtaken with a fault by the Spirit of meekneſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12. and yet to ſee that the ſore be throughly ſearcht and healed, and the joynt be well ſet again, what pain ſoever it coſt; and eſpecially to look to the honour of the Goſpel, and to ſee that they riſe by ſuch free and full confeſſions and ſignifications of true Repentance, that ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration be thereby made to the Church, and their holy profeſſion, for the wound of diſhonour that they had given it by their ſin. Much skill is required to the reſtoring of ſuch a ſoul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another part of the Miniſterial work is about thoſe that are fallen under ſome great Temptation. Much of our aſſiſtance is needful to our people in ſuch a caſe. And therefore every Miniſter ſhould
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99578:79"/>
be a man that hath much inſight into the Tempters wiles. We ſhould know the great variety of them, and the cunning craft of all Satans inſtruments that lie in wait to deceive, and the methods and devices of the grand deceiver! ſome of our people lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Temptations to Error and Hereſie, eſpecially the young unſettled, and moſt ſelf-conceited: and thoſe that are moſt converſant or familiar with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers. Young, raw ungrounded Chriſtians, are commonly of their mind that have moſt intereſt in their eſteem, and moſt opportunity of familiar talk to draw them into their way. And as they are tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo deceivers want not the ſparks of zeal, to ſet them on a flame. A zeal for error and opinions of our own, is natural, and eaſily kindled and kept alive: but it is far otherwiſe with the ſpiritual zeal for God. O what a deal of holy Prudence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry is neceſſary in a Paſtor to preſerve the flock from being tainted with hereſies, and falling into noxious conceits and practices, and eſpecially to keep them in Unity and Concord, and hinder the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or increaſe of Diviſions. If there be not a notable conjunction of all accompliſhments, and a skilful improvement of parts and intereſts, it will hardly be done, eſpecially in ſuch times as ours, when the ſign is in the head, and the diſeaſe is Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical. If we do not publikely maintain the credit of our Miniſtery, and ſecond it by unblamable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary lives, and privately meet with Seducers, and ſhame them; if we be not able to manifeſt their folly, and follow not cloſe our ſtaggering people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fall, how quickly may we give great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the enemy, and let in ſuch an inundation
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99578:79"/>
of ſin and calamity, that will not eaſily be again caſt out!</p>
               <p>Others lie under a temptation to worldlineſs! and others to gluttony or drunkenneſs; and others to iuſt; ſome to one ſin, and ſome to another. A faithful Paſtor therefore ſhould have his eye upon them all, and labour to be acquainted with their natural temperament, and alſo with their occaſions and affairs in the world, and the company that they live or converſe with, that ſo he may know where their temptations lie: and then ſpeedily, prudently and diligently to help them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another part of our work is to comfort the diſconſolate, and to ſettle the Peace of our peoples ſouls, and that on ſure and laſting grounds. To which end, the quality of the Complainants, and the courſe of their lives had need to be known; for all people muſt not have the like Conſolations that have the like complaints. But of this I have ſpoken already elſewhere, and there is ſo much ſaid by many, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> in his Inſtructions for right Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, that I ſhall ſay no more.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The reſt of our Miniſterial work is upon thoſe that are yet ſtrong: For they alſo have need of our aſsiſtance: Partly to prevent their temptations and declinings, and preſerve the grace they have; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to help them for a further progreſs and encreaſe; and partly to direct them in the improving of their ſtrength for the ſervice of Chriſt, and the aſſiſtance of their brethren. As alſo to encourage them, eſpecially the aged, the tempted, and afflicted to hold on, and to perſevere that they may attain the Crown. All theſe are the objects of the Miniſterial

work, and in reſpect to all theſe we muſt <hi>Take heed to all the Flock.</hi> Abundance more diſtributions of our work, with directions how to perform it to rich and poor, young and old, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You may find <hi>in Gregor.

               <p n="4">IV. HAving done with our work in reſpect of its Objects; I am next to ſpeak of the Acts themſelves. But of this I ſhall be very brief. 1. Becauſe they are intimated before. 2. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo fully handled by many. 3. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find I have already run into more tediouſneſs then I intended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One part of our work, and that the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, becauſe it tendeth to work on many, is the publike preaching of the word. A work that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth greater skill, and eſpecially greater life and zeal, then any of us bring to it. It is no ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſtand up in the face of a Congregation, and deliver a Meſſage of ſalvation or damnation, as from the living God, in the name of our Redeemer. It is no eaſie matter to ſpeak ſo plain, that the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may underſtand us, and ſo ſeriouſly, that the deadeſt hearts may feel us; and ſo convincingly, that the contradicting Cavilers may be ſilenced. I know it is a great diſpute whether preaching be proper to the Miniſters or not? The deciſion ſeems not very
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99578:80"/>
difficult. Preaching to a Congregation as their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Teacher, is proper to a Miniſter in office; And Preaching to the unbelieving world (Jews, Mahometans or Pagans) as one that hath given up himſelf to that work, and is ſeparated and ſet apart to it, is proper to a Miniſter in office: But Preaching to a Church or to Infidels, occaſionally, as an act of Charity, extraordinarily, or upon ſpecial call to that act, may be common to others. The Governor of a Church, when he cannot preach himſelf, may in a caſe of neceſſity appoint a private man <hi>pro tempore,</hi> to do it that is able (as Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.) But no private man may obtrude without his conſent, who by office is the Guide and Paſtor of that Church. And a maſter of a family may preach to his own family, and a School-maſter to his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and any man to thoſe whom he is obliged to teach; ſo be it he go not beyond his ability, and do it in a due ſubordination to Church-teaching, and not in a way of oppoſition and diviſion. A man that is not of the trade, may do ſome one act of a trades-man in a Corporation for his own uſe, or his family, or friend; but he may not addict or ſeparate himſelf to it, or ſet it up, and make it his profeſsion, nor live upon it, unleſs he had been Apprentice and were free. For though one man of ten thouſand may do it of himſelf as well as he that hath ſerved an Apprentiſhip, yet it is not to be preſumed that it is ordinarily ſo: And the ſtanding Rule muſt not bend to rarities and extraordinaries, leſt it undo all: For that which is extraordinary and rare in ſuch caſes, the Law doth look upon as a <hi>non ens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the beſt way to ſilence ſuch uſurping Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99578:81"/>
is for thoſe to whom it belongeth, to do it themſelves ſo diligently, that the people may not have need to go a begging; and to do it ſo judiciouſly, and affectingly, that a plain difference may appear between them and uſurpers, and that other mens works may be ſhamed by theirs; and alſo by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of holy lives, and unwearied diligence to high abilities, to keep up the reputation of their ſacred office, that neither Seducers, nor tempted ones may fetch matter of Temptation from our blemiſhes, or neglects. But I ſhall ſay no more of this duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another part of our Paſtoral work is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the holy myſteries, or Seals of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Baptiſm and the Lords Supper. This alſo is claimed by private uſurpers: but I'le not ſtand to diſcuſs their claim. A great fault it is among our ſelves, that ſome are ſo careleſs in the manner, and others do reform that with a total neglect, and others do lay ſuch a ſtreſs on circumſtances, and make them a matter of ſo much contention, even in that ordinance where Union and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſo profeſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another part of our work is to Guide our people, and be as their mouth in the publike prayers of the Church, and the publike praiſes of God: as alſo to bleſs them in the name of the Lord. This ſacerdotal part of the work is not the leaſt, nor to be ſo much thruſt into a corner as by too many of us it is. A great part of Gods ſervice in the Church-Aſſemblies, was wont in all ages of the Church till of late, to conſiſt in Publike Praiſes and Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal acts in holy Communion: and the Lords Day
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99578:81"/>
was ſtill kept as a day of Thankſgiving, in the Hymns and Common rejoycings of the faithful, in ſpecial Commemoration of the work of Redemption, and the happy condition of the Goſpel Church. I am as apprehenſive of the neceſſity of Preaching as ſome others: but yet me thinks, the ſolemn Praiſes of God ſhould take up much more of the Lords day then in moſt places they do. And me thinks, they that are for the magnifying of Goſpel Prviledges, and for a life of love and heavenly joyes, ſhould be of my mind in this; and their worſhip ſhould be Evangelical as well as their Doctrine pretendeth to be.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Another part of the Miniſterial work, is, to have a ſpecial care and over-ſight of each member of the Flock. The parts whereof are theſe that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt labour to be acquainted with the ſtate of all our people as fully as we can; Both to know the perſons, and their inclinations, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, to know what are the ſins that they are moſt in danger of, and what duties they neglect for the matter or manner, and what temptations they are moſt liable to. For if we know not the temperament or diſeaſe, we are like to prove but unſucceſsful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt uſe all the means we can to inſtruct the ignorant in the matters of their ſalvation; by our own moſt plain familiar words; by giving or lending, or otherwiſe helping them to books that are fit for them: by perſwading them to learn Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſms; and thoſe that cannot read, to get help of their neighbours; and to perſwade their neighbours,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99578:82"/>
to afford them help, who have beſt opportunities thereto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt be ready to give advice to thoſe that come to us with caſes of conſcience, eſpecially the great caſe which the Jews put to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Jaylor to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Acts</hi> 16. <hi>What muſt we do to be ſaved?</hi> A Miniſter is not only for Publike Preaching, but to be a known Counſellor for their ſouls, as the Lawyer is for their eſtates, and the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian for their bodies: ſo that each man that is in doubts and ſtraits, ſhould bring his caſe to him and deſire Reſolution. Not that a Miniſter ſhould be troubled with every ſmall matter, which judicious neighbours can give them advice in as well as he, no more then a Lawyer or Phyſitian ſhould be troubled for every trifle or familiar caſe, where others can tell them as much as they: but as when their eſtate or life is in danger they will go to theſe, ſo when their ſouls are in danger they ſhould go to Miniſters: As <hi>Nicodemus</hi> came to Chriſt and as was uſual with the people to go to the Prieſt, whoſe lips muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve knowledge, and at whoſe mouth they muſt ask the Law, becauſe he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts. And becauſe the people are grown unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the office of the Miniſtery, and their own neceſſity and duty herein, it belongeth to us to acquaint them herewith, and to preſs them publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come to us for advice in ſuch caſes of great concernment to their ſouls. We muſt not only be willing of the trouble, but draw it upon our ſelves by inviting them hereto. What abundance of good might we do, could we but bring our people to this? And doubtleſs much might be done in it, if we did
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99578:82"/>
our duties. How few have I ever heard that heartily preſt their people to their duty in this? A ſad caſe; that peoples ſouls ſhould be ſo injured and hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the total neglect of ſo great a duty, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſcarce ever tell them of it, and awaken them to it! were they but duly ſenſible of the need and weight of this, you ſhould have them more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knocking at your doors, and open their caſes to you, and making their ſad complaints, and begging your advice. I beſeech you put them more on this for the future, and perform it carefully when they ſeek your help. To this end its very neceſſary that we be acquainted with Practical Caſes, and ſpecially that we be acquainted with the nature of true Grace, and able to aſsiſt them in trying their ſtates, and reſolve the main queſtion that concerns their everlaſting life or death. One word of ſeaſonable prudent advice given by a Miniſter to perſons in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, hath done that good that many Sermons would not have done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We muſt alſo have a ſpecial eye upon families, to ſee that they be well ordered, and the duties of each relation performed. The life of Religion, and the welfare and glory of Church and State, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much on family Government and duty. If we ſuffer the neglect of this, we undo all. What are we like to do our ſelves to the Reforming of a Congregation, if all the work be caſt on us alone, and Maſters of families will let fall that neceſſary duty of their own, by which they are bound to help us! If any good be begun by the Miniſtery in any ſoul in a family, a careleſs, prayerleſs, worldly fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is like to ſtiffle it, or very much hinder it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99578:83"/>
if you could but get the Rulers of families to do their part, and take up the work where you left it, and help it on, what abundance of good might be done by it? (as I have elſewhere ſhewed more at large) I beſeech you therefore do all that you can to promote this buſineſs, as ever you deſire the true Reformation and welfare of your Pariſhes. To which end let theſe things following be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Get certain information how each family is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and how God is worſhippped in them: that you may know how to proceed in your carefulneſs for their further good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Go now and then among them, when they are like to be moſt at leiſure, and ask the maſter of the family, Whether he pray with them, or read the Scripture, or what he doth? And labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the neglecters of their ſin. And if you can have opportunity, pray with them, before you go, and give them an example, What you would have them do, and how. And get a promiſe of them that they will be more conſcionable therein for the future.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you find any unable to pray in tolerable expreſſions, through ignorance and diſuſe, perſwade them to ſtudy their own wants, and get their hearts affected with them, and ſo go oft to thoſe neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours who uſe to pray, that they may learn: and in the mean time perſwade them to uſe a form of prayer rather then none. Only tell them that it is their ſin and ſhame that they have lived ſo negligently, as to be now ſo unacquainted with their own neceſſities, as not to know how to ſpeak to God in prayer;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99578:83"/>
when every beggar can find words to ask an alms; and therefore tell them that this form i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> but for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as a crutch to a Cripple, while they cannot do as well without it; but they muſt not reſolve to take up there, but to learn to do better as ſoon as they can, ſeeing prayer ſhould come from the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart, and be varied both according to our neceſſities and obſervations. Yet is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to moſt unaccuſtomed ill-bred people, that have not been brought up where prayer hath been uſed, that they begin at firſt with the uſe of a form, becauſe they will elſe be able to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, and in ſenſe of their diſability will wholly neglect the duty, though they deſire to perform it. For many diſuſed perſons can mutter out ſome honeſt requeſts in ſecret, that be not able before others to ſpeak tolerable ſenſe. And I will not be one of them that had rather the duty were wholly neglected, or elſe prophaned and made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, then encourage them to the uſe of a ſorm, either recited by memory, or read.</p>
               <p n="4">4. See that they have ſome profitable moving book (beſides the Bible) in each family: If they have not, perſwade them to buy ſome of ſmall price, and great uſe; ſuch as Mr. <hi>Whateleys</hi> New Birth, and <hi>Dod</hi> on the Commandments; or ſome ſmaller moving Sermons; If they be not able to buy them, give them ſome if you can: if you cannot, get ſome Gentlemen or other rich perſons that are willing to good works, to do it. And engage them to read on it at nights when they have leiſure, and eſpecially on the Lords day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By all means perſwade them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99578:84"/>
all their children to learn to read Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Direct them how to ſpend the Lords day: how to diſpatch their worldly buſineſſes ſo as to prevent encombrances and diſtractions; and when they have been at the Aſſemblie, how to ſpend the time in their families: The life of Religion lieth much on this, becauſe poor people have no other free conſiderable time: and therefore if they loſe this they loſe all, and will remain ignorant and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh. Specially perſwade them to theſe two things. 1. If they cannot repeate the Sermon, or otherwiſe ſpend the time profitably at home, that they take their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily with them, and go to ſome godly neighbour that ſpends i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> better, that by joyning with them, they may have the better help. 2. That the Maſter of the family will every Lords day at night cauſe all his family to repeat the Catechiſm to him, and give him ſome account of what they have learn't in publike that day.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If there be any in the family that are known to be unruly, give the Ruler a ſpecial charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, and make them underſtand what a ſin it is to connive at them and tolerate them.</p>
               <p>Neglect not therefore this neceſſary part of your work: Get maſters of families to their duties, and they will ſpare you a great deal of labour with the reſt, or further much the ſucceſs of your labours. If a Captain can get his Lieutenant, Cornet, and other inferiour officers to do their duties, he may rule the Souldiers with leſs trouble, then if all ſhould lie upon his own hands alone. You are like to ſee no general Reformation, till you procure family Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99578:84"/>
Some little obſcure Religion there may be in here and there one; but while it ſticks in ſingle perſons, and is not promoted by theſe ſocieties, it doth not proſper, nor promiſe much for future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another part of the work of our private Over-ſight conſiſteth in a vigilant oppoſing of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, and ſeeking to prevent the Infection of our Flock, and ſpeedy reclaiming thoſe that begin to itch after ſtrange Teachers, and turn into crooked paths. When we hear of any one that lies under the influence of their temptations, or that is already deceived by them, we muſt ſpeedily with all our skill and diligence make out for their relief. The means I ſhall ſhew in the Directions in the end.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another part of this overſight lieth in the due encouragement of thoſe that are humble, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, obedient Chriſtians, and profit by our teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and are an honour to their Profeſſion: We muſt in the eyes of all the Flock, put ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the reſt by our Praiſes, and more ſpecial ſamiliarity, and other teſtimonies of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and rejoycing over them; that ſo we may both encourage them, and incite others to imitate them. Gods graces are amiable and honourable in all; even in the pooreſt of the Flock, as well as in the Paſtors: and the ſmalleſt degrees muſt be cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and encouraged, but the higheſt more openly honoured and propounded to imitation. They that have ſlighted or vilified the moſt gracious, becauſe they were of the Laity, while they claimed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the honour of their Clergy, though adorned with little or none of that grace, as they ſhewed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99578:85"/>
themſelves to be Proud and Carnal, ſo did they take the next way to debaſe themſelves by ſelf-exaltation, &amp; to bring the office it ſelf into contempt. For if there be no honour due to the Real ſanctity of a Chriſtian, much leſs to the relative ſanctity of a Paſtor: and he that vilifieth the <hi>Perſon,</hi> cannot well plead for the honouring of <hi>Robes</hi> and empty <hi>Titles:</hi> Nor can he expect that his people ſhould give him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Paſtor, if he will not give them the love and honour that is due to Chriſtians and members of Chriſt. As the Orator ſaid to <hi>Domitius, Cur ego te habeam ut principem, cum tu me non habeas ut Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorem.</hi> It was an unchriſtian courſe therefore, which our late Prelates and their Agents took, who diſcountenanced none ſo much as the moſt godly, whom they ſhould have rejoyced in, and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and made them not only the common ſcorn, but alſo the objects of their perſecuting rage, as if they had fed their Flock for the Butcher, and called them out for ſuffering as they came to any maturity. This vilifying and perſecuting the moſt diligent of the Flock, was neither the note of Chriſtian Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, nor the way to be ſo eſteemed. As <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quid de Epiſcopis, qui verberibus timeri vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt, canones dicant, bene fraternitas veſtra novit. Paſtores enim facti ſumus, non percuſſores.

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Another part of our Over-ſight lieth in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſick, and helping them to prepare either
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99578:85"/>
for a fruitful life, or a happy death: Though this be the buſineſs of all our life and theirs, yet doth it at ſuch a ſeaſon require extraordinary care both of them and us. When time is almoſt gone, and they muſt be now or never reconciled to God &amp; poſſeſſed of his grace: O how doth it concern them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem thoſe hours, and lay hold upon eternal life! And when we ſee that we are like to have but a few daies or hours time more to ſpeak to them in order to their endleſs ſtate, What man that is not an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, or a block, would not be with them, and do all that he can for their ſalvation in that ſhort ſpace!</p>
               <p>Will it not waken us to compaſſion to look upon a languiſhing man, and to think that within a few daies his ſoul will be in heaven or hell? Surely it will much try the faith and ſeriouſneſs of Miniſters or others, to be about dying men! and they will have much opportunity to diſcern whether they are themſelves in good ſadneſs about the matters of the life to come. So great is the change that is made by death, that it ſhould awaken us to the greateſt ſenſibility, to ſee a man ſo neer it, and ſhould provoke us in the deepeſt pangs of compaſſion, to do the office of inferiour Angels for the ſoul before it is departed from the fleſh, that it may be ready for the convoy of ſuperiour Angels, to tranſmit it to the prepared glory when it is removed from ſin and miſery. When a man is almoſt at his journeys end, and the next ſtep puts him into heaven or hell, its time for us to help him if we can, while there is hope. As <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, The death of the righteous is <hi>bona propter requiem, melior propter novitatem, opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma propter ſecuritatem: ſed mors peccatorum eſt</hi>

But its ſo far otherwiſe, that death it ſelf is the ſmalleſt matter that they need to care for: <hi>Sed moneudo quo ire Cogantur, ut Auguſt.</hi> Its not the <hi>prima mors quae animam pellit violenter è corpore,</hi> thats the moſt terrible, <hi>ſed ſecunda quae animam nolentem tenet in corpore, in quit Idem.</hi>

               <p>And as their preſent neceſſity ſhould move us to take that opportunity for their good, ſo ſhould the advantage that ſickneſs and the fore-ſight of death affordeth. There are few of the ſtouteſt hearts but will hear us on their death-bed, that ſcorned us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They will then let fall their fury, and be as tame as Lambs, that were before as intractable as waſps or mad men. A man may ſpeak to them then, that could not before. I find not one of ten of the moſt obſtinate ſcornful wretches in the Pariſh, but when they come to dye, will humble themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their fault, and ſeem penitent, and promiſe if they ſhould recover, to do ſo no more. If the very Meditations of death be ſo effectual in the time of health that it is ſaith <hi>Auguſt, quaſi Clavis carnit omnes motus ſuperbiae ligno crucis affigens (l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Doct.

Perhaps you will ſay, that theſe forced changes are not cordial, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have no great hope of doing them any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good. I confeſs that it is very common to be frighted into uneffectual purpoſes, but not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to be at ſuch a ſeaſon converted to fixed reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. And as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non poteſt male mori, qui bene vixerit; &amp; vix bene moritur qui male vixit.</hi> Yet <hi>vix</hi> and <hi>nunquam</hi> be not all one: It ſhould make both them and us the more diligent in the time of health, becauſe it is <hi>vix;</hi> but yet we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir us at the laſt, in the uſe of the laſt remedies, becauſe it is not <hi>nunquam.</hi>

               <p>And it will not be unuſeful to our ſelves to read ſuch Lectures of our own mortality: It is better to go into the houſe of mourning, then into the houſe of feaſting: for it tendeth to make the heart better, when we ſee the end of all the living, and what it is that the world will do for thoſe that ſell their ſalvation for it.

               <p>Becauſe I intend no ſuch thing as a Directory for the whole Miniſterial work, I will not ſtand to tell you particularly what muſt be done for men in that laſt extremity; but only chooſe out theſe three or four things to remember you of, paſſing by all the reſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Stay not till ſtrength and underſtanding be gone, and the time ſo ſhort that you ſcarce know what to do; but go to them as ſoon as you hear that they are ſick (whether they ſend for you or not.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the time is ſo ſhort, that there is no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to endeavour the change of their hearts in that diſtinct way, as is uſual with others, nor to preſs truths upon them in ſuch order, and ſtay the working of it by degrees; we muſt therefore be ſure to ply the main, and dwell upon thoſe truths which muſt do the great work: Shewing them the certainty and glory of the life to come, and the way by which it was purchaſed for us, and the great ſin and folly of their neglecting it in time of health; but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99578:87"/>
yet the poſſibility that remaineth of obtaining it, if they but yet cloſe with it heartily as their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and with the Lord Jeſus as the way thereto, and abhorring themſelves for their former evil, can now unfeignedly reſign up themſelves to him to be juſtified, ſanctified, ruled and ſaved by him. Three things muſt be chiefly inſiſted on.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The End: The Certainty and Greatneſs of the Glory of the Saints in the preſence of God: that ſo their hearts may be ſet upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſufficiency and neceſſity of the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by Jeſus Chriſt; and the fulneſs of the Spirit, which we may and muſt be made partakers of: This is the principal way to the end; and the neerer end it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Neceſſity and Nature of faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reſolutions for New Obedience according as there ſhall be opportunity. This is the ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient way, or the means that on our part muſt be performed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Labour, upon Conviction and Deliberation, to engage them by ſolemn promiſe to Chriſt, and new obedience according to their opportunity: ſpecially if you ſee any likelyhood of their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If they do recover, be ſure to mind them of their promiſes. Go to them purpoſely to ſet it home, and reduce them into performance. And when ever after you ſee them remiſs, go to them then, and mind them what they formerly ſaid. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of ſuch uſe to them that recover (and hath been a means of the converſion of many a ſoul) it is very neceſſary that you go to them whoſe ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99578:88"/>
is not mortal, as well as to them that are neerer death: that ſo we may have ſome advantage to move them to repentance, and engage them to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life; and may afterward have this to plead againſt their ſins: As a Biſhop of <hi>Colen</hi> is ſaid by <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> to have anſwered the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> when he askt him, What was the way to be ſaved; that <hi>he muſt be what he purpoſed or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be, when he was laſt troubled with the ſtone and the gout;</hi> So may we hereafter anſwer theſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another part of our Miniſterial Overſight conſiſteth in the right comforting the conſciences of the troubled, &amp; ſetling our people in a well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed peace. But this I have ſpoken of elſewhere, and others have done it more at large.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Another part of this Overſight, is, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and admoniſhing thoſe that live offenſively or impenitently, and receiving the information of thoſe that have admoniſhed them more privately in vain. Before we bring ſuch matters to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or to a Repreſentative Church, it is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily moſt fit for the Miniſter to try himſelf what he can do more privately to bow the ſinner to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, eſpecally if it be not a publike crime. A great deal of skill is here required, and difference muſt be made according, to the various tempers of offenders; but with the moſt it will be neceſſary to fall on with the greateſt plainneſs and power, to ſhake their careleſs hearts, and make them ſee what it is to dally with ſin; to let them know the evil of it, and its ſad effects, and the unkindneſs, unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, unprofitableneſs, and other aggravations; and what it is that they do againſt God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99578:88"/>
For the manner, the following directions may be hither applyed.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The next part of our Overſight conſiſteth in the uſe of Church-Diſcipline: and this conſiſteth after the foreſaid private Reproofs. 1. In more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Reproof. 2. And perſwading the perſon to meet expreſſions of Repentance. 3. And Praying for them. 4. In reſtoring the Penitent. 5. And exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and avoiding the impenitent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And for Reproof, theſe things muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. 1. That the Accuſations of none (no not the beſt in the Church) be taken without proof, nor raſhly entertained, nor that a Miniſter ſhould make himſelf a party, before he have a ſufficient evidence of the caſe. It is better let many vicious perſons go unpuniſhed, or uncenſured when we want full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then to cenſure one unjuſtly; which we may eaſily do if we will go upon too bold preſumptions: and then it will bring upon the Paſtors the ſcandal of partiality, and unrighteous and injurious dealing, and make all their reproofs and cenſures become contemptible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let there be therefore a leſs publike meeting of choſen perſons (the Officers and ſome Delegates of the Church on their behalf) to have the hearing of all ſuch caſes before they be made more publike: that once a moneth at a ſet place, they may come together, to receive what charge ſhall be brought againſt any member of the Church, that it may be conſidered whether it be juſt and the offender may be dealt with then firſt: And if the fault be either leſs publike, or leſs hainous, ſo that a leſs publike profeſsion of Repentance may ſatisfie, then if the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99578:89"/>
party ſhall there profeſs Repentance, it may ſuffice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if it be not ſo, or if the party remain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, he muſt be reproved before all, and there again invited to Repentance. This duty is never the leſs, becauſe our Brethren have made ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Practice of it; It is not only Chriſts command to tell the Church, but <hi>Pauls</hi> to <hi>rebuke ſuch before all,</hi> and the Church hath conſtantly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed it, till ſelfiſhneſs and formality cauſed them to be remiſs in this and other duties together, and the Reformers have as much ſtood up for it as the reſt; and as deeply are we engaged by Vows, Covenants, Prayers and other means, for the execution of it, (of which more in the Application) <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quae peecantur coram omnibus, coram omnibus corripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endae ſunt, ut omnes timeant: Qui ſecreto peccant in te, ſecreto corripe; nam ſi ſolus noſti, &amp; eum vis coram aliis arguere, non es corrector ſed proditor.</hi> Greg. <hi>Mag. in Regiſtro</hi> ſaith, <hi>Manifeſta peccata non ſunt occulta correctione purganda: ſed palam ſunt arguendi qui palam nocent; ut dum aperta objurgatione ſanantur, hi qui eos imitando deliquerant, corrigantur. Dum enim unus corripitur, plurimi emendantur; &amp; melius eſt ut pro multorum ſalute unus condemnetur, quam ut per unius licentiam multi periclitentur. Iſidore</hi> ſaith, <hi>Qui admonitus ſecrete de peccato corrigi negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, publice arguendus eſt, ut vulnus quod occulte ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari neſcit, manifeſte debeat emendari.</hi> If any ſhall ſay, that we ſhall thus be guilty of defaming men by publiſhing their crimes; I anſwer in the words of <hi>Bernard ſup. Cantic. Cum carpuntur vitia, &amp; inde ſcandalum oritur, ipſe ſibi ſcandali cauſa eſt, qui fecit</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:99578:89"/>
                  <hi>quod argui debet; non ille qui arguit. Non ergo ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meas contra charitatem eſſe, ſi unius ſcandalum mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum recompenſaveris pace. Melius eſt enim ut pereat unus quam unitas.</hi> There is no room for a doubt, whether this be our duty, nor any to doubt whether we are unfaithful as to the performance of it. I doubt many of us that would be aſhamed to omit preaching or praying half ſo much, have little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what we do in living in the willful neglect of this duty, and the reſt of Diſcipline ſo long as we have done. We little think how we have drawn the guilt of ſwearing, and drunkenneſs, and fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and other crimes upon our own heads, for want of uſing Gods means for the cure of them. As <hi>Gregor. M.</hi> ſaith <hi>in Reg. Qui non corrigit roſecanda, committit: &amp; facientis culpam habet, qui quod poteſt corrigere, negligit emendare,</hi> ſaith the Comedian. <hi>Si quid me ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is feciſſe inſcite aut improbe, ſi id non accuſas, tuipſe objurgandus es.</hi> Plaut.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, There is little likelyhood that publike perſonal reprehenſion ſhould do good on them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will be but enraged by the ſhame; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Philo</hi> a Jew could ſay, <hi>(de Sacrif.</hi> Abel <hi>&amp;</hi> Cain) <hi>We muſt endeavour as far as we are able to ſave thoſe from their ſins that ſhall certainly periſh; imitating good Phyſitians, who when they cannot ſave a ſick man, do yet willingly try all means for cure, leaſt they ſeem to want ſucceſs through their own neglects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I further anſwer, It ill beſeems the ſilly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to implead the Ordinances of God as uſeleſs, or to reproach his ſervice inſtead of doing it, and ſet
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99578:90"/>
their wits againſt their Maker. God can make uſe of his own Ordinances, or elſe he would never have appointed them</p>
               <p n="3">3. The uſefulneſs of this Diſcipline is apparent, to the ſhaming of ſin, and humbling of the ſinner; and manifeſting the holineſs of Chriſt, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Church before all the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What would you have done with ſuch ſinners? give them up as hopeleſs? that were too cruel. Would you uſe other means why it is ſuppoſed that all other have been uſed without ſucceſs; for this is the laſt remedy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Church of Chriſt hath found reaſon enough to uſe this courſe, even in times of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when our carnal reaſon would have told them, that they ſhould then above all have forborn it, for fear of driving away all their converts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The principal uſe of this publike Diſcipline, is not for the offendor himſelf, but for the Church. It tendeth exceedingly to deter others from the like crimes, and ſo to keep pure the Congregations and their worſhip. <hi>Seneca</hi> could ſay, <hi>Vitia tranſmitit ad poſteros, qui praeſentibus culpis ignoſcit.</hi> And elſewhere. <hi>Bonis nocet, qui malis parcit.</hi> If you ſay, that It will but reſtrain them as hypocrites, and not convert them. I anſwer, 1. As I ſaid, it may preſerve others. 2. Who knows how God may bleſs his Ordinance, even to them? 3. The reſtraint of ſin, is a benefit not to be contemned. <hi>Audebo peccanti mala ſun oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere: vitia ejus ſi non excidero, inhibebo. Non deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; ſed intermittent: fortaſſe autem deſinent, ſi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittendi conſuetudinem fecerint,</hi> ſaid the Moraliſt. <hi>Sen. Epiſt.</hi> 40. The ſcorns that I have heard from
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99578:90"/>
many againſt the Scottiſh Miniſters, for bringing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors to the ſtool of Repentance, (as if it were meer formality and hypocriſie, to take ſuch a thing as ſatisfactory, when true Repentance is abſent) hath diſcovered more of the accuſers error then of theirs. For no doubt, it is true Repentance that they exhort men to; and it is true Repentance which offendors do profeſs: and whether they truly profeſs it, who can tell but God? It is not nothing that ſin is brought to ſo much diſgrace, and the Church doth ſo far acquit themſelves of it. (But of this next.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next, To the duty of Publike Reproof, muſt be joyned an exhortation of the perſon to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to the Publike Profeſſion of it for the ſatisfaction of the Church. For as the Church is bound to avoid Communion with impenitent ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinners, ſo when they have had the Evidence of their ſin, they muſt ſee ſome Evidence of their Repentance; for we cannot know them to be peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent without Evidence. And what Evidence is the Church capable of, but their Profeſſion of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance firſt, and their actual reformation afterwards? both which muſt be expected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To theſe may moſt fitly be adjoyned the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayers of the Church, and that both for the Reproved before they are Rejected, and for the Rejected (ſome of them at leaſt) that they may repent and be reſtored: but we are now upon the former. Though this is not expreſly affixed to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, yet we have ſufficient diſcovery of Gods will concerning it in the general precepts: We are commanded to <hi>pray alway,</hi> and in <hi>all things,</hi> and for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99578:91"/>
                  <hi>all men,</hi> and <hi>in all places,</hi> and <hi>all things</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified by it.</hi> It is plain therefore that ſo great a buſineſs as this ſhould not be done without it! And who can have any juſt reaſon to be offended with us, if we pray to God for the changing of their hearts, and the pardon of their ſins. It is therefore in my Judgement a very laudable courſe of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that uſe for the three next daies together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Congregation to joyn in earneſt prayer to God for the opening of the ſinners eyes, and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his heart, and ſaving him from impenitency and eternal death! And though we have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs direction in Scripture juſt how long we ſhall ſtay to try whether the ſinner be ſo impenitent as to be neceſſarily excluded, yet we muſt follow the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral directions, with ſuch diverſity as the caſe and quality of the perſon and former proceeding ſhall require, it being left to the diſcretion of the Church, who are in general to ſtay ſo long till the perſon manifeſt himſelf obſtinate in his ſin: not but that a temporal excluſion (called ſuſpenſion) may oft be inflicted in the mean time; but before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to an excluſion <hi>à ſtatu,</hi> it is very meet (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily) that three daies prayer for him, and patience towards him ſhould antecede.</p>
               <p>And indeed I ſee no reaſon but this courſe ſhould be much more frequent then it is; and that not only upon thoſe that are members of our ſpecial charge, and do conſent to Diſcipline, but even to thoſe that deny our Paſtoral overſight and Diſcipline, and yet are our ordinary hearers. For ſo far as men have Chriſtian Communion or familiarity with us, ſo far are they capable of being excluded from Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99578:91"/>
Though the members of our ſpecial charge have fuller and more ſpecial Communion, and ſo are more capable of a fuller and more ſpecial excluſion; yet all thoſe that dwell among us, and are our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hearers, have ſome Communion. For as they converſe with us, ſo they hear the word, not as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but as Chriſtians, and members of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church into which they are baptized. And they joyn with us in publike prayers and praiſes in the celebration of the Lords day. From this therefore they are capable of being excluded, or from part of this, at leaſt. Morally, if not Locally! For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>avoiding,</hi> and <hi>withdrawing from</hi> and <hi>not eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with</hi> ſuch, is not reſtrained to the members of a Governed Church, but extended to all Chriſtians that are capable of Communion.</p>
               <p>When theſe ungodly perſons are ſick, we have daily bills from them to requeſt the prayers of the Congregation: And if we muſt pray for them againſt ſickneſs and temporal death; I know no reaſon but we ſhould much more earneſtly pray for them againſt ſin and eternal death. That we have not their conſent, is no diſſwaſive: For that is their diſeaſe, and the very venom and malignity of it; and we do not take it to be ſober arguing to ſay, I may not pray for ſuch a man againſt his ſickneſs, becauſe he is ſick: Or, if he were not ſick, I would pray againſt his ſickneſs. No more is it to ſay, If he were not impenitent ſo as to refuſe our prayers, I would pray that he might be ſaved from his impenitency. I confeſs I do not take my ſelf to have ſo ſtrict a charge over this ſort of men, that renounce my overſight, as I do over the reſt that own it; and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99578:92"/>
thats the reaſon why I have called no more of them to publike Repentance, becauſe it requireth moſt commonly more time to examine the matter of fact, or to deal with the perſon firſt more privately, that his impenitenc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be diſcerned, then I can poſſibly ſpare from the duties which I owe to my ſpecial charge, to whom I am more indebted; and therefore may ordinarily expend no more on the reſt (who are to me but as ſtrangers, or men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pariſh, and of no governed particular Church) then I can ſpare when I have done my main duty to my own Flock. But yet though I cannot uſe any ſuch diſcipline on all that ſort, nor am ſo much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do it, yet ſome of them that are moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and openly wicked, where leſs proof and ſhorter debates are requiſite, I intend to deal thus with hereafter, having found ſome ſucceſs in that kind already. But ſpecially to all thoſe whom we take for Members of that particular Church which we are Paſtors of; there is no queſtion but this is our duty. And therefore where the whole Pariſh are members, Diſcipline muſt be exerciſed on the whole.</p>
               <p>I confeſs much prudence is to be exerciſed in ſuch proceedings, leaſt we do more hurt then good; but it muſt be ſuch Chriſtian prudence as ordereth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſuteth them to their ends, and not ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal prudence as ſhall enervate or exclude them. It may be fit therefore for younger Miniſters to conſult with others, for the more cautelous proceeding in ſuch works. And in the performance of it, we ſhould deal humbly, even when we deal moſt ſharply, and make it appear that it is not from any contending,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99578:92"/>
or Lordly diſpoſition, nor an act of revenge for any injury but a neceſſary duty which we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably avoid: And therefore it will be meet that we diſclaim all ſuch animoſities, and ſhew the people the commands of God obliging us to what we do.</p>
               <p>E. G. <hi>Neighbours and Brethren, ſin is ſo hateful an evil in the eyes of the moſt holy God, how light ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever impenitent ſinners make of it, that he hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the everlaſting torments of Hell for the puniſhment of it; and no leſſer means can prevent that puniſhment then the Sacrifice of the blood of the Son of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to thoſe that truly Repent of it and forſake it; and therefore God that calleth all men to Repentance, hath commanded us to exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, leaſt any be hardened through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> Heb. 3. 13. <hi>and that we do not hate our Brother in our heart, but in any wiſe rebuke our neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him,</hi> Lev. 19. 17. <hi>and that if our brother offend us, we ſhould tell him his fault between him and us; and if he hear not, take two or three; and if he hear not them, tell the Church; and if he hear not the Church, he muſt be to us as a heathen or a Publican,</hi> Mat. 18. 17. <hi>and thoſe that ſin, we muſt rebuke before all, that others may fear,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 20. <hi>and rebuke with all authority,</hi> Tit. 1. 15. <hi>Yea were it an Apoſtle of Chriſt that ſhould openly ſin, he muſt be openly reproved, as</hi> Paul <hi>did</hi> Peter, (Gal. 2. 11, 14.) <hi>and if they repent not, we muſt avoid them, and with ſuch not ſo much as eat,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3. 6, 12, 14. 1 Cor. 5. 11, 13. <hi>According to theſe commands of the Lord, having heard of the ſcandalous practice of</hi> N. N. <hi>of this Church (or Pariſh) and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:99578:93"/>
                  <hi>ſufficient proof that he hath committed the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſin of—We have ſeriouſly dealt with him to bring him to repentance; but, to the grief of our hearts, do perceive no ſatisfactory ſucceſs of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; but he ſeemeth ſtill to remain impenitent (or, ſtill liveth in the ſame ſin, though he verbally profeſs repentance.) We do therefore judge it our neceſſary duty, to proceed to the uſe of that further remedy which Chriſt hath commanded us to try; and hence we deſire him in the Name of the Lord without any further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to lay by his obſtinacy againſt the Lord, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his rebuke, and will, and to lay to heart the greatneſs of his ſin, the wrong he hath done to Chriſt and to himſelf, and the ſcandal and grief that he hath cauſed to others; and how unable he is to contend with the Almighty, and prevail againſt the Holy God, who to the impenitent is a conſuming fire! or to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his burning indignation! And I do earneſtly beſeech him for the ſake of his own ſoul, that he will but ſoberly conſider, What it is that he can gain by his ſin or impenitency, and whether it will pay for the loſs of everlaſting life? and how he thinks to ſtand before God in Iudgement, or to appear before the Lord Jeſus one of theſe daies, when death ſhall ſnatch his ſoul from his body, if he be found in this impenitent ſtate; when the Lord Jeſus himſelf in whoſe blood they pretend to truſt, hath told ſuch with his own mouth, that except they repent they ſhall all periſh,</hi> Luk. 13. 3, 5. <hi>And I do beſeech him for the ſake of his own ſoul, and require him as a Meſſenger of Ieſus Chriſt, as he will anſwer the contrary at the Bar of God, that he lay by the ſtoutneſs and impenitency of his heart, and unfeignedly confeſs and lament his ſin before God and this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation!</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:99578:93"/>
                  <hi>And this deſire I here publiſh, not out of any ill will to his perſon, as the Lord knoweth, but in love to his ſoul, and in obedience to Chriſt that hath made it my duty; deſiring that if it be poſſible, that he may be ſaved from his ſin, and from the power of Satan, and from the everlaſting burning wrath of God, and may be reconciled to God, and to his Church, and therefore that he may be humbled by true contrition, before he be humbled by remedileſs condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus or to this purpoſe I conceive our publike admonition ſhould proceed: And in ſome caſes where the ſinner taketh his ſin to be ſmall, the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of it will be neceſſary, and ſpecially the citing of ſome texts of Scripture that do aggravate and threaten it.</p>
               <p>And in caſe he either will not be preſent, that ſuch admonition may be given him, or will not be brought to a diſcovery of Repentance (and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the prayers of the Congregation for him) it will be meet that with ſuch a preface as this afore expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, we deſire the prayers of the Congregation for him our ſelves; That the people would conſider what a fearful condition the impenitent are in, and have pitty on a poor ſoul that is ſo blinded and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by ſin and Satan that he cannot pitty himſelf; and think what it is for a man to appear before the living God in ſuch a caſe, and therefore that they would joyn in earneſt prayer to God, that he would open his eyes, and ſoften and humble his ſtubborn heart, before he be in hell beyond remedy: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly let us be very earneſt in prayer for them, that the Congregation may be provoked affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to joyn with us; and who knows but God
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99578:94"/>
may hear ſuch prayers, and the ſinners heart may more relent, then our own exhortation could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it to do. However, the people will perceive that we make not light of ſin, and preach not to them in meer cuſtom or formality. If Miniſters would be conſcionable in thus carrying on the work of God entirely and ſelf-denyingly, they might make ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, and expect a fuller bleſsing: But when we will ſhrink from all that is dangerous or ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſhift off all that is coſtly or troubleſom, they cannot expect that any great matter ſhould be done by ſuch a carnal partial uſe of means: and though ſome may be here and there called home to God, yet we cannot look that the Goſpel ſhould prevail, and run, and be glorified, where it is ſo lamely and defectively carryed on.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When a ſinner is thus Admoniſhed and Prayed for, if it pleaſe the Lord to open his eyes and give him remorſe, before we proceed to any further cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it is our next duty to proceed to his full recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where theſe things muſt be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we do not either diſcourage him by too much ſeverity, nor yet by too much facility and levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty make nothing of Diſcipline, nor help him to any ſaving cure, but meerly ſlubber and palliate it over. If therefore he have ſinned ſcandalouſly but once, if his Repentance ſeem deep and ſerious, we may in ſome caſes Reſtore him at that time; that is, If the wound that he hath given us to the credit of the Church be not ſo deep as to require more ado for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or the ſin ſo hainous as may cauſe us to delay. But if it be ſo, or if he have lived long in the ſin, it is moſt meet that he do wait in Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99578:94"/>
a convenient time before he be Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And when the time comes (whether at the firſt confeſſion, or after) it is meet that we urge him to be ſerious in his humiliation, and ſet it home up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his conſcience till he ſeem to be truly ſenſible of his ſin; For it is not a vain formality, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and ſaving of a ſoul that we expect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt ſee that he beg the Communion of the Church, and their prayers to God for his Pardon and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And that he Promiſe to fly from ſuch ſins for the time to come, and watch more narrowly, and walk more warily.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And then we have theſe things more to do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To aſſure him of the riches of Gods love, and the ſufficiency of Chriſts blood to pardon his ſins, and that if his Repentance be ſincere, the Lord doth pardon him, of which we are authorized as his Meſſengers to aſſure him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To charge him to perſevere and perform his promiſes, and avoid temptations, and continue to beg mercy and ſtrengthening grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To charge the Church that they imitate Chriſt in forgiving, and retain (or if he were caſt out, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) the Penitent perſon in their Communion, &amp; that they never reproach him with his ſins, or caſt them in his teeth, but forgive and forget them as Chriſt doth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And then to give God thanks for his recovery ſo far, and to pray for his confirmation, and future preſervation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The next part of Diſcipline, is the Rejecting
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99578:95"/>
and Removing from the Churches Communion, thoſe that after ſufficient tryaldo remain impenitent. Where note.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if a man have ſinned but once (ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly) or twice, it is but a Profeſſion of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that we can expect for our ſatisfaction; but if he be accuſtomed to ſin, or have oft broke ſuch Promiſes, then it is an actual reformation that we muſt expect. And therefore he that will refuſe either of theſe, to Reform, or to Profeſs and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Repentance, is to be taken by us as living in the ſin: For a hainous ſin, but once committed, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally continued in till it be Repented of; and a bare forbearing of the act is not ſufficient.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet have we no warrant to rip up matters that are worn out of the publike memory, and ſo to make that publike again that is ceaſed to be publike: at leaſt in ordinary caſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Excluſion from Church-Communion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Excommunication, is of divers ſorts or degrees, more then two or three, which are not to be confounded; of which, I will not ſo far digreſs as here to treat.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That which is moſt commonly to be practiſed among us, is, Only to remove an impenitent ſinner from our Communion, till it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to give him Repentance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In this Excluſion or Removal, the Miniſter or Governors of that Church are Authoritatively to charge the people in the name of the Lord to avoid Communion with him: and to pronounce him one, whoſe Communion the Church is bound to avoid: and the Peoples duty is Obedientially to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99578:95"/>
avoid him, in caſe the Paſtors charge contradict not the word of God. So that he hath the Guiding or Governing Power; and they have, 1. A diſcerning power, whether his charge be juſt. 2. And an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power; For its they that muſt execute the ſentence in part, by avoiding the Rejected, as he himſelf muſt execute it by denying him thoſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Priviledges not due to him, whereof he is the Adminiſtrator.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is very convenient to pray for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and reſtauration, even of the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And if God ſhall give them Repentance, they are gladly to be received into the Communion of the Church again: Of the manner of all theſe I ſhall ſay no more, they being things that have ſo much ſaid of them already. And for the manner of other particular duties, of which I have ſaid little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, you have much already, as in other writings, ſo in the Directory of the late Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie.</p>
               <p>Would we were but ſo far faithful in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this Diſcipline, as we are ſatisfied both of the matter and manner: and did not diſpraiſe and reproach it by our negligence, while we write and plead for it with the higheſt commendations. It is worthy our conſideration, Who is like to have the heavyer charge about this matter at the Bar of God? Whether thoſe deluded ones that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached and hindred diſcipline by their tongues, becauſe they knew not its nature and neceſſity; or we that have ſo vilified it by our conſtant omiſſion, while with our tongues we have magnified it? If
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99578:96"/>
hypocriſie be no ſin, or if the knowledge of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will be no aggravation of the evil of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then we are in a better caſe then they. I will not adviſe the zealous maintainers, and obſtinate neglecters and rejecters of Diſcipline, to unſay all that they have ſaid, till they are ready to do as they ſay, nor to recant their defences of Diſcipline, till they mean to practice it, nor to burn all the Books that they have written for it, and all the Records of their coſt and hazzards for it, leaſt they riſe up in Judgement againſt them to their confuſion; not that they recant their condemnation of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in this, till they mean a little further to outgo them: But I would perſwade them without any more delay, to conform their Practices to theſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies which they have given, leſt the more they are proved to have commended Diſcipline, the more they are proved to have condemned themſelves for neglecting it.</p>
               <p>I have often marvailed that the ſame men who have been much offended at the Books that have been written for Free Admiſsion to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or for mixt Communion in that one part, have been no more offended at as Free permiſſion in a Church ſtate, and as Free admiſſion to other parts of Communion; and that they have made ſo ſmall a matter at as much mixture in all the reſt: I ſhould think that it is a greater profanation to permit an obſtinate ſcandalous ſinner, to be a ſtated member of that particular Church, without any private (firſt) and then publike Admonition, Prayer for him, or cenſure of him; then for a ſingle Paſtor to admit him to the Lords Supper, if he had no power to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99578:96"/>
cenſure him, as theſe ſuppoſe. I ſhould think that the faithful Practice of Diſcipline in the other parts, would ſoon put an end to the Controverſie about Free Admiſſion to the Lords Supper, and heal the hurt that ſuch Diſcourſes have done to the rebellions of our people. For thoſe Diſcourſes have more modeſty then to plead for a Free Admiſſion of the Cenſured or Rejected ones; but its only of thoſe that have yet their ſtanding in that Church, and are not cenſured. And if when they forfeit their title to Church-Communion, we would deal with them in Chriſts appointed way, till we had either reclaimed them to Repentance, or cenſured them to be Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would be paſt controverſie then that they were not to be admitted to that one act of Communion in the Supper, who are juſtly excluded from the whole. But as long as we leave them uncenſured members, and tell a ſingle Paſtor that he hath no power to cenſure them, we tempt him to think that he hath no power then to deny them that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the body, which is the common priviledge of uncenſured members.</p>
               <p>And as we thus our ſelves oppoſe Diſcipline by Parts, or cheriſh Church-corruption by parts, one party being for the Free admiſsion of them, while Members, to the Sacraments, and the other as Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Permitting them in Church-State, and other parts of Communion, while they exclude them from the Sacrament; ſo ſome have learned to tye theſe ends together, and by holding both, to ſet open the doors of Church and Chancel, and pluck up the hedge, and lay the Vine-yard common to the Wilderneſs. It hath ſomewhat amazed me to hear ſome that I
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99578:97"/>
took for Reverend godly Divines, to reproach as a Sect, the Sacramentarians and Diſciplinarians! and when I deſired to know whom they meant, they tell me, they mean them that will not give the Sacrament to all the Pariſh, and them that will make diſtinction by their Diſcipline. I had thought the Tempter had obtained a great victory if he had but got one god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paſtor of a Church to neglect Diſcipline, as well as if he had got him to neglect Preaching: Much more if he had got him to approve of that neglect; but it ſeems he hath got ſome to ſcorn at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of the duty which they neglect. As the impure were wont to reproach the diligent by the name of Puritans: ſo do theſe reproach the faithful Paſtors by the name of Diſciplinarians. And I could wiſh they would remember what the antient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches were both Symptomatically and Effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and accordingly Judge impartially of themſelves, and fear a participation of the Judgement that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell them. Sure I am, if it were well underſtood, how much of the Paſtoral authority and work, conſiſteth in Church Guidance, it would be alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that to be againſt Diſcipline is <hi>tantum non</hi> to be againſt the Miniſtery: and to be againſt the Miniſtery, is <hi>tantum non</hi> to be abſolutely againſt the Church; and to be againſt the Church is neer to being abſolutely againſt Chriſt. Blame not the harſhneſs of the inference, till you can avoid it, and free your ſelves from the charge of it before the Lord. Prelates would have ſome Diſcipline; and other parties would have ſome. Yea Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would have ſome, and plead only againſt others about the form and manner of it. But theſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99578:97"/>
are ſo much worſe then all, that they would have none. Was not Chriſt himſelf the leader of theſe Diſciplinarians who inſtituted Diſcipline, and made his Miniſters the Rulers or Guides of his Church, and put the Keyes of the Kingdom into their hand, and commanded the very particular acts of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and requireth the people to ſubmit to them, and obey them in the Lord? What would theſe men have ſaid, if they had ſeen the Practice of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church for many hundred years after Chriſt, who exerciſed a Diſcipline ſo much more rigorous, then any among us do, and that even in the heat of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then perſecutions? as if they read but the antient Canons, and <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epiſtles, they may ſoon ſee, though they look no further. And it was not then (no nor after under Chriſtian Magiſtrates) taken to be a uſeleſs thing; nor would it appear ſuch now, if it were ſhewed in its ſtrength and beauty by a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Practice: For its a thing that is not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally manifeſted to the ear, but to the eye: and you will never, make men know well what it is by meer talking of it; till they ſee it they will be ſtrangers to it: As it is in the military act, or in Navigation, or in the Government of Common-wealths, which are ſo little known till learned by experience. And that will tell us that, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Diſciplina eſt cuſtos ſpei, retinaculum fidei, dux itineris ſalutaris, fomes ac nutrimentum bonae indolis, magiſtra virtutis; facit in Chriſto manere ſemper, ac jugiter Deo vivere, ad promiſſa coeleſtia &amp; divina praemia pervenire: Hanc &amp; ſectari ſalubre eſt, &amp; averſari ac negliger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So much of the Acts of Paſtoral Overſight.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, we may ſee that the Paſtoral office is another kind of thing then thoſe men have taken it to be, who think that it conſiſteth in preaching and adminiſtering Sacraments only; much more then they have taken for, that think it conſiſteth in making of new Laws or Canons to bind the Church: As if God had not made us Laws ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; and as if he had committed the proper Legiſlative power over his Church to Miniſters or Biſhops? whoſe office is but to expound, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and execute in their places the Laws of Chriſt.</p>

Canons. 2. And they may and ought to Agree among themſelves for an unanimous performance of their duties, when they have diſcovered it; that ſo they may excite one another, and be more ſtrong and ſucceſsful in their work. 3. And they muſt determine of the Circumſtances of worſhip in ſpecial, which God hath only determined in General, (as what time, and place they ſhall meet in, what Chapter read, what Text preacht on, what ſhape the Table, Cups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be; where the Pulpit, when each perſon ſhall come to be catechized or inſtructed, and whither, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> But theſe are actions that are fitter to be ordered by them that are in the place, then by diſtant Canon-makers: And to Agree for unity in a neceſſary duty (as we have done) is not to make Laws, or arrogate Authority over our Brethren.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ſpoken of the matter of our work, we are next to ſpeak a little of the manner; not of each part diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leaſt we be too tedious, but of the whole in general: But ſpecially refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the principal part.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Miniſterial work muſt be managed Pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for God and the ſalvation of the people, and not for any private ends of our own. This is our ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it. A wrong end makes all the work bad, as from us, how good ſoever in it ſelf. Its not a ſerving God, but our ſelves, if we do it not for God, but for our ſelves. They that ſet upon this as a common work, to make a trade of it for their worldly lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, will find that they have choſen a bad trade, though a good imployment. Self-denyal is of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity in every Chriſtian, but of a double neceſſity in a Miniſter, as he hath a double Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or Dedication to God. And without ſelf-denyal he cannot do God an hours faithful ſervice.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99578:100"/>
Hard ſtudies, much knowledge, and excellent preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is but a more glorious hypocritical ſinning, if the ends be not right. The ſaying of <hi>Bernard, Serm. in Cant.</hi> 26. is commonly known. <hi>Sunt qui ſcire vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt co ſine tantum ut ſciant, &amp; turpis curioſitas eſt: &amp; ſunt qui ſcire volunt, ut ſcientiam ſuam vendant; &amp; turpis quaeſt us eſt: ſunt qui ſcire volunt ut ſciantur ipſi: &amp; turpis vanitas eſt: Sed ſunt quoque qui ſcire volunt ut adificent; &amp; Charitas eſt; &amp; ſunt qui ſcire volunt ut aedificentur; &amp; prudentia eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This work muſt be managed Laboriouſly and Diligently: as being of ſuch unſpeakable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to others and our ſelves. We are ſeeking to uphold the world, to ſave it from the curſe of God, to perfect the Creation, to attain the ends of Chriſts Redemption, to ſave our ſelves and others from Damnation, to overcome the Devil, and demoliſh his Kingdom, and to ſet up the Kingdom of Chriſt, and attain and help others to the Kingdom of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And are theſe works to be done with a careleſs mind, or a lazy hand? O ſee then that this work be done with all your might. Study hard, for the well is deep, and our brains are ſhallow; and (as <hi>Caſſiod.) Decorum hic eſt terminum non habere: hic honeſta probatur ambitio; Omne fi quidem ſcientificum quanto profundius quaeritur, tanto glorioſius invenitur.</hi> But eſpecially be laborious in Practice and exerciſe of your knowledge. Let <hi>Pauls</hi> words ring in your ears continually, <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon me, and woe unto me if I preach not the Goſpel.</hi> Still think with your ſelves, what lyeth upon your hands. <hi>If I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir me, Satan may prevail, and the people everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſh, and their blood be required at my hand.</hi> And
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99578:100"/>
by avoiding Labour and Suffering, I ſhall draw on me a thouſand times more then I avoid: for as <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Qui in labore hominum non ſunt, in labore profecto Daemonum erunt,</hi> Whereas by preſent Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence you prepare for future bleſſedneſs. For, as <hi>Gregor. in Mor.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quot labores veritati nunc ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibes, tot etiam remunerationis pignora intra ſpei tuae cubiculum clauſum tenes.</hi> No man was ever a loſer by God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This work muſt be carried on Prudent'y, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and by Degrees; Milk muſt go before ſtrong meat: The foundation muſt be firſt laid before we build upon it. Children muſt not be dealt with as men at age. Men muſt be brought into a ſtate of Grace, before we can expect from them the works of Grace. The work of Converſion and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead works, and faith in Chriſt muſt be firſt, and frequently, and throughly taught. The Stewards of Gods houſhold muſt give to each their portion in due ſeaſon. We muſt not go beyond the capacities of our people ordinarily, nor teach them the perfection, that have not learned the principles. As <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſaith, <hi>li.</hi> 12. <hi>de Civit. Si pro viribus ſuis alatur infans, fiet ut creſcendo plus capiat: ſi modum ſuae capacitatis excedat, deſicit antequam creſcat.</hi> And as <hi>Gregor. Nyſen.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Orat, de Pauper. amand. As we teach not inſants the deep precepts of ſcience, but firſt letters, and then ſyllables,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So alſo the Guides of the Church do firſt propound to their hearers certain documents, which are as the elements, and ſo by degrees do open to them the more perfect and myſterious matters.</hi> Therefore did the Church take ſo much pains with their <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> before they baptized them, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99578:101"/>
would not lay unpoliſhed ſtones into the building; as <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hom.</hi> 40. <hi>Imperfect. operis</hi> (or who ever elſe it be) <hi>p. (mihi)</hi> 318. <hi>Aedificatores ſunt Sacerdotes, qui—domum Dei compon unt ſicut enim adificatores, nodoſos lapides &amp; habentes torturas, ferro dolant, poſtea vero ponunt eos in aedificio, alioqui non dolati lapides lapidibus non cohaerent: Sic &amp; Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae doctores vitia hominum quaſi nodos acutis incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pationibus primum circumcidere debent, &amp; ſic in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae aedificatione collocare: alioquin vitiis manentibus Chriſtiani Chriſtianis concordare non poſſunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Through the whole courſe of our Miniſtery, we muſt inſiſt moſt upon the Greateſt, moſt Certain and Neceſſary things, and be more ſeldom and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon the reſt. If we can but teach Chriſt to our people, we teach them all. Get them well to heaven, and they will have knowledge enough. The great and commonly acknowledged Truths are they that men muſt live upon, and which are the great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of raiſing the heart to God, and deſtroying mens ſins. And therefore we muſt ſtill have our peoples <hi>neceſſities</hi> in our eyes. It will take us off gawdes, and needleſs Ornaments, and unprofitable Controverſies, to remember that <hi>One thing is Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</hi> Other things are deſirable to be known, but theſe <hi>muſt</hi> be known, or elſe our people are undone for ever. I confeſs I think Neceſſity ſhould be a great diſpoſer of a Miniſters courſe of ſtudy and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. If we were ſufficient for every thing, we might fall upon every thing, and take in order the whole <hi>Encuclopaedia:</hi> But life is ſhort: and we are dull: and eternal things are neceſſary: and the ſouls that depend on our teaching are precious: I
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99578:101"/>
confeſs Neceſſity hath been the Conductor of my ſtudies and life: It chooſeth what book I ſhall read, and tells when and how long? it chooſeth my Text, and makes my Sermon for matter and manner, ſo far as I can keep out my own corruption. Though I know the conſtant expectation of death hath been a great cauſe of this, yet I know no reaſon why the moſt healthful man ſhould not make ſure of the <hi>Neceſſaries</hi> firſt, conſidering the uncertainty and ſhortneſs of all mens lives. <hi>Xenophon</hi> thought, <hi>there was no better Teacher then Neceſſity, which teacheth all things moſt diligently. Curtius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Efficacior eſt omni arte Neceſſitas.</hi> Who can in ſtudy, preaching, or life, <hi>aliud agere</hi> be doing other matters, if he do but know, that <hi>This muſt be done?</hi> Who can trifle or delay, that feeleth the ſpurs of haſty Neceſſity: As the ſouldier ſaith, <hi>Non diu diſputandum, ſed celeriter &amp; fortiter dimicandum ubi urget Neceſſitas.</hi> So much more muſt we as our buſineſs is more important. And doubtleſs this is the beſt way to redeem time, and ſee that we loſe not an hour, when we ſpend it only on Neceſſary things: And I think it is the way to be moſt profitable to others, though not alwaies to be moſt pleaſing and applauded; becauſe through mens frailty, its true that <hi>Seneca</hi> complains of, that <hi>Nova potius miramur quam magna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is, that a Preacher muſt be oft upon the ſame things, becauſe the matters of Neceſſity are few; We muſt not either feign Neceſſaries, or fall much upon unneceſſaries, to ſatisfie them that look after Novelties: Though we muſt cloth the ſame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries with a grateful variety in the manner of our delivery. The great volumns and tedious controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99578:102"/>
that ſo much trouble us and waſte our time, are uſually made up more of Opinion then neceſſary verities. For, as <hi>Marſil. Ficinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Neceſſitas brevibus clauditur terminis; opinto nullis.</hi> And as <hi>Greg. Nazianz.</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> often ſay, <hi>Neceſſaries are common and obvious it is ſuperfluities that we waſte our time for, and labour for, and complain that we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them not.</hi> Miniſters therefore muſt be obſervant of the caſe of their Flocks, that they may know what is moſt <hi>neceſſary</hi> for them, both for matter and for manner. And uſually matter is firſt to be regarded, as being of more concernment then the manner. If you are to choſe what Authors to read your ſelves, will you not rather take thoſe that tell you what you know not, and ſpeak the needful truth moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly though it were with barbarous, or unhandſom language, then thoſe that will moſt learnedly, and elegantly, and in grateful language tell you that which is falſe or vain, and <hi>magno conatu nihil dicere?</hi> I purpoſe to follow <hi>Auſtins</hi> counſel, <hi>(li. de catech.) praeponendo verbis ſententiam, ut animus praeponitur corpori: ex quo fit ut ita mallem Veriores quam Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretiores invenire ſermones, ſicut mallem prudentiores quam formoſiores habere amicos.</hi> And ſurely as I do in my ſtudies for my own edification, I ſhould do in my teaching for other mens. It is commonly empty ignorant men that want the matter and ſubſtance of true learning, that are over curious and ſollicitous about words and ornaments, when the antient, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, moſt learned men, abound in ſubſtantial verities, uſually delivered in the plaineſt dreſs. As <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes it the reaſon why women are more addicted to pride in apparel then men, becauſe being
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99578:102"/>
conſcious of little inward worth and ornament, they ſeek to make it up with borrowed ornaments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; So is it with empty worthleſs Preachers, who affect to be eſteemed that which they are not, and have no other way to procure that eſteem.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All our teaching muſt be as Plain and Evident as we can make it. For this doth moſt ſuite to a Teachers ends. He that would be underſtood, muſt ſpeak to the capacity of his hearers, and make it his buſineſs to make himſelf underſtood. Truth loves the Light, and is moſt beautiful when moſt naked. Its a ſign of an envious enemy to hide the truth; and a ſign of an Hypocrite to do this under pretence of revealing it: and therefore painted obſcure Sermons (like the painted glaſs in the windows that keeps out the light) are too oft the markes of painted Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. If you would not Teach men, what do you in the Pulpit? If you would, why do you not ſpeak ſo as to be underſtood? I know the height of the matter may make a man not underſtood when he hath ſtudied to make it as plain as he can; but that a man ſhould purpoſely cloud the matter in ſtrange words, and hide his mind from the people, whom he pretendeth to inſtruct, is the way to make fools admire his profound learning, and wiſe men his folly, pride and hypocriſie. And uſually its a ſuſpicious ſign of ſome deceitful project and falſe Doctrine that needeth ſuch a cloak, and muſt walk thus masked in the open day light. Thus did the followers of <hi>Baſilides,</hi> and <hi>Valentinus,</hi> and others among the old Hereticks; and thus do the <hi>Behmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi> and other <hi>Paracelſians</hi> now; who when they have ſpoken that few may underſtand them, leſt they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99578:103"/>
expoſe their errours to the open view, they pretend a neceſſity of it, becauſe of mens prejudice, and the unpreparedneſs of common underſtandings for the truth. But truth overcomes prejudice by meer light of Evidence, and there is no better way to make a good cauſe prevail, then to make it as plain, and commonly and throughly known as we can; and it is this Light that will diſpoſe an unprepared mind. And, at beſt, its a ſign that he hath not well digeſted the matter himſelf, that is not able to deliver it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to another. I mean, as plain as the nature of the matter will bear, in regard of capacities prepared for it by prerequiſite truths. For I know that ſome men cannot at preſent under ſtand ſome truths, if you ſpeak them as plainly as words can expreſs them: as the eaſieſt Rules in Grammar moſt plainly taught, will be no whit underſtood by a child that is but learning his Alphabet.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Our whole work muſt be carried on in a ſenſe of our inſufficiency, and in a Pious, Believing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon Chriſt. We muſt go to him for Light, and Life, and ſtrength, who ſends us on the work; And when we feel our own faith weak, and our hearts grown dull, and unſuitable to ſo great a work as we have to do, we muſt have recourſe to the Lord that ſendeth us, and ſay, <hi>Lord, wilt thou ſend me with ſuch an unbelieving heart to perſwade others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? muſt I daily and earneſtly plead with ſinners about everlaſting life and death, and have no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and feeling of theſe weighty things my ſelf? O ſend me not naked and unprovided to the work; but as thou commandeſt me to do it, furniſh me with a ſpirit ſuitable thereto. As Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>(de Doctr. Chriſt. l.</hi> 4.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:99578:103"/>
                  <hi>A Preacher muſt labour to be heard underſtanding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, willingly and obediently, &amp; hoc ſe poſſe magis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate or ationum, quam oratoris facultate non dubitet: ut or ando pro ſe ac pro aliis, quos eſt allocuturus, ſit prius orator quam doctor; &amp; in ipſahora accedens, priuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam exeat, proferat linguam ad Deum, levet animam ſitientem,</hi> &amp;c. Prayer muſt carry on our work as well as preaching; He preacheth not heartily to his people, that will not pray for them; If we prevail not with God to give them faith and Repentance, we are unlike to prevail with them to Believe and Repent. <hi>Paul</hi> giveth us frequently his example, of praying night and day for his hearers; When our own hearts are ſo far out of order, and theirs ſo far out of order, if we prevail not with God to mend and help them, we are like to make but unſucceſsful work.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Our work muſt be managed with great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; we muſt carry our ſelves meekly and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendingly to all; and ſo teach others, as to be as ready to learn of any that can teach us, and ſo both Teach and learn at once; Not proudly venting our own conceits, and diſdaining all that any way contradict them, as if we had attained to the top of knowledge, and we were deſtinated for the chair, and other men to ſet at our feet: Not like them that <hi>Gregory M.</hi> mentioneth in <hi>Moral. l.</hi> 24. <hi>par.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>In quorum verbis proditur, quod cum docent, quaſi in quodam ſibi videntur ſummitatis culmine reſidere, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

10. All our work muſt be managed Reverently; as beſeemeth them that believe the preſence of God, and uſe not holy things as if they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The more of God appeareth in our duties, the more authority will they have with men: And Reverence is that affection of the ſoul, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from deep apprehenſions of God, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth a mind that is much converſant with him. To manifeſt unreverence in the things of God, is ſo far to manifeſt hypocriſie; and that the heart agreeth not with the tongue. I know not what it doth by others; but the moſt Reverent Preacher, that ſpeaks as if he ſaw the face of God, doth more affect my heart, though with common words, then an unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man with the moſt exquiſite preparations. Yea, if he bawl it out with never ſo much ſeeming ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs if Reverence be not anſwerable to fervency, it worketh but little. Of all Preaching in the world (that ſpeaks not ſtark lyes) I hate that Preaching which tendeth to make the hearers laugh, or to move their minds with tickling levity, and affect them as Stage-playes uſe to do, inſtead of affecting them with a holy Reverence of the name of God. Saith <hi>Hierom. (in Epiſtol. ad Nepotian. pag. mihi</hi> 14.) <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente in Eccleſia te, non clamor populi, ſed gemitus ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citetur; Lachrymae auditorum laudes tuae ſunt.</hi> We ſhould as it were ſuppoſe we ſaw the Throne of God, and the millions of Glorious Angels attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that we might be awed with his Majeſty, when we draw neer him in his holy things, leſt we profane them, and take his name in vain.</p>
               <p>To this I annex, that all our work muſt be done <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> as by men poſſeſſed by the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99578:105"/>
and acted by him, and men that ſavour the things of the Spirit. There is in ſome mens preaching a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtrain, which ſpiritual hearers can diſcern and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. And in ſome mens this ſacred tincture is ſo wanting, that even when they ſpeak of ſpiritual things, the manner is ſuch as if they were common matters. Our Evidence alſo and ornaments muſt be ſpiritual, rather from the holy Scripture, (with a tautelous ſubſervient uſe of Fathers and other Writers) then from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or the authorities of men. The wiſdom of the world muſt not be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt the wiſdom of God; Philoſophy muſt be taught to ſtoop and ſerve, while faith doth bear the chiefeſt ſway; And great Schollars in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> School, muſt take heed of too much glorying in their maſter, and deſpiſing thoſe that are there below them; leaſt themſelves prove lower in the School of Chriſt, and <hi>leaſt</hi> in the Kingdom of God, while they would be <hi>great</hi> in the eyes of men. As wiſe a man as any of them, would glory in nothing but the Croſs of Chriſt, and deſired to know nothing but him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. They that are ſo confident that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is in Hell, ſhould not too much take him for their Guide in the way to heaven. Its an excellent <hi>memorandum</hi> that <hi>Greg.

The whole courſe of our Miniſtery muſt be carried on in a tender Love to our people: we muſt let them ſee that nothing pleaſeth us but what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth them; and that which doth them good doth us good; and nothing troubleth us more then their hurt. We muſt remember as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith <hi>ad Nepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.

We will put up a blow that is given us in Love, ſooner then a foul word that is given us in anger or in malice. Moſt men uſe to judge of the counſel, as they judge of the affection of him that gives it: at leaſt ſo far as to give it a fair hearing. O therefore ſee that you feel a tender love to your people in your breaſts, and then let them feel it in your ſpeeches, and ſee it in your dealings; Let them ſee that you ſpend and are ſpent for their ſakes; and that all you do is for them, and not for any ends of your own.

               <p>Having given you theſe 12. Concomitants of our Miniſterial labour as ſingly to be performed by every Miniſter, let me conclude with one other that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to us as we are conjoyned, and fellow-labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the work: and that is this: We muſt be very ſtudious of Union and Communion among our ſelves, and of the Unity and Peace of the Churches that we overſee. We muſt be ſenſible how needful this is to the Proſperity of the whole, the ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our common cauſe, the good of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular members of our flock, and the further enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom of Chriſt. And therefore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters muſt ſmart when the Church is wounded and be ſo far from being the Leaders in diviſions, that they ſhould take it as a principal part of their work to prevent and heal them. Day and night ſhould they bend their ſtudies to find out means to cloſe ſuch breaches. They muſt not only barken to motions for Unity, but propound them and proſecute them: Nor only entertain an offered Peace, but even fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99578:108"/>
it when it flyeth from them. They muſt therefore keep cloſe to the antient ſimplicity of the Chriſtian faith, and the foundation and Center of Catholike Unity. They muſt abhor the arrogancy of them that frame new Engins to wrack and tear the Church of God, under protence of obviating Errors, and maintaining the truth: The Scripture-ſufficiency muſt be maintained, and nothing beyond it impoſed on others; and if Papiſts or others call to us for the Standard and Rule of our Religion, it is the Bible that we muſt ſhew them, rather then any Confeſſions of Churches, or writings of men. We muſt learn to difference well between Certainties and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, Neceſſaries and Unneceſſaries, Catholike verities <hi>(quae ab omnibus, ubi<expan>

Peace upon the former, and not upon the latter. We muſt therefore underſtand the Doctrine of Antiquity, that we may know what way men have gone to heaven by in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, and know the writings of later Divines, that we may partake of the benefit of their clearer Methods and Explications; but neither of them muſt be made the Rule of our faith or charity. We muſt avoid the common confuſion of thoſe that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference not between verbal and real Errors, and hate that <hi>Rabies quorundam Theologorum,</hi> that tear their Brethren as Hereticks, before they underſtand them. And we muſt learn to ſee the true ſtate of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and reduce them to the very Point where the difference lyeth, and not to make them ſeem greater then they are. Inſtead of quarreling with our Brethren, we muſt combine againſt the common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99578:109"/>
And all Miniſters muſt aſſociate, and hold Communion, and Correſpondency, and Conſtant meetings to thoſe ends; and ſmaller differences of Judgement are not to interrupt them. They muſt do as much of the work of God in Unity and Concord as they can. Which is the uſe of Synods; not to Rule over one another, and make Laws; but to avoid miſunderſtandings, and conſult for mutual edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and maintain Love and Communion, and go on unanimouſly in the work that God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Commanded us. Had the Miniſters of the Goſpel been men of Peace, and of Catholike rather then factious ſpirits, the Church of Chriſt had not been in the caſe as now it is; the Nations of <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> and <hi>Calvinſts</hi> abroad, and the differing parties here at home, would not have been plotting the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of one another, nor remain at that diſtance, and in that uncharitable bitterneſs, nor ſtrengthen the common enemy, and hinder the building and proſperity of the Church as they have done.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Everend and dear Brethren, our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs here this day is to humble our ſouls before the Lord for our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer negligence, eſpecially of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing and perſonal inſtructing thoſe committed to our charge; and to deſire Gods aſſiſtance of us in our undertaken employment for the time to come. Indeed we can ſcarce expect the later without the former. If God will help us in our future duty and amendment, he will ſure humble us firſt for our former ſin. He that hath not ſo much ſenſe of his faults as unfeignedly to lament them, will hardly have ſo much more as may move him to reform them. The ſorrow of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99578:110"/>
may go without the change of heart and life; becauſe a Paſsion may be eaſier wrought then a true converſion: but the change cannot go without ſome good meaſure of the ſorrow. Indeed we may juſtly here begin our Confeſſions; It is too common with us to expect that from our people, which we do little or nothing in our ſelves. What pains take we to humble them, while our ſelves are unhumbled? How hard do we ſqueeze them by all our expoſtulations, convictions, and aggravations, to wring out of them a few penitent tears, (and all too little) when our own eyes are dry, and our hearts too ſtrange to true remorſe and we give them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of hard-heartedneſs, while we are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by our words to mollifie and melt them. O if we did but ſtudy half as much to affect and amend our own hearts, as we do our hearers, it would not be with many of us as it is! Its a great deal too little that we do for their humiliation; but I fear its much leſs that ſome of us do for our own. Too many do ſomewhat for other mens ſouls, while they ſeem to forget that they have any of their own to regard. They ſo carry the matter, as if their part of the work lay in calling for Repentance, and the hearers in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting: theirs in ſpeaking tears and ſorrow, and other-mens-only in weeping and ſorrowing; theirs in preaching duty, and the hearers in performing it; theirs in crying down ſin, and the peoples in forſake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>But we find that the Guides of the Church in Scripture did confeſs their own ſins as well as the ſins of the people, and did begin to them in tears for their own and the peoples ſins. <hi>Ezra</hi> confeſſeth the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99578:110"/>
ſins of the Prieſts as well as of the people, weeping and caſting himſelf down before the houſe of God, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 10. and 10. 1. So did the <hi>Levites, Neh.</hi> 9. 32, 33, 34. <hi>Daniel</hi> confeſſed his own ſin as well as the peoples, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 20. And God calleth ſuch to it as well as others, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 15, 16, 17. When the faſt is ſummoned, the people gathered, the Congregation ſanctified, the Elders aſſembled, the Prieſts the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Lord are called to begin to them in weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and calling upon God for mercy. I think if we conſider well of the Duties already opened, and withal how we have done them; of the Rule and of our unanſwerableneſs thereto, we need not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murr upon the queſtion, nor put it to a queſtion, Whether we have cauſe of humiliation? I muſt needs ſay, though I judge my ſelf in ſaying it, that he that readeth but this one Exhortation of <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. and compareth his life with it, is too ſtupid and hard-hearted, if he do not melt in the ſenſe of his neglects, and be not laid in the duſt before God, and forced to bewail his great omiſsions, and to flye for refuge to the blood of Chriſt, and to his pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace. I am confident, Brethren, that none of you do in judgement approve of the Libertine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that cryeth down the neceſsity of Confeſsion, Contrition and true humiliation, yea and in order to the pardon of ſin! Is it not pitty then that our Hearts are not more Orthodox as well as our heads? But I ſee our leſſon is but half learnt when we know it, and can ſay it: When the underſtanding hath learned it, there is more ado to teach it our Wills and Affections, our eyes, our tongues and hands. It is a ſad thing that ſo many of us do uſe to preach
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99578:111"/>
our hearers aſleep: but its ſadder if we have ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and preacht our ſelves aſleep, and have talkt ſo long againſt hardneſs of heart, till our own grow hardned, under the noiſe of our own reproofs. Though the head only have eyes, and ears, and ſmell, and taſte, the heart ſhould have life, and feeling and motion as well as the head.</p>
               <p>And that you may ſee that it is not a cauſeleſs ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that God calleth us to. I ſhall take it to be my duty to call to remembrance our mainfold ſins, or thoſe that are moſt obvious, and ſet them this day in order before God and our own faces, that God may caſt them behind his back: and to deal plainly and faithfully in a free confeſsion; that he who is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt may forgive them; and to judge our ſelves that we be not judged of the Lord. Wherein I ſuppoſe I have your free and hearty conſent, and that you will be ſo far from being offended with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of your perſons and of others in this office, that you will readily ſubſcribe the charge, and be humble ſelf-accuſers; and ſo far am I from juſtifying my ſelf by the accuſation of others, that I do unfeignedly put my name with the firſt in the bill. For how can a wretched ſinner of ſo great tranſgreſſions, preſume to juſtifie himſelf with God? Or how can he plead Guiltleſs, whoſe conſcience hath ſo much to ſay againſt him? If I caſt ſhame upon the Miniſtery, it is not on the office, but on our perſons, by opening that ſin which is our ſhame: The glory of our high imployment doth not communicate any glory to our ſin; nor will afford it the ſmalleſt covering for its nakedneſs. For <hi>ſin is a reproach to any people,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 34. And it is my ſelf as well as others
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99578:111"/>
on whom I muſt lay the ſhame. And if this may not be done, What do we here to day? Our buſineſs is to take ſhame to our ſelves, and to give God the glory, and faithfully to open our ſins that he may cover them, and to make our ſelves bare by confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we have done by tranſgreſsion, that we may have the white rayment which cloatheth none but the penitent; For be they Paſtors or people, it is only he <hi>that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins, that ſhall have mercy, when he that hardeneth his heart ſhall fal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to miſchief, Pro.</hi> 28. 13.</p>
               <p>And I think it will not be amiſs if in the beginning of our Confeſsion we look behind us, and imitate <hi>Daniel</hi> and other ſervants of God who confeſſed the ſins of their fore-fathers and predeceſſors. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed my own Judgement is ſo far from denying Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin, even the imputed part, with the antient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of it, or thoſe of the new Edition, that it doth not ſo much excuſe me from the Guilt of my later progenitors offences, as moſt other mens do ſeem to excuſe them.

               <p>And for their damnatory Sentences, they were more preſumptuous then their Laws; Few men could ſtand in anothers way, or fall out, but one of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99578:114"/>
them muſt be an Heretick before they had made an end. Small differences were named damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. Though they had enough among them that were ſuch indeed, (whereof ſome of the Clergy were almoſt alwaies the cauſes and fomenters) yet did they ſo multiply them by their imputation, that their Catalogues ſwelled beyond the credit of charity. And he that had the higheſt reputation, was uſually ſafeſt from the blot, and had power to make others hereticks almoſt at his pleaſure; and if a man had once got the vote and fame, it was dangerous gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying him. Had <hi>Vigilantius</hi> or <hi>Jovinian</hi> had <hi>Hieroms</hi> name, ſome of their hereſies might poſſibly have been articles of faith.</p>
               <p>And as they were dangerouſly forward on one ſide to make every ſmall miſtake a Hereſie, and cauſe diviſions in the Church by their unjuſt condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo many on the other hand were as forward to provoke them, by novelties or falſe conceits, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally about the Trinity, and the perſon and natures of Chriſt; So that unquiet ſpirits knew not when or where to reſt: And multitudes of them did turn cheaters and deluders of the vulgar, by pretending to Miracles, and Revelations, and Viſions, and drawing the people deeper into ſuperſtition by ſuch means, (as <hi>Bonafacius Moguntinus</hi> wrote to Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> about the hypocritical Saint <hi>Aldebert.)</hi> And in that age eſpecially when few learned men (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> complaineth) did eſcape the ſuſpition of hereſie, and he that was a Mathematician was counted a Magitian, it had been more wit to have ſilenced ſome unneceſſary verities, then to have angred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient ignorance. <hi>Virgilius</hi> might have talkt more

But to mention the twentieth part of the Proud uſurpations, innovations, impoſitions and ſentences of thoſe following times, eſpecially among the Romaniſts, is fitter for large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns then a curſary Lamentation of the Churches ſins. I will not meddle with the Errors, and cruel blood ſhed of the Popiſh Clergy of late, againſt the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and Proteſtants; nor yet with the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the reſt of the Clergy through the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, in <hi>Aethiopia, Muſcovia, Grece,</hi> &amp;c. For you will think that this is leſs to us that do diſclaim them: But let us come neerer our ſelves, and we ſhall find yet matter of further lamentation. And I will purpoſely ſay nothing of any of the ſins of our forrain Reformers, nor meddle with any of thoſe ſad contentions, which have brought the Reformed Churches into two ſuch exaſperated partys, <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> (as they are commonly called) and hindred their reconciliation and fruſtrated all means that have been uſed to that end till this day, to the exceeding ſhame of the Paſtors of theſe Churches, and the publiſhing of our darkneſs, Pride, and ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all the world. But my preſent buſineſs lyeth only at home, and that only with the Reformed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of our Churches. For though through the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99578:115"/>
great mercy of God, they are far from the Papal cruelty which made bone-fires of their Brethren better then themſelves throughout the Land, and as far from the worſt of their Errors and falſe worſhip; yet have we been ſo far from innocency, that all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity is bound to lament the miſcarriages of <hi>their</hi> predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>Is it not a very ſad Hiſtory of the troubles at <hi>Frankford,</hi> to read that ſo many godly learned men that had forſaken all for the Reformed profeſſion, and were Exiles in a forraign Land, even in a City where they had but borrowed the liberty of one Church ſhould even then fall in pieces among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that about a Liturgy and Ceremonies, ſo far as to make a diviſion; and after many plottings and counter-plottings, and underminings of one another, one part of them muſt leave the City, and go ſeek another for their liberty! What had not thoſe few Exiles that left their native Country, lands and friends, and all for the Goſpel, that fled ſo far for the liberty of Gods worſhip, and had as great advantage as moſt men in the world to be ſenſible of the excellency of Reformation and liberty, had theſe I ſay no more Chriſtian love and tenderneſs, no more eſteem of what they ſuffered for, then to fall out with one another, and almoſt fall upon one another, for ſuch things as theſe! Would not ſuffering abate their pride and paſſions, and cloſe their hearts, nor yet make them ſo far patient as to tolerate each other in ſo ſmall a difference: Even when their dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends and fellow-ſervants were frying in the flames at home, and the priſons filled with them, and they had daily news of one after another that was
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99578:116"/>
made a ſacrifice to the fury of the Papiſts, could they yet proceed in their own diſſentions, and that to ſuch a height! O what is man! and the beſt of men! Yea before this, in King <hi>Edwards</hi> daies, what rigor was uſed againſt Biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi> about ſuch Ceremonies! But the priſon abated Biſhop <hi>Ridleys</hi> uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they then learned more charity when they were going to the flames.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Frankford</hi> the ſad diviſion at the death of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was tranſported into <hi>England;</hi> and the ſeeds that were ſown or began to ſpring up in the Exiled Congregation, did too plentifully fructifie in the Land of their proſperity. No ſooner doth the Sun ſhine upon them, but contentious ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſwarm; and the priſon doors are no ſooner open, and their bolts knockt off, but they continue the ſuppreſſing of their Brethren, as if they had been turned looſe as fighting Cocks to fall upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to work for Satan when they had ſuffered for Chriſt. The party that was for Prelacy and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, prevailed for the countenance of the ſtate, and quickly got the ſtaff into their hands, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Brethren under their feet: and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the buſineſs that there was no quiet ſtation to be had in the Miniſtery, for thoſe that would not be of their mind and way. And many of them endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to have a brand of ignominy ſet upon their names, who deſired the Diſcipline and order of other reformed Churches; That all might be accounted Schiſmaticks that would not be ruled by them even in Ceremonies. The contrary-minded alſo were ſome of them too intemperate, and impatient, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable; and ſome few of them turned to flat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99578:116"/>
and flew in the faces of the Prelates with reviling: For their ſakes many wiſe and peaceable men were the worſe uſed; and they that were got into the Chair, began to play the ſcorners and the perſecutors: and thought meet to impoſe upon them all the nick-name of Puritans, as knowing how much names of reproach and ſcorn could do with the vulgar for the furthering of their cauſe; ſome of theſe Puritans (as now they had named them) were impriſoned, and ſome put to death, and ſome dyed in and by impriſonment: They are all made uncap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of being Preachers of the Goſpel in <hi>England,</hi> till they would change their minds, and ſubſcribe to the lawfulneſs of Prelacy, and the Liturgy and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and uſe theſe accordingly when they uſe their Miniſtery. O how much did many good men rejoyce that the Lord had viſited their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey with deliverance, and the light of the glorious Goſpel of his Son? How much did they long to lay out themſelves for the ſaving of their dear Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to improve the preſent freedom for the moſt effectual propagation of the Truth? When alas their own friends, ſome of their fellow-ſufferers animated and aſſiſted by many temporizers, did ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly diſappoint their hopes and ſhut them out of the Vineyard of the Lord, and would ſuffer none to labour in it, but themſelves and theirs. Alas that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution ſhould be ſo ſoon forgotten! and that they ſhould have no more ſenſe of the cruelty of the Papiſts, to have moved them to ſome more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the conſciences and liberties of their Brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. That they had no more compaſsion on the Church of Chriſt, then to deprive it of the labours
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99578:117"/>
of ſo many choice and worthy men; and that at ſuch a time of neceſſity. When Popiſh Prieſts were newly caſt out, and multitudes of Congregations had no Preachers at all, but ſome ſilly Readers, yet might not theſe men be allowed to Preach. If the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe Prelates were never ſo abſolute for the Divine right of their own government, yet could it not be ſo for the abſolute Neceſsity of the Croſs, Surplice, and every part of the forms in their Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy! Had they but countenanced moſt their own party, and ſilenced all that did ſpeak againſt their Government and Ceremonies, and only allowed them to preach the Goſpel without ſubſcription to the lawfulneſs of theſe things, and with a ſilent forbearance of the uſe of the Ceremonies, they might have better ſecured their own power and way, and have exerciſed ſome ſenſe of brotherly love, and compaſsion on the neceſsitous ſtate of the Church, and in all likelyhood might have ſtood ſafe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this day. A wonderful thing it ſeems to me, that wiſe and good men (for ſuch I doubt not but many of them were) ſhould think it better that many hundred Congregations in <hi>England</hi> (to ſay nothing of <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>Scotland)</hi> ſhould be without any preaching at all to the apparent hazard of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of means ſouls (who were ſo deep in Popiſh ignorance before) then that a man ſhould preach to them that durſt not uſe the Croſs or Surplice? were theſe of more worth then ſo many ſouls? It was lawful in the Apoſtles daies to baptize without the Croſs, and to pray, and praiſe God without the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice? and why might not the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> have tolerated that in the Churches neceſſities, at
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99578:117"/>
leaſt as a weakneſs in well-meaning Brethren which the Apoſtolical Churches uſed not at all? What if they were lawful? They that thought ſo might have them. Were they now become more neceſſary then the Preaching of the Goſpel, when in the Apoſtles times they were of no neceſſity or uſe at all? If it were obedience to the Prelates that was neceſſary, they might have required obedience to undoubted and neceſſary things, and they ſhould ſoon have found it. Had they contented themſelves to be as Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers under Chriſt, to ſee to the execution of his Laws, and to meddle at leaſt with no needleſs new Legiſlation, I think few would have queſtioned obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them but the ungodly. But it was ſadly contrived to have ſuch Impoſitions on mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in needleſs or indifferent things, as the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſcienc't men were likeſt to diſobey, and as might be ſnares to thoſe that deſired to pleaſe God, (when) the buſineſs of Church Governors ſhould be to promote the obedience of Chriſts-Laws, and to encourage thoſe that are moſt fearful to diſobey them) and to do as the Law makers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>We ſhall not find any occaſion againſt this</hi> Daniel, <hi>except we find it againſt him concerning the Law of his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thus it came to paſs that the enemy of the Church did too much attain his ends: ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men as <hi>Hilderſham, Brightman, P. Bayn, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Ames, Bradſhaw, Dod, Nicolls,</hi> with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes more were laid aſide and ſilenced; and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of them that petitioned for liberty in <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Devonſhire,</hi> and other parts, ſuppreſſed; and the Nation in the mean time abounding with groſs
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99578:118"/>
ignorance, was brought by obſerving the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the times, to like their own Readers better then painful Preachers, and to hate and ſcorn the zealous obedience to the Laws of Chriſt, and all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence for ſalvation, becauſe they obſerved, that thoſe men that were ſuch, were ſo many of them hated and perſecuted by the Rulers, though on the occaſions before mentioned. And here was the foundation of our greateſt miſery laid: While ſome of the Rulers themſelves began to turn their hatred againſt practical godlineſs (which corrupted nature hates in all) and the common people took the hint, and no longer confined the word Puritan to the Non-conformiſts, but applyed it commonly through all parts of the Land, to thoſe that would but ſpeak ſeriouſly of heaven, and tell men of Death and Judgement, and ſpend the Lords day in preparation thereto, and deſire others to do the like; that did but pray in their families, and keep their children and ſervants on the Lords day to learn the way to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſtead of letting them ſpend it in gaming or revelling; they that did but reprove a ſwearer or a drunkard; theſe were become the Puritans and the Preciſians, and the hated ones of the time; ſo that they became a by-word in all the Towns and Villages in <hi>England</hi> that ever I knew, or heard of (as to theſe things.) And thus when the Prelates had engaged the vulgar in their cauſe, and partly by themſelves, and partly by them, had ſo far changed their cauſe, as that all ſerious Chriſtians that feared ſin, and were moſt diligent for ſalvation, were preſently engaged among their adverſaries, and they were involved with the reſt, though they did nothing againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99578:118"/>
or Ceremonies, and the moſt ignorant and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious became the friends and agents of the times, and everywhere made the moſt pious and ſedulous Chriſtians a common ſcorn, to the diſhonour of God, and the hardening of the wicked, and diſcouraging of the weak, and filling men with prejudice againſt a godly life, and hindring many thouſands from the way of ſalvation: then did God himſelf appear more evidently as intereſted in the quarrel, and roſe againſt them, and ſhamed them that had let in ſcorn and ſhame upon his waies; And this, even this was the very thing that brought them down.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, there was ſcarce ſuch a thing as Church-Government or Diſcipline known in the Land; but only this haraſſing of thoſe that diſſented from them. In all my life I never lived in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh where one perſon was publikely admoniſhed or brought to publike penitence or excommunicated, though there were never ſo many obſtinate drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, whoremongers or vileſt offenders. Only I have known now and then one for getting a baſtard, that went to the Biſhops Court and paid their ſees; and I heard of two or three in all the Countrey (in all my life) that ſtood in a white ſheet an hour in the Church: But the antient Diſcipline of the Church was unknown. And indeed it was made by them impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, when one man that lived at a diſtance from them, and knew not one of many hundreds of the Flock, did take upon him the ſole Juriſdiction (and executed it not by himſelf, but by a lay-Chancellor) excluding the Paſtors of the ſeveral Congregations, who were but to joyn with the Church-wardens and the Apparitors in preſenting men, and bringing them
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99578:119"/>
into their Courts: And an impoſſible task muſt needs be unperformed: And ſo the controverſie as to the letter and outſide was, <hi>Who ſhould be the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of all the particular Churches?</hi> but as to the ſenſe and inſide of it, it was, <hi>Whether there ſhould be any effectual Church-Government, or not?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon thoſe that pleaded for Diſcipline, were called by the New name of Diſciplinarians; as if it had been a kind of Hereſie to deſire Diſcipline in the Church.</p>
               <p>At laſt the heat began to grow greater, and new impoſitions raiſed new adverſaries. When conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Puritans began to bear the great reproach (there being few of the Non-conformiſts left) Then muſt they alſo be gotten into the Net; Altars muſt be bowed to or towards: All muſt publiſh a Book for dancing and ſports on the Lords day, diſabling the Maſters of Families, &amp; parents (though they had ſmal time on the week-daies, by reaſon of their poverty or labour) to keep in their own children or families from dancing on that day, that they might inſtruct them in the matters of God. If a man as he read a Chapter to his family, had perſwaded them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and practice it, and with any reaſons urged them thereto, this was called <hi>expounding,</hi> and was enquired of in their Articles, to be preſented toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Adultery and ſuch like ſins: ſo alſo was he uſed that had no preaching at home, and would go hear a conformable Preacher abroad: So that multitudes have I known exceedingly troubled or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ſuch matters as theſe, when not one was much troubled for ſcandalous crimes. Then Lectures were put down, and afternoon Sermons, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99578:119"/>
the Catechiſm, or Scripture in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons. And the violence grew ſo great, that many thouſand families left the Land, and many godly, able Miniſters, Conformiſts as well as others, were fain to flie and become Exiles, ſome in one Countrey and ſome in another, and moſt in the remote <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> parts of the world: Thither went <hi>Cotten, Hooker, Davenport, Shephard, Allen, Cobbet, Noyes, Parker,</hi> with many another that deſerved a dwelling place in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I muſt profeſs I ſhould ſcarce have mentioned any of this, nor taken it for ſo hainous a crime, had it been only cruelty to the perſons of theſe men, though they had dealt much hardlyer with them then they did, and if it had not been greater cruelty to the Church, and if they had but had competent men for their places when they were caſt out. But alas the Churches were peſtered with ſuch wretches as are our ſhame and trouble to this day. Abundance of meer Readers, and drunken profane deboiſt men, were the Miniſters of the Churches; ſo that we have been this many years endeavouring to cleanſe the Church of them, and have not fully effected it to this day. And many that had more plauſible tongues, did make it their chief buſineſs, to bring thoſe that they called Puritans into diſgrace, and to keep the people from being ſuch. So that I muſt needs ſay, that I knew no place in theſe times, where a man might not more ſafely have been drunken every week, (as to their puniſhment) then to have gone to hear a Sermon if he had none at home. For the common people readily took the hint, and increaſed their reproach, as the Rulers did their perſec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99578:120"/>
ſo that a man could not in any place of <hi>England</hi> that I came in, have ſaid to a ſwearer or a drunkard, <hi>O do not ſin againſt God, and wound or hazard your own ſoul,</hi> but he ſhould have been preſently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>s neighbour, <hi>Remember your everlaſting ſtate: prepare for death and Judgement:</hi> or have talked of any Scripture matters to them, but he was preſently jeered as a Puritan or Preciſian: and Scripture it ſelf was become a reproach to him that talked of it, and they would cry out, <hi>What! we muſt have talk of Scripture now! you will preach to us! we ſhall have theſe Preachers ordered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re long.</hi> So that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come commonly in <hi>England</hi> a greater reproach to be a man truly living in the fear of God, then to live in open prophaneſs, and to rail at godlineſs, and daily ſcorn it, which was ſo far from being a matter of danger, that many took it up in expectation of preferment; and the Preachers of the times were well ware that the riſing way was to preach againſt the preciſe Puritans, and not to live preciſely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And thus both Miniſtery and people grew to that ſad paſs, that it was no wonder if God would bear no longer with the Land.</p>
               <p>Even as it was in the Weſtern Churches before the inundation of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> as <hi>Salvian</hi> among others tells us; Indeed I know not a Writer that more fitly painteth out the ſtate of our times; I ſhall therefore borrow ſome of his words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our caſe, which it ſeems had been then the Churches caſe.</p>

               <p>Yet through the mercy of God, it was not all the Prelates of the Church that thus miſcarried: we have yet ſurviving our <hi>Uſher,</hi> our <hi>Hall,</hi> our <hi>Morton,</hi> learned, godly and peaceable men; whoſe names are as dear to us as any mens alive. And O that it had been the will of God that all had been ſuch! Then had we not been like to have ſeen thoſe daies of blood that we have ſeen: nor thoſe great mutations in Church and ſtate! But ſo far were theſe good men from being able to do the good that they would, that they were maligned for their piety, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the faith, and many a time have I heard them deſpiſed as well as others, and ſcorned as Puritans for all they were Prelates.</p>
               <p>And yet it were well if all the guilt had lain upon that party! But alas it was not ſo! Thoſe pious and painful Divines that were oppreſſed, and much more that part of the people that joyned with them, were too impatient under their ſuffering! and bent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (ſome of them) more then was meet againſt the perſons of thoſe that they ſuffered by; and too much endeavoured to make the Prelates odious with the people; as perſecutors of the Church of God: and were ready to go too far from them on the other hand; and to think the worſe of ſome things becauſe they commanded them. Doubtleſs had we all ſuffered with more patience, and carried our ſelves with meekneſs and gent eneſs to thoſe that we differed from, and given them ſo much commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as was their due, and put the beſt conſtructions on
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99578:122"/>
their actions that we could, and covered their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with the moſt charitable interpretations, we might have done more to mollifie their minds; or at leaſt, to have maintained our own innocency. But as there was no room on their part to a motion for peace, or a petition for liberty, in the time of their proſperity; ſo when advantages did ſeem to appear to us of vindicating our liberties, we looked upon them as unreconcileable, and too inconſiderately ruſht on, and were wanting in thoſe peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that were our duty. We did not in our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly invite them to a free conſultation, that their cauſe might have the fulleſt and faireſt hearing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had been condemned. Propoſals that had any tendency to healing and accommodation, had never that entertainment from us that they did deſerve. What moderate Propoſals were made to one party by Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> which both parties did diſlike! How many pacificatory motions and excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes came from that Heavenly peaceable Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> eſpecially his <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> his <hi>Pax terris,</hi> and his <hi>Modeſt Offer!</hi> But how little did they effect! Certainly ſome of the men were ſo venerable for their admirable learning and piety, that they deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been heard, and conſulted with too, as wiſe and moſt Judicious men. And Prelacy was not ſo young a plant in the Church, nor had it in former and latter ages, had ſo few or mean perſons to adorn and credit it, but that it well deſerved the faireſt hearing and debate.</p>
               <p>But thus have we all ſhewed our frailty, and this is the <hi>heed</hi> that we have <hi>taken to our ſelves and to all the Flock.</hi> The Lord open our eyes at laſt, that we
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99578:122"/>
may all fullyer ſee our own miſcarriages; for ſurely they lie as Mountains before us, and all the world about us may ſee them, and yet we will hardly ſee them our ſelves.</p>
               <p>A man would think now that if the heart of man be cureable, we ſhould by this time be all brought to the ſenſe of our miſcarriages, and be prepared to a cloſure on any reaſonable terms? Who would think but after all the ſmart of our diviſions, we ſhould long ere this have got together, and prayed, and conſulted our ſelves into peace! But alas there is no ſuch matter done; and few do I find that mind the doing of it.

               <p>The minds of many are as much exaſperated or eſtranged as ever. Three ſorts I meet with, that all are too backward to any accommodation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The violent men of the Prelates ſide, eſpecially thoſe of the new way, who are ſo far from Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and healing of our breaches, that they labour to perſwade the world that the contrary-minded are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99578:123"/>
Schiſmaticks, and that all the Miniſters that have not Epiſcopal ordination are no Miniſters, nor any of the Churches that have not Prelates are true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (at leaſt, except it can be proved to be through unavoidable neceſſity.) And they ſay, To agree with ſuch were to ſtrike a Covenant with Schiſm it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some on the other ſide ſay, <hi>Do you not ſee that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept an inconſiderable number, the Prelatical party are all, empty, careleſs, if not ſcandalous ungodly men! Where are almoſt any of them whoſe Communion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable! That ſet themſelves to the winning and ſaving of ſouls, and are ſerious men in the matters of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in whom you can perceive a heavenly converſation? Hath God brought down theſe enemies of godlineſs, and perſecutors and depopulaters of his Church, and would you make a league with them again? Do you not ſee that they are as bitter and implacable as ever! and have not ſome of them the faces to juſtifie all the former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and perſecutions, and draw or continue the guile of it upon their heads? and would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are wrongfully eiected, when ſo many accuſatians in Parliament before the diviſion, ſo many Centuries of horribly ſcandalous ones publiſhed by Mr.</hi> White, <hi>and ſo many more Centuries that lie on Record under depoſitions in the ſeveral Countyes of the Nation where the Committees eiected them, will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual witneſſes of the quality of theſe men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Others there be that are peaceable men on both ſides, that will not juſtifie the former miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, nor own the preſent evils of any; but think though there be too much truth in theſe later accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet the nature of the Difference and the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

of ſome of the perſons is ſuch, as deſerveth our deſires and endeavours of Reconciltation. But they think the work to be hopeleſs and impoſſible, and therefore not to be attempted.</p>
               <p>And thus our breach is made; but how or when it will be well healed, the Lord knoweth. But this is not all; it behoveth us yet to come neerer home, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the waies of the preſent approved Godly Miniſters, of what party ſoever; and doubtleſs if we are willing to know our ſelves we may ſoon find that which will lay us very low before the Lord, I ſhall in all have an eye at my own corrupt heart which I am ſo far from Juſtifying in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Only I muſt needs firſt premiſe this profeſſion; That for all the faults that are now among us, I do not believe that ever <hi>England</hi> had ſo able and faithful a Miniſtery ſince it was a Nation as it hath at this day: and I fear that few Nations on earth, if any, have the like. Sure I am the change is ſo great with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this 12. years, that it is one of the greateſt joyes that ever I had in the world to behold it. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations are now plainly and frequently taught, that lived then in great obſcurity? How many able faithful men are there now in a County in compariſon of what were then? How graciouſly

And in particular, how mercifully hath the Lord dealt with this poor Countrey of <hi>Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> in raiſing up ſo many of theſe, that credit their ſacred office, and ſelf-denyingly, and freely, zealouſly and unwearyedly do lay out themſelves for the good of ſouls! I bleſs the Lord that hath placed me in ſuch a neighbourhood, where I may have the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly fellowſhip of ſo many able, humble, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, peaceable and faithful men. O that the Lord would long continue this admirable mercy to this unworthy Countrey: And I hope I ſhall rejoyce in God while I have a being for the common change in other parts, that I have lived to ſee: That ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred faithful men are ſo hard at work for the ſaving of ſouls, <hi>frementibus licet &amp; frendentibus ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micis;</hi> and that more are ſpringing up apace. I know there are ſome men whoſe parts I reverence, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in point of Government of another mind from them, will be offended at my very mention of this happy alteration: but I muſt profeſs if I were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Prelatical, if I knew my heart, I could not choſe for all that but rejoyce: What not rejoyce at the proſperity of the Church, becauſe the men do differ in one opinion, about its order! ſhould I ſhut my eyes againſt the mercies of the Lord! The ſouls
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99578:124"/>
of men are not ſo contemptible to me, that I ſhould envy them the bread of life, becauſe it is broken to them by a hand that had not the Prelatical appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; O that every congregation were thus ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; but all cannot be done at once. They had a long time to ſettle a corrupted Miniſtery; and when the ignorant and ſcandalous are caſt out, we cannot create abilities in others for the ſupply; we muſt ſtay the time of their preparation and growth; and then if <hi>England</hi> drive not away the Goſpel by their abuſe, even by their willful unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formedneſs, and hatred of the light, they are like to be the happieſt Nation under heaven. For, as for all the Sects and Hereſies that are creeping in and daily troubling us, I doubt not but the free Goſpel managed by an able ſelf denying Miniſtery, will effectually diſperſe and ſhame them all.</p>
               <p>But you may ſay, This is not confeſſing ſin, but applauding thoſe whoſe ſins you pretend to confeſs?</p>

               <head>SECT. II.</head>
               <p>AMong the many things that are yet ſadly out of order in the <hi>beſt,</hi> I ſhall touch upon theſe few particulars following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One of our moſt hainous &amp; palpable ſins is <hi>Pride:</hi> A ſin that hath too much intereſt in the beſt; but is more hateful &amp; unexcuſable in us then in any men. Yet is it ſo prevalent in ſome of us, that it inditeth our diſcourſes for us, it chooſeth us our company, it form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our countenances, it putteth the accents and emphaſis upon our words; when we reaſon, it is the determiner and exciter of our Cogitations? It fills ſome mens minds with aſpiring deſires and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: It poſſeſſeth them with envious and bitter thoughts againſt thoſe that ſtand in their light, or by any means do ecclipſe their glory, or hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of their idolized Reputation. O what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant companion, what a tyranous commander, what a fly and ſubtile inſinuating enemy is this ſin of Pride! It goes with men to the Draper, the Mercer, the Taylor; it choſeth them their cloth, their trimming and their faſhion. It dreſſeth them in the morning, at leaſt the out ſide. Fewer Miniſters would ruſtle it out in the faſhion in hair and habit, if it were not for the command of this tyrannous vice. And I would that were all, or the worſt: But alas how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doth it go with us to our ſtudies, and there ſet with us and do our work? How oft doth it choſe our ſubject? and more often choſe our words and ornaments. God biddeth us be as plain as we can,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99578:125"/>
for the informing of the ignorant, and as convincing and ſerious as we are able, for the meiting and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of unchanged hearts; And Pride ſtands by and contradicteth all; and ſometime it puts in toyes and trifles, and polluteth rather then poliſheth, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of laudable ornaments, it diſhonoureth our Sermons with childiſh gawdes: as if a Prince were to be decked in the habit of a Stage-player or a painted fool. It perſwadeth us to paint the window that it may dim the light; and to ſpeak to our people that which they cannot underſtand, to acquaint them that we are able to ſpeak unprofitably: It taketh off the edge, and dulls the life of all our teachings, under pretence of filing off the roughneſs, unevenneſs and ſuperfluity; If we have a plain and cutting paſſage, it throws it away as too ruſtical or ungrateful. When God chargeth us to deal with men as for their lives, and beſeech them with all the earneſtneſs that we are able; this curſed ſin controlleth all, and condemneth the moſt holy commands of God, and calleth our moſt neceſſary duty a madneſs; and ſaith to us, <hi>What will you make people think you are mad? will you make them ſay you rage or rave? cannot you ſpeak ſoberly and moderately?</hi> And thus doth Pride make many a mans Sermons, and what Pride makes the Devil makes; and what Sermons the Devil will make, and to what end, we may eaſily conjecture. Though the matter be of God, yet if the dreſs, and manner, and end be from Satan, we have no great reaſon to expect ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>And when Pride hath made the Sermon, it goes with them into the Pulpit, it formeth their tone, it animateth them in the delivery, it takes them off
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99578:126"/>
from that which may be diſpleaſing, how neceſſary ſoever, and ſetteth them in a purſuite of vain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. And the ſum of all this is, that, It maketh men both in ſtudying and preaching to ſeek them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and deny God, when they ſhould ſeek Gods glory and deny themſelvs. When they ſhould ask, <hi>What ſhould I ſay, and how ſhould I ſay it, to pleaſe God beſt, and do moſt good?</hi> It makes them ask, <hi>What ſhall I ſay, and how ſhall I deliver it, to be thought a learned able Preacher, and to be applauded by all that hear me?</hi> When the Sermon is done, Pride goeth home with them, and maketh them more eager to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were applauded, then whether they did prevail for the ſaving change of ſouls. They could find in their hearts, but for ſhame, to ask folks, how they liked them, and to draw out their commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If they do perceive that they are highly thought of, they rejoyce as having attained their end; but if they perceive that they are eſteemed but weak or common men, they are diſpleaſed as having miſt the prize of the day.</p>
               <p>But yet this is not all nor the worſt, if worſe may be. O that ever it ſhould be ſpoken of godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that they are ſo ſet upon popular air, and of ſitting higheſt in mens eſtimation, that they envy the parts and names of their Brethren that are preferred before them, as if all were taken from their praiſes that is given to anothers, and as if God had given them his gifts to be the meer ornaments and trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of their perſons, that they may walk as men of reputation in the world, and all his gifts in others were to be trodden down and vilified, if they ſeem to ſtand in the way of their honour! What, a Saint, a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99578:126"/>
Preacher for Chriſt, and yet envy that which hath the Image of Chriſt, and malign his gifts for which he ſhould have the glory, and all becauſe they ſeem to hinder our glory! Is not every true Chriſtian a member of the body, and therefore partaketh of the bleſſings of the whole, and of each particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof? and doth not every man owe thanks to God for his Brethrens gifts, not only as having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a part in them, as the foot hath the benefit of the Guidance of the eye; but alſo becauſe his own ends may be attained by his brethrens gifts as well as by his own? For if the glory of God and the Churches felicity be not his end, he is not a Chriſtian. Will any work-man malign another becauſe he helpeth him to do his maſters work? yet alas how common is this hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crime among men of parts and eminency in the Church! They can ſecretly blot the Reputation of thoſe that ſtand croſs to their own; and what they cannot for ſhame do in plain and open terms, leſt they be proved palpable lyers and ſlanderers, they will do it in generals and malicious intimations, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuſpicions where they cannot faſten accuſations. And ſo far are ſome gone in this Satanical vice, that it is their ordinary practice, and a conſiderable part of their buſineſs to keep down the eſtimation of any that they diſlike, and to defame others in the ſlyeſt and moſt plauſible way. And ſome goe ſo far, that they are unwilling that any one that is abler then themſelves ſhould come into their Pulpits, leaſt they ſhould be applauded above themſelves. A fearful thing, That any man that hath the leaſt of the fear of God, ſhould ſo envy at Gods gifts, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that his carnal hearers were unconverted, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99578:127"/>
the drowſie not awakened, then that it ſhould be done by another who may be preferred before them. Yea ſo far doth this curſed vice prevail, that in great Congregations that have need of the help of many Teachers, we can ſcarce in many places get two in equality to live together in love and quietneſs, and unanimouſly to carry on the work of God! But unleſs one of them be quite below the other in parts, and content to be ſo eſteemed, or unleſs one be a Curate to the other or ruled by him, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for precedency, and envying each others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and walking with ſtrangneſs and jealouſie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, to the ſhame of their profeſſion, and the great wrong of the Congregation. I am aſhamed to think of it, that when I have been endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring with perſons of publike intereſt and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to further a good work, to convince them of the great neceſſity of more Miniſters then one in great Congregations, they tell me, they will never agree together! I hope the objection is ungrounded as to the moſt: but it is a ſad caſe that it ſhould be ſo with any. Nay ſome men are ſo far gone in Pride, that when they might have an equal aſſiſtant to further the work of God, they had rather take all the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon themſelves, though more then they can bear, then that any ſhould ſhare with them in the honour; and for fear leaſt they ſhould diminiſh their intereſt in the people.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo it comes to paſs that men do ſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their own opinions, and are as cenſorious of any that differ from them in leſſer things, as if it were all one to differ from them and from God; and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that all ſhould be conformed to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99578:127"/>
as if they were the rule of the Churches faith! and while we cry down Papal Infallibility, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Controverſies, we would too many of us be Popes our ſelves, and have all ſtand to our deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, as if we were infallible. Its true, we have more modeſty then expreſly to ſay ſo: we pretend that it is only the evidence of truth that appeareth in our Reaſons that we expect men ſhould yield to, and our zeal is for the truth and not for our ſelves: But as that muſt needs be taken for Truth which is ours, ſo our Reaſons muſt needs be taken for valid; and if they be but freely examined, and found to be infirm and fallacious, and ſo diſcovered, as we are exceeding backward to ſee it our ſelves, becauſe they are ours, ſo how angry are we that it ſhould be diſcloſed to others? and we ſo eſpouſe the cauſe of our errors, as if all that were ſpoken againſt them were ſpoken againſt our perſons, and we were hainouſly injured to have our arguments throughly confuted, by which we injured the truth and the minds of men! ſo that the matter is come to that paſs through our Pride, that if an errour or fallacious argument do fall under the Patronage of a Reverend Name (which is no whit rare) we muſt either give it the victory, and give away the truth, or elſe become injurious to that name that doth patronize it. For though you meddle not with their perſons, yet do they put themſelves under all the ſtrokes which you give their arguments; and feel it as ſenſibly as if you had ſpoken it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe they think it will follow in the eyes of man, that weak arguing is a ſign of a weak man. If therefore you take it for your duty to ſhame their errors and falſe reaſonings, by diſcovering their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99578:128"/>
they take it as if you ſhamed their perſons; and ſo their names muſt be a Garriſon or fortreſs to their miſtakes, and their Reverence muſt defend all their ſayings from the light.</p>
               <p>And ſo high are our ſpirits, that when it becomes a duty to any man to reprove or contradict us, we are commonly impatient both of the matter and of the manner. We love the man that will ſay as we ſay, and be of our opinion, and promote our reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though he be leſs worthy of our love in other reſpects: But he is ungrateful to us that contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth us, and differeth from us, and that dealeth plainly with us in our miſcarriages, &amp; telleth us of our faults! Eſpecially in the management of our publike arguings: where the eye of the world is upon us, we can ſcarce endure any contradiction or plain dealing. I know that Railing language is to be abhorred, and that we ſhould be as tender of each others reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as our fidelity to the truth will permit: But our Pride makes too many of us to think all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn us that do not admire us, yea and admire all that we ſay, and ſubmit their judgements to our moſt palpable miſtakes! We are ſo tender that no man can touch us ſcarce but we are hurt; and ſo ſtout and high-minded that a man can ſcarce ſpeak to us: Like froward children, or ſick folk that cannot endure to be talkt to; the fault is not that you ſpeak amiſs to them, but that you ſpeak to them. So our indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not at men for writing or ſpeaking injuriouſly or unjuſtly againſt our words, but for confuting them. And a man that is not verft in complementing: and skilled in flatterie above the vulgar rate, can ſcarce tell how to handle them ſo obſervantly, and fit
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99578:128"/>
their expectations at every turn, but there will be ſome word, or ſome neglect which their high ſpirits will faſten, and take as injurious to their honour; So that a plain Countrey-man that ſpeaks as he thinks, muſt have nothing to do with them, unleſs he will be eſteemed guilty of diſhonouring them.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I have often wondered at it, that this moſt hainous ſin ſhould be made ſo ſlight of, and thought ſo conſiſtent with a holy frame of heart and life when far leſſer ſins are by our ſelves proclaimed to be ſo damnable in our people! And more have I wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee the difference between ungodly ſinners, and godly Preachers in this reſpect. When we ſpeak to drunkards, worldlings, or any ignorant unconverted men, we diſgrace them as in that condition to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and lay it on as plainly as we can ſpeak, and tell them of their ſin, and ſhame, and miſery: and we expect, not only that they ſhould bear all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, but take al thankfully; and we have good reaſon for all this: And moſt that I deal with do take it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and many groſs ſinners will commend the cloſeſt Preachers moſt, and will ſay that they care not for hearing a man that will not tell them plainly of their ſins. But if we ſpeak to a godly Miniſter, againſt his errours or any ſin, (for too many of them) if we honour them and reverence them, and ſpeak as ſmoothly as we are able to ſpeak, yea if we mixt commendations with our contradictions or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, if the applauſe be not apparently predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo as to drown all the force of the reproof or confutation, and if it be not more an applauſe then a reprehenſion, they take it as an injury almoſt inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. That is <hi>railing</hi> againſt them, that would be no
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99578:129"/>
better then <hi>flatterie</hi> in them to the common people; though the cauſe may be as great.</p>
               <p>Brethren, I know this is a ſad and harſh confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! but that all this ſhould be ſo among us, ſhould be more grievous to us then to be told of it. Could this nakedneſs be hid, I ſhould not have diſcloſed it, at leaſt ſo openly in the view of all. But alas it is long ago open in the eyes of the world: We have diſhonoured our ſelves by idolizing our honour; We print our ſhame, and preach our ſhame, and tell it unto all. Some will think that I ſpeak over charitably to call ſuch perſons Godly men, in whom ſo great a ſin doth ſo much preval. I know where it is indeed predominant, not hated, and bewailed, and mortified in the main, there can be no true godlineſs; and I leave every man to a cautelous jealouſie and ſearch of his own heart; But if all be Graceleſs that are guilty of any, or moſt of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſcoveries of Pride, the Lord be merciful to the Miniſters of this Land, and give us quickly another ſpirit; for grace is then a rarer thing then moſt of us have ſuppoſed it to be.</p>
               <p>Yet I muſt needs ſay that it is not <hi>all</hi> that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; To the praiſe of Grace be it ſpoken, we have ſome among us here, (and I doubt not but it is ſo in other parts) that are eminent in humility and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs and condeſcention, and exemplary herein to their flocks and to their Brethren: and it is their glory and ſhall be their glory; and maketh them truly honourable and amiable in the eyes of God and all good men; yea and in the eyes of the ungodly themſelves: And O that the reſt of us were but ſuch! But alas this is not the caſe of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:99578:129"/>
O that the Lord would lay us at his feet, in the tears of unfeigned ſorrow for this ſin! Brethren, may I take leave a little to expoſtulate this caſe with my own heart and you, that we may ſee the ſhame of our ſin and be reformed? Is not Pride the ſin of Devils? the firſt-born of Hell? is it not that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Satans Image doth much conſiſt? and is it tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable evil in a man that is ſo engaged againſt him and his Kingdom as we are? The very deſign of the Goſpel doth tend to ſelf abaſing; and the work of grace is begun and carried on in Humiliation. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is not a meer ornament of a Chriſtian, but an eſſential part of the new creature. It is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be a ſanctified man, or a true Chriſtian, and not humble. All that will be Chriſtians muſt be Chriſts Diſciples, and <hi>come to him to learn;</hi> and their leſſon is, to <hi>be meek and lowly, Mat.</hi> 11. 28. O how many precepts and admirable examples hath our Lord and maſter given us to this end? Can we once conceive of him as purpoſely waſhing and wiping his ſervants feet, and yet be ſtout and Lordly ſtill? ſhall he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the meaneſt, and we avoid them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible people, and think none but perſons of riches and honour to be fit for our ſociety? How many of us are oftner found in the houſes of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, then in the poor cottages of thoſe that have moſt need of our help? There are many of us that would think it a baſeneſs, to be daily with the moſt needy and beggarly people, to inſtruct them in the matters of life, and ſupply their wants? As if we had taken charge only of the ſouls of the rich! Alas what is it that we have to be proud of? Of our body? why, are they not made of the like
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99578:130"/>
materials as the brutes? and muſt they not ſhortly be as loathſom and abominable as the dung? is it of our Graces? Why the more we are proud of them, the leſs we have to be proud of. And when ſo much of the nature of Grace is in Humility its a great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity to be proud of it. Is it of our Learning, Knowledge, abilities and gifts? Why ſure if we have any knowledge at all, we muſt needs know much reaſon to be humble; and if we know more then others, we muſt know more reaſon then others do to be humble. How little is it that the moſt Learned know, in compariſon of that which yet they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of? And to know that things are paſt your reach, and to know how ignorant you are, one would think ſhould be no great cauſe of Pride! However, do not the Devils know more then you? And will you be Proud of that which the Devils do excell you in? Yea to ſome I may ſay as <hi>Salvian, li.</hi> 4. <hi>de Gubern. p.</hi> 98. <hi>Quid tibi blandiris O homo quiſquis es, Credulitate, quae ſine timore atque obſequio Dei nulla eſt? aliquid plus Daemones habent. Tu emin unam rem habes tantummodo; illi duat. Tu Credulitatem habes; non habes timorem: illi &amp; Credulitatem habent pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; timorem.</hi> Our very buſineſs is to teach the great leſſon of ſelf-denyal and humility to our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and how unfit is it then that we ſhould be proud our ſelves? We muſt ſtudy Humility, and Preach Humility; and muſt we not poſſeſs and practice it? A proud Preacher of Humility, is at leaſt a ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning man.</p>
               <p>What a ſad caſe is it that ſo vile a ſin is no more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned by us? but many that are moſt Proud, can blame it in others, and take no notice of it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99578:130"/>
The world takes notice of ſome among us, that they have aſpiring minds, and ſeek for the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt room, and muſt be the Rulers, and bear the ſway where-ever they come, or elſe there is no ſtanding before them. No man muſt contradict them that will not partake of the fruits of their indignation: In any conſultations, they come not to ſearch after truth, but to dictate to others that perhaps are fit to teach them. In a word, they have ſuch arrogant domineering ſpirits, that the world rings of it; and yet they will not ſee it in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Brethren I deſire to deal cloſely with my own heart and yours. I beſeech you conſider. Whether it will ſave us to ſpeak well of the grace that we are without? or to ſpeak againſt the ſin that we live in? Have not many of us cauſe to enquire once &amp; again, Whether ſincerity will conſiſt with ſuch a meaſure of Pride? When we are telling the drunkard that he cannot be ſaved unleſs he become temperate, and the fornicator, that he cannot be ſaved unleſs he become chaſte (an undoubted truth); have we not as great reaſon if we are proud, to ſay of our ſelves, that we cannot be ſaved unleſs we become humble? Certainly, Pride is a greater ſin then whoredom or drunkenneſs: and Humility is as neceſſary as Chaſtity and Sobriety. Truly Brethren, a man may as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more ſlily and dangerouſly, make haſte to hell in a way of Profeſſion and earneſt preaching of the Goſpel, and ſeeming zeal for a Holy life, as in a way of drunkenneſs and filthyneſs. For what is true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs but a devotedneſs to God and a living to him? and what is a wicked and damnable ſtate, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votedneſs to our carnal ſelves, and a living to our
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99578:131"/>
ſelves? And doth any man live more to himſelf then the proud? or leſs to God? And may not Pride make a Preacher ſtudy for himſelf, and pray, and preach, and live to himſelf, even when he ſeemeth to out-go others in the work, if he therefore out-go them that he may have the glory of it from men? It is not the work without the principle and end that will prove us upright. The work may be Gods, and yet we do it, not for God but for our ſelves. I confeſs I feel ſuch continual danger in this point, that if I do not watch againſt it, leaſt I ſhould ſtudy for my ſelf, and preach for my ſelf, and write for my ſelf, rather then for Chriſt, I ſhould ſoon miſcarry; and after all, I juſtifie not my ſelf, when I muſt condemn the ſin. Conſider I beſeech you Brethren, what baits there are in the work of the Miniſtery, to entice a man to be ſelfiſh, that is, to be carnal and impious, even in the higheſt works of piety! The fame of a godly man is as great a ſnare as the fame of a learned man: And woe to him that takes up with the fame of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs inſtead of godlineſs. Verily I ſay unto you, they have their reward. When the times were all for learning and empty formalities, then the Temptation of the proud did lie that way; But now through the unſpeakable mercy of God, the moſt lively practical preaching is in credit, and godlineſs it ſelf is in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: and now the Temptation to Proud men is here, even to pretend to be zealous Preachers and godly men. O what a fine thing doth it ſeem to have the people crowd to hear us, and to be affected with what we ſay, and then we can command their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Affections! What a taking thing is it to be cryed up as the ableſt and godlyeſt man in the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99578:131"/>
Countrey! and to be famed through the Land for the higheſt ſpiritual excellencies. Alas Brethren a little grace will ſerve turn to make you to joyn your ſelves with the forwardeſt of thoſe men, that have theſe inducements or encouragements. To have the people plead for you as their felicity, and call you the Pillars of the Church of God, and their Fathers, the Chariots and horſe-men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and no lower language then excellent men, and able Divines and to have them depend upon you and be ruled by you; though this may be no more then their duty, yet I muſt again tell you, that a little grace may ſerve to make you ſeem zealous men for this. Nay Pride may do it without any ſpecial Grace. O therefore be jealous of your ſelves, and in all your ſtudies, be ſure to ſtudy Humility. <hi>He that exalieth himſelf ſhall be brought low, and he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</hi> I obſerve commonly that almoſt all men good and bad do loath the Proud, and love the Humble: ſo far doth Pride contradict it ſelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be where it purpoſely hideth it ſelf, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of its own deformity doth borrow the homely dreſs of humility. And we have cauſe to be the more jealous, becauſe it is the moſt radicated vice, and as hardly as any extirpated from the ſoul. <hi>Nam ſaepe ſibi de ſe mens ipſa mentitur, &amp; fingit ſe de bono opere amare quod non amat; de mundi autem gloria, non amare quod amat; inquit Gregor.

               <p n="2">2. ANother ſin the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> and much more of many other Churches, are ſadly guilty of, is, <hi>An undervaluing the Unity and Peace of the whole Church.</hi> Though I ſcarce ever met with any that will not ſpeak for Unity and Peace, or at leaſt, that will expreſly ſpeak againſt it: yet is it not common to meet with thoſe that are addicted to promote it; but too commonly do we find men averſe to it, and jealous of it, if not themſelves the inſtruments of diviſion. The Papiſts have ſo long abuſed the name of the Catholike Church, that in oppoſition to them many do either put it out of their Creeds, or only fill up a room with the name, while they underſtand not or conſider not the nature of the thing; or think it enough to <hi>believe</hi> that there is ſuch a Body, though they behave not themſelves as ſenſible members of it. If the Papiſts will Idolize the Church, ſhall we therefore deny it, diſregard it, or divide it? It is a great and common ſin through the Chriſtian world, to take up Religion in a way of faction; and inſtead of a love and tender care of the Univerſal Church, to confine that love and reſpect to a party. Not but that we muſt prefer in our eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Communion the purer parts before the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, and refuſe to participate with any in their ſins; but the moſt infirm and diſeaſed part ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionated and aſſiſted to our utmoſt power; and communion muſt be held as far as is lawful, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99578:133"/>
avoided but upon the urgency of neceſſity: As we muſt love thoſe of our neighbourhood that have the plague or leproſie, and afford them all the relief we can, and acknowledge all our juſt relations to them, and communicate to them, though we may not have local Communion with them: and in other diſeaſes which are not ſo infectious, we may be the more with them for their help, by how much the more they need it. Of the multitude that ſay they are of the Catholike Church, it is too rare to meet with men of a Catholike Spirit: Men have not an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conſideration of and reſpect to the whole Church; but look upon their own party as if it were the whole. If there be ſome called <hi>Lutherans,</hi> ſome <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> ſome (among theſe) of ſubordinate divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſo of other parties among us, moſt of them will pray hard for the proſperity of their party, and rejoyce and give thanks accordingly, when it goes well with them: but if any other party ſuffer, they little regard it, as if it were no loſs at all to the Church If it be the ſmalleſt parcel that poſſeſſeth not many Nations, no nor Cities on earth, they are ready to carry it as if they were the whole Church, and as if it went well with the Church when it gots well with them. We cry down the Pope as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt for including the Church in the Romiſh pale, and no doubt but it is an abominable ſchiſm: But alas how many do imitate them too far, while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them! And as they foiſt the word <hi>Roman</hi> into their Creed, and turn the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> into <hi>the Roman Catholike Church:</hi> as if there were no other Catholikes, and the Church were of no larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; ſo is it with many others as to their ſeveral
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99578:133"/>
parties. Some will have it to be the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, and ſome the Reformed Catholike Church (as if it were all reformed) ſome the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt Catholike Church, and ſo of ſome others. And if they differ not among themſelves, they are little troubled at differing from others, though it be from almoſt all the Chriſtian world. The Peace of their party, they take for the Peace of the Church: No wonder therefore if they carry it no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>How rare is it to meet with a man that ſmarteth or bleedeth with the Churches wounds, or ſenſibly tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to heart as his own? or that ever had ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous thoughts of a cure? No but almoſt every Party thinks that the happineſs of the reſt conſiſteth only in turning to them; and becauſe they be not of their mind, they cry, <hi>Down with them,</hi> and are glad to hear of their fall, as thinking that is the way to the Churches riſing; that is, their own. How few be there that underſtand the true ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between the ſeveral parties? or that ever well diſcerned how many of them are but Verbal, and how many are Real? And if thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it do in order to right information and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, diſcloſe it to others, its taken as an exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of their error, and a carnal complyance with them in their ſin. Few men grow zealous of Peace, till they grow old, or have much experience of mens ſpirits and principles, and ſee better the true ſtate of the Church, and the ſeveral differences, then they did before. And then they begin to write their <hi>Irenicon's;</hi> and many ſuch are extant at this day. <hi>Pareus, Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and many more have done their parts; as our
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99578:134"/>
                  <hi>Davenant, Morton, Hall,</hi> (whoſe excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe called the <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> and his <hi>Pax terris,</hi> deſerve to be tranſcribed upon all our hearts) <hi>Hattonus, Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus</hi> alſo have done: But <hi>recipiuntur ad modum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipientis;</hi> As a young man in his heat of luſt and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was judged to be no fit auditor of Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy; ſo we find that thoſe ſame young men who may be zealous for Peace and Unity, when they are grown more experienced, are zealous for their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt theſe in their youthful heat. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as theſe before mentioned, and <hi>Duraeus</hi> who hath made it the buſineſs of his life, do ſeldom do much greater good then to quiet their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in the diſcharge of ſo great a duty, and to moderate ſome few and ſave them from further guilt, and to leave behind them when they are dead, a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt a wilful, ſelf-conceited and unpeaceable world.</p>
               <p>Nay commonly it bringeth a man under ſuſpition either of favouring ſome hereſie, or abating his zeal, if he do but attempt a pacificatory work. As if there were no zeal neceſſary for the great fundamental ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities for the Churches Unity and Peace, but only for parties and ſome particular truths.</p>
               <p>And a great advantage the Devil hath got this way, by imploying his own Agents, the unhappy Socinians in writing ſo many Treatiſes for Catholike and Arch-catholike Unity and Peace, which they did for their own ends, and would have done it on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient terms: By which means the enemy of Peace hath brought it to paſs that whoever maketh motion for Peace, is preſently under ſuſpition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one that hath need of it for an indulgence to his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99578:134"/>
own Errors. A fearful caſe! that hereſie ſhould be ſo credited, as if none were ſuch friends to Unity and Peace as they! And that ſo great and neceſſary a duty, upon which the Churches wellfare doth ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, ſhould be brought into ſuch ſuſpition or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
               <p>Brethren, I ſpeak not all this without apparent reaſon. We have as ſad diviſions among us in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> conſidering the piety of the perſons, and the ſmallneſs of the matter of our diſcord, as moſt Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under heaven have known. The moſt that keeps us at odds is but about the right form and order of Church-Government. Is the diſtance ſo great that Presbyterian, Epiſcopal and Independent <hi>might</hi> not be well agreed? Were they but heartily willing and forward for peace, they <hi>might,</hi> I know they <hi>might.</hi> I have ſpoken with ſome moderate men of all the parties, and I perceive by their conceſſions it were an eaſie work. Were mens hearts but ſenſible of the Churches caſe, and unfeignedly touched with Love to one another, and did they but heartily ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſeek it, the ſettling of a ſafe and happy Peace were an eaſie work. If we could not in every point agree, we might eaſily find out, and narrow out differences, and hold Communion upon our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the main; determining of the ſafeſt way for the managing of our few and ſmall diſagreements, without the danger or trouble of the Church. But is this much done? It is not done. To the ſhame of all our faces be it ſpoken, it is not done. Let each party flatter themſelves now as they pleaſe, it will be recorded to the ſhame of the Miniſtery of <hi>England,</hi> while the Goſpel ſhall abide in the Chriſtian world.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99578:135"/>
What will be recorded? What? Why this; That learned and godly Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> did firſt diſagree among themſelves, and head and lead on their people in thoſe diſagreements! That they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in them for the ſpace of 14. years (already; how much more will be, God knows) and in all that time had as great advantages and opportunities for Agreement, as any people in the world. They had the ſad experience of the conflagration of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and were ſcourged to it by a calamitous war. They ſaw the fearful confuſions in the Church; and the perverting of multitudes of ſeduced ſouls, ſome to be Seekers, ſome Socinians, ſome Ranters, Quakers or Infidels; They ſaw the continual exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of minds, and the jealouſies and bitterneſs that their diſtance bred, and how it was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uel of a daily courſe of ſin. And yet for all theſe, they were not moved to effectual endeavours for a cure. They could let a courſe of ſin run on: they could let divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and hereſies increaſe, they ſee the Church of Chriſt ſo low, and yet forbear the cheapeſt cure, that ever a people could be called to uſe. They could ſee, and hear, and know that we were all made a very deriſion to our enemies, and the publike ſcorn or pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the world; and yet ſet ſtill, as if all this were little to them. They had Magiſtrates that did not hinder them from the work: but gave them full liberty to have conſulted and endeavoured a full agreement. They lived neer together, and might have eaſily met together for the work: and if one or two or an hundred meetings could not have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht it, they might have held on till it was done. And yet for all this there is no ſuch thing done, not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99578:135"/>
any conſiderable attempt yet made. And O what hainous aggravations do accompany this ſin? Never men ſince the Apoſtles daies I think, did make grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter profeſsion of godlineſs: The moſt of them are bound by ſolemn Oathes and Covenants, for unity and reformation: They all confeſs the worth of peace: and moſt of them will preach for it, and talk for it, while they ſet ſtill and neglect it, as if it were not worth the looking after: They will read and preach on thoſe Texts that command men to <hi>follow peace with all men, and as much as in us lyeth if it be poſſible, to live peaceably with them:</hi> and yet we are ſo far from following it, and doing all that poſſibly we can for it, that too many will ſnarl at it, and malign and cenſure any that endeavour it, as if all zeal for Peace did proceed from an abatement of our zeal for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and as if holineſs and peace were ſo fallen out that there were no reconciling them; when yet they have found by long experience, that concord is a ſure friend to Piety, and Piety alwaies moves to Concord. We have ſeen how Errors and Hereſies breed by Diſcord as Diſcord is bred and fed by them. We have ſeen to our ſorrow, that where the ſervants of God ſhould live together as one, of one heart and one ſoul, and one lip, and ſhould promote each others faith and holineſs, and admoniſh and aſſiſt each other againſt ſin, and rejoyce together in the hope of their future glory, we have contrarily lived in mutual jealouſies, and drowned holy love in bitter contendings, and have ſtudyed to diſgrace and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine one another, and to increaſe our own parties by right or wrong; and we, that were wont to glory of our Love to the Brethren as the certain mark of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99578:136"/>
our ſincerity in the faith, have now turned it into a Love of a Party only; and thoſe that are againſt that Party have more of our ſpleen, and envy, and malice then our love. I know this is not ſo with all (nor prevalently with any true Believer) but yet it is ſo common that it may cauſe us to queſtion the ſincerity of many that are thought by themſelves and others to be moſt ſincere. And it is not our ſelves only that are ſcorched in this flame, but we have drawn our people into it, and cheriſhed them in it, ſo that moſt of the godly in the Nation are fallen into ſeveral parties, and have turned much of their antient Piety into vain Opinions, and vain Diſputes, and envyings, and animoſities; Yea whereas it was wont to be made the certain mark of a graceleſs wretch to deride the godly, how few be there now that ſtick at ſecret deriding and ſlandering thoſe that are not of their opinion? A pious Prelatical man can reverently ſcorn and ſlander a Presbyterian; and ſome of them an Independent, and an Independent both. And, which is the worſt of all: the common ignorant people take notice of all this, and do not only deride us, but are hardened by us againſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and when we go about to perſwade them to be Religious, they ſee ſo many Parties, that they know not which to joyn with, and think that it is as good be of none at all as of any, when they are uncertain which is the right; And thus thouſands are grown into a contempt of all Religions by our diviſions; and poor carnal wretches begin to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the better caſe of the two, becauſe they hold to their old formalities, when we hold to nothing Yea, and theſe Pious contenders do more effectually
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99578:136"/>
plead the Devils cauſe againſt one another, then any of the ignorant people can do; They can prove one another Deceivers and Blaſphemers, and what not? and this by ſecret ſlanders among all that they can handſomly vent them to; and perhaps alſo by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſputations and Printed ſlanderous books. So that when the obſtinate drunkards are at a loſs, and have nothing to ſay of their own againſt a man that would drive them from their ſin they are prompted by the raling books or reports of factious zealous malice; Then they can ſay, <hi>I regard him not nor his Doctrine; ſuch a man hath proved him a Deceiver and a Blaſphemer; Let him anſwer him if he can.</hi> And thus the lyes and ſlanders of ſome (for that is no news) and the bitter opprobriou, ſpeeches of others, have more effectually done the Devils ſervice, under the name of Orthodoxneſs and Zeal for Truth, then the malignant ſcorners of Godlineſs could have done it. So that the matter is come to that paſs, that there are few men of note of any party, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the other parties are ſo publikly upon them, that the ignorant and wicked rabble that ſhould be converted by them, have learnt to be Orthodox and to vilifie and ſcorn them. Miſtake me not! I do not ſlight Orthodoxneſs nor jeer at the name; but diſcloſe the pretences of Deviliſh Zeal, in Pious or ſeemingly Pious men. If you are offended with me for my harſh language, becauſe I can tell you that I learnt it of God I dare be bold therefore to tell you further, that you have far more cauſe to be offended at your Satanical Practices. The thing it ſelf is ſure odious, if the name be ſo odious as to turn your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks How ſhould the preſence and guilt of it terrifie
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99578:137"/>
you, if the name make you ſtart? I know that many of theſe Reverend Calumniators do think that they ſhew that ſoundneſs in the fairh, and love to truth which others want. But I will reſolve the caſe in the words of the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. <hi>Who is a wiſe man, and endued with knowledge among you? Let him ſhew out of a good converſation his works with meekneſs of wiſdom; But, if you have bitter envying (or zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) and ſtrife in your hearts, glory not, and lye not againſt the Truth; This wiſdom deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh. For where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying (or zeal) and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work: But the wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, without hypocriſie: And the fruit of Righteouſneſs is ſown in peace of them that make Peace.</hi> I pray you read theſe words again and again, and ſtudy them.</p>
               <p>O doleful caſe to think of; that a while ago we were afraid of nothing, but leaſt Papiſts and Deboiſt perſons ſhould have ſwallowed up the Goſpel and our liberty, and deſtroyed us together; And now when the work hath been put into the hands of thoſe men, that were joyned in theſe fears, and are joyned in the ſtricteſt profeſsion of Piety, and are of one judgement in all the Articles of the faith; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not or will not unanimouſly joyn in carrying on the work; but they either fall upon one another, or live at a diſtance, and caſt their work upon a hundred diſadvantages by the bitter diſagreements that are among themſelves. O what a Nation might <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have been ere now, if it had not been for the proud and obſtinate contentions of godly Miniſters?
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99578:137"/>
What abundance of good might we have done! Nay, what might we not have done, if our perverſneſs had not marr'd our work? Did we but agree among our ſelves, our words would have ſome Authority with the people; But when they ſee us ſome of one mind, and ſome of another, and ſnarling and reviling at each other, they think they may well enough do ſo too: Why may not we call them Sectaries or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, ſay they, when they call one another ſo? Nay, if we were not all of a mind in ſome ſmaller matters, yet if we did but hold Communion and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency, and joyn together in the main, and do as much of Gods work as we can in concurrent una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, the people would far more regard us, and we might be in a greater capacity to do them good: But when we are ſingle, they ſleight us; and when we diſagree and divide, they deſpiſe us: and who can marvel at it, when we deſpiſe one another? What, ſay they, (when a Miniſter doth his duty alone) <hi>Muſt we he ruled by every ſingular man? Are you wiſer then all the Miniſters in the Countrey? Are not ſuch and ſuch as learned as you?</hi> But when we go hand in hand, it ſtops their mouths. They think either themſelves may be wiſer then one or two Miniſters, or at leaſt, other Miniſters may be wiſer then they; but common modeſty will not ſuffer them to think that they are wiſer then all the Miniſters in the Country, or in the world. I know that matters of faith are not to be received upon our credit alone: but yet our credit may do much to remove prejudice, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block the entrance into mens minds, and procure the truth a more equal hearing, and therefore is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our peoples good.</p>

For he that would have a Miniſter under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, would have him uſeleſs; which is next to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing him, and tendeth to the ſame end. You will ſay, we do not deſire that he ſhould be diſabled to do good, but to do hurt. I anſwer; but the queſtion is, Whether his error be ſo great, that the holding or propagating it doth more hurt, then all his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the labours of that whole party which you would diſgrace, is like to do good? If ſo, then I think it is a deſirable work to diſgrace him, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence him in a juſt meaſure, and by juſt means, and I would concurr therein; but if it be otherwiſe, we are bound to keep up that reputation of others, which is neceſſary ordinarily to the ſucceſs of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>I may not here without wrong to my conſcience, paſs over the late practiſes of ſome of our Brethren of the <hi>New Prelatical way;</hi> (For thoſe of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Prelacy are more moderate.) I know it will be diſpleaſing to them: and I have no mind to diſpleaſe them: but yet I will more avoid the treacherous or unfaithful ſilence which may wrong them, then the words of faithful friendſhip, which may diſpleaſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99578:138"/>
them. And I will ſay no more to them, then (if I know my ſelf) I ſhould ſay if I were reſolved for Prelacy. It is the judgement of theſe men that I now ſpeak of, that a Prelate is eſſential to a Church, and there is no Church without them; and that their Ordination is of neceſsity to the eſſence of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and that thoſe that are ordained without them (though ſome will except a caſe of neceſſity) are not Miniſters of Chriſt. Hereupon they conclude that our Congregations in <hi>England</hi> are no true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (except where the Presbyter dependeth on ſome Prelate) and the Miniſters ordained by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters only are no true Miniſters; and they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men to hear them or communicate with them, but withdraw from our Congregations like Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts or Recuſants. And the ſame note many of them brand upon all the Reformed Churches abroad, that have no Prelates, as they do on us: So that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is admirably gratified by it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of demanding where our Church vvas before <hi>Luther,</hi> they begin to demand of us, Where it is now? And indeed had it been no more viſible in the ages before <hi>Luther</hi> then a Reformed Prelatical Church is now, they would have a fairer pretence then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow they have, to call upon us for the proof of its viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Suppoſe that the Presbyters who rejected Prelacy were guilty of all that ſchiſm and other ſin, as they are ordinarily accuſed of. (For I will now go on ſuch ſuppoſitions.) Muſt the people therefore turn their back on the Aſſemblies and Ordinances of God? Is it better for them to have no preaching, and no Sacraments, and no publike Communion in Gods worſhip, then to have it in an Aſſembly that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99578:139"/>
hath not a Prelate over it; or from a Miniſter or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained without his conſent? I confeſs I would not for all the world ſtand guilty before God of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that this Doctrine hath already done to mens ſouls, much leſs of what it evidently tendeth to. There are through the great mercy of God, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of painful and able young Miniſters, that were in the Univerſities in the time of the wars, and had no hand in it, and were ordained ſince Biſhops became to them either inviſible, or inacceſtible; and its like they judge not <hi>their</hi> Ordination to be of neceſſity. They lay out themſelves faithfully for the healing of that ignorance and common prophaneneſs which got ſo much head under their careleſs or drunken prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. They deſire nothing more then the ſaving of ſouls; They preach ſound Doctrine: They live in Peace. And it is the greateſt of their grief that many of their hearers remain ſo ignorant and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſtill. And ſee what a help theſe poor impenitent ſinners have for their cure? They are taught to turn their backs upon their Teachers; and whereas before they heard them but with diſregard, they are now taught not to hear them at all. And if we privately ſpeak to them, they can tell us that its the Judgement of ſuch and ſuch learned men, that we are not to be heard, nor our Churches to be communicated with, nor we to be at all regarded as Chriſts Miniſters. And thus Drunkards, and Swearers, and worldlings, and all ſorts of ſenſualiſts are got out of gun-ſhot, and beyond the reach of our teaching or reproof: And thoſe that do not (for ſhame of the world) obey their Doctrine to ſtay from the Aſſembly, yet do they there hear us with prejudice and contempt, and from
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99578:139"/>
the Communion of the Church in the Lords Supper they commonly abſtain. Were it only the caſe of thoſe few Civil perſons, that conſcientiouſly go this way, and addreſs themſelves to theſe kind of men for Government and Sacraments, I would never have mentioned the thing; For it is not them that I intend. For what care I what Miniſter they hear or obey, ſo it be one that leadeth them in the waies of truth and holineſs? Let them follow Chriſt and forſake their ſins, and go to heaven, and I will never much contend with them for the forſaking of my Conduct. But it is the common ſort of prophane and ſenſual men, that are everywhere hardened againſt the Miniſtery, and they have nothing but the reputation of the Prelatical Divines to countenance it with. If their Teachers do but differ in a geſture from theſe men, they vilifie them, and reject their guidance, having nothing but the authority of ſuch men to ſupport them. Fain would we reach their conſciences to awaken them from their ſecurity; for it pittyeth us to ſee them ſo neer unto perdition. But we can do no good upon them; for our Miniſtery is in contempt becauſe of the contrary judgement of theſe men. Not that the poor people care any more for a Prelate, as ſuch, then for an ordinary Miniſter: For if Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates would have troubled them as much with their preaching, and reproofs, and diſcipline, they would have hated them as much as they do the Miniſters: But becauſe they found by experience, that under their Government they might ſin quietly, and make a ſcorn of godlineſs without any danger or trouble, and that to this day, the men of that way are ſo much againſt thoſe preciſe Miniſters, that will not let them
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99578:140"/>
go quietly to hell, therefore are they all for Prelacy, and make this the great ſhelter for their diſobedience and unreformed lives. So that I confeſs I think that the hurt that Separatiſts and Anabaptiſts do in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at this day, is little to the hurt that is done by theſe men. For I count that the greateſt hurt, which hardeneth the greateſt number in the ſtate and way of greateſt danger. An Anabaptiſt may yet be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and godly perſon, and be ſaved; But the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and impenitent worldlings can never be ſaved in that condition. I ſee by experience, that if ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on infect two or three, or half a ſcore in a Pariſh; or if Anabaptiſtry infect as many (and perhaps nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them mortally) this obſtinate contempt of Miniſterial exhortation, encouraged by the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the contrary minded, doth infect them by the ſcores or hundreds. If we come to them in a caſe where they have no countenance from the Miniſtery, how mute, or tractable comparatively do we find them! But if it be a caſe where they can but ſay, that the Prelatical Divines are of another judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how unmoveable are they, though they have nothing elſe to ſay? Try when we come to ſet afoot this work that we are now upon, of Catechizing and private inſtruction, whether this will not be one of our greateſt impediments; though in a work of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtioned lawfulneſs and neceſſity: Even becauſe they are taught that we are none of their Paſtors, and have no authority over them. I know that ſome of theſe men are Learned and Reverend, and intend not ſuch miſchievous ends as theſe. The hardening of men in ignorance is not their deſign. But this is the thing effected. To intend well in doing ill, is no
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99578:140"/>
rarity. Who can in reverence to any men on earth, ſit ſtill and hold his tongue, while he ſeeth people thus run to their own deſtruction, and the ſouls of men be undone by the contendings of Divines for their ſeveral parties and intereſts? The Lord that knows my heart, knows that (if I know it my ſelf) as I am not of any one of theſe parties, ſo I ſpeak not a word of this in a ſactious partiality, for one party, or againſt another, as ſuch; much leſs in ſpleen againſt any perſon; but if I durſt in conſcience, I would have ſilenced all this, for fear of giving them offence whom I much honour: But what am I but a ſervant of Chriſt? and what is my life worth, but to do him ſervice? and whoſe favour can recompence for the ruines of the Church? and who can be ſilent while ſouls are undone? Not I for my part, while God is my Maſter, and his word my Rule; his work my buſineſs: and the ſucceſs of it, for the ſaving of men, my end. Who can be reconciled to that which ſo lamentably croſſeth his Maſters intereſt, and his main end? Nor yet would I have ſpoken any of this, if it had been only in reſpect to my own charge; yet I bleſs God, the ſore is but ſmall, in compariſon of what it is in many other places. But the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome neighbour Congregations and others more remote, me thinks, ſhould make the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minded Divines relent, if they were preſent with them.</p>
               <p>Would it be a pleaſant hearing to them, to hear a croud of ſcandalous men to reproach their Miniſters that would draw them to repentance, and to tell them they have no authority over them, and all this under the pretence and ſhelter of their judgements?
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99578:141"/>
Had they rather men went to Hell, then be taught the way to Heaven by Presbyters that had not their Impoſition of hands? Is that point of order more neceſſary then the ſubſtance of the work, or the end it ſelf? Nay, I muſt needs in faithfulneſs ſay yet more; That it is no credit to the cauſe of theſe Reverend men, nor ever was, that the generality of the moſt wicked men, and haters and contemners of all Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are the great friends and maintainers of it. And the befriending of ſuch a party did more to gain their love, then to ſave their ſouls. And the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Party for them, hath not been the leaſt cauſe of their fall. This is true, however it be taken.</p>
               <p>And what a caſe would the Churches of <hi>England</hi> be in, if we ſhould yield to the motions of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend men! ſuppoſing that mens judgements are not at their own wills, and therefore many cannot ſee the reaſons for Prelacy; muſt we all give up our charges as no true Miniſters, and deſert the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations as no true Churches? Why, whom will they then ſet over them in our ſtead? Firſt, it is known that they cannot, if they had fit men, procure them what liberty their way requires, becauſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance of authority; and it is known that they have not fit men for one Congregation of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And had they rather that the doors were ſhut up, and God had no publike worſhip, nor the people any publike teaching or Sacraments, then any but they ſhould have a hand in the performance of it? Or if the Miniſters keep their places, can they wiſh all the Congregations to ſtay at home, and live like Heathens? Nay, are they not angry with us for
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99578:141"/>
caſting out a groſly ignorant, inſufficient, ſcandalous ſort of Miniſters, who were the great means of the perdition of the people, whoſe ſouls they had taken charge of? As for the caſting out of any able god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men upon meer differences about the late troubles and State affairs; I ſpeak not of it, I approve not of it; If any ſuch thing were done, let them maintain it if they can that did it; for I neither can nor will. But its a very ſad caſe, that any men of judgement &amp; piety ſhould not only be indifferent in matters of ſuch moment, but ſhould think it a perſecution and an injury to their party and cauſe, to have hundreds of unworthy wretches to be ejected, when it was a work of ſo great neceſſity to the Church.</p>
               <p>And indeed by all this they plainly ſhew what a condition they would reduce this Nation into again, if it were in their power. Sure they that would have the people diſown and withdraw from them as being no Miniſters, and turn their backs on the word and Sacraments, would ſilence them if they could: I think there is no doubt of that. And ſurely they that are ſo offended that the inſufficient and ſcandalous ones are caſt out, would have them in again if they could. And if this be the change that they deſire, let them not blame men that believe the Scripture, and value mens ſalvation, if they have no mind of their change. If it were a matter of meer opinion, we ſhould be more indifferent with them: Or if the queſtion were only whether men ſhould be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in waies of holineſs by a Prelate, or by meer Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters only, we ſhould think it of leſs moment, then the matter that is before us: But when it comes to this paſs, that the Prince of darkneſs muſt be ſo
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99578:142"/>
gratified. and ſo much of the Church of Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered overmuch into his power, and the people led by multitudes to perdition, and all for the upholding of our own parties, or intereſts, or conceits; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make light of ſuch matters as theſe: Theſe are not meer ſpeculations, but matters that are ſo obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſenſe and Chriſtian experience, that they muſt not think much that ſerious experienced Chriſtians are againſt them.</p>
               <p>But that I be not miſtaken, it is far from my thoughts to ſpeak what I have done of any peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man of the Prelatical way, or to meddle in the Controverſie of the beſt way of Government; nor do I ſpeak to any of the New Prelatical way, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who are guilty of the miſcarriages which I have ſpoken of; and for them, I had rather bear their indignation, then the Church ſhould bear the fruits of their deſtructive intemperate conceits.</p>
               <p>The moſt common cauſe of our Diviſions and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceableneſs, is, mens high eſtimation of their own Opinions. And it ordinarily worketh theſe two waies; ſometimes by ſetting men upon Novelties; and ſometimes by a cenſorious condemning of all that differ from the party that they are of.</p>
               <p>Some are as buſie in their enquiries after new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as if the Scripture were not perfect, or Chriſt had not told us all that is neceſſary; or the way to heaven were not in all ages one and the ſame, from Chriſt to the end of the world; or the Church were not ſtill the ſame thing. And they look not only after new diſcoveries in leſſer things, but they are making us new Articles of faith, &amp; framing out new waies to heaven. The body of Popery came in at this door;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99578:142"/>
Their new fundamentals were received on theſe terms; Their new Catholike Church, which their fore-fathers knew not, was thus ſet up. Before, it conſiſted of all Chriſtians through the world; and now it muſt conſiſt of none but the Popes ſubjects. So is it with the Anabaptiſts; They muſt now in the end of the world have a new Church for Chriſt, even in the natural capacity of the matter I Never ſince the creation can it be proved that God had any where a Church on earth where Infants were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from being members (if there were any among them.) They were members before the Law, under the Promiſe, under the Law, and under the Goſpel, through the Chriſtian world to this day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and yet they would needs make Chriſt a Church now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. As if Chriſt had miſt it in the forming of his Church till now! Or as if he begun to be awea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of infants in his Church now at laſt! Or as if the Providence of God did now begin to be awakened to have a right formed Church in the concluſion of the world, and to eject thoſe infants as incapable, who till now have been in the boſom of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>Yea this diſturbing vice doth alſo work by ſetting a higher rate of neceſſity upon ſome truths, then the Church of Chriſt had ever done; When we will needs make that to be of abſolute Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which hath been either not before received, or but as a dark &amp; doubtful thing; and we will make that to be of neceſſity to ſalvation, which the former ages did hold but as a point of a far lower nature, which ſome were for, and ſome againſt, without any great diſagreement or mutual cenſure. I confeſs I do hold
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99578:143"/>
ſome points of Doctrine my ſelf to be true, which I cannot find that the Church or any in it did hold of many ages after the Apoſtles; but then I cannot lay ſuch a ſtreſs on them, as to think them of flat neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the welfare of the Church, and the ſaving of ſouls; As the Doctrine of the certain perſeverance of all the Juſtified, and ſome few more: If I may think that <hi>Auſtin, Proſper,</hi> and all the Church in thoſe Ages did err therein (as I think they did): Yet to think that they erred fundamentally, were to think that Chriſt had no Church: I will not take the Judgement or Practice of the Church in any age ſince the Apoſtles as my Rule of faith and life: but I will ſuppoſe that they had all things in the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed age, that were of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I know that we muſt be Juſtified in the ſame way as they were, and upon the ſame terms. Faith is the ſame thing now as it was then; and hath the ſame object to apprehend for our Juſtification, and the ſame office in order to our Juſtification. Many new notions are brought in by Diſputers, which muſt not be made matters of neceſſity to the ſoundneſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the Churches faith. We may talk of Peace as long as we live; but we ſhall never obtain it but by returning to the Apoſtolical ſimplicity. The Papiſts faith is too big for all men to agree upon: or all their own, if they enforced it not with arguments drawn from the fire, the halter, and the ſtrappado. And many Anti-Papiſts do too much imitate them in the tedious length of their ſubſcribed Confeſſions, and novelty of impoſitions, when they go furtheſt from them in the quality of the things impoſed. I ſhall ſpeak my mind to theſe in the words of <hi>Vincentim</hi>

               <p>But the Pride of mens hearts doth make them ſo overvalve their own conceptions, that they expect all men elſe ſhould be of their mind, and bow down to thoſe reaſons which others can ſee through, while they are as confident as if there were no room for doubting. Every Sect is uſually confident in their own way, and as they value themſelves, ſo they do their reaſons. And hereupon ariſe ſuch breaches in affections and communion as there are, while moſt men cry down the diviſions of others, but maintain the like. Some will have no Communion with our Churches, becauſe we have ſome Members that they take to be ungodly, and do not pull up the Tares in doubtful unproved caſes, where we cannot do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pulling up the Wheat. Others are ſo confident that Infants ſhould be unbaptized, and out of the Church, that they will be of no Church that hath infant members, till theſe ſcandalous infants be (I ſay not excommunicated, for that ſuppoſeth a former right, but) taken as ſuch that have no part or fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the buſineſs, they will not joyn with ſuch a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99578:144"/>
ſociety; Chriſt telleth us, that except we become as little children, we ſhall not enter into his Kingdom; and they ſay, except little children be kept out of the Church, they will not enter or abide in it. Is not this extream height of ſpirit, to be ſo confident, as to avoid Communion upon it, in a caſe where the Church hath been in all ages (or almoſt all by their own confeſſion) ſo much againſt them? Would they not have ſeparated from the whole Church on the ſame ground, if they had lived in theſe times? Others (as is before ſaid) are ſo confident that we are no Miniſters or Churches for want of Prelatical Ordination and Government, that they ſeparate alſo, or deny Communion with us. And thus every party in the height of their ſelf-conceitedneſs is ready to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, &amp; condemn all others that be not of their mind.</p>
               <p>And it uſually falls out that this confidence doth but bewray mens ignorance, and that too many make up that in paſſion and wilfulneſs, which they want in reaſon. How many have I heard zealouſly condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they little underſtand? Its a far eaſier matter to ſay that another man is erroneous, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or rail at him as a deceiver or blaſphemer, then to give a ſound account of our belief. And as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member twenty years ago, I have obſerved it the common trick of a company of ignorant formal Preachers, to get the repute of that learning which they wanted, by railing at the Puritans, as being all unlearned: ſo is it now the trick of ſome that can ſcarce give a ſound reaſon for any controverted part of their belief, (nor it may be of the fundamentals) to uſe this as the chief remedy, to get the name of ſound Divines, by reproaching ſome that differ! from
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99578:144"/>
them, as unſound; and to be eſteemed Orthodox, by calling others Erroneous or Heterodox.</p>
               <p>The truth is, moſt Miniſters in the world do take up their opinions in complyance with their ſeveral parties; and they look more who believeth it, then what is believed, and on what ground, or they have nothing but what is ſpoken by the men that they muſt concurr with: And thus too many take up their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in a faction; even the truth it ſelf. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt ſpeak againſt thoſe that they hear that party ſpeak againſt. As <hi>Proſter</hi> ſaid of the detractors of <hi>Auſtin, Praef, ad capit. Gall.

               <p n="3">3. THE next ſin which I ſhall mention, that we are lamentably guilty of, is this; We do not ſo ſeriouſly, unreſervedly and induſtriouſly, lay out our ſelves in the work of the Lord, as beſeemeth men of our profeſſion and engagements. I bleſs the Lord that there are ſo many that do his work with all their might! But alas, for the moſt part, even of thoſe that we take for Godly Miniſters, how reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly and how negligently do we go through our work? How few of us do ſo behave our ſelves in our office, as men that are wholly devoted thereto, and have devoted all that they have to the ſame ends? And becauſe you ſhall ſee my grounds for this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, I ſhall mention to you ſome of the ſinful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of it, which do too much abound.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is too common with us to be negligent in our ſtudies; and few men will be at that pains that is neceſſary, for the right informing of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and fitting them for their further work. Some men have no delight in their ſtudies, but take only now and then an hour, as an unwelcome task which they are forced to undergo, and are glad when they are from under the yoak. Will neither the natural deſire of knowing, nor the ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of knowing God and things divine, nor the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99578:145"/>
conſciouſneſs of our great ignorance and weakneſs, nor the ſenſe of the weight of our Miniſterial work, will none of all theſe keep us cloſer to our ſtudies, and make us more painful in ſeeking after the truth? This diligence is now the more neceſſary for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, becauſe the Neceſsitie of the Church doth draw ſo many from the Univerſities ſo young, ſo that they are fain to Teach and Learn together: And for my part, I would not diſcourage ſuch young ones, ſo be it they be but competently qualified, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with earneſt deſires of mens ſalvation, and are drawn out by the preſent Neceſsities, ſooner then they would go, if the Church could longer wait for their preparation; and will but ſtudy hard in the Country. For I know that as Theologie is a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Science, ſo the knowledge of it ſhineth beſt in a practical courſe: And laying out here is a means of gathering in; and a hearty endeavour to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and do good, is not the ſmalleſt help to our own proficiency.

O what abundance of things are there that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſhould underſtand? and what a great defect is it to be ignorant of them? and how much ſhall we miſs ſuch knowledge in our work! Many Miniſters ſtudy only to compoſe their Sermons, and very little more, when there are ſo many books to be read, and ſo many matters that we ſhould not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. Nay in the ſtudy of our Sermons we are too negligent, gathering only a few naked heads, and not conſidering of the moſt forcible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions by which we ſhould ſet them home to mens hearts. We muſt ſtudy how to convince and get within men, and how to bring each truth to the quick, and not leave all this to our extemporarie promptitude, unleſs it be in caſes of neceſsity. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Brethren, experience will teach you, that men are not made learned or wiſe without hard ſtudy, and unwearied labours and experience.</p>

               <p n="2">2. IF Miniſters were ſet upon the work of the Lord, it would be done more vigorouſly then by the moſt of us it is. How few Miniſters do Preach with all their might? or ſpeak about everlaſting Joy or Torment in ſuch a manner as may make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are in good ſadneſs. It would make a mans heart ake to ſee a company of dead and drowſy ſinners ſit under a Miniſter, and not have a word that is like to quicken or awake them. To think with our ſelves, <hi>O if theſe ſinners were but convinced</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:99578:146"/>
                  <hi>and awakened, they might yet be converted and live.</hi> And alas we ſpeak ſo drowſily or gently, that ſleepy ſinners cannot hear: The blow falls ſo light, that hard-hearted perſons cannot feel it. Moſt Miniſter will not ſo much as put out their voice, and ſtir up themſelves to an earneſt utterance: But if they do ſpeak loud and earneſtly, how few do anſwer it with earneſtneſs of matter! and the voice doth little good; the people will take it but as meer bauling, when the matter doth not correſpond. It would grieve one to hear what excellent Doctrines ſome Miniſters have in hand, and let it die in their hands for want of cloſe and lively application. What fit matter they have for convincing ſinners: and how little they make of it; and what a deal of good it might do if it were ſet home; and yet they cannot or will not do it. O ſirs, how plain, how cloſe and earneſtly ſhould we deliver a meſſage of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as ours is? when the everlaſting life or death of men is concerned in it: Me thinks we are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſo wanting as in this ſeriouſneſs? There is nothing more unſuitable to ſuch a buſineſs, then to be ſlight and dull. What! ſpeak coldly for God! and for mens ſalvation! Can we believe that our people muſt be converted, or condemned and yet can we ſpeak in a drowſie tone! In the name of God, Brethren, labour to awaken your hearts, before you come, and when you are in the work, that you may be fit to waken the hearts of ſinners. Remember that they muſt be wakened or damned; and a ſleepy Preacher will hardly wake them. If you give the holy things of God the higheſt praiſes in words, and yet do it coldly, you will ſeem in the manner to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99578:147"/>
what you ſaid in the matter. It is a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of great things, eſpecially ſo great to ſpeak of them without great affection and fervency: The manner as well as the words muſt ſet them forth. If we are commanded what ever our hand findeth to do, to do it with all our might; then certainly ſuch a work as preaching for mens ſalvation ſhould be done with all our might: But alas how few, how thin are ſuch men! here one and there one, even among good Miniſters, that have an earneſt perſwading wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way, or that the people can feel him preach when they hear him.</p>

IF we are all heartily Devoted to the work of God, why do we not compaſsionate the poor unprovided Congregations about us, and take care to help them to able Miniſters? and in the mean time, ſtep out now and then to their aſsiſtance, when the buſineſs of our own particular charge will give us any leave. A Lecture in the more ignorant places purpoſely for the work of converſion, performed by the moſt lively working-preachers, might be a great help where conſtant means is wanting.</p>

               <p n="4">4. THE negligent execution of acknowledged duties, doth ſhew that we be not ſo wholly Devoted to the work as we ſhould be. If there be any work of Reformation to be ſet a foot, how many are there that will go no further then they are drawn? And it were well if all would do but that much.</p>
               <p>If any buſineſs for the Church be on foot, how many neglect it for their own private buſineſs? when we ſhould meet and conſult together for the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and ſucceſsful performance of our work, one hath this buſineſs of his own, and another that buſineſs, which muſt be preferred before Gods buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>And when a work is like to prove difficult and coſtly, how backward are we to it, and make excuſes and will not come on? For inſtance; What hath been for more talked of, and prayed for, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about in <hi>England</hi> for many years paſt, then the buſineſs of Diſcipline? And there are but few men (the <hi>Eraſtians)</hi> but they ſeem zealous in diſputing for one ſide or other: ſome for the Prelatical way, and ſome for the Presbyterian, and ſome for the Congregational. And yet when we come to the practice of it, for ought I ſee we are moſt of us for no way. It hath made me admire ſometimes; to look on the face of <hi>England,</hi> and ſee how few Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Land have any conſiderable execution of Diſcipline, and to think withall what volumns they have written for it; and how almoſt all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99578:148"/>
of the Nation is engaged for it? how zealouſly they have contended for it, and made many a (juſt) exclamation againſt the oppoſers of it; and yet for all this will do little or nothing in the exerciſe of it. I have marvelled what ſhould make them ſo zealous in ſiding for that which their practice ſhews that their hearts are againſt. But I ſee a diſputing zeal is more natural then a holy obedient practizing zeal. How many Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> be there that know not their own charge, that plead for the truth of their particular Churches, and know not which they be, or who be members of them? and that never caſt out one obſtinate ſinner; no nor brought one to publike Confeſsion, and expreſsion of Repentance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of reformation; No nor admoniſhed one pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to call him to ſuch Repentance. But they think they do their duties if they give them not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, (when it is perhaps avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded voluntarily by themſelves, and thouſands will keep away themſelves without our prohibiting them) and in the mean time we leave them ſtated members of our Churches, and grant them all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, and call them not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Repentance for their ſin. Read <hi>Albaſpinaens,</hi> a ſober Papiſt in his <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 1. and 2. and 3. after his <hi>Annot</hi> on <hi>O tatus,</hi> and ſee whether Church-Communion in former times was taken to conſiſt only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n co-partaking of the Lords Supper. Either theſe hundreds that we communicate not with in the Supper are members of our Churches, or not; If not; then we are Separatiſts while we ſo much diſclaim it; for we have not caſt them out nor have we called them to any profeſſion, whether they own
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99578:148"/>
or diſown their memberſhip, but only whether they will be examined in order to a Sacrament nor do we uſe to let them know that we take their refuſal of Examination for a refuſal of Church memberſhip, and excluſion of themſelves. It follows therefore that we have gathered Churches out of Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were unchurched, or before we took Gods way to caſt any of them (much leſs all of them) out. But if they are taken for members, how can we ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our conſciences to forbear all execution of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline upon them? It is not Gods Ordinance that they ſhould be perſonally rebuked and admoniſhed, and then publikely called to Repentance and be caſt out if they remain impenitent? If theſe be no duties, why have we made ſuch a noiſe and ſtir about them in the world as we have done? If they be duties, why do we not practiſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If none of all theſe perſons be ſcandalous, why do we not admit them to the Lords Supper? If they keep away themſelves, is not that a ſin which a brother ſhould not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to remain in? Is it not a ſcandal for them to avoid the Ordinances of God and the Communion of the Church for ſo many years together as they do? Yea and many a one of them avoideth alſo the very hearing of the word: The antient Diſcipline was ſtricter, when the ſixth general Council at <hi>Trull,</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinop.</hi> ordained <hi>Can.</hi> 80. that <hi>whoſoever was three daies together from Church, without urgent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, was to be excommunicated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren, for my part, I deſire not to offend any party, nor to bring the leaſt diſhonour to them; but I muſt needs ſay that theſe ſins are not to be cloaked over with excuſes, extenuations or denyals. We have
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99578:149"/>
long cryed up Diſcipline, and every party their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral waies. Would you have people value your way of Government or not? No doubt but you would; Why if you would have them value it, it muſt be for ſom excellency: ſhew them then that excellency. What is it? and wherein doth it conſiſt? And if you would have them believe you, ſhew it them not only in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but in practice, not only in words, but in deeds. How can the people know the worth of bare notions and names of Diſcipline, without the thing? Is it a name and a ſhadow that you have made all this noiſe about? How can they think that that is good which doth no good? Truly I fear we take not the right way to maintain our cauſe, but even betray it, while we are hot diſputers for it. Speak truly; is it not theſe two things that keep up the Reputation of the long-contended for Diſcipline among men; <hi>viz.</hi> with the godly, the <hi>meer reputation of their Miniſters that ſtand for it;</hi> and with many of the ungodly, <hi>the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>execution of it,</hi> becauſe they find it to be tooth-leſs, and not much troubleſom to them? Verily Brethren, if we get the late Prelates carnal wiſdom and go their way to work, by ingratiating our way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with the ungodly multitude, by the meer neglect of practice, and the befriending of their ſins, we may well look for the ſame bleſſing and iſſue as the Prelates had. If once our Government come to be upholden by the votes of thoſe who ſhould be corrected or ejected by it, and the worſt men be friends to it, becauſe it is a friend to them in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, we then engage it againſt the Lord, and he will appear as engaged againſt us. Set all the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Diſcipline together that hath been practiſed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99578:149"/>
in a whole County ever ſince it was ſo contended for, and I doubt it will not appear ſo obſervable as to draw godly people into a liking of it for the effects. How can you wonder if many that deſire deeds and not words, Reformation and not the meer name of Reformation, do turn over to the ſeparated Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, when you ſhew them nothing but the bare name of Diſcipline in yours? All Chriſtians value Gods Ordinances, and think them not vain things; and therefore are unwilling to live without them. Diſcipline is not a needleſs thing to the Church: If you will not difference between the precious and the vile by Diſcipline, people will do it by ſeparation. If you will keep many ſcore or hundreds in your Churches that are notoriouſly ſcandalous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of Church-Communion, and never openly (nor perhaps privately) reprove them nor call to Repentance, nor caſt them out, you cannot marvel if ſome timorous ſouls do run out of your Churches as from a ruinous aedifice, that they fear is ready to fall upon their heads. I pray you conſider, if you ſhould do in the ſame manner with them in the Sacrament, as you do in Diſcipline, and ſhould only ſhew the bread and wine, and never let them taſte of it, could you expect that the name of a Sacrament ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them, or that they ſhould like your Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Why ſhould you think then that they will be ſatisfied with the empty ſound of the word, <hi>Church-Government?</hi> And conſider but what a diſadvantage you caſt your cauſe upon in all your diſputations with men of another way. If your principles be righter then theirs, and their practice be righter then yours, the people will ſuppoſe that the Queſtion is,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99578:150"/>
Whether the name or the thing, the ſhaddow or the ſubſtance, be more deſirable? and they will take your way to be a meer deluſory formality, becauſe they ſee you but formal in the uſe of it, yea that you uſe it not at all. I ſpeak not againſt your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for it, all this while; and tell you, that its you that are againſt it, that ſeem ſo earneſt for it; while you more diſgrace it for want of exerciſe, then you credit it by your bare arguments: And you will find before you have done, that faithful execution will be your ſtrongeſt argument. Till then, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will underſtand you as if you openly proclaimed, <hi>We would have no Publike Admonitions, Confeſsions or Excommunications; our way is to do no good, but to ſet up the naked name of a Government.</hi> Doubtleſs it was a ſault more paſt all diſputation, for the Prelates to deſtroy Diſcipline and do little or nothing in it, then for them to be Prelates; and if they had but done the good that Diſcipline is ordained for, Prelacy might have ſtood to this day for ought I know; I am ſure it would have had no oppoſition from many a hundred godly people that have oppoſed it. And again I ſay, if you will run into their error, you may expect their fate.</p>
               <p>And what are the hindrances now that keep the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> from the Execution of that Diſcipline which they have ſo much contended for? I hear not all ſpeak: but I hear ſome, and ſee more. The great Reaſon as far as I can learn, is, <hi>The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Work, and the trouble or ſuffering that we are like to incurr by it: We cannot publikely reprehend one ſinner, but he will ſtorm at it, and bear us a deadly malice. We can prevail with very few to make a publike</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:99578:150"/>
                  <hi>profeſſion of true Repentance. If we proceed to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them, they will be raging mad againſt us: They will be ready to vow revenge againſt us, and to do us a miſchief: If we ſhould deal as God requireth with all the obſtinate ſinners in the Pariſh, there were no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving among them; they would conſpire in hatred againſt us to the hazard of our lives. We ſhould be ſo hated of all, that as our lives would be uncomfortable, ſo our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours would become unprofitable; for men would not hear us when they are poſſeſſed with a hatred of us; therefore duty ceaſeth to be duty to us, becauſe the hurt that would follow would be greater then the good; and affirmatives bind not</hi> ad ſemper.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the great Reaſons for the non execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Diſcipline, together with the great labour that private admonition of each offender would coſt us. And to theſe I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Are not theſe reaſons as valid againſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf in ſome times and places, as now againſt Diſcipline? Chriſt came not to ſend us peace; we ſhall have his Peace, but not the worlds; for he hath foretold us that they will hate us. Might not Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> or <hi>Hooper,</hi> or any that were burnt in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies have alledged more then this againſt duty? They might have ſaid, It will make us hated, if we own the Reformation, and it will expoſe our lives to the flames. How is he concluded by Chriſt to be no Chriſtian, who hateth not all that he hath and his own life for him! and yet we can take the hazard of our life as a reaſon againſt his work; What is it but hypocriſie to ſhrink from ſufferings, and take up none but ſafe and eaſie works, and make our ſelves believe that the reſt are no duties? Indeed
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99578:151"/>
this is the common way of eſcaping ſuffering, to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the duty that would expoſe us thereunto. If we did our duty faithfully, Miniſters ſhould find the ſame lot among profeſſed Chriſtians, as their predeceſſors have done among the Infidels. But if you could not ſuffer for Chriſt, why did you put your hand to his plough? and did not firſt ſet down and count your coſts? This makes the Miniſterial work ſo unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done, becauſe it is ſo carnally undertaken; and men enter upon it as a life of eaſe, and honour, and reſpect from men and therefore reſolve to attain their ends, and have what they expected by right or wrong. They looked not for hatred and ſuffering, and they will avoid it, though by the avoiding of their work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as for the making your ſelves uncapable to do them good: I anſwer, That reaſon is as valid againſt plain preaching, reproof, or any other duty which wicked men will hate us for. God will bleſs his own Ordinances to do good, or elſe he would not have appointed them. If you admoniſh, and publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuke the ſcandalous, and call men to repentance, and caſt out the obſtinate, you may do good to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that you reprove; and poſſibly to the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: I am ſure it is Gods means; And it is his laſt means, when Reproofs will do no good: It is therefore perverſe to neglect the laſt means leſt we fruſtrate the foregoing means, when as the laſt is not to be uſed but upon ſuppoſition that the former were all fruſtrate before. However, thoſe within and thoſe without may receive good by it, if the offendor do receive none; and God will have the honour, when his Church is manifeſtly differenced from the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99578:151"/>
world, and the heirs of heaven and hell are not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally confounded, nor the world made to think that Chriſt and Satan do but contend for ſuperiority, and that they have the like inclination to holineſs or to ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And I would know whether on the grounds of this objection before mentioned all Diſcipline ſhould not be caſt out of the Church, atleaſt ordinarily; And ſo is not this againſt the Thing it ſelf, rather then againſt the preſent ſeaſon of it? For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not drawn from any thing proper to our times, but common to all times and places. Wicked men will alwaies ſtorm againſt the means of their publike ſhame; and the uſe of Church cenſures is purpoſely to ſhame them, that ſin may be ſhamed, and diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Church. What age can you name ſince the daies of the Apoſtles wherein you would have exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Diſcipline that you now refuſe, if you go on theſe grounds, ſuppoſing that it had not been by Magiſterial compulſion? If therefore it be Diſcipline it ſelf that hath ſuch intolerable inconveniences, why have you ſo prayed for it, and perhaps fought for it, and diſputed for it as you have done? What muſt all diſſenters bear your frowns and cenſures, and all for a work which your ſelves judge intolerable, and dare not touch with one of your fingers? When do you look to ſee all theſe difficulties over, that you may ſet upon that which you now avoid? Will it be in your daies? Or will you wait till you are dead, and leave it as a part of your Epitaph to poſterity, that you ſo deeply engaged and contended for that which you ſo abhord to the death, that you would never be brought to the practice of it! And doth
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99578:152"/>
not this Objection of yours plainly give up your cauſe to the Separatiſts? and even tell them that your contending is not for your way of Diſcipline; but that there may be none, becauſe it will do more harm then good. Certainly if this be true, it would have been better to ſpeak it out at firſt, before all our wars, and tears, and prayers, and contentions, then now in the concluſion to tell the world, that we did all this but for a name or word, and that the thing is ſo far from being worth our coſt, that it is not toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, much leſs deſirable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But yet let me tell you, that there is not ſuch a Lyon in the way as you do imagine; nor is Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline ſuch a uſeleſs thing. I bleſs God upon the ſmall and too late tryal that I have made my ſelf of it, I can ſpeak by experience, it is not vain; nor are the hazards of it ſuch as may excuſe our neglect.</p>
               <p>But I know that pinching reaſon is behind; They ſay that, <hi>When we pleaded for Diſcipline, we meant a Diſcipline that ſhould be eſtabliſhed and impoſed by the ſecular power: and without them what good can we do? when every man hath leave to deſpiſe our cenſures, and ſet us at nought: and therefore we will not meddle with it (ſay they) without authority.</hi> To which I anſwer, 1. I thought it once a ſcornful indignity that ſome fellows attempted to put upon the Miniſtery, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed them to be the Miniſters of Chriſt, and would have had them called the Miniſters of the State, and dealt with accordingly. But it ſeems they did not much croſs the judgements of ſome of the Miniſtery themſelves, who are ready to put the ſame ſcorn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own calling. We are ſent as Chriſts Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to ſpeak in his name, and not in the Princes;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99578:152"/>
and by his Authority we do our work as from him we have our Commiſsion. And ſhall any of his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers queſtion the Authority of his commands? The ſame Power that you have to preach without or againſt the Magiſtrates command, the ſame have you to exerciſe Paſtoral Guidance and Diſcipline without it. And ſhould all Miniſters refuſe preaching if the Magiſtrate bid them not? yea or if he forbid them? 2. What mean you when you ſay, <hi>you will not do it without Authority?</hi> Do you mean the <hi>Leave,</hi> or the <hi>Countenance</hi> and approbation, or the <hi>Command</hi> upon your ſelves, or do you mean a <hi>Force</hi> or <hi>Penalty</hi> on the People to obey you? The Magiſtrates <hi>Leave</hi> we have; who hindereth or forbiddeth you to ſet up Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and exerciſe it faithfully? Doth the ſecular Power forbid you to do it, or threaten or trouble you for not doing it? No, they do not. To the ſhame of the far greateſt part of the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> it muſt be ſpoken (for we have ſo opened our own ſhame that it cannot be hid) we have had free Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have done the work of Chriſt, which we have deſired and pleaded for, and yet we would not do it. What might not the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> have done for the Lord, if they had been but willing? They had no prohibition, nor any man to riſe up againſt them, of all the enemies whoſe hearts are againſt their work: and yet they would not do it. Nay more, for ought you know, you have the Approbation of Authority. You have the commands of former powers not yet repealed. You have the Protection of the Laws and preſent Governors: If any one ſeek revenge againſt you for the ſake of Diſcipline, you have not only Laws, but as many willing Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99578:153"/>
to reſtrain and puniſh them as ever you knew I think in <hi>England.</hi> And what would you have more? Would you have a Law made to Puniſh you if you will not do your duty? What! dare you tell God that you will not do his work unleſs the Magiſtrate drive you to it with ſcourges? I confeſs if I had my will it ſhould be ſo; and that man ſhould be ejected as a <hi>negligent</hi> Paſtor, that will not rule his People by Diſcipline (though yet I might allow him to be a Preacher to the unchurched) as well as he is ejected as a negligent Preacher that will not preach. For Ruling is as Eſſential a part of a Paſtors office as preaching I am ſure. And therefore ſeeing theſe men would fain have the Magiſtrate interpoſe, if he did eject them for unfaithful negligent Paſtors (were it not for the neceſſity of the Church that hath not enow better) I know not well how they could blame him for it. Its a ſad diſcovery of our carnal hearts, when man can do ſo much more with us then God, that we would obey the commands of men, and will not obey the commands of Chriſt. Is he fit to be Chriſts Officer, that will not take his Command as obligatory?</p>
               <p>But I know the thing expected is, that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be forced under a penalty to ſubmit to our Diſcipline. I confeſs, I think that the Magiſtrate ſhould be the hedge of the Church and defend the Miniſtery, and improve his power to the utmoſt to procure an univerſal obedience to Chriſts Laws, and reſtrain men from the apparent breach of them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from being falſe Teachers and Seducers of others. How far I am againſt the two extreams of Univerſal Licence, and Perſecuting tyrannie, I have
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99578:153"/>
frequently manifeſted on other occaſions. But I ſhall now ſay but this. 1. Doth not this further diſcover the carnal frame of our hearts, when we will not do our duty unleſs the Magiſtrate will do his to the full, and all that we conceive may be his duty? What! will his neglect excuſe yours? Hath Chriſt bid you uſe the Keyes of the Kingdom, and avoid a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinner upon condition that the Magiſtrate will puniſh him with the ſword? Is not this your meaning if you would ſpeak it out, that you find a great deal of difficulty in your work, and you would have the Magiſtrate by terrifying offendors make it eaſie to you? for if it be not ſafe and cheap and eaſie, you are reſolved you will not do it; And ſuch ſervants Chriſt may have enough. Nay is not your meaning, that you would have the Magiſtrate to do your work for you? Juſt as your pious people have long cryed and prayed for Diſcipline, and called upon Miniſters to do it, but we cannot get them to reprove offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors and deal with them ſeriouſly and lovingly for their good and inform the Church-Officers of them that are obſtinate. So do we toward the Magiſtrates: The work of God is ſo much beholden to us, that we would all have it done, but few w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll do it. We can eaſilyer cenſure and talk againſt others for not doing it, then do it our ſelves. O the guile and hypocriſie of our hearts!</p>
               <p n="2">2. But further, What is it that you would have the Magiſtrate to do? I pray you conſider it how you will anſwer it before God, that you ſhould will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglect your own duty, and then make it your Religion to quarrel with others. Is it not a fearful deceit of heart for a man to think himſelf a godly
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99578:154"/>
Miniſter for finding fault with them that are leſs faulty then himſelf? I ſay, leſs faulty. For tell me truly. Whether the Magiſtrate do more of his part in Government, or you in yours. I am no more a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer of the Magiſtrate then of you; nor was ever taken for ſuch, that I could underſtand: but we muſt deal juſtly by all men. Would you have the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to puniſh men <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, without any particular cogniſance of the fact and caſe? 1. That were unjuſt; Then he muſt do wrong when ever we miſtake and do wrong; If an honeſt man were an hangman, he would be willing to know that he hanged not a man that was unjuſtly condemned: However the Magiſtrate is not the meer executioner of the Miniſters, but a Judge: and therefore muſt be allowed the uſe of his Reaſon, to know the cauſe, and follow his own judgement, and not puniſh men againſt it. 2. And excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſo great a puniſhment of it ſelf, that I hope you do not think it nothing, unleſs the Magiſtrate add more: If ſo, then the temporal puniſhment might ſerve turn, and what need of yours? But I ſuppoſe that this is not your ſenſe, but you are ſo juſt, that you would have the Magiſtrate to puniſh a man as an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor, and not as excommunicate. And if ſo, I think it is not nothing that he doth. Are all the penalties againſt Swearers, Curſers, Drunkards, Peace-breakers, Sabboth-breakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nothing? Certainly the Laws of the Land do puniſh much ſin againſt God. Well! What do you as Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors againſt theſe ſame ſins? The Magiſtrate fineth and impriſoneth them: that is his part: It is your part to bring them to open Repentance, or to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99578:154"/>
caſt them out: Have you done this as oft as he hath done his part? Doth not the Magiſtracy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> puniſh ten, twenty, what if I ſay an hundred Swearers, Drunkards or Sabboth-breakers by the ſword, for one that the Elders of the Church do pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh by cenſures or bring to publike Repentance for the ſatisfaction of the Church? Brethren, theſe things ſeem ſtrange to me; that the caſe ſhould ſtand thus as it doth, and yet that the deceit of our hearts ſhould be ſo great, that we ſhould go on to account our ſelves ſuch blameleſs godly men, whom Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and people are all bound to reverence, and to ſpeak againſt the Magiſtrate ſo much as we do. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are all ſlack and faulty; but are not we much more faulty? What if they ſhould pay us in our own coyn? What language might they give the Miniſters, that after ſo many years talk of Diſcipline will do nothing in it! I ſay nothing in moſt places: To meet together for conſulation, is no exerciſe of Diſcipline, nor reformation of the Church, which our meetings ſhould conduce to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And I give you this further anſwer: What had the Church of Chriſt done till the daies of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the great, if it had no better Paſtors then you that will not Govern it without the joynt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the Magiſtrate? Diſcipline, and ſevere Diſcipline was exerciſed for three hundred years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, where the Prince did not give them ſo much as a Protection, nor Toleration, but perfecuted them to the death. Then was the Church at the beſt, and Diſcipline moſt pure and powerful; ſay not then any more for ſhame, that it is to no purpoſe without a Magiſtrate, when it hath done ſo much againſt
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99578:155"/>
their wills? O what an aggravation is it of our ſin! That you cannot be content to be negligent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful ſervants, but you muſt alſo flie in the face of your Lord and Maſter, and obliquely lay the blame on him! What do you elſe, when you blame Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ures as uneffectual, when you ſhould blame your lazy ſelf ſeeking hearts, that ſhift off the uſe of them? Hath Chriſt put a leaden ſword into your hands, when he bids you ſmite the obſtinate ſinner? Or are you cowardly and careleſs, and then blame your ſword inſtead of uſing it, as thinking that the eaſier task? Are the Keyes of Chriſts Kingdom ſo unmeet and uſeleſs, that they will not open and ſhut without the help of the ſword? or are you unskillful and lazy in the uſe of them! If they have contracted any ruſt, by which they are made leſs fit for ſervice, next to the Prelates we may thank our ſelves, that let them lie ſo long unuſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And I muſt tell you, that too much interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſword with our Diſcipline, would do more harm then good. It would but corrupt it by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and make it become a humane thing. Your Government is all to work upon the conſcience; and the ſword cannot reach that. It is not a deſirable thing to have Repentance ſo obſcured by meer forced Confeſſions, that you cannot know when men do mean as they ſpeak; and ſo it will be the ſword that doth all, by forcing men to diſſemble, and you will not diſcern the power of the Word and Ordinance of Chriſt. I confeſs ſince I fell upon the exerciſe of ſome Diſcipline I find by experience that if the ſword did interpoſe and force all thoſe Publike Confeſſions of ſin, and Profeſſion of Repentance, which I have
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99578:155"/>
perſwaded men to by the light of the word of God; it would have left me much unſatisfied concerning the validity of ſuch Confeſſions and Promiſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might indeed be ſatisfactory to the Church: And I find that the godly people do no further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it then they perceive it hearty and free; and if it were forced by Magiſtrates, they would take him for no Penitent perſon, nor be any whit ſatisfied, but ſay, <hi>He doth it becauſe he dare do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I muſt add this word of plainer dealing yet. You blame the Magiſtrate for giving ſo much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and is it not long of your ſelves that he doth ſo? You will ſcarce believe that ſuch enemies to Liberty of Conſcience, are the cauſes of it: I think that you are; and that the keeneſt enemies have been the greateſt cauſes. For you would run too far to the other extream, and are ſo confident in every contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie that you are in the right, and lay ſuch a ſtreſs upon many Opinions of your own as if life or death did lie upon them, (when perhaps the difference may prove more verbal then real, if it were ſearcht to the quick) that this occaſioneth Magiſtrates to run too far the other way; and if they look on ſuch as—and dare not truſt the ſword in ſuch hands, you may thank your ſelves. Truly Brethren, I ſee by experience, that there is among many of the moſt injudicious of us, ſuch a blind confuſed zeal againſt all that is called error by their party, that without being able to try and make a difference, they let flie pell mell at all alike, and make a great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry againſt errors, when either we know not what they are, nor how to confute them, nor which he
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:99578:156"/>
tolerable in the Church, and which intolerable, nor how far we may hold or break Communion with the owners of them, and perhaps are the erroneous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons our ſelves. The obſervation of this hath made the Magiſtrates ſo over-jealous of us, that they think if they ſet in with a party in each contention, we ſhall never be without blood and miſery. And I confeſs I ſee in ſome Miniſters ſo little of the fire of Divine Love, and Chriſtian Charity, and compaſſion, nor heavenly mindedneſs, nor humble ſenſe of their own infirmities, and ſo much of the zeal that <hi>Iames</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth <hi>(Iam.</hi> 3. 14, 15.) which is kindled from another fire, that makes them full of ſuſpicions and jealouſies, and keen and eager againſt their Brethren, cenſuring, defaming and unconſcionably back-biting them, and ſtraining an ill ſenſe out of their well meant words and actions, and living towards them in plain envy and malice inſtead of Chriſtian love and peace; I ſay I ſee ſo much of this in many that affect the Reputation of Orthodox, while they are indeed factious, that I am the leſs ſorry that the Magiſtrate doth ſo little interpoſe. For were the ſword in ſuch envious angry hands, there would be little quiet to the Church: For there is no two men on earth but differ in ſomething, if they know or believe any thing. And theſe men muſt ſquare the world to their own judgements, which are not alway the wiſeſt in the world: They that dare ſo rail at others as Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, when they know not what they ſay themſelves, durſt ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſmite them as Blaſphemers, if they had power. This may poſſibly make the Magiſtrate think meet, (ſeeing we are ſo quarrelſom and impatient) to let us fight it out by the bare fiſts, and not to put
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99578:156"/>
ſwords into our hands till we are more ſober and know better how to uſe them: For if every paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man, when he hath not wit enough to make good his cauſe, ſhould preſently borrow the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſword to make it good, truth would be upon great diſadvantage in the world! Magiſtrates are commonly the moſt tempted and abuſed men, and therefore I know not why we ſhould call ſo lowd to have them become the Arbitrators in all our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, leſt error have two victories where truth gets one. I could wiſh the Magiſtrate did more; but if he do but give us Protection and Liberty (ſpecially if he will but reſtrain Deceivers from preaching againſt the great unqueſtionable truths of the Goſpel, and give publike Countenance and Encouragement to thoſe maſter-truths) I ſhall not fear by the Grace of God, but a prudent, ſober unanimous Miniſtery will ere long ſhame the ſwarm of vanities that we think ſo threatning.</p>
               <p>But I have been too long on this. I ſhall only conclude it with this earneſt requeſt to my Brethren of the Miniſtery, that they would ſpeedily and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put in execution, at leaſt all the unqueſtionable part of the Diſcipline, that they have ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for. When we were ſo offended with the Parliament for their enumeration of ſcandals, as too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and a Proteſtation was publiſhed that we acted only on ſuppoſition that it was defective, ſure we little thought then that we that were ſo earneſt to have had more power, would uſe none and we that muſt needs have authority to reject more then the Parliament did enumerate, would cenſure ſo few even
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:99578:157"/>
of them as we have done, ſince we have had more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do it.</p>
               <p>But one objection is common, which I forgot: They ſay, We are but ſingle Paſtors, and therefore cannot excommunicate men alone, unleſs we ſhould make every Paſtor a Pope in his Pariſh, or a Biſhop at leaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For my part I have no mind to obtrude my own opinion on ſuch (for the power of a ſingle perſon to excommunicate) I have ſufficiently already proved my ſelf a Noveliſt and ſingular with ſome, by aſſerting antient and moſt common Truths. But yet 1. I could with theſe men ſo much moderation, as to be ſure that they are in this as much wiſer then the contrary-minded, as their confidence doth import, before they proceed in calling them Popes: Leaſt as the cunning of the times is by making many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts, to make none; ſo theſe men ſhould contrary to their intention, credit the Pope, by making ſo many Popes, and the Prelates too by making ſuch kind of Prelates.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Pope is the pretended head of the Catholike Church, and an univerſal Biſhop to govern it; Are ſingle ruling Paſtors ſuch? A Dioceſan Biſhop is the Ruler of all the Paſtors and Churches in a Dioceſs: Is ſuch a Paſtor one of theſe?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why do you in your diſputes againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates maintain that every Miniſter is a Biſhop of his own Church; and do you now abhor it?</p>
               <p n="4">4. What if you might not excommunicate, may you not therefore do the reſt? may you not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and publikely reprove them, pray for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. Have you none in your Pariſh, not one or two to make Ruling Elders of, that by their conjunction you may be authoriſed to do more then now you do? I mean, according to your own principles; for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs its not according to mine.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And what hindereth but you may joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if you will? If it muſt needs be many Paſtors conjunct, that muſt exerciſe any act of Diſcipline, why is it not ſo done? Doth any forbid them, or threaten them if they do it? If you ſay, <hi>I am alone, becauſe no neighbour Miniſter will joyn with me.</hi> You ſpeak hardly of all the Miniſters about you? What! are they all ſo negligent? Blame us not then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them. But its an incredible thing that they ſhould be all ſo bad that are of your judgement, that no one or two will be perſwaded to aſſiſt you. And I think you will confeſs that two or three may do it authoritatively, though no one elſe in the County do it. I could wiſh that the Prelates had not ſuch an argument given them as this: <hi>No one Presbyter hath the Power of the Keyes, by their own Confeſſion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two or three have not;</hi> leaſt they go further in proving the conſequence then you expect. But if it muſt be ſo, I could yet wiſh that no ſingle Paſtor for the excuſing of himſelf, would lay ſuch a reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful charge upon all the Miniſters in the Country that be of his own Judgement, as to ſay that Diſcipline is caſt aſide, becauſe they can get none to joyn with them in the execution! at leaſt till they
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:99578:158"/>
have throughly tryed whether it be ſo indeed, or not.</p>

If they look for ſecular advantages, they ſuit themſelves to the ſecular Power: if for the air of Eccleſiaſtick applauſe, then do they ſuit themſelves to the party of Eccleſiaſticks that is moſt in credit. This is not a private, but an Epidemical malady. In <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantines</hi> daies, how prevalent were the Orthodox? In <hi>Conſtantius</hi> daies, they almoſt all turned <hi>Arrians,</hi> ſo that there were very few Biſhops at all that did not apoſtatize or betray the truth; even of the ſame
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:99578:158"/>
men that had been in the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> And when not only <hi>Liberius,</hi> but great <hi>O ſius</hi> himſelf fell, who had been the Preſident or chief in ſo many Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Councils, what better could be expected from weaker men! Were it not for ſecular advantage, or Eccleſiaſtick faction and applauſe, how could it come to paſs that Miniſters in all the Countries in the world, are either all, or almoſt all, of that Religion and way that is moſt in credit, and moſt conſiſtent with their worldly intereſt! Among the Greeks, they are all of the Greek profeſſion: and among the <hi>Abaſſines,</hi> the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> the <hi>Maronites,</hi> the <hi>Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> the Miniſters generally go one way. And among the Papiſts they are almoſt all Papiſts. And in <hi>Saxony, Sweden, Denmark,</hi> &amp;c. almoſt all <hi>Lutherans:</hi> In <hi>Holland, France, Scotland,</hi> almoſt all <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> Its ſtrange that they ſhould be all in the right in one Countrey, and all in the wrong in another, if carnal advantages and reputation did not ſway much. When men fal upon a conſcientious ſearch, the variety of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual capacities cauſeth unavoidably a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of conceits about ſome hard &amp; lower things. But let the Prince and the ſtream of men in credit go one way, and you ſhall have the generality of Miniſters agree to a hair, and that without any extraordinary ſearch. How generally did the common ſort of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters too often change their Religion with the Prince at ſeveral times in this land? Not all (as our Martyrologie can witneſs) but the moſt. I will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely forbare the mention of any later change. If the Rulers of an Univerſity ſhould but be corrupt, who have the diſpoſal of preferments, how much might they do with the moſt of the ſtudents, where
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:99578:159"/>
meer Arguments would not take? And the ſame tractable diſtemper doth ſo often follow them into the Miniſtery, that it occaſioneth the enemies to ſay, that Reputation and preferment is our Religion, and our Reward.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for the ſecond, How common is it with Miniſters to drown themſelves in worldly buſineſs? Too many are ſuch as the Sectaries would have them be, who tell us that we ſhould go to plough and cart, and labour for our living, and preach without ſo much ſtudy: And this is a leſſon eaſily learnt. Men take no care to caſt off and prevent care, that their ſouls and the Church may have their care.</p>
               <p>And eſpecially how commonly are thoſe duties neglected, that are like if performed to diminiſh our eſtates? For example: Is there not many that dare not, that will not ſet up the exerciſe of any Diſcipline in their Churches (not only on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned accounts but eſpecially) becauſe it may hinder the people from paying them their dues? They will not offend ſinners with Diſcipline, leaſt they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them in their eſtates, (yea though the Law ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their maintenance.) I find money is too ſtrong an Argument for ſome men to anſwer, that can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the love of it to be the root of all evil, and can make large orations of the danger of covetouſneſs. I will ſay no more now to theſe but this; If it was ſo deadly a ſin in <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to offer to buy the Gift of God with money; what is it to ſell his gifts, his cauſe, and the ſouls of men for money? and what reaſon have ſuch to fear leaſt their money periſh with them?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the moſt that I have to ſay is to the third
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:99578:159"/>
diſcovery. If worldly and fleſhly intereſt did not much prevail againſt the intereſt of Chriſt and the Church, ſurely moſt Miniſters would be more fruitful in good works, and would more lay out that they have to their maſters uſe. Experience hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved it, that works of Charity do moſt potently remove prejudice, and open the ears to words of piety. If men ſee that you are addicted to do good, they will the eaſilyer belive that you are good, and the eaſilyer then believe that it is good which you perſwade them too. When they ſee that you Love them, and ſeek their good, they will the eaſilyer truſt you: And when they ſee that you ſeek not the things of the world, they will the leſs ſuſpect your intentions, and the eaſilyer be drawn by you to ſeek that which you ſeek. O how much good might Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters do, if they did ſet themſelves wholly to do good, and would dedicate all their faculties and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to that endl Say not that it is a ſmall matter to do good to mens bodies, and that this will but win them to us, and not to God, nor convert the ſoul; For it is prejudice that is a great hindrance of mens converſion, and this will remove it: We might do men more good, if they were but willing to learn of us; and this will make them willing, and then our further diligence may profit them. Brethren, I pray you do not think that it is ordinary charity that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from you, any more then ordinary piety. You muſt in proportion to your talents go much beyond others: It is not to give now and them two pence to a poor man; others do that as well as you. But what ſingular thing do you with your eſtates for your Maſters uſe? I know you cannot give away
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:99578:160"/>
that which you have not: But me thinks all that you have ſhould be for God. I know the great objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, <hi>We have wife and children to provide for: a little will not ſerve them at preſent, and we are not bound to leave them beggars.</hi> To which I anſwer, 1. There are few texts of Scripture more abuſed then that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He that provideth not for his own, and ſpecially thoſe of his family, hath denyed the faith, and is worſe then an Infidel.</hi> This is made a pretence for gathering up portions, and providing a full eſtate for poſterity, when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh only againſt them that did caſt their poor kindred and family on the Church to be maintained out of the common ſtock, when they were able to do it themſelves. As if one that hath a widdow in his houſe that is his mother or daughter, and would have her to be kept on the Pariſh when he hath enough him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. His following words ſhew that it is preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and not future portions that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, when he bids <hi>them that have widdows, adminiſter to them, or give them what is ſufficient.</hi> 2. You may ſo educate your children as other mean perſons do, that they may be able to get their own livings, in ſome honeſt trade or imployment, without other great proviſions. I know that your charity and care muſt begin at home, but it muſt not end there: You are bound to do the beſt you can to educate your children, ſo as they may be capable of being moſt ſerviceable to God, but not to leave them rich or a full eſtate; Nor to forbear other neceſſary works of Charity. meerly for a larger proviſion for them. There muſt be ſome proportion kept between our proviſion for our families, and for the Church
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:99578:160"/>
and poor. A truly charitable ſelf-denying heart, that hath devoted it ſelf and all that he hath to God, would be the beſt judge of the due proportions, and would ſee which way of expence is likely to do God the greateſt ſervice, and that way he would take. 3. I confeſs I would not have men lie too long under endangering ſtrong temptations to incontinency; leſt they wound themſelves and their profeſſion by their falls: But yet methinks its hard that men can do no more to mortifie the concupiſcence of the fleſh, that they may live in a ſingle freer condition, and have none of theſe temptations from wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to hinder them from furthering their Miniſterial ends by charitable works. If he that marryeth not, doth better then he that doth, ſure Miniſters ſhould labour to do that which is beſt. And if he that can <hi>receive this ſaying,</hi> muſt receive it, we ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after it. This is one of the higheſt points of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> policy, which they pretend to be a duty of common neceſſity, that all their Biſhops, Prieſts and other Religious orders muſt not marry, by which means they have no poſterity to drain the Churches revenues, nor to take up their care: but they make their publike cauſe to be their intereſt, and they lay out themſelves for it while they live, and leave all that they have to it when they die; So that their Churches wealth doth daily increaſe, as every Biſhop, Abbot, Jeſuite or other perſon doth gather more in their life time, and uſually add it to their common ſtock. Its pitty that for a better cauſe we can no more imitate them in wiſdom and ſelf-denyal, where it might be done. 4. But they that muſt marry, ſhould take ſuch as can maintain themſelves and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:99578:161"/>
or maintain them at the rate as their temporal means will afford, and devote as much of the Church means to the Churches ſervice as they can.</p>
               <p>I would put no man upon extreams; But in this caſe fleſh and blood doth make even good men ſo partial, that they take their duties, and duties of very great worth and weight to be extreams. If worldly vanities did not blind us, we might ſee when a publike or other greater good did call us to deny our ſelves and our families. Why ſhould we not live neerlyer and poorer in the world, rather then leave thoſe works undone, which may be of greater uſe then our plentiful proviſion? But we conſult in matter of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with fleſh and blood; and what counſel it will give us, we may eaſily know. It will tell us we muſt have a competency; and many pious mens compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, is but little below the Rich mans rates, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. If they be not cloathed with the beſt, and fare not deliciouſly every day, they have not a competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. A man that preacheth an Immortal Crown of glory, muſt not ſeek much after tranſitory vanity: And he that preacheth the contempt of Riches, muſt himſelf contemn them, and ſhew it by his life; And he that preacheth ſelf-denyal and mortification, muſt practiſe theſe in the eyes of them that he preacheth to, if ever he would have his Doctrine proſper. All Chriſtians are ſanctified, and therefore themſelves and all that they have are conſecrated and dedicated to their maſters uſe; But Miniſters are doubly ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; They are devoted to God both as Chriſtians and as Miniſters; and therefore they are doubly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to honour him with what they have.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:99578:161"/>
O Brethren, what abundance of good works are before us, and how few of them do we put our hands to? I know the world expecteth more from us then we have: but if we cannot anſwer the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the unreaſonable, let us do what we can to anſwer the expectations of God, and conſcience, and all juſt men. <hi>It is the will of God that with well doing we ſhould put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men.</hi> Eſpecially thoſe Miniſters that have larger mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance muſt be larger in doing good.</p>
               <p>I will give but one inſtance at this time, which I mentioned before. There are ſome Miniſters that have 150. or 200. or 300. <hi>per an.</hi> of Church means, and have ſo great Pariſhes that they are not able to do a quarter of the Miniſterial work, nor once in a year to deal perſonally with half their people for their inſtruction, and yet they will content themſelves with publike preaching, as if that were all that were neceſſary, and leave almoſt all the reſt undone, to the everlaſting danger or damnation of multitudes, rather then they will maintain one or two diligent men to aſsiſt them. Or if they have an aſsiſtant, it is but ſome young man to eaſe them about baptizings or burials, or ſuch work, and not one that will faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and diligently watch over the Flock, and afford them that perſonal inſtruction which is ſo neceſſary. If this be not a ſerving our ſelves of God, and not a ſerving God, and a ſelling mens ſouls for our fuller maintenance in the world; what is? Me thinks ſuch men ſhould fear leaſt while they are accounted excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Preachers and godly Miniſters by men, they ſhould be accounted cruel ſoul murderers by Chriſt? and leaſt the cryes of thoſe ſouls whom they have
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:99578:162"/>
betrayed to damnation ſhould ring in their ears for ever. Will preaching a good Sermon ſerve the turn; while you never look more after them, but deny them that cloſer help that you find to be neceſſary, and alienate that maintenance to your own fleſh, which ſhould provide relief for ſo many ſouls? How can you open your mouthes againſt oppreſſors, when your ſelves are ſo great oppreſſors, not only of mens bodies but their ſouls? How can you Preach againſt unmercifulneſs, while you are ſo unmerciful? And how can you talk againſt unfaithful Miniſters, while you are ſo unfaithful your ſelves? The ſin is not therefore ſmall becauſe it is unobſerved, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come odious in the eyes of men; nor becauſe the charity which you withhold is ſuch as the people blame you not for withholding. Satan himſelf their greateſt enemy hath their conſent all along in the work of their perdition. It is no extenuation therefore of your ſin that you have their conſents: For that you may ſooner have for their hurt then for their good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:99578:162"/>I Shall proceed no further in theſe confeſsions and diſcoveries; but beſeech you to take what is ſaid into Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nſideration; and ſee whether this be not the great and lamentable ſin of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that <hi>they be not fully devoted to God,</hi> and give not up themſelves and all that they have to the carrying on of the bleſſed work which they have undertaken? and whether fleſh-pleaſing and ſelf-ſeeking, and an intereſt diſtinct from that of Chriſt, do not make us neglect much of our duty, and walk too unfaithfully in ſo great a truſt, and reſervedly ſerve God in the cheapeſt and moſt applauded part of his work, and withdraw from that which would put us upon coſt and ſufferings? And whether this do not ſhew, that too many are earthly that ſeem to be heavenly, and mind the things below while they preach for the things above, and Idolize the world while they call men to contemn it?

               <p>AND now Brethren what remaineth, but that we all cry guilty, of too much of theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſins! and humble our ſouls in the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our miſcarriages before the Lord! Is this <hi>Taking heed to our ſelves and to all the Flock?</hi> Is this like the pattern that is given us here in the Text? If we ſhould prove now ſtout-hearted and unhumbled men, and ſnuff at theſe Confeſsions as tending to our diſgrace, how ſad a ſymptom would it be to our ſelves and to the Church? The Miniſtery hath been oft threatned here, and is ſtill maligned by many ſorts of adverſaries; Though all this may ſhew their impious malice, yet may it alſo intimate to us Gods juſt indignation. Believe it Brethren, the Miniſtery of <hi>England</hi> is not the leaſt or laſt in the ſin of the Land; It is they that have encouraged the common prophaneſs; It is they that have led the people into diviſions, and are now ſo backward to bring them out. And as ſin hath been found in them, ſo Judgements have been found and laid upon them. Its time therefore for us to take our part of that Humiliation which we have been calling ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> people to ſo long. If we have our wits about us, we may perceive that God hath been offended with us and that the voice that called this Nation to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, did ſpeak to us as well as others. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath ears let him hear the voice of railing enemies of all ſorts, the voice of them that cry, down
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99578:163"/>
with us, even to the ground, all calling us to try our waies and to reform. He that hath eyes let him ſee the precepts of Repentance written in ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable deliverances and preſervations, and written in ſo many lines of blood. By fire and ſword hath God been calling even us to Humiliation; And as Judgement hath begun at the houſe of God, ſo if Humiliation begin not there too, it will be a ſad prognoſtick to us and to the Land. What! ſhall we deny, or excuſe, or extenuate our ſins, while we call our people to ſuch free Confeſſions? Is it not better to give glory to God by a full and humble Confeſsion, then in tenderneſs of our own glory to ſeek for fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves to cover our nakedneſs; and to put God to it, to build his glory which we denyed him, upon the ruines of our own which we preferred before him? and to diſtrain for that by a yet ſorer Judgement, which we denyed voluntarily to ſurrender to him? Alas if you put God to get his honour as he can, he can get it to your greater ſorrow and diſhonour. If any of our hearers in a day of Humiliation when ſin is fully confeſſed and lamented, ſhould be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Confeſsion, and ſtand up againſt it, and ſay, <hi>You wrong me; I am not ſo bad! You ſhould have told me of this in private, and not have diſgraced me before the Congregation.</hi> What could we think of ſuch a man but that he was a hardened impenitent wretch; and as he would have no part in the Confeſsion, ſo he ſhould have none in the Remiſſion. And ſhall we do that which we ſcarce ever ſee the moſt hardened ſinner do? Shall we ſay, This ſhould not have been ſpoken of us in the ears of the people, but we ſhould have been honoured before them? Certainly ſins
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:99578:164"/>
openly committed are more diſhonourable to us when we hide them, then when we confeſs them. It is the ſin and not the Confeſſion that is our diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: And we have committed them before the Sun, ſo that they cannot be hid. Attempts to cloak them, do increaſe the guilt and ſhame: There is no way to repair the breaches in our honour, which our ſin hath made, but by free Confeſſion and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I durſt not but make Confeſſion of my own: and if any be offended that I have confeſſed theirs, let them know, that I do but what I have done by my ſelf. And if they dare diſown the confeſſion of their ſin, let them do it at their peril. But as for all the truly humble Miniſters of the Goſpel, I doubt not but they will rather be provoked more ſolemnly in the face of their ſeveral Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to lament their ſins, and promiſe Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>

It is a ſad caſe, that men ſhould be of a calling that they know not the nature of, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake they know not what. Do theſe men know
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:99578:165"/>
and conſider what they have undertaken, that live at eaſe and pleaſure, and have time to take their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous recreations, and to ſpend an hour and more at once in loitering and vain diſcourſes, when ſo much work doth lie upon their hands! Why Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, do you conſider where you ſtand, and what you have taken upon you? Why you have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the Conduct under Chriſt of a band of his ſouldiers againſt Principalities and Powers, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wickedneſs in high places. You muſt lead them on the ſharpeſt conflicts. You muſt acquaint them with the enemies ſtratagems and aſſault. You muſt watch your ſelves and keep them watching. If you miſcarry they and you many periſh. You have a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile enemy, and therefore muſt be wiſe; You have a vigilant enemy, and therefore muſt be vigilant. A malicious, and violent, and unwearied enemy; and therefore you muſt be reſolute, couragious &amp; unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. You are in a crowd of enemies, compaſſed with them on every ſide; and if you heed one and not all, you will quickly fall. And O what a world of work have you to do? Had you but one ignorant old man or woman to teach, though willing to learn, what a tedious task is it? But if they be as unwilling as ignorant, how much more difficult is it? But to have ſuch a multitude of theſe, as moſt of us have, what work will it find us? Who hath ever tryed it, that knoweth it not by experience? What a pitiful life is it, to reaſon with men that have almoſt loſt the uſe of reaſon, and to talk with obſtinate willful people, that know what they will and reſolve, but not why they do it? and to argue the caſe with them that neither underſtand themſelves nor you; and yet

think that no man hath underſtanding that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth them, and that are confident they are in the right, when they can ſhew nothing but that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to make them confident? their will is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their judgements and lives: it ſatisfies them, and it muſt ſatisfie you. O Brethren, what a world of wickedneſs have we to contend againſt, in ſome one ſoul! and what a number of thoſe worlds? what rooting have their ſins? what diſadvantage muſt truth come upon? How ſtrange are they to the Heavenly meſſage that we bring them: and know not what you ſay when you ſpeak in that only lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that they underſtand? And when you think you have done ſomething, you leave your ſeed among the ſowls of the air; wicked men are at their elbows to riſe up and contradict all that you have ſaid. They will cavil, and carp, and ſlander you, that they may diſgrace your meſſage, and deride and ſcorn them away from Chriſt, and quickly extinguiſh the good beginnings that you hoped you had ſeen. They uſe indeed weaker reaſons then yours, but ſuch as come with more advantage being neer them, and familiarly and importunately urged, and ſuch as are fetcht from things that they ſee and feel, and which are befriended by their own fleſh. You ſpeak but once to a ſinner, for ten times or twenty times that the Meſſengers of Satan ſpeak to them; moreover, how eaſily do the cares and buſineſſes of the world devour and choak the ſeed which you have ſown? And if it had no enemy but what is in themſelves, how eaſily will a frozen carnal heart, extinguiſh thoſe ſparks which you have been long in kindling? and for want of fewel and further help, they will go out

of themſelves. What abundance of diſtemperers, and luſts, and paſſions, do you caſt your gracious words amongſt? and what entertainment ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions will afford them, you may eaſily conjecture. And when you think your work doth happily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and have ſeen men under troubles and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, confeſsing their ſins, and promiſing reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and living as new creatures and zealous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, alas after all this, they may prove unſound and falſe at the heart, and ſuch as were but ſuperficially changed, and took up new Opinions, and new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, without a new heart: How many are after a notable change, deceived by the profits and honours of the world, and fallen away while they think they ſtand? How many are entangled again in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſuality? and how many do but change a diſgraceful way of fleſh-pleaſing for a way that is leſs diſhonourable, and maketh not ſo great a noiſe in their conſciences? How many grow proud before they reach to a ſettled knowledge, &amp; greedily ſnatch at every error that is preſented to them, under the name of Truth; and in confidence of the ſtrength of their unfurniſhed intellects, deſpiſe them that they were wont to learn of, and become the greateſt grief to their Teachers, that before rejoyced in their hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful beginnings? And like Chickens that ſtraggle from the hen, they are carried away by that infernal Kite, while they proudly deſpiſe the Guidance and advice of thoſe that Chriſt hath ſet over them for their ſafety. O Brethren, what a field of work is there before us? not a perſon that you can ſee but may find you work. In the Saints themſelves, how ſoon do their graces languiſh if you neglect them?
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99578:167"/>
and how eaſily are they drawn into ſcandalous waies, to the diſhonour of the Goſpel, and their own loſs and ſorrow! If this be the work of a Miniſter, you may ſee what a life he hath to lead. Up then, and let us be doing with all our might: Difficulties muſt quicken and not diſcourage in a Poſsible and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary work. If we cannot do all, let us do what we can: For if we neglect it, woe to us and them. Should we paſs over all theſe needful things, and by a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Sermon only, think to prove our ſelves faithful Miniſters, and to put off God and man with ſuch a ſhell and formal vizor, our Reward would prove as ſuperficial as our work.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider alſo that it is by your own voluntary undertaking and engagement, that all this work is laid upon you. No man forced you to be Overſeers of the Church. And doth not common honeſty bind you to be true to your truſt?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider alſo that you have the <hi>Honour</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to the <hi>Labour.</hi> And a great honour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is to be the Embaſſadors of God, and the inſtruments of mens converſion and ſalvation, <hi>to ſave mens ſouls from death, and cover a multitude of ſins, Jam.</hi> 5 <hi>ult.</hi> Indeed the honour is but the attendant of the work. To do therefore as the Prelates of the Church in all ages have done, to ſtrive for preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and fill the world with vile contentions about the dignity and ſuperiority of their ſeats, doth ſhew that they much forget the nature and work of that office which they ſtrive about. I ſeldom ſee men ſtrive ſo ſeriouſly who ſhall go firſt to a poor mans cottage to teach him and his family the way to heaven; or who ſhall firſt endeavour the converſion of a ſinner; or
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:99578:167"/>
firſt become the ſervant of all; ſtrange! that for all the plain expreſſions of Chriſt, men will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the nature of their office! If they did, would they ſtrive who ſhould be the Paſtor of a whole County and more, when there are ten thouſand poor ſinners in it that cry for help; and they are not ſo eager to engage for their relief? Nay when they can patiently live in the houſes with riotous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane perſons, and not follow them ſeriouſly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly for their change? And that they would have the Name and Honour of the work of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who are unable to do all the work of a Pariſh, when the Honour is but the appendix of the work? Is it <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> or the Work and End that theſe deſire? O if they would faithfully, humbly, and ſelf-denyingly lay out themſelves for Chriſt and his Church, and never think of Titles and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſhould then have Honour whether they would or not: but by gaping after it, they loſe it: For this is the caſe of vertues ſhadow, <hi>Quod ſequitu, fugio, quod fugit ipſe ſequor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider alſo, you have the many other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Priviledges of the Miniſterial office to encourage you to the work. If you will not therefore do the work, you have nothing to do with the Priviledges. Its ſomething that you are maintained by other mens labours, and live on the common-wealths allowance. This is for your work, that you may not be taken off it, but as <hi>Paul</hi> requireth, may <hi>Wholly give your ſelves to theſe things,</hi> and not be forced to neglect mens ſouls whileſt you are providing for your own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Either do the work then or take not the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>

                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:99578:168"/>
But you have far greater Priviledges yet then this. Is it nothing to be bred up to Learning, when others are bred at the plough and cart? and to be furniſhed with ſo much delightful knowledge, when the world lieth in ignorance. Is it nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Learned men, and talk of high and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, when others muſt converſe with almoſt none but ſilly ignorants?</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially, What an excellent life is it to live in the ſtudies and preaching of Chriſt? to be ſtill ſearching into his myſteries, or feeding on them! to be daily in the conſideration of the bleſſed Nature, or Works, or Waies of God! Others are glad of the leiſure of the Lords Day, and now and then an hour beſides when they can lay hold of it: But we may keep a continual Sabboth: We may do nothing elſe almoſt but ſtudy and talk of God and Glory, and call upon him, and drink in his ſacred, ſaving truths. Our employment is all high and ſpiritual! Whether we be alone, or with others, our buſineſs is for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. O were but our hearts more ſuitable to this work, what a bleſſed joyful life ſhould we live! How ſweet would our ſtudy be to us? How pleaſant would the pulpit be? and what a delight would our conference of theſe things afford? To live among ſuch excellent helps as our libraries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and have ſo many ſilent wiſe companions when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we pleaſe and of ſuch variety. All theſe and more ſuch Priviledges of the Miniſtery, beſpeak our unwearied diligence in the work.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You are related to Chriſt as well as to the Flock. He therefore being alſo related to you, you are not only advanced but ſecured by the relation, if
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:99578:168"/>
you be but faithful in the work that it requireth. You are the Stewards of his myſteries, and Rulers of his houſhold: And he that entruſted you will maintain you in his work: But then, <hi>it is required of a Steward that a man be found faithful,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. Be true to him, and never doubt but he will be true to you. Do you feed his Flock; and he will ſooner feed you as he did <hi>Elias,</hi> then forſake you. If you be in priſon, he will open the doors; but then you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve impriſoned ſouls. He will give you a tongue and wiſdom that no enemy ſhall reſiſt: but then you muſt uſe it faithfully for him. If you will put forth your hand to relieve the diſtreſſed, and willingly put it to his plough, he will wither the hand that is ſtretched out againſt you. The Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> I am ſure, may know this by large experience. Many a time hath God reſcued them from the jaws of the devourer. O the admirable preſervations, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances that they have had, from cruel Papiſts! from tyranical perſecutors! from malicious Sectaries, &amp; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided paſſionate men! Brethren, in the fear of God conſider, Why is it that God hath done all this? Is it for your perſons, or for his Church? What are you to him more then other men, but for his work and peoples ſakes? Are you Angels, or men? Is your fleſh of any better mettle then your neighbours? Are you not of the ſame Generation of ſinners, that need his grace as much as they? Up then and work as the Redeemed of the Lord; as thoſe that are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely reſcued from ruine for his ſervice. O do not prepare a remedileſs overthrow for the Engliſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery by your ingratitude after all theſe deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If you believe that God hath reſcued you for

               <p n="2">II. THE firſt Motive mentioned in the text, we have ſpoken of, which is from the Conſideration of our office it ſelf. The ſecond is from the <hi>efficient cauſe.</hi> It is <hi>God by his ſpirit</hi> that makes us Overſeers of his Church, therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth us to Take heed to our ſelves and it. I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhew you how the Holy-Ghoſt is ſaid to make Biſhops or Paſtors of the Church in three ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. By Qualifying them for the office: By di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Ordainers to diſcern their Qualifications, and know the fitteſt men: and by directing them, the people and themſelves for the affixing them to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charge. All theſe were done then in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſort, by inſpiration, at leaſt very oft. The ſame are all done now by the ordinary way of the ſpirits aſſiſtance. But it is the ſame ſpirit ſtill: and men are made Over-ſeers of the Church (when they are rightly called) by the Holy-Ghoſt now as well as then. Its a ſtrange conceit therefore of the Papiſts to think that Ordination by the hands of man, is of more abſolute neceſſity to the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Office, then the calling of the Holy-Ghoſt. God hath determined in his word, <hi>that there ſhall be ſuch an office,</hi> and <hi>what the Work and Power ſhall be,</hi> and <hi>what ſort of men,</hi> as to their qualifications, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: None of theſe can be undone by man, or
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:99578:169"/>
made unneceſſary. God alſo <hi>giveth men the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> which he requireth. So that all that the Church hath to do, whether Paſtors or People, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainors or Electors, is but to <hi>diſcern,</hi> and <hi>determine, which are the men that God hath thus Qualified, and to Accept of them that are ſo provided, and upon conſent to inſtall them ſolemnly in this office.</hi> But I purpoſely cut ſhort the controvertible part.</p>
               <p>What an Obligation then is laid upon us by our call? If our Commiſſion be ſent from Heaven, its not to be diſobeyed. When <hi>Paul</hi> was called by the voice of Chriſt, he <hi>was not diſobedient to the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Viſion!</hi> When the Apoſtles were called by Chriſt from their ſecular imployments they preſently leave friends, and houſe, and trade and all, and follow him. Though our call be not ſo immediate or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, yet is it from the ſame ſpirit. Its no ſafe courſe to imitate <hi>Ionah,</hi> in turning our back upon the commands of God. If we neglect our work, he hath a ſpur to quicken us: and if we over-run it he hath Meſſengers enough to over-take us, and fetch us back, and make us do it; and it is be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> to do it at firſt then at laſt. This is the ſecond Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tive.</p>

               <p n="3">III. THE third Motive in the Text, is, from the dignity of the Object. It is the Church of God which we muſt Overſee, and Feed. It is that Church which the world is much upheld for; which is ſanctified by the Holy-Ghoſt; which is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, and is his myſtical body: that Church which Angels are preſent with, and attend upon as Miniſtring Spirits; whoſe very little ones have their Angels beholding the face of God in heaven: O what a charge is it that we have-undertaken! And ſhall we be unfaithful to ſuch a charge! Have we the Stewardſhip of Gods own family, and ſhall we neglect it! Have we the conduct of thoſe Saints that muſt live for ever with God in glory, and ſhall we neglect them! God forbid! I beſeech you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, let this thought awaken the negligent! You that draw back from painful, diſpleaſing, ſuffering duties, and will put off mens ſouls with uneffectual formalities; do you think this is an honourable uſage of Chriſts Spouſe? Are the ſouls of men thought meet by God to ſee his face, and live for ever in his glory, and are they not worthy of your utmoſt coſt and labour? Do you think ſo baſely of the Church of God, as if it deſerved not the beſt of your care and help? Were you the Keepers of ſheep or ſwine, you might better let them go, and ſay, they be not worthy the looking after; and yet you would ſcarce do ſo if they were your own. But dare
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99578:170"/>
you ſay ſo by the ſouls of men even by the Church of God? Chriſt walketh among them: Remember his preſence, and keep all as clean as you can. The praiſes of the moſt high God are in the midſt of them. They are a ſanctified peculiar people, a Kingly Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a choice gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to ſhew forth the praiſes of him that hath called them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. and yet dare you neglect them? What a high honour is it to be but one of them, yea but a door keeper in the houſe of God! but to be the Prieſt of theſe Prieſts, and the Ruler of theſe Kings, this is ſuch an honour as multiplyeth your obligations to diligence and fidelity in ſo noble an employment.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. THE laſt Motive that is mentioned in my Text, is, from the Price that was paid for the Church which we Overſee. God the Son did purchaſe it with his own blood. O what an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is here to quicken the negligent? and what an Argument to condemn thoſe that will not be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up to their duty by it? O ſaith one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Doctors, if Chriſt had but committed to my keeping one ſpoonful of his blood in a fragile glaſs, how curiouſly ſhould I preſerve it, and how tender ſhould I be of that glaſs? If then he have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me the purchaſe of his blood, ſhould I not as carefully look to my charge? What Sirs ſhall we
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99578:171"/>
deſpiſe the blood of Chriſt? Shall we think it was ſhed for them that are not worthy of our utmoſt care? You may ſee here it is not a little fault that negligent Paſtors are guilty of? as much as in them lyeth, the blood of Chriſt ſhould be ſhed in vain: They would loſe him thoſe ſouls that he hath ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought.</p>
               <p>O then let us hear thoſe Arguments of Chriſt, when ever we feel our ſelves grow dull and careleſs; <hi>Did I dye for them, and wilt not thou look after them? Were they worth my blood, and are they not worth thy labour? Did I come down from Heaven to Earth, to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt: and wilt not thou go to the next door, or ſtreet, or Village to ſeek them? How ſmall is thy labour or condeſcention as to mine? I debaſed my ſelf to this, but it is thy honour to be ſo imployed. Have I done and ſuffered ſo much for their ſalvation? and was I willing to make thee a co-worker with me, and wilt thou refuſe that little that lyeth upon thy hands?</hi> Every time we look upon our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, let us believingly remember, that they are the purchaſe of Chriſts blood, and therefore ſhould be regarded accordingly by us.</p>
               <p>And think what a confuſion it will be at the laſt day to a negligent Miniſter, to have this Blood of the Son of God to be pleaded againſt him! and for Chriſt to ſay, <hi>It was the purchaſe of my blood that thou didſt ſo make light of, and doſt thou think to be ſaved by it thy ſelf?</hi> O Brethren, ſeeing Chriſt will bring his Blood to plead with us, let it plead us to our duty, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I Have done with the Motives which I find in the Text it ſelf: There are many more that might be gathered from the reſt of this Exhortation of the Apoſtle; but we muſt not ſtay to take in all. If the Lord will ſet home but theſe few upon your hearts, I dare ſay we ſhall ſee reaſon to mend our pace: and the change will be ſuch on our hearts, and in our Miniſtery, that our ſelves and our Congregations will have cauſe to bleſs God for it. I know my ſelf unworthy to be your Monitor; but a Monitor you muſt have; and its better for us to hear of our ſin, and duty, from any body, then from no body. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the admonition, and you will ſee no cauſe in the Monitors unworthyneſs, to repent of it: but if you reject it, the unworthyeſt Meſſenger may bear that witneſs againſt you that will confound you. But before I leave this Exhortation, as I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed it to our general work, ſo I ſhall carry it a little further to ſome of the ſpecial parts and modes of our Duty which were before expreſſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And firſt and above all, <hi>See that the work of ſaving grace be throughly wrought on your own ſouls.</hi> It is a fearful caſe to be an unſanctified Profeſſor; but much more to be an unſanctified Preacher. Doth it not make you tremble when you open the Bible, leſt you ſhould read there the Sentence of your own Condemnation? when you pen your Sermons, little do you think that you are drawing up inditements againſt
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:99578:172"/>
your own ſouls! When you are arguing againſt ſin, you are aggravating your own: When you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to your hearers the riches of Chriſt and grace, you publiſh your own iniquity in rejecting them, and your unhappineſs in being without them. What can you do in perſwading men to Chriſt in drawing them from the world in urging them to a life of faith and holineſs; but conſcience if it were but awake might tell you, that you ſpeak all this to your own confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If you mention Hell, you mention your own Inheritance: If you deſcribe the Joyes of heaven, you deſcribe your miſery that have no right to it. What can you deviſe to ſay for the moſt part, but it will be againſt your own ſouls? O miſerable life! that a man ſhould ſtudy and preach againſt himſelf, and ſpend all his daies in a courſe of ſelf-condemning! A graceleſs unexperienced Preacher, is one of the moſt unhappy creatures upon earth. And yet is he ordinarily moſt inſenſible of his unhappineſs. For he hath ſo many counters that ſeem like the gold of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, and ſo many ſplendid ſtones that ſeem like the Chriſtians Jewel, that he is ſeldom troubled with the thoughts of his poverty, but thinks he is Rich and wanteth nothing when he is poor, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and blind, and naked: He is acquainted with the holy Scripture, he is exerciſed in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he liveth not in open diſgraceful ſin, he ſerveth at Gods Altar, he reproveth other mens faults, and preacheth up holineſs both of heart and life; and how can this man choſe but be Holy? O what an aggravated miſery is this, to periſh in the midſt of plenty! and to famiſh with the bread of life in our hands, while we offer it to others, and urge it on
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99578:172"/>
them! That thoſe Ordinances of God ſhould be the Occaſions of our deluſion, which are inſtituted to be the means of our conviction and ſalvation? and that while we hold the Looking glaſs of the Goſpel to others, to ſhew them the true face of the ſtate of their ſouls, we ſhould either look on the back ſide of it our ſelves, where we can ſee nothing, or turn it aſide, that it may miſ-repreſent us to our ſelves. If ſuch a wretched man would take my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he ſhould make a ſtand, and call his heart and life to an account, and fall a preaching a while to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, before he preach any more to others: He ſhould conſider whether food in the mouth will nouriſh that goeth not into the ſtomack? whether it be a Chriſt in the mouth or in the heart that will ſave men? Whether <hi>he that nameth him ſhould not depart from iniquity?</hi> and whether <hi>God will hear their prayers, if they regard iniquity in their hearts?</hi> and whether it will ſerve the turn at the day of reckoning to ſay, <hi>Lord we have propheſied in thy name;</hi> when they ſhall hear, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not?</hi> and what comfort it will be to <hi>Iudas</hi> when he is gone to his own place, to remember that he preached with the reſt of the Apoſtles, or that he ſate with Chriſt, and was called by him, <hi>Friend?</hi> and whether a wicked Preacher <hi>ſhall ſtand in the Iudgement, or ſinners in the Aſſembly of the juſt?</hi> When ſuch thoughts as theſe have entred into their ſouls, and kindly workt a while upon their conſciences, I would adviſe them next to go to the Congregation, and there preach over <hi>Origens</hi> Sermon, on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16, 17. <hi>But to the wicked, ſaith God, What haſt thou to do to declare my ſtatutes, or that thou ſhouldſt take my Covenant into</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:99578:173"/>
                  <hi>thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt inſtruction, and haſt caſt my words behind thee?</hi> And when they have read this text, to ſit down, and expound, and apply it by their tears. And then to make a free Confeſſion of their ſin, and lament their caſe before the aſſembly, and deſire their earneſt prayers to God for pardoning and renewing grace; and ſo to cloſe with Chriſt in heart, who before admitted him no further then into the brain; that hereafter they may preach a Chriſt whom they know, and may feel what they ſpeak, and may commend the riches of the Goſpel by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Verily, it is the common danger and calamity of the Church, to have unregenerate and unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Paſtors: and to have ſo many men become Preachers, before they are Chriſtians; to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by dedication to the Altar as Gods Prieſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſanctified by hearty dedication to Chriſt as his Diſciples: &amp; ſo to worſhip an unknown God, and to preach an unknown Chriſt, an unknown ſpirit, an unknown ſtate of holineſs and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God and a glory that is unknown, and like to be unknown to them for ever. He is like to be but a heartleſs Preacher, that hath not the Chriſt and grace that he preacheth in his heart. O that all our Students in the Univerſity would well conſider this! What a poor buſineſs is it to themſelves, to ſpend their time in knowing ſome little of the works of God, and ſome of thoſe names that the divided tongues of the Nations have impoſed on them, and not to know the Lord himſelf, nor exalt him in their hearts, nor to be acquainted with that one renewing work that ſhould make them happy. They do but
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:99578:173"/>
walk in a vain ſhew, and ſpend their lives like dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, while they buſie their wits and tongues about abundance of names and notions, and are ſtrangers to God and the life of Saints. If ever God waken them by ſaving grace, they will have cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and imployments ſo much more ſerious, then their unſanctified ſtudies and diſputations were, that they will confeſs they did but dream before. A world of buſineſs they make themſelves about <hi>Nothing,</hi> while they are wilful ſtrangers to the Primitive, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent neceſſary Being, who is all in all. Nothing can be rightly known, if God be not known: nor is any ſtudy well managed, nor to any great purpoſe, where God is not ſtudyed. We know little of the creature till we know it as it ſtandeth in its Order and reſpects to God: ſingle letters and ſyllables un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed are non ſence. He that over-looketh the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> and ſeeth not the beginning and end, and him in all, who is the <hi>all</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> doth ſee nothing at all. All creatures are as ſuch broken ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables; they ſignifie nothing as ſeparated from God. Were they ſeparated <hi>actually,</hi> they would ceaſe to be, and the ſeparation would be an annihilation: And when we ſeparate them <hi>in our fancies,</hi> we make <hi>Nothing</hi> of them to our ſelves. Its one thing to know the creatures as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and another thing to know them as a Chriſtian. None but a Chriſtian can read one line of his Phyſicks ſo as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it rightly. It is a high and excellent ſtudy, and of greater uſe then many do well underſtand; but its the ſmalleſt part of it that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> can teach us. When man was made perfect, and placed in a perfect world, where all things were in perfect
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:99578:174"/>
order, and very good, the whole Creation was then mans book in which he was to read the nature and will of his great Creator; Every creature had the Name of God ſo legibly engraven on it, that man might run and read it. He could not open his eyes, but he might ſee ſome image of God: but no where ſo fully and lively as in himſelf. And therefore it was his work to ſtudy the whole volume of Nature; but firſt and moſt to ſtudy himſelf. And if man had held on in this preſcribed work he would have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and increaſed in the knowledge of God and himſelf; but when he would needs know and love the creature and himſelf, in a way of ſeparation from God, he loſt the knowledge of all, both of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture himſelf and God, ſo far as it could beatifie, and was worth the name of knowledge, and inſtead of it he hath got the unhappy knowledge which he affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, even the empty notions, and phantaſtick know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the creature and himſelf as thus ſeparated: And thus he that lived to the Creator and upon him, doth now live to, and as upon the (other) crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and himſelf; and thus, <hi>Every man at his beſt eſtate (the Learned as well as the illiterate) is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity: Surely every man walketh in a Vain Shew: ſurely they are diſquieted in vain, Pſal.</hi> 39. 5, 6. And it muſt be well obſerved, that as God laid not by the Relation of a Creator by becoming our Redeemer, nor the Right of his Propriety and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of us in that Relation, but the, work of Redemption ſtandeth in ſome ſubordination to that of Creation, and the Law of the Redeemer to the Law of the Creator: ſo alſo the duties that we owed God as Creator are not ceaſed; but the duties that
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:99578:174"/>
we own to the Redeemer, as ſuch, are ſubordinate thereto. It is the work of Chriſt to bring us back to God, whom we fell from, and to reſtore us to our perfection of Holineſs and Obedience; and as he is the way to the Father, ſo faith in him, is the way to our former employment and enjoyment of God. I hope you perceive what all this driveth at, <hi>viz.</hi> That to ſee God in his creatures, and to love him and converſe with him, was the employment of man in his upright ſtate; That this is ſo far from ceaſing to be our duty, that it is the work of Chriſt by faith to bring us back to it: and therefore the moſt holy men are the moſt excellent ſtudents of Gods works: and none but the holy can rightly ſtudy them, or know them. His works are great, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 2. But not for themſelves but for him that made them. Your ſtudy of Phyſicks and other Sciences, is not worth a ruſh, if it be not God by them that you ſeek after. To ſee and admire to reverence and adore, to love and delight in God appearing to us in his works, and purpoſely to peruſe them for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, this is the true and only Philoſophy, and the contrary is meer foolery, and ſo called and called again by God himſelf. This is the ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your ſtudies, when they are devoted to God, and when he is the life of them all, and they all intend him as the end, and the principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>And therefore I ſhall preſume to tell you by the way, that it is a grand error, and of dangerous Conſequence in the Chriſtian Academies, (pardon the Cenſure from one ſo unfit for it, ſeeing the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99578:175"/>
of the Caſe commandeth it) that they ſtudy the Creature before the Redeemer, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Phyſicks, and Metaphyſicks, and Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, before they ſet themſelves to Theology: when as no man that hath not the vitals of Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is capable of going beyond a fool in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and all that ſuch do is but <hi>doting about queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and oppoſition of ſciences falſly ſo called.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. 21. And as by affecting a ſeparated Creature-knowledge <hi>Adam</hi> fell from God, ſo thoſe that mind theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they miſs the end of all right ſtudies; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: while they will needs preferr theſe, they miſs that faith which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to aim at. Their pretence is, that Theology being the end, and the moſt perfect, muſt be the laſt, and all the ſubſervient ſciences muſt go firſt: But, 1. There is ſomewhat of Natural knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed prerequiſite, and ſomewhat of art, before a man can receive Theology; but that is no more then their mothers can teach them before they go to ſchool. 2. And its true that all right natural knowledge doth tend to the increaſe of Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal knowledge: but that which is a means to its perfection, may be the effect or Conſequent of its beginning: And 3. The end muſt be firſt known, becauſe it muſt be intended before the choice or uſe of means: And 4 The Scripture revealeth to us the things of God himſelf in the moſt eaſie way, and therefore he muſt be firſt learned there: And 5. The book of the Creatures is not to ſhew us more of God then the Scripture doth; but by repreſenting him to us in more ſenſible appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:99578:175"/>
to make our knowledge of him the more intenſe and operative, and being continually before our eyes, God alſo would be continually before them, if we could aright diſcern him in them. Its evident therefore that Theology muſt lay the ground, and lead the way of all our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when we are once acquainted with ſo much of words and things as is needful to our underſtanding the ſenſe of its Principles. If God muſt be ſearched after in our ſearch of the Creature, and we muſt affect no ſeparated know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, then Tutors muſt read God to their Pupils in all; and Divinity muſt be the beginning, the middle, the end, the life, the all of their ſtudies: And our Phyſicks and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks muſt be reduced to Theologie; and nature muſt be read as one of Gods books, which is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely written for the revelation of himſelf. The holy Scripture is the eaſier book: when you have firſt learnt God and his will there, in the neceſſary things, addreſs your ſelves cheerfully to the ſtudy of his works, that you may there ſee the Creature it ſelf as your Alphabet, and their Order as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of ſyllables, words and ſentences, and God as the ſubject matter of all, and the reſpect to him as the ſenſe or ſignification; and then carry on both together, and never more play the meer Scriveners, ſtick no more in your letters and words, but read every Creature as a Chriſtian or a Divine. If you ſee not your ſelves and all things as <hi>living, and moving and having being in God,</hi> you ſee nothing, what ever you think you ſee. If you perceive not in your peruſals of the Creatures, that God is all, and in all,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:99578:176"/>
and ſee not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>(Rom</hi> 11. 36.) you may think perhaps that you <hi>know ſomething, but you know Nothing as you ought to know</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2.) But he that ſeeth and <hi>loveth God in the Creature, the ſame is known and loved of him. (Verſ.</hi> 3.) Think not ſo baſely of the works of God, and your phyſicks, as that they are only preparatory ſtudies for boyes; It is a moſt high and noble part of holineſs to ſearch after, behold, admire, and love the great Creator in all his works: How much have the Saints of God been imployed in it! The beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the books of <hi>Job</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms</hi> may acquaint us that our Phyſicks are not ſo little kin to Theology as ſome ſuppoſe. I do therefore in zeal to the good of the Church, and their own ſucceſs in their moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary labours, propound it to the conſideration of all pious Tutors, whether they ſhould not as time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as diligently read to their Pupils (or cauſe them to read) the chiefeſt parts of Practical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (and there is no other) as any of the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? and whether they ſhould not go together from the very firſt? It is well that they hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; but that is not enough: If they have need of private help in Philoſophy beſides publike Lectures, much more in Theology? If Tutors would make it their principal buſineſs to acquaint their Pupils with the doctrine of Life, and Labour to ſet it home upon their hearts that all might be received accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its weight, and read to their hearts as well as to their heads, and ſo carry on the reſt of their inſtructions, that it may appear they make them
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:99578:176"/>
but ſubſervient unto this, and that their Pupils may feel what they drive at in all, and ſo that they would teach all their Philoſophy <hi>in habitu Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> this might be a happy means to make happy ſouls, and a happy Church and Commonwealth. (The ſame I mean alſo along of the Courſe of Schoolmaſters to their ſcholars.) But when Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages and Philoſophy have almoſt all their time and diligence, and inſtead of reading Philoſophy like Divines, they read Divinity like Philoſophers, as if it were a thing of no more moment then, a leſſon of Muſick, or Arithmetick, and not the doctrine of Everlaſting life; this is it that blaſteth ſo many in the bud, and peſtereth the Church with unſanctified Teachers! Hence it is that we have ſo many worldlings to preach of the inviſible felicity, and ſo many carnal men to declare the myſteries of the Spirit; and I would I might, not ſay, ſo many Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels to preach Chriſt, or ſo many Atheiſts to preach the living God: And when they are taught Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy before or without Religion, what wonder if their Philoſophy be all or moſt of their Religion; and if they grow up into admirations of their unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable fancies, and deifie their own deluded brains, when they know no other God; and if they reduce all their Theologie to their Philoſophy, like <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella, White,</hi> and other ſelf-admirers; or if they take Chriſtianity for a meer deluſion, and fall with <hi>Hobbs</hi> to write <hi>Leviathans,</hi> or with the L. <hi>Herbert</hi> to write ſuch Treatiſes <hi>de veritate,</hi> as ſhall ſhew the world how little they eſteem of verity; or at beſt, if they turn <hi>Paracelſian Behmeniſts,</hi> and ſpin them a Religion from their own inventions! Again there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:99578:177"/>
I addreſs my ſelf to all them that have the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of youth, eſpecially in order to preparation for the Miniſtery; You that are Schoolmaſters and Tutors begin and end with the things of God. Speak daily to the hearts of your Schollars thoſe things that muſt be wrought into their hearts, or elſe they are undone. Let ſome piercing words fall fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from your mouthes, of God, and the ſtate of their ſouls, and the life to come; Do not ſay, They are too young to underſtand and entertain them. You little know what impreſſions they may make which you diſcern not; Not only the ſoul of that boy, but a Congregation, or many ſouls therein may have cauſe to bleſs God for your zeal and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, yea for one ſuch ſeaſonable word. You have a great advantage above others to do them good; You have them before they are grown to the worſt, and they will hear you when they will not hear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If they are deſtinated to the Miniſtery, you are preparing them for the ſpecial ſervice of God; and muſt they not firſt have the knowledge of him whom they muſt ſerve! O think with your ſelves, what a ſad thing it will be to their own ſouls, and what a wrong to the Church of God, if they come out from you with common and carnal hearts, to ſo holy, and ſpiritual and great a work! Of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Students that be in one of your Colledges, how many may there be that are ſerious experienced godly men! ſome talk of too ſmall a number. If you ſhould ſend one half of them on a work that they are un it for, what bloody work will they make in the Church or Countries. Whereas if you be the means of their through-ſanctification, how many
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:99578:177"/>
ſouls may bleſs you, and what greater good can you do the Church? When once their hearts are ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with the Doctrine which they ſtudy and preach, they will ſtudy it more heartily, and preach it heartily: their own experience will direct them to the fitteſt ſubjects, and will furniſh them with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and quicken them to ſet it home; and I obſerve that the beſt of our hearers can feel and favour ſuch experimental preachers, and uſually do leſs regard others, what ever may be their accompliſhments. See therefore that you make not work for Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors nor for the groans and lamentation of the Church, nor for the great Tormenter of the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſouls.</p>

               <p n="2">2. MY ſecond particular Exhortation is this: Content not your ſelves to have the main work of grace, but be alſo <hi>very careful that your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be kept in life and action, and that you preach to your ſelves the Sermons that you ſtud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, before you preach them to others.</hi> If you did this for your own ſakes, it would be no loſt labour; but I am ſpeaking to you upon the publike account, and that you would do it for the ſake of the Church. When your minds are in a heavenly holy frame, your people are like to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the fruits of it. Your prayers, and praiſes, and doctrine will be heavenly and ſweet to them! They will likely feel when you have been much with God: That which is on your hearts moſt, is like to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:99578:178"/>
be moſt in their ears: I confeſs I muſt ſpeak it by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable experience, that I publiſh to my Flock the diſtempers of my ſoul: when I let my heart grow cold, my preaching is cold; and when it is confuſed, my preaching will be ſo; and ſo I can obſerve too, oft in the beſt of my hearers, that when I have a while grown cold in preaching, they have cooled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; and the next Prayers that I have heard from them hath been too like my preaching. We are the Nurſes of Chriſts little ones. If we forbear our food, we ſhall famiſh them; they will quickly find it in the want of Milk; and we may quickly ſee it again on them, in the lean and dull diſcharge of their ſeveral duties: If we let our Love go down; we are not ſo like to raiſe up theirs: If we abate our holy care and fear, it will appear in our Doctrine: If the matter ſhew it not, the manner will. If we feed on unwholſom food, either errors, or fruitleſs controverſies, our hearers are like to fare the worſe for it. Whereas if we could abound in Faith, and Love, and Zeal, how would it over-flow to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of our Congregations, and how would it appear in the increaſe of the ſame graces in others! O Brethren, watch therefore over your own hearts: keep out luſts and paſſions, and worldly inclinations; Keep up the life of Faith and Love; Be much at home: and be much with God. If it be not your daily ſerious buſineſs to ſtudy your own hearts, and ſubdue corruptions, and live as upon God, if you make it not your very work which you conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, all will go amiſs, and you will ſtarve your audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; or if you have but an affected ſervency, you cannot expect ſuch a bleſſing to attend it; Be much,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:99578:178"/>
above all, in ſecret prayer and meditation. There you muſt fetch the heavenly fire that muſt kindle your ſacrifices; Remember you cannot decline and neglect your duty, to your own hurt alone; but many will be loſers by it as well as you. For your peoples ſakes therefore look to your hearts. If a pang of ſpiritual Pride ſhould overtake you, and you ſhould grow into any dangerous or ſchiſmatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and vent your own over-valued inventions, to draw away Diſciples after you, what a wound might this prove to the Church that you are ſet over! and you might become a plague to them inſtead of a bleſſing, and they might wiſh they had never ſeen your faces. O therefore take heed of your own Judgements and Affections. Error and vanity will ſlily inſinuate, and ſeldom come without fair preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Great diſtempers and apoſtacies, have uſually ſmall beginnings. The Prince of darkneſs doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently perſonate the Angels of light, to draw chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light again into his darkneſs. How eaſily alſo will diſtempers creep in upon our affections, and our firſt love, and fear, and care abate! Watch therefore for the ſake of your ſelves and others.</p>
               <p>And more particularly, me thinks a Miniſter ſhould take ſome ſpecial pains with his heart, before he is to go to the Congregation: if it be then cold, how is he like to warm the hearts of the hearers! Go therefore then ſpecially to God for life: and read ſome rowſing waking book, or meditate on the weight of the ſubject that you are to ſpeak of, and on the great neceſſity of your peoples ſouls, that you may go in the zeal of the Lord into his houſe.</p>

               <p n="3">3. MY next particular Exhortation is this, <hi>Star up your ſelves to the great work of God, when you are upon it, and ſee that you do it with all your might.</hi> Though I move you not to a conſtant lowdneſs (for that will make your fervency contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible) yet ſee that you have a conſtant ſeriouſneſs; and when the matter requireth it (as it ſhould do it, the application at leaſt of every Doctrine) then lift up your voice, and ſpare not your ſpirits, and ſpeak to them as to men that muſt be awakened, either here or in Hell. Look upon your Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions believingly and with compaſſion, and think in what a ſtate of Joy or Torment they muſt all be for ever; and then me thinks it ſhould make you earneſt, and melt your heart in the ſenſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. O ſpeak not one cold or careleſs word about ſo great a buſineſs as heaven or hell! What ever you do, let the people ſee that you are in good ſadneſs. Truly Brethren, they are great works that are to be done, and you muſt not think that trifling will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch them. You cannot break mens hearts by jeſting with them, or telling them a ſmooth tale, or patching up a gawdy oration. Men will not caſt away their deereſt pleaſures upon a drowſie requeſt of one that ſeemeth not to mean as he ſpeaks, or to care much whether his requeſt be granted. If you ſay, That the work is Gods, and he may do it by the weakeſt means; I anſwer, Its true, he may do ſo;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:99578:179"/>
But yet his ordinary way is to work by means; and to make not only the matter that is preacht, but alſo the manner of preaching to be inſtrumental to the work: Or elſe it were a ſmall matter whom he ſhould imploy that would but ſpeak the truth. If grace made as little uſe of the Miniſterial perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as ſome conceive, we need not ſo much mind a Reformation, nor caſt out the Inſufficient.</p>
               <p>A great matter alſo with the moſt of our hearers, doth lie in the very pronunciation and tone of ſpeech; The beſt matter will ſcarce move them, if it be not movingly delivered. Eſpecially, ſee that there be no affectation, but that we ſpeak as familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our people as we would do if we were talking to any of them perſonally. The want of a familiar tone and expreſſion, is as great a defect in moſt of our deliveries, as any thing whatſoever, and that which we ſhould be very careful to amend. When a man hath a Reading or Declaming tone, like a School-boy ſaying his leſſon or an Oration, few are moved with any thing that he ſaith. Let us therefore rowſe up our ſelves to the work of the Lord, and ſpeak to our people as for their lives, and ſave them as by violence, pulling them out of the fire: Satan will not be charmed out of his poſſeſſion: we muſt lay ſiege to the ſouls of ſinners which are his garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and find out where his chief ſtrength lyeth, and lay the battery of Gods Ordinance againſt it, and ply it cloſe till a breach be made; and then ſuffer them not by their ſhifts to make it up again; but find out their common objections, and give them a full and ſatisfactory anſwer. We have reaſonable creatures to deal with; and as they abuſe their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:99578:180"/>
againſt the truth, ſo they will expect better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it before they will obey. We muſt therefore ſee that our Sermons be all <hi>convincing,</hi> and that we make the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Scripture and Reaſon</hi> ſhine ſo bright in the faces of the ungodly, that it may even force them to ſee unleſs they willfully ſhut their eyes. A Sermon full of meer words, how neatly ſoever it be compoſed, while there is wanting the light of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the life of Zeal, is but an image or a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt carkaſs; In preaching there is intended a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſouls, and a communication of ſomewhat from ours unto theirs. As we and they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and wills, and affections, ſo muſt the bent of our endeavours be to communicate the fulleſt Light of Evidence from our underſtandings unto theirs, and to warm their hearts by kindling in them holy affections, as by a communication from ours. The great things which we have to commend to our hearers, have reaſon enough on their ſide, and lie plain before them in the word of God; we ſhould therefore be ſo furniſhed with all ſtore of Evidence, as to come as with a torrent upon their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and bear down all before us, and with our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma's and expoſtulations to bring them to a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, and pour out ſhame upon all their vain objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they may be forced to yield to the power of truth, and ſee that it is great and will prevail.</p>

               <p n="4">4. MOreover, if you would proſper in your work; Be ſure to keep up earneſt deſires and expectations of ſucceſs. If your hearts be not ſet on the end of your labours; and you long not to ſee the converſion and edification of your hearers, and do not ſtudy and preach in hope, you are not likely to ſee much fruit of it. Its an ill ſign of a falſe ſelf-ſeeking heart, that can be content to be ſtill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſee no fruits of their labour; ſo I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that God ſeldom bleſſeth any mans work ſo much as his whoſe heart is ſet upon the ſucceſs; Let it be the property of a <hi>Iudas</hi> to have more regard to the bag then to his buſineſs, and not to care much for what they pretend to care; and to think if they have their Tythes, and the love and commendations of the people, that they have enough to ſatisfie them: but let all that preach for Chriſt and mens ſalvation, be unſatisfied till they have the thing they preach for: He had never the right end of a Preacher, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different whether he do obtain them, and is not grieved when he miſſeth them, and rejoyced when he can ſee the deſired iſſue. When a man doth only ſtudy what to ſay, and how with commendation to ſpend the hour, and looks no more after it, unleſs it be to know what people think of his own abilities, and thus holds on from year to year, I muſt needs think that this man doth preach for himſelf, and drive on a private trade of his own, and doth not
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:99578:181"/>
preach for Chriſt even when he preacheth Chriſt, how excellently ſoever he may ſeem to do it. No wiſe or charitable Phyſitian is content to be ſtill gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Phyſick, and ſee no amendment among his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, but have them all to die upon his hands: nor will any wiſe and honeſt Schoolmaſter be content to be ſtill teaching though his Scholars profit not; but either of them would rather be weary of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. I know that a faithful Miniſter may have comfort when he wants ſucceſs and though Iſrael be not gathered, our reward is with the Lord: and our acceptance is not according to the fruit, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our labour; and as <hi>Greg. M.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Et Aethiops etſi balneum niger intrat, &amp; niger egreditur, tamen balneat or nummos accipit.</hi> If God ſet us to waſh Blackamores, and cure thoſe that will not be cured; we ſhall not loſe our labour, though we perform not the cure. But then 1. He that longeth not for the ſucceſs of his labours, can have none of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, becauſe he was not a faithful labourer: This is only for them that I ſpeak of, that are ſet upon the end, and grieved if they miſs it 2. And this is not the full comfort that we muſt deſire, but only ſuch a part as may quiet us though we miſs the reſt. What if God will accept a Phyſitian though the Patient dye? He muſt work in compaſſion, and long for a better iſſue, and be ſorry if he miſs of it, for all that: For it is not only our own Reward that we labour for, but other mens ſalvation. I confeſs for my part, I marvel at ſome antient Reverend men, that have lived 20. or 40. or 50 years with an unprofitable people, where they have ſeen ſo little fruit of their labours, that it was ſcarce diſcernable, how they can

with ſo much patience there go on? Were it my caſe, though I durſt not leave the Vineyard, nor quit my calling, yet I ſhould ſuſpect that it was Gods will, I ſhould go ſome whether elſe, and another come thither that might be fitter for them; and I ſhould not be eaſily ſatisfied to ſpend my daies in ſuch a ſort.</p>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Do well</hi> as well as <hi>ſay well:</hi> be zealous of good works. Spare not for any coſt, if it may promote your maſters work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Maintain your innocency, and walk without offence. Let your lives condemn ſin, and perſwade men to duty. Would you have your people be more careful of their ſouls, then you will be of yours? If you would have them redeem their time, do not you miſſpend yours. If you would not have them vain in their conference, ſee that you ſpeak your ſelves the things which may edifie, and tend to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter grace to the hearers. Order your own families well if you would have them do ſo by theirs. Be not Proud and Lordly if you would have them to be lowly. There is no vertue wherein your example will do more, at leaſt to abate mens prejudice, then humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and meekneſs, and ſelf-denyal. Forgive injuries, and be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good: Do as our Lord, who when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, reviled not again; If ſinners be ſtubborn, and ſtout, and contemptous, fleſh and blood will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:99578:182"/>
you to take up their weapons, and to maſter them by their carnal means; but thats not the way, (further then neceſſary ſelf-preſervation or publike good requireth it) but overcome them with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and patience, and gentleneſs. The former may ſhew that you have more worldly power then they (wherein yet they are ordinarily too hard for the faithful); but its the later only that will tell them that you overtop them in ſpiritual excellency, and in the true qualifications of a Saint. If you believe that Chriſt was more imitable then <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> and that its more glory to be a Chriſtian then to be a Conqueror, yea to be a man then a beaſt, (who oft exceed us in ſtrength) contend then with charity, and not with violence; and ſet Meekneſs, and Love, and Patience againſt force, and not force againſt force: Remember you are obliged to be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of all. Condeſcend to men of low eſtate; be not ſtrange to the poor ones of your Flock. They are apt to take your ſtrangeneſs for contempt: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity improved to holy ends, is exceeding neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and may do abundance of good. Speak not ſtoutly or diſreſpectively to any one: but be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to the meaneſt as your equal in Chriſt. A kind and winning carriage is a cheap way of advantage to do men good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Remember what I ſaid before of works of Bounty and Charity: Go to the poor, and ſee what they want, and ſhew at once your compaſsion to ſoul and body. Buy them a Catechiſm and ſome ſmall Books that are likeſt to do them good, and beſtow them on your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and make them promiſe you to read
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:99578:182"/>
them, and ſpecially to ſpend that part of the Lords day therein, which they can ſpare from greater du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Stretch your purſe to the utmoſt, and do all the good you can. Think not of being rich, ſeek not great things for your ſelves or poſterity. What if you do impoveriſh your ſelves to do a greater good; will it be loſs or gain! If you believe that God is your ſafeſt purſe-bearer, and that to expend in his ſervice is the greateſt uſury, and the moſt thriving trade, ſhew them that you do believe it. I know that fleſh and blood will cavil before it will looſe its prey, and will never want ſomewhat to ſay againſt that duty that is againſt its intereſt; But mark what I ſay, and the Lord ſet it home upon your hearts; <hi>That man that hath any thing in the world ſo dear to him that he cannot ſpare it for Chriſt if he call for it, is no true Chriſtian,</hi> And becauſe a carnal heart will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt calls for it when he cannot ſpare it, and therefore makes that his ſelf deceiving ſhift, I ſay furthermore; that <hi>That man that will not be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that duty is duty, becauſe he cannot ſpare that for Chriſt which is therein to be expended, is no true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian:</hi> For a falſe heart corrupteth the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that again increaſeth the deluſions of the heart. Do not take it therefore as an undoing to make you friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to lay up a treaſure in heaven, though you leave your ſelves but little on earth. <hi>Nemo tam pauper poteſt eſſe quam natus eſt; Aves ſine patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio vivunt, &amp; in diem pecua paſcuntur; &amp; haec nobis tamen nata ſunt; quae omnia ſi non concupiſcimus poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidemus, inquit Minutins Felix.</hi> p. <hi>(mihi)</hi> 397. You loſe no great advantage for heaven by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:99578:183"/>
poor; <hi>Qui viam terit, eo faelicior quo levior ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Id.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know where the heart is carnal and covetous, words will not wring their money out of their hands; They can ſay all this, and more to others; but ſaying is one thing, and believing is another. But with thoſe that are true believers, me thinks ſuch conſiderations ſhould prevail. O what abundance of good might Miniſters do if they would but live in a contempt of the world, and the riches and glory of it, and expend all they have for the beſt of their Maſters uſe, and pinch their fleſh that they might have wherewith to do good. This would unlock more hearts to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of their Doctrine, then all their oratory will do; and without this, ſingularity in religiouſneſs will ſeem but hypocriſie, and its likely that it is ſo. <hi>Qui innocentiam colit, Domino ſupplicat.—qui hominem periculo ſurripit, opimam victimam caedit; Haec noſtra ſacrificia; haec Dei ſacra ſunt; ſic apud nos Religioſior eſt ille qui juſtior, inquit idem Minutius Felix. ib.</hi> Though we need not do as the Papiſts, that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them to Monaſteries, and caſt away Propriety, yet we muſt have nothing but what we have for God.</p>

               <head>SECT. X.</head>
               <p n="6">6. THE next branch of my Exhortation is, that you would <hi>maintain your Chriſtian and brotherly Unity and Communion,</hi> and do as much of Gods work as you can in unanimity and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Bleſſed be the Lord that it is ſo well with us in this County in this regard as it is. We loſe our Authority with our people when we divide. They will yield to us when we go together, who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and contemn the beſt of us alone.</p>
               <p>Two things in order to this I beſeech you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. The firſt is, that you ſtill maintain your meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for communion: Incorporate, and hold all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian correſpondency; Grow not ſtrange to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Do not ſay, that you have buſineſs of your own to do, when you ſhould be at any ſuch meeting or other work for God. It is not only the mutual edification that we may receive by Lectures, diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or conferences (though thats not nothing) but it is ſpecially for conſultations for the common good, and the maintaining of our Communion, that we muſt thus aſſemble. Though your own perſon might be without the benefit of ſuch meetings, yet the Church and our common work requireth them. Do not then ſhew your ſelves contemners or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecters of ſuch a neceſſary work. Diſtance breedeth ſtrangeneſs, and ſomenteth dividing flames and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, which Communion wil prevent or cure. It wil be our enemies chiefeſt plot to divide us that they may
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:99578:184"/>
weaken us: conſpire not with the enemies, and take not their courſe. And indeed Miniſters have need of one another, and muſt improve the gifts of God in one another: and the ſelf-ſufficient are the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and commonly proud and empty men. Some there be that come not among their brethren to do or receive good, nor afford them any of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in conſultations for the common good, and their excuſe is only <hi>we love to live privately.</hi> To whom I ſay, why do you not on the ſame grounds forbear going to Chriſt, and ſay You love to live privately? Is not Miniſterial Commnnion a duty, as well as common-Chriſtian Communion? and hath not the Church always thought ſo, and practiſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly? If you mean that you love your own eaſe or commodity better then Gods ſervice, ſay ſo and ſpeak your minds. But I ſuppoſe there are few of them ſo ſilly as to think that is any juſt excuſe, though they will give us no better. Somewhat elſe ſure lieth at the bottom. Indeed ſome of them are empty men, and afraid their weakneſs ſhould be known, when as they cannot conceal it by their fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſs, and might do much to heal it by Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: ſome of them are careleſs or ſcandalous men: &amp; for them we have no deſire of their Communion, not ſhall admit it, but upon publike Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Some of them are ſo in love with their parties and opinions, that they will not hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with us becauſe we are not of their parties and opinions: whereas by Communication they might give or receive better information, or at leaſt carry on ſo much of Gods work in unity as we are agreed in. But the miſchief of ſchiſm is to make
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:99578:184"/>
men cenſorious and proud, and take others to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet for their communion, and themſelves to be the only Church, (or pure Church) of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts will have no Catholick Church but the <hi>Romans,</hi> and unchurch all beſide themſelves. The Separatiſts and many Anabaptiſts ſay the like of their parties: The new prelatical party will have no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church but Prelatical, and unchurch all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their party, and ſo avoid Communion with others; and thus turning Separatiſts and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, they imitate the Papiſts, and make an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſchiſm their pretence. Firſt, All muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſchiſmaticks that he not of their opinion and party (when yet we find not that opinion in the Creed), and they muſt be avoided becauſe they are Schiſmaticks. But were ſolve by the grace of God to adhere to more Catholick principles and practices, and to have Communion with all Godly Chriſtians that will have Communion with us, ſo far as they force us not to actual ſin. And for the ſeparating Brethren, as by diſtance they are like to theriſh miſinformations of us, ſo if by their wilful eſtrangedneſs, and diſtance, any among us do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain injurious reports of them, and think worſe of them, and deal worſe by ſome of them, then there is cauſe, they may partly thank themſelves.</p>
               <p>Sure I am by ſuch means as theſe we are many of us grown ſo hardened in ſin, that men make no great matter what they ſay one againſt another, but ſtand out of hearing and ſight, and vent their ſpleen againſt each other behind their backs. How many jeers and ſcorns have they among their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for thoſe that are againſt their party! and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:99578:185"/>
they eaſily venture be'the matter never ſo falſe. A bad report of ſuch is eaſily taken to be true; and that which is true is eaſily made worſe: when as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>[Multos abſolvemus, ſi coeperimus ante ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare quam iraſci: nunc autem primum impetum ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimur]</hi> It is paſſion that tels the tale, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing therefore that I intreat of you is, that you would be very tender of the Unity and Peace of the Catholick Church; not only of your own parties, but of the whole. And to this end theſe things will prove neceſſary. 1. Do not too eaſily introduce any Novelties into the Church ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in faith or practice: I mean not, that which ſeems a novelty to men that look no further then yeſterday; for ſo the reſtoring of Ancient things will ſeem novelty to thoſe that know not what was Anciently; and the expulſion of prevailing novelties will ſeem a novelty to them that known not what is ſuch indeed. So the Papiſts cenſure us as Noveliſts for caſting out many of their Innovations; and our common people tell us we bring up new Cuſtoms if we do not kneel at the receiving of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: (A notorious Novelty: Even in the ſixth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council at <hi>Trull. in Conſtantinop.</hi> this was the ninth Canon: <hi>Ne Dominicis diebus genua flectamus; à Divinis Patribus noſtris Canonice accepimus: Quare poſt veſpertinum ingreſſum Sacerdotum in Sabbato ad Altare ut more obſervatum eſt, nemo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu flectii uſque ad ſequentem veſperem poſt domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam.)</hi> It is that which is indeed Novelty that I diſſwade you from, and not the demoliſhing of Novelties. Some have already introduced ſuch New
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:99578:185"/>
Phraſes, at leaſt, even about the great points of faith, luſtification and the like, that there may be reaſon to reduce them to the Primitive Patterns.</p>
               <p>A great ſtir is made in the world about the teſt of a Chriſtian and true Church, with whom we may have Communion, and about that true Center and Cement of the Unity of the Church, in and by which our Common calamitous breaches muſt be healed. And indeed the true Cauſe of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived diviſions and miſery is for want of diſcerning the center of our unity, and the terms on which it muſt be done: which is great pity, when it was once ſo eaſie a matter, till the ancient teſt was thought inſufficient! If any of the Ancient Creeds might ſerve, we might be ſoon agreed. If <hi>Vinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntius Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineuſ.</hi> teſt might ſerve, we might yet make ſome good ſhift, <hi>viz.</hi> To believe (explicitly) all that <hi>quod ubique quod ſemper quod ab omnibus creditum eſt</hi> For as he addeth <hi>[hoc eſt etenim verè propriè<expan>

                     </expan> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum]</hi> But then we muſt come 1. That the firſt age may not be excluded which gave the rule to the reſt. 2. And that this extend not to every Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which never was taken for unalterable, but to matters of faith; and that the acts and Canons of Councils, which were not about ſuch matters of faith, but meer variable order, and which newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted thoſe things, which the Apoſtolike Age knew not, and therefore were not properly <hi>Credita,</hi> much leſs, <hi>ſemper, &amp; ab omnibus,</hi> may have no hand in this work. I ſay if either the ancient Weſtern, or Eaſtern Creed, or this Catholick faith of <hi>Vincentius</hi> might be taken as the teſt for explicit ſaith, or elſe rather all thoſe Scripture texts, that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:99578:186"/>
expreſs the <hi>Credenda</hi> with a note of neceſſity, and the the whole Scripture moreover be confeſſed to be Gods word, and ſo believed (in other points) at leaſt implicitly; this Courſe might produce a more general Communion and agreement; and more lines would meet in this Center then otherwiſe are like to meet. And indeed till men can be again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make the Scripture the ſufficient Rule, in Neceſſaries to be explicitly believed, and in all the reſt implicitly, we are never like to ſee a Catholike Chriſtian durable Peace. If we muſt needs make the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or the Papal Judgement our teſt; or if we muſt make a blind bargain, with the Papiſts to come as near them as ever we dare, and ſo to compaſs another <hi>Interim,</hi> and make that a teſt (when God never made it ſo, and all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans never be of a mind in it, but ſome dare go nearer <hi>Rome,</hi> then others dare, and that in ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) or if we muſt thruſt in all the Canons of the former Councils about matters of order, diſcipline and ceremonies into our teſt, or gather up all the opinions of the Fathers for the three or four firſt ages, and make them our teſt; None of all theſe will ever ſeem to do the buſineſs! and a Catholike Union will never be founded in them. It is an eaſie matter infallibly to foretel this. Much leſs can the writings of any ſingle man, as <hi>Auſtin, Aquinas, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> &amp;c. or yet the late Confeſſors of any Churches that add to the ancient teſt, be ever capable of this uſe and honour.</p>
               <p>I know it is ſaid that a man may ſubſcribe the Scripture, and the ancient Creeds, and yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Socinianiſm or other hereſies: To which I
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:99578:186"/>
anſwer, 1. So he may another teſt which your own brains ſhall contrive; and while you make a ſnare to catch hereticks, inſtead of a teſt for the Churches Communion, you will miſs your end, and the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick by the ſlipperyneſs of his conſcience will break through, and the tender Chriſtian may poſſibly be enſnared. And by your new Creed the Church is like to have new diviſions, if you keep not cloſe to the words of Scripture. 2. In ſuch caſes when hereticks contradict the Scripture, which they have ſubſcribed, this calls not for a new or more ſufficient teſt, but the Church muſt take notice of it, and call him to account, and if he be impenitent exclude him their Communion. What I muſt we have new Laws made every time the old ones are broken? as if the Law were not ſufficient becauſe men break it? Or rather muſt not the penalty of the violated Law be executed? It is a moſt ſad caſe that ſuch reaſons as theſe ſhould prevail with ſo many learned godly men, to deny the ſufficiency of Scripture as a teſt for Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and to be ſtill framing new ones that depart (at leaſt) from Scripture-phraſe, as if this were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to obviate hereſies? Two things are neceſſary to obviate hereſies, the Law and good execution; God hath made the former, and his Rule and Law is both for ſenſe and phraſe (tranſlated) ſufficient: and all their additional inventions as to the foreſaid uſe are as ſpiders webs. Let us but do our part in the Due execution of the Laws of Chriſt, by que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning offenders in orderly Synods, for the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Laws, and let us avoid Communion with the impenitent; and what can the Church do more? The reſt belongs to the Magiſtrate (to reſtrain him
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:99578:187"/>
from ſeducing his ſubjects) and not to us.</p>
               <p>Well! this is the thing that I would recommend therefore to all my Brethren as the moſt neceſſary thing to the Churches peace, that you <hi>Unite in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truths, and tolerate tolerable failings; and bear with one another in things that may be born with; and do not make a larger Creed, and more neceſſaries then God hath done.</hi> And to that end, let no mans writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor the judgement of any party though right, be taken as a teſt, or made that rule. And I, Lay not too great a ſtreſs upon controverted opinions, which <hi>have godly men,</hi> and ſpecially <hi>whole Churches</hi> on both ſides. 2. Lay not too great a ſtreſs on thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies that are ultimately reſolved into Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical uncertainties (as ſome unprofitable contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies are about Free-will, and the manner of the ſpirits operation of Grace, and the Divine Decrees and Pre-determination.) 3. Lay not too great a ſtreſs on thoſe controverſies that are meerly verbal, and if they were anatomized would appear to be no more. Of which ſort are far more, (I ſpeak it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently upon certain knowledge) that now make a great noiſe in the world, and tear the Church, then almoſt any of the eager contenders that ever I ſpoke with do ſeem to diſcern, or are like to believe. 4. Lay not too much on any point of faith which was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned of, or unknown to the whole Church of Chriſt in any age ſince the Scriptures were delivered us. 5. Much leſs ſhould you lay too much on thoſe which any of the more pure or judicious ages were wholly ignorant of. 6. And leaſt of all, ſhould you lay too much on any point which no one age ſince the Apoſtles did ever receive, but all commonly hold
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:99578:187"/>
the contrary. For to make ſuch an error which all the Church held, to be ſuch as is damning were to unchurch all the Church of Chriſt: and to make it ſuch, as muſt exclude them from our Communion. 1. Doth make the whole Church excommunicable, which is abſurd. 2. And doth ſhew that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> we had lived in that age, you would it ſeems have ſeparated from the whole Church. To give an inſtance of the difference among errors. That any elect perſon ſhall fall away totally and finally, is a palpable condemned error; of dangerous conſequence. But that there are ſome juſtified ones not elect that ſhall fall away and periſh, is an errour of a lower nature, which may not break the Communion of Chriſtians: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we muſt renounce Communion with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> daies, and much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as is ſaid before.) What then? Shall I take this therefore for a truth which the Church then held? ſome will think me immodeſt to ſay, No; as if I were wiſer then all the Church, and that in ſo learned an age if not for ſo many: But yet I muſt be ſo immodeſt, as long as Scripture ſeemeth to me to warrant it! Why might not <hi>Auguſtine, Proſper,</hi> and all the reſt miſtake in ſuch a thing, as that? But then I am not ſo immodeſt nor unchriſtian as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church all the Church on that account: Nor would I have ſeparated from <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and all the Church, if I had then lived; Nor will do now from any man on that account. Both ſides will be diſpleaſed with this reſolution, one, that I ſuppoſe all the Church to err, and our ſelves to be in the right; and the other, that I take it for no greater an error: but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy! it will, it muſt be ſo; Read <hi>Proſpers Reſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad</hi>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:99578:188"/>
                  <hi>Capit. Gall.</hi> and you may quickly know both <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> mind and his.</p>
               <p>He that ſhall live to that happy time, when God will heal his broken Churches, ſhall ſee all this that I am now pleading for, reduced to practice, and this moderation take place of the new dividing zeal, and Scripture-ſufficiency take place, and all mens Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Comments to be valued only as ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent helps, and not to be the teſt of Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, any further then they are exactly the ſame with Scripture. And till the healing Age come, we cannot expect that healing truths be entertained, becauſe there are not healing ſpirits in the Leaders of the Church. But when the work is to be done, the workmen will be fitted for it; and bleſſed will be the agents of ſo glorious a work.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Love of Unity and Verity, Peace and Purity muſt be conjunctly manifeſted, we muſt avoid the extreams both in Doctrine and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The extreams in Doctrine are on one ſide, by Innovating Additions: on the other ſide by envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or hindring the progreſs of the light. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is the moſt dangerous, of which men are guilty theſe waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By making new points of faith, or duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By making thoſe points to be fundamental or neceſſary to ſalvation, that are not ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By pretending of Prophetical and other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurer paſſages of the Scriptures that they have a greater objective Evidence, and we a greater certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their meaning, then indeed is ſo.</p>
               <p>As I have met with ſome ſo confident of their right underſtanding of the <hi>Revelation</hi> (which <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:99578:188"/>
durſt not expound, and profeſt he underſtood it not) that they have framed part of their Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Articles of faith out of it; and grounded the weightyeſt actions of their lives upon their expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and could confidently tell in our late changes and differences, which ſide was in the right and which in the wrong, and all from the <hi>Revelation;</hi> and thence would fetch ſuch arguments as would carry all, if you would but grant the ſoundneſs of their expoſitions; but if you put them to prove that, you marr'd all.</p>
               <p>And theſe corruptions of ſacred Doctrine by their Additions are of two ſorts: ſome that are the firſt Inventers: and others that are the propagators and maintainers: and theſe when Additions grow old, do commonly maintain them under the notion of antient verities, and oppoſe the antient verities under the notion of Novelty, as is before ſaid.</p>
               <p>The other extream about Doctrine is by hindring the progreſs of knowledge: and this is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on pretence of avoiding the Innovating extream. It muſt be conſidered therefore, how far we may grow, and not be culpable Innovaters. And 1.

almoſt nothing, and to be themſelves the members of ſome ſingular ſociety, as if they were loth to have too much company in heaven. And by a ſtrange deluſion through the workings of a proud fancy, they are fuller of joy in their ſeparted ſocieties, then they were, while they kept in the union of the Church. At leaſt ſuch power of Ordinances, and preſence of the ſpirit, purity and peace, is promiſed to the weak by the Leaders that would ſeduce them, as if the Holy-Ghoſt were more eminently among them then any where elſe in the world.

               <p>Having ſaid thus much of the means, I return to the end of this Exhortation beſeeching all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt to compaſſionate the poor divided Church, and to entertain ſuch <hi>Catholike principles,</hi> and <hi>charitable diſpoſitions,</hi> as tend to their own and the common peace. Hath any thing in the world
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:99578:190"/>
done more to loſe our authority, and diſable us for Gods ſervice then our differences and diviſions? If Miniſters could but be all of a mind, or at leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr in the ſubſtance of the work, ſo that the people that hear one, might as it were hear all, and not have any of us to head a party for the diſcontented to fall into or to object againſt the reſt, we might then do wonders for the Church of Chriſt. But if our tongues and hearts be divided, what wonder if our work be ſpoiled, and prove liker a <hi>Babel</hi> then a Temple of God. Get together then ſpeedily, and conſult for peace, and cheriſh not heart-burnings, and continue not uncharitable diſtances and ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If dividing hath weakened you, cloſing muſt recover your authority and ſtrength. If you have any diſlike of your Brethren or their waies, manifeſt it by a free debate to their faces, but do not unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily withdraw from them. If you will but keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, you may come to better underſtanding of each other, or at leaſt may chide your ſelves. Friends, ſpecially quarrel not upon points of precedency or reputation, or any intereſt of your own. No man will have ſettled peace in his mind, nor be peaceable in his place, that proudly envyeth the precedency, of others, and ſecretly grudgeth at them that ſeem to cloud their parts and name. One or other will ever be an eye-ſore to ſuch men. There is too much of the Devils image on this ſin, for an humble ſervant of Chriſt to entertain. Moreover, be not too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of injuries: and make not a great matter of every offenſive word or deed. At leaſt do not let it interrupt your Communion and Concord in Gods work: For that were to wrong Chriſt and his Church,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:99578:191"/>
becauſe another hath wronged you. And if you be of this impatient humor, you will never be quiet: For we are all faulty, and cannot live together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wronging one another. <hi>Ubi<expan>

               <p>And as for thoſe opinions which hinder our union (alas the great dividers of this age) me thinks if I cannot change their minds, I might yet rationally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of every Party among us that profefs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, that they ſhould value the <hi>whole</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>part;</hi> and therefore not ſo perverſly ſeek to promote their party, as may hinder the common good of the Church, or ſo to propagate their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Truths, as to hinder the work of the main bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of divine Truths.

THE next branch of my Exhortation is, that <hi>You would no longer neglect the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo much Diſcipline in your Congregations, as it of confeſſed neceſſity and right.</hi> I deſire not to ſour on any one to an unſeaſonable performance of the greateſt duty. But will it never be a fit ſeaſon? Would you forbear Sermons and Sacraments ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years on pretence of unſeaſonableneſs? Will you have better ſeaſon for it, when you are dead? How many are dead already before they ever did any thing in this work that were long preparing for it? It is now near three years ſince many of us here did engage our ſelves to this duty: And have we been faithful in performance of that engagement? I know ſome have more diſcouragements and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances then others: But what diſcouragements can excuſe us from ſuch a duty? Beſides the Reaſons that we then conſidered of, let theſe few be further laid to heart.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How ſad a ſign do we make it to be in our preaching to our people, to live in the willful conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued omiſſion of any known duty? And ſhall we do ſo even year after year and all our daies. If excuſes will take off the danger of this ſign, what man will not find them as well as you? Read <hi>Ameſius medul. cap.</hi> 37. <hi>de Diſciplin. Eccleſ. &amp; Geleſpi's, Aarons</hi> rod,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:99578:192"/>
with <hi>Rutherford</hi> and many more that are written to prove the Need and Dueneſs of Diſcipline, ſaith <hi>Ameſ. ib. ſect.</hi> 5. <hi>Immo peccat in Chriſtum authorem ac inſtitutorem quiſquis non facit quod in ſe eſt, ad hanc Diſciplinam in Eccleſiis Dei conſtituendam &amp; promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendam.</hi> And do you think it ſafe to live and dye in ſuch a known ſin?</p>
               <p n="2">2. You gratifie the preſent deſigns of dividers, whoſe buſineſs is to unchurch us and unchriſten us: to prove our Pariſhes no true Churches (and our ſelves no baptized Chriſtians.) For if you take them for people uncapable of Diſcipline, they muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper and other Church-Communion; and then they are no Church. And ſo you will plainly ſeem to preach meerly as they do, to gather Churches where there were none before. And indeed if that be your caſe that your people are not Chriſtians, and you have no particular Churches, and ſo are no Paſtors, tell us ſo and manifeſt it, and we ſhall not blame you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We do manifeſt plain lazineſs and ſloath, if not unfaithfulneſs in the work of Chriſt. I ſpeak from experience; It was lazineſs that kept me off ſo long, and pleaded hard againſt this duty. It is indeed a troubleſom and painful work, and ſuch as calls for ſome ſelf-denyal, becauſe it will caſt us upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the wicked. But dare we preferr our carnal eaſe, and quietneſs, and the love or peace of wicked men, before our ſervice to Chriſt our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? Can ſloathful ſervants look for a good reward? Remember Brethren, that we of this County have thus Promiſed before God in the ſecond Article of our Agreement, <hi>We agree and reſolve by Gods help,</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:99578:193"/>
                  <hi>that ſo far as God doth make known our duty to us, we will faithfully endeavour to diſcharge it, and will not, deſiſt through any fears or loſſes in our eſtates, or the frowns and diſpleaſure of men, or any the like carnal inducements whatſoever.</hi> I pray you ſtudy this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and compare your performance with it. And do not think that you were enſnared by thus engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for Gods Law hath laid an obligation on you to all the ſame duty, before your engagement did it. Here is nothing but what others are bound to, as well as you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Miniſtery that are for the Presbyterian Government have already by their common neglect of the execution, made thoſe of the ſeparating way believe, that they do it in a meer carnal compliance with the unruly part of the people, that while we exaſperate them not with our Diſcipline, we might have them on our ſide. And we ſhould do nothing needleſs, that hath ſo great an appearance of evil and is ſo ſcandalous to others. It was the ſin and ruine of many of the Clergy of the laſt times, to pleaſe and comply with them that they ſhould have repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and corrected; by unfaithfulneſs in preaching, and neglect of Diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The neglect of Diſcipline hath a ſtrong tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the deluding of ſouls; by making them think they are Chriſtians that are not: while they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to live in the reputation of ſuch, and be not ſeparated from the reſt by Gods Ordinance: and it may make the ſcandalous to think their ſin a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable thing which is ſo tolerated by the Paſtors of the Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We do corrupt Chriſtianity if ſelf in the eyes
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:99578:193"/>
of the world; and do our part to make them believe, that to be a Chriſtian is but to be of ſuch an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to have that faith which <hi>James</hi> ſaith the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils had, and to be ſolifidians; and that Chriſt is no more for Holineſs, then Satan, or that the Chriſtian Religion exacteth Holineſs no more, then the falſe Religions of the world: For if the Holy and unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are all permitted to be ſherp of the ſame fold, without the uſe of Chriſts means to difference them, we do our part to defame Chriſt by it, as if he were guilty of it, and as if this were the ſtrain of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts</p>
               <p n="7">7. We do keep up ſeparation, by permitting the worſt to be uncenſured in our Churches, ſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honeſt Chriſtians think they are neceſſitated to withdraw. I muſt profeſs that I have ſpoke with ſome members of the ſeparated (or gathered) Churches, that were moderate men, and have argued with them againſt their way; and they have aſſured me, <hi>That they were of the Presbyterian judgement, or bad nothing to ſay againſt it, but they joyned themſelves with other Churches upon meer neceſſity, thinking that Diſcipline being an Ordinance of Chriſt, muſt be uſed by all that can, and therefore they durſt no longer live without it when they may have it; and they could find no Presbyterian Churches that executed Diſcipline, as they wrote for it; and they told me, that they did thus ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate only</hi> protempore, <hi>till the Presbyterians will uſe Diſcipline, and then they would willingly return to them again.</hi> I confeſs I was ſorry that ſuch perſons had any ſuch occaſion to withdraw, and the leaſt ground for ſuch a reaſon of their doings. It is not keeping them from the Sacrament that will excuſe us from
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:99578:194"/>
the further exerciſe of Diſcipline, while they are Members of our Churches.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We do too much to bring the wrath of God upon our ſelves and our Congregations, and ſo to blaſt the fruit of our labours. If the Angel of the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> was reproved for ſuffering Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers in the Church, we may be reproved on the ſame ground for ſuffering open, ſcandalous, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ones. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2 20.</p>

               <p>I know that Diſcipline is not eſſential to a Church; but what of that?

And becauſe this is the chief buſineſs of the day, I muſt take leave to inſiſt ſomewhat the longer on it. And 1. I ſhall give you ſome further Motives to perſwade you to faithfulneſs in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken work; Preſuppoſing the former general Motives, which ſhould move us to this as well as to any other part of our duty. 2. I ſhall give to the younger of my Brethren, a few words of Advice for the manner of the performance.</p>

The ſecond ſort are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the difficulty. And the third from the Neceſſity, and the many obligations that are upon us for the performance of it. And to theſe three heads I ſhall reduce them all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And for the firſt of theſe; when I look before me, and conſider what through the bleſſing of God, this work well managed is like to produce, it makes my heart to leap for joy. Truly Brethren, you have begun a moſt bleſſed work: and ſuch as your own conſciences may rejoyce in, and your Pariſhes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in, and the Nation rejoyce in, and the childe that is yet unborn; yea thouſands and millions for ought we know may have cauſe to bleſs God for,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:99578:195"/>
when we have finiſhed our courſe. And though it be our buſineſs here to humble our ſelves for the neglect of it ſo long, as we have very great cauſe to do, yet the hopes of a bleſſed ſucceſs are ſo great in me, that they are ready to turn it into a day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing I bleſs the Lord that I have lived to ſee ſuch a day as this, and to be preſent at ſo ſolemn an engagement of ſo many ſervants of Chriſt to ſuch a work. I bleſs the Lord, that hath honoured you of this County to be the beginners and awakeners of the Nation hereunto. Is it not a controverted buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where the exaſperated minds of divided men might pick quarrels with us, or malice it ſelf be able to invent a rational reproach: Nor is it a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, where envy might charge, you as innovators, or proud boaſters of any new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of your own; or ſcorn to follow in it, becauſe you have led the way. No; it is a well known duty: It is but the more diligent and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all management of the Miniſterial work, and the teaching of our Principles, and the feeding of babes with milk. You lead indeed, but not in invention of novelty, but the reſtauration of the antient Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial work, and the ſelf-denying attempt of a duty that few, or none can contradict. Unleſs men do envy you, your labours and ſufferings, or unleſs they envy the ſaving of mens ſouls, I know not what they can envy you for, in this. The age is ſo quarrel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om, that where there is any matter to faſten on, we can ſcarce explain a truth or perform a duty, but one or other, if not many, will have a ſtone to caſt at us, and will ſpeak evil of the things which they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or which their hearts and intereſts are againſt.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:99578:196"/>
But here I think we have ſilenced malice it ſelf: and I hope we may do this part of Gods work quietly, (as to them); If they cannot endure to be told what they know not, or contradicted in what they think, or diſgraced by diſcoveries of what they have ſaid amiſs, I hope they will give us leave to do that which no man can contradict, and to practice that which all are agreed in; I hope we may have their good leave, or ſilent patience at leaſt, to deny the eaſe and pleaſure of our fleſh, and to ſet our ſelves in good earneſt to help men to heaven, and to propagate the knowledge of Chriſt with our people. And I take it for a ſign of a great and neceſſary work, which hath ſuch univerſal approbation; the commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged truths and duties being, for the moſt part, of greateſt neceſſity and moment. A more noble work it is to practiſe faithfully the truths and duties that all men will confeſs, then to make new ones, or diſcover ſomewhat more then others have diſcovered. I know not why we ſhould be ambitious of finding out new waies to heaven: To make plain, and to walk in the old way, is our work, and our greateſt honour.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the work in hand is ſo pregnant of great advantages to the Church, I will come down to the particular benefits which we may hope for, that when you ſee the excellency of it, you may be the more ſet upon it, and the lother by any negligence or failing to deſtroy or fruſtrate it. For certainly he that hath the true intentions of a Miniſter, will rejoyce in the appearances of any further Hopes of the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ends, and nothing can be more welcome to him, then that which will further the very buſineſs
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:99578:196"/>
of his life; And that our preſent work is ſuch, I ſhall ſhew you more particularly.</p>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="1">I. AND firſt; It will be the moſt hopeful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the converſion of many ſouls, that we can expect. For it hath a concurrence of thoſe great things which muſt further ſuch a work.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the matter of it, it is about the moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things: the Principles or Eſſentials of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the manner of exerciſe, It will be by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conference, where we may have opportunity to ſet all home to the heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The common concord of Miniſters will do much to bow their hearts to a conſent. Were it but a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſolv ſom controverted queſtions it would not have ſo direct a tendency to converſion Were it but occaſional, we could not handſomly fall on them ſo cloſely: but when we make it the appointed buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it will be expected, and not ſo ſtrangely taken. And if moſt Miniſters had ſingly ſet upon this work, perhaps but few of the people would have ſubmitted, and then you might have loſt your chiefeſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and thoſe that had moſt needed your help, would have had leaſt of it. Whereas now we may hope that when it is a general thing, few will refuſe it; and when they ſee that other neighbours do it, they will be aſhamed to be ſo ſingular or openly ungodly as to deny.</p>
                  <p>The work of converſion conſiſteth of two parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:99578:197"/>
1. The well informing of the judgement in the neceſſary points. 2. The change of the will, by the efficacy of this truth. Now in this work; we have the moſt excellent advantage for both. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of their underſtandings, it muſt needs be an excellent help to have the ſumme of all Chriſtianity ſtill in memory. And though bare words not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, will make no change, yet when the words are plain Engliſh, he that hath the words is far liker to know the meaning and matter, then another; For what have we to make known things by, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are inviſible, but words and other ſubſervient ſigns? Thoſe therefore that will deride all Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms and Profeſſions, as unprofitable forms, may better deride themſelves for talking and uſing the form of their own words to make known their minds to others: And they may deride all Gods word on the ſame account, which is a ſtanding Form for the guiding of preachers, and teaching all others the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of eternal life. Why may not written words that are ſtill before their eyes and in their memories; inſtruct them, as well as the tranſient words of a Preacher? Theſe Forms therefore of wholſom words are ſo far from being unprofitable (as ſome phantaſtical perſons do imagine) that they are of admirable uſe to all.</p>
                  <p>And then, we ſhal have the opportunity by perſonal conference to try them how far they underſtand it, and how far not? and ſo to explain it to them as we go: and to choſe out and inſiſt on thoſe particulars which the perſons that we ſpèak to have moſt need to hear. So that theſe two conjunct: A form of words, with a plain Explication, may do more,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:99578:197"/>
then either of them could do alone.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, we have the beſt opportunity to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the ſame Truths upon their hearts; When we can ſpeak to each ones particular neceſſity, and ſay to the ſinner, Thou art the man; and plainly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his particular caſe, and ſet home the truth with familiar importunity; if any thing in the world is likely to do them good, it is this. They will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a familiar ſpeech, that hear a Sermon, as if it were non-ſence: And they have far greater help for the Application of it to themſelves. And withal you ſhall hear their Objections, and know where it is, that Satan hath moſt advantage on them, and what it is that ſtands up againſt the truth, and ſo may be able to ſhew them their errors, and confute their objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and more effectually to convince them: we can better drive them to a ſtand, and urge them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their reſolutions for the future, and to promiſe the uſe of means and reformation, then otherwiſe we could do. What need we more for this, then our experience? I ſeldom deal with men purpoſely on this great buſineſs, in private ſerious conference, but they go away with ſome ſeeming convictions, and promiſes of new obedience, if not ſome deeper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, and ſenſe of their condition. And I hope your own experiences are the ſamè.</p>
                  <p>O Brethren, what a blow may we give the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkneſs by the faithful and skilful managing of this work! If then the ſaving of <hi>ſouls,</hi> of your <hi>neighbours ſouls,</hi> of <hi>many ſouls,</hi> from everlaſting mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, be worth your labour, Up and be doing! If the increaſe of the true Church of Chriſt be deſirable, this work is Excellent, which is ſo likely to promote it.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:99578:198"/>
If you would be the Fathers of many that ſhall be new born to God, and would ſee the travail of your ſouls with comfort, and would be able to ſay at laſt, Here am I, and the children that thou haſt given me; Up then and ply this bleſſed work. If it will do you good to ſee your holy converts among the Saints in glory, and praiſing the Lamb before his Throne; if you will be glad to preſent them blameleſs and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to Chriſt; be glad then of this ſingular oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that is offered you. If you are Miniſters of Chriſt indeed, you will long for the perfecting of his body, and the gathering in of his Elect, and your hearts will be ſet upon it, and you will travail as in birth of them till Chriſt be formed in them. And then you will take ſuch opportunities as your harveſt-time, and as the un-ſhine daies in a rainy harveſt, in which it is unreaſonable &amp; unexcuſable to be idle. If you have any ſpark of Chriſtian compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in you, it wil ſure ſeem worth your utmoſt labour to ſave ſo many ſouls from death, and to recover ſo great a multitude of ſins. If you are indeed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers with Chriſt, ſet then to his work, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect not the ſouls, for whom he dyed. O remember when you are talking with the unconverted, that now there is an opportunity in your hands to ſave a ſoul, and to rejoyce the Angels of heaven, and to rejoyce Chriſt himſelf, and that your work is to caſt Satan out of a ſinner, and to increaſe the family of God. And what is your own Hope, or Joy, or Crown of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing? Is it not your ſaved people in the preſence of Chriſt Jeſus at his coming? Yea doubtleſs, they are your glory and your joy, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 19, 20.</p>

2. THE ſecond happy Benefit of our work if well managed, will be, <hi>The moſt orderly building up of thoſe that are converted, and the ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hazardeth the whole work, or at leaſt much hindereth it, when we do it not in the order that it muſt be done. How can you build if you firſt lay not a good foundation? or how can you ſet on the top-ſtone while the middle parts are neglected? <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia non facit ſaltum,</hi> any more than nature. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond order of Chriſtian Truths have ſuch depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the firſt, that they can never be well learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till the firſt are learned. This makes ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded novices, that are puſt up with the vain conceits of knowledge while they are groſly ignorant, and itch to be preaching before they well know what it is to be Chriſtians; becauſe they took not the work before them, but learnt ſome leſſer matters which they heard moſt talk of, before they learnt the vital Principles. And this makes many labour ſo much in vain, and are ſtill learning, but never come to the knowledge of the Truth, becauſe they would learn to read before they learn to ſpell, or to know their letters; And this makes ſo many fall away, and ſhaken with every wind of temptation, becauſe they were not well ſettled in the fundamentals. It is theſe Fundamentals that muſt lead men to further truths: It is theſe they muſt bottom and build all upon. It is theſe that they muſt live upon, and that muſt actuate all their graces, and animate all their duties; It is
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:99578:199"/>
theſe that muſt fortifie them againſt particular tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations; and he that knows theſe well, doth know ſo much as will make him happy; and he that knows not theſe, knows nothing; and he that knows theſe beſt, is the beſt and moſt underſtanding Chriſtian. The moſt godly people therefore in your Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will find it worth their labour to learn the very words of a Catechiſm. And if you would ſafely edifie them and firmly ſtabliſh them, be diligent in this work.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="3">3. A Third Benefit that may be expected by the well-managing of this work, is this, <hi>It will make our publike preaching to be better underſtood and regarded.</hi> When you have acquainted them with the Principles, they will the better underſtand all that you ſay. They will perceive what you drive at, when they are once acquainted with the main. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth their minds, and openeth you a way to their hearts: when without this you may loſe the moſt of your labour: and the more pains you take, in accurate preparations, the leſs good you do. As you would not therefore loſe your publike labour, ſee that you be faithful in this private work.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:99578:199"/>
4. AND this is not a contemptible Benefit, that by this courſe <hi>you will come to be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with your people,</hi> when you have had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of familiar conference. And the want of this with us, that have very numerous Pariſhes, is a great impediment to the ſucceſs of our labours. By di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and unacquaintedneſs, ſlanderers and deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have opportunity to poſſeſs them with falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of you, which prejudice their minds againſt your doctrine: and by this diſtance and ſtrangeneſs abundance of miſtakes between Miniſters and people are fomented. Beſides that, familiarity it ſelf doth tend to beget thoſe affections, which may open their ears to further teaching. And when we are familiar with them, they will be more encouraged to open their doubts and ſeek reſolution, and deal freely with us. But when a miniſter knoweth not his people, or is as ſtrange to them as if he did not know them, it muſt be a great hindrance to his doing them any good.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="5">5. BEſides, by the means of theſe private Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>we ſhall come to be the better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with each perſons ſpiritual ſtate, and ſo the better know how to watch over them,</hi> and carry our ſelves towards them ever after. We may know the better how to preach to them when we know their temper, and their chief objections, and ſo what they have
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:99578:200"/>
moſt need to hear. We ſhall the better know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be jealous of them with a pious jealouſie, and what temptations to help them moſt againſt. We ſhal the better know how to lament for them and to rejoyce with them, and to pray for them to God. For as he that will pray rightly for himſelf, will know his own ſores and wants, and the diſeaſes of his own heart; ſo he that will pray rightly for others, ſhould know theirs as far as he may, and as is meet. If a man have the charge but of ſheep or cattle, he cannot ſo well diſcharge his truſt if he know them not, and their ſtate and qualities. So is it with the Maſter that will well teach his Schollars, and Parents that will rightly educate their children: And ſo with us.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="6">6. AND then this tryal of, and acquaintance with our peoples ſtate, will better <hi>ſatisfie us in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</hi> We may the better underſtand how far they are fit or unfit. Though this give them not the ſtate or relation of a Member of that Church whereof we are Over-ſeers; yet becauſe the Members of the Church Univerſal, though they are of no particular Church, may in ſome caſes have a right to the Ordinances of Chriſt in thoſe particular Churches where they come, and in ſome caſes they have no right, we may by this means be the better informed how to deal with them, though they be no members of that particular Church. And whereas many will queſtion a Miniſter that exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth his people in order to the Lords Supper, by
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:99578:200"/>
what authority he doth it, the ſame work will be done this way, in a courſe beyond exception. Though I doubt not but a Miniſter may require his Flock to come to him at any convenient ſeaſon, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their faith and proficiency, and to receive inſtruction, and therefore he may do it in preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Sacrament; yet becauſe Miniſters have laid the ſtreſs of that examination upon the meer neceſſity of fitneſs for that Ordinance, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their common duty to ſee the ſtate and proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of each member of their Flock at all fit ſeaſons, and upon the peoples duty to ſubmit to the guidance and inſtruction of the Paſtors at all times, they have therefore occaſioned people ignorantly to quarrel againſt their examinations, and call for the proof. Whereas it is an eaſie thing to prove that any Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in Chriſts School is bound at any time to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to his Teachers, and to obey them in all lawful things in order to their own edification and ſalvation; though it may be more difficult to prove a neceſſity that a Miniſter muſt ſo examine them in order to the Lords Supper, any more then in order to a day of Thankſgiving or a Lords day, or the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing of their children.</p>
                  <p>Now by this courſe, we ſhall diſcern their fitneſs in an unqueſtionable way.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:99578:201"/>
7. ANother Benefit will be this, <hi>We ſhall by this means be the better enabled to help our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt their particular temptations, and we ſhall much better prevent their entertainment of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular errors or hereſies;</hi> or their falling into Schiſm to the hazard of themſelves and the Church. For men will freelyer open their thoughts and ſcruples to us, and if they are infected already or inclined to any errour or ſchiſm, they will be ready to diſcover it, and ſo may receive ſatisfaction before they are paſt cure. And familiarity with their Teachers, will the more encourage them to open their doubts to them at any other time. The common cauſe of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples infections and hereſies is the familiarity of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers with them, and the ſtrangeneſs of their own Paſtors. When they hear us only in publike, and hear Seducers frequently in private unſaying all that we ſay, and we never know it, or help them againſt it, this fettleth them in hereſies before we are aware of it. Alas our people are moſt of them ſo weak, that whoever hath 1. Moſt intereſt in their eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections: and 2. Moſt opportunity in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate frequent conferences to inſtill his opinions into them, of that mans religion will they ordinarily be. It is pity then that we ſhould let deceivers take ſuch opportunities to undo them, and we ſhould not be as induſtrious, and uſe our advantages to their good. We have much advantage againſt Seducers in many reſpects, if our negligence and their diligence did not fruſtrate them.</p>

8. ANother, and one of the greateſt Benefits of our work will be this, <hi>It will better inform men of the true nature of the Miniſterial office, or awaken them to better conſideration of it, then is now uſual.</hi> It is now too common for men to think that the work of the Miniſtery is nothing but to preach well, and to Baptize and adminiſter the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and viſit the ſick: and by this means the people will ſubmit to no more, and too many Miniſters are negligently or wilfully ſuch ſtrangers to their own calling, that they will do no more. It hath oft grieved my heart to obſerve ſome eminent able Preachers, how little they do for the ſaving of ſouls, ſave only in the Pulpit; and to how little purpoſe much of their labour is, by this neglect. They have hundreds of people that they never ſpoke a word to perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their ſalvation, and if we may judge by their practice, they take it not for their duty: and the principal thing that hardeneth men in this overſight, is the common neglect of the private part of the work by others. There are ſo few that do much in it; and the omiſſion is grown ſo common among pious able men, that they have abated the diſgrace of it by their parts, and a man may now be guilty of it, without any common obſervance or diſhonour. Never doth ſin ſo reign in a Church or State, as when it hath gained reputation, or at leaſt is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the ſinner, nor a matter of any offence to beholders. But I make no doubt through the mercy of God, but the reſtored practice of perſonal over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:99578:202"/>
will convince many Miniſters, that this is as truly their work as that which they now do: and may awaken them to ſee that the Miniſtery is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of buſineſs, then too many excellent Preachers do take it to be. Brethren, do but ſet your ſelves cloſely to this work, and follow on diligently, and though you do it ſilently, without any words to them that are negligent, <hi>I am in hope that moſt of you here may live to ſee the day, that the neglect of private perſonal Overſight of all the Flock ſhall be taken for a ſcandalous and adious omiſſion, and ſhall be as diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them that are guilty of it, as preaching but once a day was heretofore.</hi> A School maſter muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read a common Lecture, but take a perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Scholars, or elſe he is like to do little good. If Phyſicians ſhould only read a publike Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Phyſick, their patients would not be much the better for them: Nor would a Lawyer ſecure your eſtate by reading a Lecture of Law. The charge of a Paſtor requireth perſonal dealing as well as any of theſe. Let us ſhew the world this by our practiſe; for moſt men are grown regardleſs of bare words.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, we have been occaſioned exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to wrong the Church in this, by the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream of the Papiſts, who bring all their people to Auricular confeſſion: For in the overthrowing of this error of theirs, we have run into the contrary extream, and led our people much further into it then we are gone our ſelves. It troubled me to read in an Orthodox Hiſtorian, that licentiouſneſs, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be from under the ſtrict enquiries of the Prieſts in Confeſſion, did much further the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of the Reformed Religion in <hi>Germany.</hi> And yet its like enough to be true, that they that were againſt Reformation in other reſpects, yet partly for the change, and partly on that licentious account, might joyn with better men in crying down the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Clergy. But by this means, leſt we ſhould ſeem to favour the ſaid Auricular Confeſsion, we have too commonly neglected all perſonal inſtruction; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when we occaſionally fall into mens company, few make it a ſtated part of their work: I am paſt doubt that the Popiſh Auricular Confeſſion, is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful novelty, which the antient Church was unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with. But perhaps ſome will think ſtrange that I ſhould ſay, that our common neglect of perſonal Inſtruction is much worſe, if we conſider their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions in themſelves, and not as they reſpect their connexed Doctrines of ſatisfaction and purgatory. Many of the Southern and Eaſtern Churches do uſe a Confeſsion of ſin to the Prieſt. And how far Mr. <hi>Tho. Hocker</hi> in his Souls Preparat and other Divines do ordinarily require it, as neceſſary or uſeful, is well known. If any among us ſhould be guilty of this groſs miſtake as to think when he hath preached, he hath done all his work, let us ſhew him to his face by our practice of the reſt, that there is much more to be done, and that taking heed to all the Flock is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buſineſs then careleſs lazy Miniſters do conſider of. If a man have the leaſt apprehenſion that duty, and the chiefeſt duty, is no duty; he is like to neglect it, and be impenitent in the neglect.</p>

9. ANother ſingular Benefit which we may hope for from the faithful performance of this work, is, that <hi>It will help our people better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the nature of their duty towards their Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, and conſequently to diſcharge it better.</hi> Which were no matter if it were only for our ſakes; but their own ſalvation is very much concerned in it. I am confident by ſad experience, that it is none of the leaſt impediments to their happineſs, and to a true Reformation of the Church: that the people underſtand not what the work and power of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is, and what their own duty towards them is. They commonly think that a Miniſter hath no more to do with them but to preach to them, and viſit them in ſickneſs, and adminiſter Sacraments, and that if they hear him, and receive the Sacrament from him, they owe no further obedience, nor can he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any more at their hands. Little do they know that the Miniſter is in the Church as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter in his School, to teach and take an account of every one in particular, and that all Chriſtians ordinarily muſt be Diſciples or Scholars in ſome ſuch School They think not that a Miniſter is in the Church as a Phyſician in a Town, for all people to reſort to, for perſonal advice for the curing of all thoſe diſeaſes that are fit to be brought to a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian: and that the Prieſts lips muſt preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the people muſt ask the Law at their mouths, becauſe he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts. And that every ſoul in the Congregation is
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:99578:203"/>
bound for their own ſafety, to have perſonal recourſe to him, for the reſolving of their doubts, and for help againſt their ſins, and for direction in duty, and for increaſe of knowledge and all ſaving grace! and that Miniſters are purpoſely ſettled in Congregations to this end, to be ſtill ready to adviſe and help the Flock. If our people did but know their duty, they would readily come to us when they are deſired to be inſtructed, and to give an account of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith and lives; and they would come them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without ſending for, and knock oftner at our doors, and call for advice and help for their ſouls; and ask, What ſhall we do to be ſaved? Whereas now the matter is come to that ſad paſs, that they think a Miniſter hath nothing to do with them, and if he admoniſh them, they will bid him look to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſhall not anſwer for them: and if he call them to be Catechized or inſtructed, or to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Lords Supper, or other holy Ordinance, or would take an account of their faith and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they will ask him, By what authority he doth theſe things? and think that he is a buſie pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fellow, that loves to be medling where he hath nothing to do; or a proud fellow that would bear rule over their conſciences. When they may as well ask him, By what authority he preacheth, or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for them, or giveth them the Sacrament; or they may as well ask a School-maſter, By what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he cals his Scholars to learn or ſay their leſſon? Or a Phyſitian, By what authority he enjoyment them to take his Medicine? people conſider not, that all our authority is but for our work: even a Power to do our duty and our work is for them;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:99578:204"/>
ſo that it is but an authority to do them good: And the ſilly wretches do talk no wiſelyer, then if they ſhould thus quarrel with a man that would held to quench the fire in their thatch, and ask him, By what authority he doth it? Or that would give his money to relieve the poor, and they ſhould ask him, <hi>By what authority do you require us to take this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?</hi> Or as if I offered my hand to one that is fallen, to help him up, or to one that is in the water, to ſave him from drowning, and he ſhould ask me, <hi>By what authority I do it?</hi> Truly we have no wiſer nor thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller dealing from theſe men: Nay, it is worſe, in that we are doubly obliged, both by Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Miniſterial office to do them good. I know not of any Simile that doth more aptly expreſs the Miniſterial power and duty, and the peoples du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then theſe two conjunct; <hi>viz.</hi> even ſuch as a Phyſician is in an Hoſpital, that hath taken the charge of it, and ſuch as a School-maſter is in his School, eſpecially ſuch as the Philoſophers, or teachers of any ſcience or art, whoſe Schools have the aged and voluntary members, as well as children (Chriſts hath all ages) even ſuch is a Miniſter in the Church, and ſuch is their work and their authority to do it, and the duty of the people to ſubmit thereto, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch differences as the ſubject requireth.</p>
                  <p>And what is it that hath brought people to this ignorance of their duty, but cuſtom? Its long of us, Brethren to ſpeak truly and plainly, its long of us; that have not uſed them nor our ſelves to any more then the common publike work. We ſee how much cuſtom doth with the people. Where it is the cuſtom, they ſtick not among the Papiſts at the confeſſing
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:99578:204"/>
of all their ſins to the Prieſt: And becauſe it is not the cuſtom among us, they diſdain to be queſtioned, catechized or inſtructed. They wonder at it as a ſtrange thing, and ſay, ſuch things were never done before. And if we can but prevail to make this duty become as uſual as other duties, they will much more eaſily ſubmit to it then now. What a happy thing would it be, if you might live to ſee the day, that it ſhould be as ordinary for people of all ages to come in courſe to their Teachers for perſonal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and help for their ſalvation, as it is now uſual for them to come to Church, or as it is for them to ſend their children thither to be Catechized.

I have often ſaid it, and ſtill muſt ſay it, that this is a great part of <hi>Englands</hi> miſery, and a great degree of ſpiritual famine which reigns in moſt Cities and great
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:99578:205"/>
Towns through the Land, even where they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of it, and think themſelves well provided; Alas we ſee multitudes of carnal, ignorant, ſenſual ſinners round about us, <hi>here</hi> is a family, and <hi>there</hi> a family, and there almoſt a whole ſtreet or village of them; and our hearts pity them, and we ſee that their neceſsities cry loud for our ſpeedy and diligent relief, ſo that he that hath ears to hear muſt needs hear it. And if we would never ſo fain, we cannot help them: Not only through their obſtinacy, but alſo through our want of opportunity. We have experience, that if we could but have leiſure to ſpeak to them, and to open plainly to them their ſin and danger, there were great hopes of doing good to many of them, that receive little by our publike teaching. But we cannot come at them: more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary work prohibits us: we cannot do both at once: and the publike muſt be preferred, becauſe there we deal with many at once. And it is as much as we are able to do, to perform the publike work, or ſome little more; And if we do take the time when we ſhould eat or ſleep, (beſides the ruining of weakened bodies by it) we ſhall not be able af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, to ſpeak to one of very many of them. So that we muſt ſtand by and ſee poor people periſh, and can but be ſorry for them, and cannot ſo much as ſpeak to them to endeavour their recovery. Is not this a ſad caſe in a Nation that glorieth of the fulneſs of the Goſpel? An Infidel will ſay, No: but me thinks no man that believes an everlaſting Joy or Torment ſhould ſay ſo. I will give you the inſtance of my own caſe. We are together two Miniſters, and a third at a Chappel, willing to beſtow every
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:99578:205"/>
hour of our time in Chriſts work. Before we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this work that we are now upon, our hands were full, and now we are engaged to ſet apart two daies every week from morning to night for private cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing and inſtruction; ſo that any man may ſee that we muſt leave undone all that other work that we were wont to do at that time: and we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitated to run upon the publike work of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſmall preparation, and ſo muſt deliver the Meſſage of God, ſo rawly and confuſedly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably to its dignity, and the needs of mens ſouls that it is a great trouble to our minds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, and a greater trouble to us when we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. And yet <hi>it muſt</hi> be ſo: there is no remedy, unleſs we will omit this perſonal inſtruction, we muſt needs run thus unpreparedly into the Pulpit! And to omit this we dare not, it is ſo great and neceſſary a work. And when we have incurred all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned inconveniences, and have ſet two whole daies a week apart for the work that we have now undertaken, it wil be as much as we ſhal be able to do, to go over the Pariſh but once in a year (being about 800. families) And which is worſe then that, we ſhall be forc't to cut it ſhort, and do it leſs effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe that we do it, having above 15. Families a week to deal with. And alas, how ſmall a matter is it to ſpeak to a man once only in a year, and that ſo curſorily as we muſt be forced to do, in compariſon of what their neceſsities do require? yet are we in hope of ſome fruit of this much, but how much more might it be, if we could but ſpeak to them once a quarter, and do the vvork more fully and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as you that are in ſmaller Pariſhes may do.)
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:99578:206"/>
And many Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> have ten times, (if not more) the number of Pariſhoners as I have: ſo that if they ſhould undertake the work that we have done, they can go over the Pariſh but once in ten years. So that while we are hoping for opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to ſpeak to them, we hear of one dying after another, and to the grief of our ſouls are forced to go with them to their graves before we could ever ſpeak a word to them perſonally to prepare them for their change. And what is the cauſe of all this miſery? Why our Rulers have not ſeen a neceſſity of any more Miniſters then one or two in ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes; and ſo they have not allowed any mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to that end: Some have alienated much from the Church (the Lord humble all them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it effectually, leſt it prove the conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Nation at laſt) while they have left this famine in the chief parts of the Land. Its eaſie to ſeparate from the multitude, and gather diſtinct Churches, and let the reſt ſink or ſwim, and if they will not be ſaved by publike preaching, let them be damned: but whether this be the moſt charitable and Chriſtian courſe, one would think ſhould be no hard queſtion. But whats the matter that wiſe and godly Rulers ſhould be thus guilty of our miſery, and that none of our cries will awake them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion? What, are they ſo ignorant as not to know theſe things? Or are they grown cruel to the ſouls of men? Or are they falſe-hearted to the intereſt of Chriſt, and have a deſign to undermine his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? No, I hope it is none of theſe; but for ought I can find, it is even long of us, even of us the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, whom they ſhould thus main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:99578:206"/>
For thoſe Miniſters that have ſmall Pariſhes, and might do all this private part of the work, yet do it not (but very few of them) nor will not do it. And thoſe in great Towns and Cities, that might do ſomewhat, though they cannot do all, will do juſt nothing, but what accidentially fals in their way, or next to nothing; ſo that the Magiſtrate is not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to an obſervance or conſideration of the weight of our work: If it be not in their eyes, as well as in their ears, they will not regard it. Or if they do apprehend the uſefulneſs of it, yet if they ſee that Miniſters are ſo careleſs and lazy that they will not do it, they think it in vain to provide them a maintenance for it: it would be but to cheriſh idle droans: and ſo they think, that if they maintain Miniſters enough to preach in the Pulpit, they have done their parts. And thus are they involved in hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſin, and we are the occaſions of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if we do but heartily all ſet our ſelves to this work, and ſhew the Magiſtrate to his face, that it is a moſt weighty and neceſſary part of our buſineſs, and that we would do it throughly if we could, and that if there were hands enough at it, the work might go on, and withal when he ſhall ſee the happy ſucceſs of our labours, then no doubt, if the fear of God be in them, and they have any love to his truth and mens ſouls, they will ſet to their helping hand, and not let men periſh, becauſe there is no man to ſpeak to them to prevent it. They will one way or other raiſe maintenance in ſuch populous places for labourers proportioned to the number of ſouls, and greatneſs of the work. Let them but ſee us fall to the work, and ſee it proſper in our hands; (as if it be well managed
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:99578:207"/>
through Gods bleſſing, there is no doubt but it will do) and then it will draw out their hearts to the promoting of it: and inſtead of <hi>laying Pariſhes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to diminiſh the number of teachers,</hi> they will either divide them, or allow more teachers to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. But when they ſee that many carnal Miniſters do make a greater ſtir to have more maintenance to themſelves, then to have more help in the work of God, they are tempted by ſuch worldlings to wrong the Church, that particular Miniſters may have eaſe and fulneſs.</p>

Would they not have ſaid, <hi>If I muſt be a Biſhop, let me be a Parochial Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or have no more to overſee then I am capable of overſeeing, and let me be ſuch as the Primitive Biſhops were, that had but one Church, and not hundreds to take care of; and let me not be engaged to natural impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and that on pain of damnation, and to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain deſtruction of the buſineſs that I undertake;</hi> ſure theſe would rather have been their ſtrivings. I ſpeak not this againſt any Biſhops that acknowledge the Presbyters to be true Paſtors to rule and teach the Flock, and take themſelves only to be the chief or Preſidents among the Presbyters, yea or the Rulers of Presbyters, that are the Rulers of the Flock; but of them that null the Presbyters office, and the Churches Government and Diſcipline, by undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it alone as their ſole prerogative.</p>

AND then for the extent of the foreſaid Benefits, (which in the two next places ſhall now be conſidered) The deſign of this work is, the <hi>Reforming and ſaving of all the people in our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pariſhes;</hi> For we ſhall not leave out any man that will ſubmit to be inſtructed. And though we can ſcarce hope that every particular perſon will be reformed and ſaved by it, yet have we reaſon to hope, that as the attempt is univerſal, ſo the ſucceſs will be more general or extenſive then hitherto we have ſeen of our other labours. Sure I am it is moſt like to the ſpirit, and precept and offers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which requireth us to preach the Goſpel to every creature, and promiſeth life to every man if he will accept it by believing! If God would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth (that is, as Rector and Benefactor) of the world, he hath manifeſted himſelf willing to ſave All men if they will themſelves, though his Elect he will alſo make willing) then ſure it beſeems us to offer ſalvation unto all men, and to endeavour to bring them to the knowledge of the truth. And if Chriſt taſted death for every man, its meet we ſhould preach his death for every man. This work hath a more excellent deſign, then our accidental conferences with now and then a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And I obſerve that in ſuch occaſional diſcourſes men ſatisfie themſelves to have ſpoken ſome good words, but ſeldom ſet plainly and cloſely to the matter, to convince men of ſin, and miſery, and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:99578:211"/>

For though it be at the preſent neglected, I ſuppoſe the cauſe is the ſame with our Brethren as it hath all this while been with us; who by vain expectations of the Magiſtrates interpoſition, or by that inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs, and lazyneſs which we are bewailing here this day, have ſo much omitted it till now as we have done; but ſpecially a deſpair of a common ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the people hath been the hindrance. But when they ſhall be remembered of ſo clear and great a duty, and excited to the conſideration of it, and ſee with us the feiſableneſs of it, in a good meaſure, when it is done by common conſent, no doubt they will univerſally take it up, and gladly concurr with us in ſo bleſſed a work. For they are the ſervants of the ſame God, as regardful of their Flocks, and as conſciencious as we, and as ſenſible of the Intereſt of Chriſt, and as compaſsionate to mens ſouls, and as ſelf-denying, and ready to do or ſuffer for ſuch excellent ends: ſeeing therefore they have the ſame Spirit, Rule and Lord, I will not be ſo unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as to doubt, whether all that are godly, (or the generality of them) will gladly joyn with us through all the Land And O what a happy thing it will be to ſee ſuch a general combination for Chriſt? and to ſee all <hi>England</hi> ſo ſeriouſly called upon, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:99578:211"/>
for Chriſt, and ſet in ſo fair a way to heaven! Me thinks, the conſideration of it ſhould make our hearts rejoyce within us, to ſee ſo many faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt all over the Land, to fall in with every particular ſinner with ſuch induſtrious ſollicitations for the ſaving of their ſouls, as men that will hardly take a denyal. Me thinks, I even ſee all the godly Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> even ſetting upon the work al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and reſolving to take the opportunity, the unanimity may facilitate it. Which if they do, no doubt but God will ſucceed them. Is it not then a moſt happy undertaking that you are all ſetting your hands to, and deſiring the aſſiſtance of Chriſt in, this day?</p>

                  <p>How long have we talkt of Reformation, how much have we ſaid and done for it in general, and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:99578:212"/>
how deeply and devoutly have we vowed it for our own parts (of which more anon.) And after all this, how ſhamefully have we neglected it, and neglect it to this day! We carry our ſelves as if we had not known or conſidered what that Reformation was that we vowed. As carnal men will take on them to be Chriſtians, and profeſs with confidence that they believe in Chriſt, and accept of his ſalvation and may contend for Chriſt, and fight for him, and vet for all this, would have none of him, but periſh for refuſing him, who little dreamt that ever they had been refuſers of him; and all becauſe they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not what his ſalva ion is, and how it is carried on, but dream of a ſalvation without fleſh-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, and without ſelf-denying, and renouncing the world, and parting with their ſins, and without any holineſs or any great pains and labour of their own in ſubſerviency to Chriſt and the ſpirit: Even ſo did too many Miniſters and private men talk and write, and pray, and fight, and long for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and would little have believed that man, that ſhould have preſumed to tell them, that for all this, their very hearts were againſt Reformation, and that they that were praying for it and faſting for it, and wading through blood for it, would never accept it, but would themſelves be the rejecters and deſtroyers of it? And yet ſo it is, and ſo it hath too plainly proved: and whence is all this ſtrange deceit of heart? That good men ſhould no better know themſelves? Why, the caſe is plain: They thought of a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to be given by God, but not of a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be wrought on and by themſelves. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the bleſsing, but never thought of the means
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:99578:212"/>
of accompliſhing it. But as if they had expected that all things beſides themſelves ſhould be mended without them; or that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould again deſcend miraculouſly, or every Sermon ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert its thouſands, or that ſome Angel from heaven, or ſome <hi>Eliis</hi> ſhould be ſent to reſtore all things; or that the Law of a Parliament, and the ſword of a Magiſtrate would have converted or conſtrained all, and have done the deed; and little did they think of a Reformation that muſt be wrought by their own diligence and unwearied labours, by earneſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and catechizing, and perſonal inſtructions, and taking heed to all the Flock, whatever pains or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches it ſhould coſt them They thought not that a through Reformation muſt multiply their own work, but we had all of us too carnal thouhgts, that when we had ungodly men at our mercy all would be done, and conquering them was converting them, or ſuch a means as would have frightned them to, heaven. But the buſineſs is far otherwiſe, and had we then known how a Reformation muſt be atrained, perhaps ſome would have been colder in the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it. And yet I know that even foreſeen la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſeem ſmall matters at a diſtance, while we do, but hear and talk of them: but when we come nearer them, and muſt lay our hands to the work and put on our armour, and charge through the thickeſt of oppoſing difficulties then is the ſincerity and the ſtrength of mens hearts brought to tryal, and it will appear how they purpoſed and promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

They thought of having the oppoſers of godlineſs under their feet; but now they ſee they muſt go to them with humble intreaties and put their hands under their feet, if it would do them good, and meekly beſeech even thoſe that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſought their lives, and make it now their daily buſineſs to overcome them by kindneſs, and win them with love. O how many carnal expectations are here croſt.</p>

                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:99578:214"/>
Hence alſo it is, that moſt men do lay ſo great a part of Reformation in their private opinions, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular waies. The Prelatical party think that the true Reformation is to reſtore them to power. The Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians have thought that if Prelacy and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy were well down, and Claſſes up, the work were much done: And the Independents have thought that if they had gathered a ſeparated body of godly people under Covenant, much of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation were wrought: And the Anabaptiſts have thought, that if they could but get people to be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized again, they had done a great matter for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. I am not now reproving any of theſe in the matter, (though the laſt eſpecially well deſerve it) but that they lay ſo much upon their ſeveral or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and formalities as many of them do: When in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if we had our will in all ſuch matters of order, and had the righteſt form of Government in the world, it is the painful execution, and the diligent and prudent uſe of means for mens converſion and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by able faithful men, that muſt accompliſh the Reformation. Brethren, I dare confidently tell you, that if you will but faithfully perform what you have Agreed upon both in this buſineſs of Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and perſonal inſtruction, and in the matter of Diſcipline formerly (where we have well waved all the controverted part, which hath ſo much aſcribed to it) you will do more for the true Reformation, that is ſo deſirable, and hath been ſo long prayed and hoped for, then all the changes of forms and orders ſo eagerly contended for, are ever like to effect. If Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops would do this work, I would take them for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers: And if Presbyters will do it, I will take
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:99578:215"/>
them for Reformers: and it was thoſe that neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hindred it, that I ever took for Deformers. Let us ſee the work well done, that God hath made ſo neceſſary for mens converſion, preſervation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration and ſalvation, and the doers of it, whether Prelates or Presbyters, ſhall never have any fierce op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of mine. But it is not bare Canons and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Names and Shews, that any wiſe man will take for the ſubſtance of Reformation! It is not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion or uncircumciſion, to be a Jew or a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, bond or free, that availeth any thing, but a new creature, and faith that worketh by love. That is the Reformation which beſt healeth the Ignorance, and Infidelity, and Pride, and Hypocriſie, and Worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and other killing ſins of the Land, and that moſt effectually bringeth men to faith and holineſs. Not that I would have the leaſt truth or duty undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or any part of Gods will to be rejected: But the Kingdom of God conſiſteth not in every truth or duty; not in ceremonies, or circumſtances, not in meats or drinks; but in Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Dear Brethren, it is you and ſuch as you, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt muſt yet give this Nation the fruit of all their prayers and pains, their coſt and blood, and heavy ſufferings. All that they have been doing, for the good of the Church, and for true Reformation for ſo may years, was but to prepare the way for you, to come in and do the work which they deſired. Alas what would they do by fire and ſword, by drums and trumpets, for the converting of ſouls! The actions of Armies and famous Commanders, which ſeem ſo glorious, and make ſo great a noiſe that the world
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:99578:215"/>
rings of them, what have they done, or what can they do that is worth the talking on without you? In themſelves conſidered, all their victories and great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, are ſo far from being truly glorious, that they are very lamentable: and a Butcher may as well glory that he hath killed ſo many beaſts, or a hangman that he hath executed ſo many men, as they can glory in the thing conſidered in it ſelf. For war is the moſt heavy temporal judgement. And far leſs cauſe would they have to glory, if their cauſe and ends were wrong. And if their hearts, and ends, and cauſe be right, and they mean as honeſtly as any men in the world, yet are theſe great Commanders but your pioneers, to cut up the thorns that ſtand in your way, and to caſt out the rubbiſh, and prepare you the way to build the houſe. Alas they cannot with all their victories, exalt the Lord Jeſus in the ſoul of any ſinner; and therefore they cannot ſet up his ſpiritual Kingdom; for the hearts of men are his houſe and throne: If the work ſhould ſtop with the end of theirs, and go no further then they can carry it, we ſhould be in the end but where we were in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and one generation of Chriſts enemies would ſucceed another, and they that take down the wicked, would inherit their vices, as they poſſeſs their rooms, and the laſt would be far the worſt, as being deeper in the guilt, and more engaged in evil-doing. All this trouble then, and ſtir of the Nation, hath been to bring the work to your hands: and ſhall it dye there? God forbid! They have opened you the door, and at exceeding coſt and ſufferings have removed many of your impediments, and put the building inſtruments into your hands: and will you now ſtand ſtill, or
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:99578:216"/>
loyter? God forbid! up then Brethren, and give the Nation the fruit of their coſt and pains; fruſtrate not all the preparers work: fail not the long expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſo many thouſands, that have prayed in hope of a true Reformation, and paid in hope, and ventured in hope, and ſuffered in hope, and waited till now in hope. In the name of God take heed that now you fail not all theſe Hopes. Have they ſpent ſo long time in fencing the Vineyard, and weeding and pruning it, and making it ready for your hands: and will you now fail them that are ſent to gather in the vintage, and loſe all their labours? When they have plowed the field, will you ſow it by the halves? If they had known beforehand that Miniſters would have proved idle and unfaithful, how many hundreds would have ſpared their blood, and how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands would have ſate ſtill, and have let the old Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and formaliſts alone, and have ſaid, If we muſt have dullards and unprofitable men, it is as good have one as another: It is not worth ſo much coſt and pains to change one careleſs Miniſter for another.] The end is the mover and life of the agent in all the means. How many thouſands have prayed, and paid, and ſuffered, and more, upon the expectations of a great advantage to the Church, and more common il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination and reformation of the Nation, by your means. And will you now deceive them all! Again I ſay, God forbid. Now it is at your hands that they are expecting the happy iſſue of all. The eyes of the Nation are or ſhould be, all (under God) upon you, for the bringing in the harveſt of their coſt and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. I profeſs, it maketh me admire at the fearful deceitfulneſs of the heart of man, to ſee how every
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:99578:216"/>
man can call on others for duty, or cenſure them for the omitting it, and what excellent Judges we are in other mens caſes, and how partial in our own? The very judicious Teachers of the Nation can cry out (and too juſtly) againſt one ſect and another ſect, and againſt unfaithful underminers of thoſe that they thought would have done the work, and againſt the diſturbers of the Reformation that was going on, and ſay, [Theſe have betrayed the Church, and fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Nations coſt and hopes, and undone all that hath been ſo long a doing.] And yet they ſee not, or ſeem not to ſee, that it is we that are guilty of this, as much as they. It was not the Magiſtrates driving, but the Miniſters drawing, that was the principal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving means that we have waited for. Brethren, it were a ſtrange miſtake ſure, if any of us ſhould think, that the price of the Nations wealth and blood was purpoſed to ſettle us in good Benefices, and to pull down the Biſhops, and give us the quiet poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our livings which they would have deprived us of. Was this the Reformation, that we might live in greater eaſe and fulneſs, and ſucceed the ejected Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in their leſs diſgraced ſins! Why ſirs? what are we more then other men, that the people ſhould do all this for us? that they ſhould impoveriſh the whole Nation almoſt to provide us a livelyhood! What can they ſee in our Perſons or Countenances for which they ſhould ſo doate upon us? Are we not men, frail and corruptible fleſh, unworthy ſinners like themſelves? Surely it was for our work, and the ends of our work, and not for our Perſons (but in order to our work) that they have done all this- What
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:99578:217"/>
ſay you now Brethren? Will you deal faithfully with your Creditors, and pay the Nation the debt which you owe them? Shall all the blood and coſt of this People be fruſtrated, or not? You are now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon to give your anſwer, and it is you that muſt give it. The work is now before you: And in theſe perſonal Inſtructions of all the Flock, as well as in publike preaching doth it conſiſt. Others have done their part, and born their burden, and now comes in yours. You may eaſily ſee how great a matter lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hands, and how many will be wronged by your failings, and how much by the ſparing of your labour will be loſt. If your labour be more worth then all our treaſures, hazards and lives, and then the ſouls of men, and the blood of Chriſt, then ſit ſtill, and look not after the ignorant or the ungodly; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your pleaſure or worldly buſineſs, or take your eaſe, diſpleaſe not ſinners, nor your own fleſh, but let your neighbours ſink or ſwim; and if publike preaching will not ſave them, let them periſh. But if the caſe be far otherwiſe, you were beſt look about you. (But I ſhall ſay more of this anon.)</p>

For diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties muſt excite to greater diligence in a neceſſary work.</p>
               <p>And difficulties we ſhall find many, both in our ſelves and in our people; which becauſe they are things ſo obvious that your experience will leave no room for doubting, I ſhall take leave to paſs them over in a few words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In ourſelves there is much dulneſs and lazineſs, ſo that there will be much ado to get us to be faithful in ſo hard a work. Like a ſluggard in bed, that knows he ſhould riſe, and yet delayeth and would ſtay as long as he can; ſo do we by duties that our corrupt natures are againſt, and put us to the uſe of all our powers. More ſloath will tye the hands of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have alſo a baſe man-pleaſing diſpoſition, which will make us let men periſh leſt we loſe their love, and let them go quietly to hell, leaſt we ſhould make them angry with us for ſeeking their ſalvation: and we are ready to venture on the diſpleaſure of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:99578:218"/>
God, and venture our people into everlaſting miſery, rather then get ill-will to ourſelves. This diſtemper muſt be diligently reſiſted,</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have ſome of us alſo a fooliſh baſhfulneſs, which makes us very backward to begin with them, and to ſpeak plainly to them: we are ſo modeſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, that we bluſh to ſpeak for Chriſt, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Devil, or to ſave a ſoul: when ſhameful works we are leſs aſhamed of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are ſo carnal, that we are prone by our fleſhly intereſts, to be drawn to unfaithfulneſs in the work of Chriſt. Leſt we loſe our Tythes, or bring trouble upon ourſelves, or ſet people againſt us, and many ſuch like. All theſe require diligence for their reſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The greateſt impediment of all is, that we are too weak in the faith: So that when we ſhould ſet upon a man for his converſion with all our might, if there be not the ſtirrings of unbelief within us, to raiſe up actual queſtionings of Heaven and Hell, whether the things that we ſhould earneſtly preſs be true, yet at leaſt the belief of them is ſo weak, that it will hardly excite in us ſo kindly, reſolute, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant zeal: So that our whole motion will be but weak, becauſe the ſpring of faith is ſo weak. O what need therefore have all Miniſters for themſelves and their work, to look well to their faith, eſpecially that their Aſſent to the truth of Scripture, about the Joy and Torments of the life to come, be ſound and lively.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And laſtly, we have commonly a great deal of unskilfulneſs and unfitneſs for this work. Alas how few know how to deal with an ignorant worldly man
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:99578:218"/>
for his ſalvation! To get within him, and win upon him, and ſuit all ſpeeches to mens ſeveral conditions and tempers, to chooſe the meeteſt ſubjects, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them with the holy mixture of ſeriouſneſs, and terrour, and love, and meekneſs, and evangelical al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements! O who is fit for ſuch a thing! I profeſs ſeriouſly, it ſeems to me (by experience) as hard a matter to confer aright with ſuch a carnal perſon in order to his change, as to preach ſuch Sermons as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily we do, if not much more. All theſe Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in our ſelves ſhould waken us to reſolutions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and diligence, that we be not overcome by them, and hindred from, or in the work.</p>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="2">2. AND for our people, we have as many Difficulties to encounter with in them. 1. Too many of them will be obſtinately unwilling to be taught; and ſcorn to come at us, as being too good to be catechized, or too old to learn: unleſs we deal wiſely with them in publike and private, by the force of Reaſons, the power of Love to conquer their perverſneſs; which we muſt carefully endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. And when they do come, ſo great is their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and unapprehenſiveneſs, that you will find it a wonderful hard matter to get them to underſtand

you, ſo that if you have not the skill of making things plain, you will leave them as ſtrange to it, as before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And yet harder will you find it to work things upon their hearts, and ſet them ſo cloſe to the quick, as to make that ſaving change which is our end, and without which our labour is almoſt loſt. Oh what a block, what a rock is a hardened carnal heart! How ſtiffly will it reſiſt the moſt powerful perſwaſions! and hear of everlaſting life or death as a thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing! If you have not therefore great ſeriouſneſs, and fervency, and working matter, and fitneſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, what good can you expect? And when all is done, the ſpirit of Grace muſt do the work: But as God and men do uſe to chooſe inſtruments moſt ſuitable to the nature of the agent, work or end, ſo here the ſpirit of wiſdom, life, and holineſs, doth not uſe to work by fooliſh, dead or carnal inſtruments, but by ſuch perſwaſions of Light, and Life, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as are likeſt to it ſelf, and to the work that is to be wrought thereby.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And when you have made ſome deſirable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on their hearts, if you look not after them, and have not a ſpecial care of them when they are gone, their hearts will ſoon return to their former hardneſs, and their old companions, and temptations will work off all again. I do but briefly hint theſe things which you ſo well know.

               <p n="3">III. THE third ſort of moving Reaſons are drawn from the Neceſſity of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken work: For if it were not Neceſſary, the lazy might be diſcouraged rather then excited, by the forementioned difficulties, as is aforeſaid. And if we ſhould here expatiate, we might find matter for a volumn by it ſelf. But becauſe I have already been longer then I did intend, I ſhall only give you a brief hint of ſome of the general grounds of this Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>And 1. it is Neceſſary by Obligation, <hi>Ut Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Neceſsitate praeceoti:</hi> and 2. It is neceſſary <hi>ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem;</hi> and that, 1. For God. 2. For our neighbours. 3. And for our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the firſt of theſe. 1. We have on us the Obligation of Scripture-precepts. 1. General. 2. Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. And 2. the ſubſervient obligation (or the firſt bound faſter on us) by Promiſes and Threatnings. 3. And theſe alſo ſeconded by executions, even 1. by actual Judgements: 2. and mercies. And laſtly, we have the Obligation of our own undertaking upon us. Theſe all deſerve your Conſideration, but may not be inſiſted on by me, leſt I be over tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every Chriſtian is Obliged to do all that he can for the ſalvation of others, but every Miniſter is doubly obliged, becauſe he is ſeparated to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and is to give up himſelf wholly to that

work. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15. It is needleſs to make any further queſtion of our Obligation, when we know that this work is needful to our peoples converſion and ſalvation, and that we are in general commanded to do all that is needful to thoſe ends, as far as we are able. That they are neceſſary to thoſe ends hath been ſhewed before; and ſhall be more anon. Even the antient profeſſors, have need to be taught the Principles of Gods Oracles, if they have neglected it, or forgot it, ſaith the Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. Whether the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted have need of converſion and the means of it, I hope is no doubt among us: And whether this be a means, and a needful means, experience may put us far out of doubt, if we had no more. Let them that have taken moſt pains in publike, examine their people, and try whether many of them be not yet as ignorant and careleſs almoſt, as if they had never heard the Goſpel. For my part, I ſtudy to ſpeak as plainly and movingly as I can, (and next my ſtudy to ſpeak truly, theſe are my chief ſtudies) and yet I frequently meet with thoſe that have been my hearers this 8. or 10. years, who know not whether Chriſt be God or man, and wonder when I tell them the hiſtory of his birth, and life, and death, and ſending abroad the Goſpel, as if they had never heard it before, and that know not that Infants have any original ſin: And of thoſe that know the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpel, how few are they that know the nature of that faith, repentance, and holineſs, that it requireth; Or at leaſt, that know their own hearts? But moſt of them have an ungrounded affiance in
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:99578:220"/>
Chriſt, truſting that he will pardon, juſtifie and ſave them, while the world hath their hearts, and they live to the fleſh: And this aſſiance they take for a juſtifying-faith. I have found by experience, that an ignorant ſot that hath been an unprofitable hearer ſo long, hath got more knowledge and remorſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in half an hours cloſe diſcourſe, then they did from ten years publike preaching. I know that preaching of the Goſpel publikely is the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means, becauſe we ſpeak to many at once: But otherwiſe, it is uſually far more effectual to preach it privately to a particular ſinner, as to himſelf. For the plaineſt man that is, can ſcarce ſpeak plain enough in publike for them to underſtand; but in private we may much more. In publike, we may not uſe ſuch homely expreſſions, or repetitions, as their dulneſs doth require, but in private we may: In publike our ſpeeches are long, and we quite over-run their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings and memories, and they are confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and at a loſs, and not able to follow us, and one thing drives out another and ſo they know not what we ſaid: But in private we can take our work <hi>gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> and take our hearers with us as we go; and by queſtions and their anſwers, we can ſee how far they go with us, and what we have next to do. In publike, by length and ſpeaking alone, we loſe their attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But when they are Interlocutors, we can eaſily cauſe them to attend. Beſides that, we can (as was aboveſaid) better anſwer their Objections, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them by Promiſes before we leave them, which in publike we cannot do. I conclude therefore that publike preaching will not be ſufficient: For though it may be an effectual means to convert many, yet
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:99578:221"/>
not ſo many; as experience, and Gods appointment of further means, may aſſure us. Long may you ſtudy and preach to little purpoſe, if you neglect this duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for inſtances of particular ſpecial Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we might eaſily ſhew you many, both from Chriſts own example, who uſed this interlocutory preaching, both to his Diſciples and to the Jews, and from the Apoſtles examples, who did the like: But that indeed it would be needleſs tediouſneſs to recite the paſſages to thoſe that ſo well know them, it being the moſt ordinary way of the Apoſtles preaching, to do it thus interlocutorily and by diſcourſe: And when they did make a ſpeech any thing long to the people, yet the people and they diſcourſe it out in the concluſion. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> preached to the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2 and to <hi>

Its plain that it was the commoneſt preaching of thoſe times, which occaſioneth the Quakers to challenge us to ſhew where any ever took a text, and preacht as we do: (though they might have found that Chriſt did ſo, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18.)

               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="2">2. THere is a Neceſſity alſo of this Duty <hi>ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem;</hi> and firſt, To the Creater Glory of God, by the fuller ſucceſs of the Goſpel: Not <hi>ſimply to his Glory,</hi> as if he could not have his Glory without it: for ſo our ſalvation is not Neceſſary to his Glory: but to his Greater Glory: becauſe he is moſt honoured and pleaſed when moſt are ſaved: For he hath ſworn that he hath no pleaſure in the Death of a Sinner, but rather that he return and live. And doubtleſs as every Chriſtian liveth to the Glory of God, as his End ſo will he gladly take that courſe that may moſt effectually promote it: For what man would not attain his Ends? O Brethren if we could generally ſet this work a foot in all the Pariſhes of <hi>England,</hi> and get our people to ſubmit to it, and then proſecute it skilfully and zealouſly our ſelves, what a Glory would it put upon the face of the Nation, and what Glory would redound to God thereby? If our common Ignorance were thus baniſhed, and our vanity and idleneſs turned into the ſtudy of the way of life, and every Shop, and every houſe were buſied in learning of Catechiſms, and ſpeaking of the word and works of God, what Pleaſure would God take in our Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries? He would even dwell in our habitations and make them his delight. It is the Glory of Chriſt that ſhineth in his Saints; and all their Glory is his
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:99578:222"/>
Glory; that therefore which honoureth them, in Number, or excellency, that honoureth him; Will not the Glory of Chriſt be moſt wonderful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the Church ſhall have that ſhining luſtre that is deſcribed in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.? It is he that is the ſun and the ſhield of his Church, and his light is it in which they ſhall have light; and the buſineſs of every Saint is to glorifie him: If therefore we can increaſe the Number or ſtrength of the Saints, we thereby increaſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the King of Saints; For he will have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and praiſe where before he had diſobedience and diſhonour. Chriſt alſo will be honoured in the fruits of his bloodſhed, and the ſpirit of Grace in the fruit of his operations; And do not all theſe Ends require that we uſe the means with diligence?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Duty alſo is neceſſary to the welfare of our people: How much doth it conduce to their ſalvation is manifeſt. Brethren can you look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly on your miſerable neighbours, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them calling for your help? There is not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whoſe caſe you ſhould not ſo far compaſſionate, as to be willing to relieve them at dearer rates then this comes to. Can you ſee them as the wounded man by the way, and unmercifully paſs by? Can you hear them cry to you, as the man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> in his viſion, come and help us? and yet will you refuſe your help? Are you entruſted with an hoſpital, where one languiſheth in one corner, and another groaneth in another, and cryeth out, O help me, pity me for the Lords ſake, and a third is raging mad, and would deſtroy himſelf and you, and yet will you ſit idle, or refuſe your help?
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:99578:222"/>
If it may be ſaid of him that relieveth not mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, how much more of them that relieve not mens ſouls, that <hi>if you ſee your brother have need, and ſhut up the bowels of your Compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in you?</hi> You are not ſuch Monſters, ſuch hard-hearted men, but you will pity a Leper, you will pity the naked, impriſoned or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, you will pity him that is tormented with grievous pain or ſickneſs; And will you not pity an ignorant hard-hearted ſinner? will you not pity one that muſt be ſhut out from the preſence of the Lord, and ile under his remedileſs wrath, if through Repentance ſpeedily prevent it not? O what a heart is it that will not pity ſuch a one? what ſhall I call the heart of ſuch a man? a heart of ſtone, or a very rock, or adamant, or the heart of a Tyger? or rather the heart of an Infidel? for ſure if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the miſery of the impenitent, it is not poſsible but he ſhould have pity on him! Can you tell men in the Pulpit, that they ſhall certainly be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed except they repent, and yet have no pity on them when you have proclaimed ſuch a danger? And if you pity them, will you not do this much for their ſalvation? what abundance round about you are blindly haſtening to perdition? and your voice is appointed to be the means of reclaiming them. The Phyſician hath no excuſe who is doubly bound to relieve the ſick, when every neighbour is to help them. Brethren, what if you heard ſinners cry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you in the ſtreets, <hi>O Sir; have pity on me, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me your advice! I am afraid of the everlaſting wrath of God! I know I muſt ſhortly leave this world, and I am afraid leſt I ſhall be miſerable in the next</hi> I
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:99578:223"/>
Could you deny your help to ſuch a ſinner? What if they came to your Study-door, and cryed for help, and would not away, till you had told them how to eſcape the wrath of God? could you find in your hearts to drive them away without advice? I am confident you could not. Why, alaſs ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are leſs miſerable then they that cannot cry for help. It is the hardened ſinner that cares not for your help that moſt needeth it: and he that hath not ſo much life as to feel that he is dead, nor ſo much light as to ſee his danger, nor ſo much ſenſe left as to pity himſelf, this is the man that is moſt to be pityed. Look upon your neighbours round about you, and think what abundance need your help in no leſs a caſe then the apparent danger of damnation. And every impenitent perſon that you ſee and know about you, ſuppoſe that you hear them cry to you for help <hi>as ever you pitied poor wretches pity us, leſt we ſhould be tormented in the flames of hell: if you have the hearts of men, pitty us:</hi> And do that for them that you would do if they followed you with ſuch complaints. O how can you walk and talk, and be merry with ſuch people, when you know their caſe? Me thinks when you look them in the face, and think how they muſt lie in perpetual miſery, you ſhould break forth into tears (as the Prophet did when he looked upon <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael,)</hi> and then fall on with the moſt importunate Exhortations! when you muſt viſit them in their ſickneſs, will it not wound your hearts, to ſee them ready to depart into miſery, before you have ever dealt ſeriouſly with them for their recovery? O then for the Lords ſake, and for the ſake of poor

               <p>And 1. what cauſe have we to bleed before the Lord this day, that have neglected ſo great and good a work ſo long? That we have been Miniſters of the Goſpel ſo many years, and done ſo little by perſonal inſtructions and conference for the ſaving of mens ſouls! If we had but ſet a work this buſineſs ſooner, that we have now agreed upon, who knows how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more might have been brought over unto Chriſt? and how much happyer we might have made our Pariſhes, ere now? And why might we not have done it ſooner as well as now? I confeſs many impediments were in our way, and ſo there are ſtill, and will be while there is a Devil to tempt, and a corrupt heart in man to reſiſt the light: But if the greateſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment had not been in our ſelves, even in our own darkneſs, and dulneſs, and undiſpoſedneſs to duty, and our dividedneſs and unaptneſs to cloſe for the work of God, I ſee not but much might have been done before this. We had the ſame God to command us, and the ſame miſerable objects of compaſſion, and the ſame liberty from Governors of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. But we ſtood looking for changes, and we would have had the Magiſtrate not only to have
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:99578:225"/>
given us leave to work, but have done our work for us, or at leaſt to have brought the game to our hands, and while we lookt for better daies, we made them worſe, by the lamentable neglect of a chief part of our work. And had we as much petitioned Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the interpoſition of their Authority to compell men to be catechized and inſtructed by the Miniſter, as we did for maintenance and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; its like we might have obtained it long ago, when they were forward to gratifie us in ſuch undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable things.

The Lord of Mercy forgive us, and all the Miniſtry of <hi>England,</hi> and lay not this or any of our Miniſterial negligences to our charge. O that he would cover all our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs, and by the blood of the everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, would waſh away our guilt of the blood of ſouls, that when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, we may ſtand before him in peace, and may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for the ſcattering of his Flock. And O that he would put up his controverſie which he hath againſt the Paſtors of his Church, and not deal the hardlyer with them for our ſakes; nor ſuffer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners or perſecutors to ſcatter them, as they have ſuffered his Sheep to be ſcattered! and that he will not care as little for them, as they have done for the ſouls of men; nor think his ſalvation too good for them, as they have thought their labour and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings too much for mens ſalvation: and as we have had many daies of Humiliation in <hi>England,</hi> for the

The harveſt is great, the labourers are too few; the loyterers and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious hinderers are many; the ſouls of men are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; the miſery of ſinners is great; and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery that they are near to is greater; the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:99578:226"/>
beauty and glory of the Church is deſirable; the joy that we are helping them to, is unconceivable; the comfort that followeth a faithful ſteward-ſhip is not ſmall; the comfort of a full ſucceſs alſo will be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; to be co-workers with God and his Spirit, is not a little honour; to ſubſerve the blood-ſhed of Chriſt for mens ſalvation is not a light thing: to lead on the Armies of Chriſt through the thickeſt of the enemies, and guide them ſafely through a dangerous wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſteer the veſſel through ſuch ſtorms, and rocks, and ſands, and ſhelves, and bring it ſafe to the harbour of Reſt, requireth no ſmall skill and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: the fields now ſeem even white unto harveſt, the preparations that have been made for us are very great; the ſeaſon of working is more warm and calm, then moſt ages before us have ever ſeen: we have careleſly loytered too long already; the preſent time is poſting away; while we are trifling, men are dying, &amp; how faſt are men paſſing into another world? And is there nothing in all this to awaken us to our duty, and to reſolve us to ſpeedy and unwearied diligence? Can we think that a man can be too careful and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful under all theſe motives and engagements? Or could that man be a fit inſtrument for other mens il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, that were himſelf ſo blind? or for the quickning of others, that were himſelf ſo ſenſleſs? What Sirs, are you that are men of wiſdom as dull as the common people? and do we need to heap up a multitude of words to perſwade you to a known and weighty duty? One would think it ſhould be enough to ſet you on work, to ſhew a line in the Book of God, to prove it to be his will? or to prove to you that the work hath a tendency to mens ſalvation?
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:99578:226"/>
One would think that the very ſight of your miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neighbours ſhould be motive ſufficient to draw out your moſt compaſſionate endeavours for their relief? If a cripple do but unlap his ſores, and ſhew you his diſabled limbs, it will move you without words? and will not the caſe of ſouls that are neer to damnation move you? O happy Church, if the Phyſicians were but healed themſelves! and if we had not too much of that Infidelity and ſtupidity which we daily preach againſt, in others! and were ſoundlyer perſwaded of that which we perſwade men of, and deeplyer affected with the wonderful things, wherewith we would affect them! Were there but ſuch clear and deep impreſſions upon our ſouls, of thoſe glorious things that we daily preach, O what a change would it make in our Sermons, and in our private courſe! O what a miſerable thing it is to the Church and to themſelves, that men muſt preach of Heaven and Hell, before they ſoundly believe that there are ſuch things! Or have felt the weight of the Doctrines which they preach! It would amaze a ſenſible man to think what matters we preach and talk of! What it is for the ſoul to paſs out of this fleſh, and go before a righteous God, and enter upon unchangeable Joy or Torment! O with what ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing thoughts do dying men apprehend thoſe things! How ſhould ſuch matters be preacht and diſcourſt of? O the gravity, the ſeriouſneſs, the unceſſant diligence, that theſe things require! I know not what others think of them, but for my part, I am aſhamed of my ſtupidity, and wonder at my ſelf that Ideal not with my own and others ſouls, as one that looks for the great day of the Lord; and that I can
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:99578:227"/>
have room for almoſt any other thoughts or words, and that ſuch aſtoniſhing matters do not wholly take me up: I marva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I ſeldom come out of the Pulpit, but my Conſcience ſmiteth me that I have been no more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſervent in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
               <p>It accuſeth me not ſo much for want of humane ornaments or elegancy, nor for letting fall an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanſom word But it asketh me <hi>How couldſt thou ſpeak of Life and Death with ſuch a Heart? How couldſt thou Preach of Heaven and Hell, in ſuch a careleſs ſleepy manner? Doſt thou believe what thou ſaiſt? Art thou in earreſt or in jeſt? How canſt thou tell people that ſin is ſuch a thing, and that ſo much miſery is upon them and before them, and be no more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it? ſhouldſt thou not weep over ſuch a people, and ſhould not thy tears interrupt thy words? ſhouldſt thou not cry aloud, and ſhew them their tranſgreſſions? and intreat and beſeech as for life and death.</hi> Truly this is the peal that Conſcience doth ring in my ears, and yet my drouzie ſoul will not be awakened! O what a thing is a ſenſeleſs hardened heart! O Lord ſave us from the plague of Infidelity and Hard-heartedneſs our ſelves, or elſe how ſhall we be fit Inſtruments of ſaving others from it! O do that on our own ſouls, which thou wouldſt uſe us to do on the ſouls of others! I am even confounded to think what difference there is between my ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs apprehenſions, and my Pulpit and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:99578:227"/>
apprehenſions of the life to come? That ever that can ſeem ſo light a matter to me now, which ſeemeth ſo great and aſtoniſhing a matter then; and I know will do ſo again when death looks me in the face, when yet I daily know and think of that approaching hour! and yet thoſe fore thoughts will not recover ſuch working apprehenſions? O Brethren ſure if you had all converſed with neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-death as oft as I have done, and as often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſentence in your ſelves, you would have an unquiet Conſcience, if not a reformed life in your Miniſterial diligence and fidelity; and you would have ſomething within you that would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ask you ſuch queſtions as theſe: <hi>Is this all thy Compaſſion on loſt ſinners? wilt thou do no more to ſeek and to ſave them? Is there not ſuch and ſuch, and ſuch a one, O how many round about thee, that are yet the viſible ſons of death? What haſt thou ſaid to them or done for their recovery? ſhall they dye, and be in Hell before thou wilt ſpeak to them one ſerious word to prevent it? ſhall they there curſe thee for ever that didſt no more in time to ſave them?</hi> ſuch cries of Conſcience are daily in mine ears, though the Lord knows I have too little obeyed them. The God of Mercy pardon me, and awake me, with the reſt of his ſervants that have been thus ſinfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, I confeſs to my ſhame, that I ſeldom hear the Bell toll for one that is dead, but Conſcience asketh me <hi>What haſt thou done for the ſaving of that ſoul before it left the body? There is one more gone to Iudgement: what didſt thou to prepare them for Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> and yet I have been ſlothful and backward to help the reſt that do ſurvive. How can you
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:99578:228"/>
chuſe, when you are laying a Corps in the grave, but think with your ſelves, <hi>Here lieth the body, but where is the ſoul? and what have I done for it, before it departed? It was part of my charge, what account can I give of it,</hi> O Sirs, is it a ſmall matter to you to anſwer ſuch queſtions, as theſe? It may ſeem ſo now, but the hour is coming when it will not ſeem ſo. If our hearts condem us. God is greater then our hearts, and will condemn us much more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>even with another kind of Condemnation then Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth. The voice of conſcience now is a ſtil voice, and the ſentence of Conſcience is a gentle ſentence, in compariſon of the voice, and the ſentence of God. Alas! Conſcience ſeeth but a very little of our ſin and miſery, in compariſon of what God ſeeth. What mountains would theſe things appear to your ſouls, which now ſeem mole hils? What beams would theſe be in your eyes that now ſeem motes, if you did but ſee them with a clearer light? (I dare not ſay, As God ſeeth them) we can eaſily make ſhift to plead the Cauſe with Conſcience, and either bribe it, or bear its ſentence: but God is not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt with, nor his ſentence ſo eaſily born. <hi>Wherefore we receiving</hi> (and preaching) <hi>a Kingdom that cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with reverence, and Godly fear: for our God is a Conſuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12. <hi>ult.</hi> But becauſe you ſhall not ſay, that I affright my ſelf or you with bug bears, and tell you of dangers and terrors when there are none, I will here add the certainty and ſureneſs of that Condemnation, that is like to befal the negligent Paſtors, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that will befall us that are here this day, if we
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:99578:228"/>

               <p n="1">1. Our Parents that deſtinated us to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry may condemn us, and ſay, <hi>Lord we devoted them to thy ſervice, and they made light of it, and ſerv'd themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Maſters that taught us, our Tutors that inſtructed us; The Schools and Univerſities that we lived in, and all the years that we ſpent in ſtudy, may riſe up in judgement againſt us, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us: For why was all this, but for the work of God?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Learning and Knowledge and Miniſterial gifts will condemn us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For to what are we made partakers of theſe, but for the work of God?</p>

               <p n="5">5. All the Care of God for his Church, and all, that Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for them, will riſe up in judgement againſt us, if we be negligent and unfaithful, and condemn us: For that we did by our neglect deſtroy them for whom Chriſt dyed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All the ſevere Precepts and Charges of holy Scripture, with the Promiſes of Aſſiſtance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and the threatnings of puniſhment, will riſe up againſt the unfaithful and condemn them; For God did not ſpeak all this in vain.</p>

For theſe were for their imitation, and to provoke them to a holy emulation in fidelity and Miniſterial dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Holy Bible that is open before us, and all the Books in our ſtudies that tell us of our duty, directly or indirectly, may condemn the lazy and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervant: For we have not all theſe helps and furniture in vain.</p>
               <p n="9">9. All the Sermons that we preach to perſwade our people to work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling, to lay violent hands upon the Crown, and take the Kingdom as by force, to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, and ſo to run as they that may obtain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will riſe up againſt the unfaithful and condemn them. For if it ſo nearly concern them to labour for their ſalvation, doth it not concern us who have the charge of them to be alſo violent, laborious, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied in ſtriving to help on their ſalvation? Is it worth their labour, and patience, and is it not alſo worth ours?</p>
               <p n="10">10. All the Sermons that we preach to them to ſet out the danger of a natural ſtate, the evil of ſin, the need of Chriſt, and Grace, the Joyes of heaven, and the torments of hell, yea and the truth of Chriſtian Religion, will riſe up in Judgement againſt ſuch and condemn them.

               <p n="11">11. All the Sermons that we have preached to perſwade other men to ſuch duties, as neighbours to exhort one another daily, and plainly to rebuke them, and parents and maſters to do it to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervants, will riſe up in Judgement againſt ſuch, and condemn them. For will you perſwade others to that which you will not do (as far as you can) your ſelves? When you threaten them for neglecting it, you threaten your own ſouls.</p>
               <p n="12">12. All our hard cenſures of the Magiſtrate for doing no more, and all our reproofs of him for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Seducers, and denying his further aſſiſtance to the Miniſters, doth condemn our ſelves if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe our own duty. What muſt all the Rulers of the world be ſervants to our ſloathfulneſs, or light us the candle to do nothing, or only hold the ſtirrup to our Pride, or make our beds for us, that we may ſleep by day-light? Should they do their part in a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate office to protect and further us, and ſhould not we do ours who ſtand neareſt to the end?</p>
               <p n="13">13. All the maintenance that we take for our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice if we be unfaithful will condemn us: For who is it that will pay a ſervant to take his pleaſure, or ſit ſtill or work for himſelf?

               <p n="15">15. All the witneſs that we have born againſt the ſcandalous negligent Miniſters of this age, and the words we have ſpoken againſt them, and all the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that we have uſed for their removal, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the unfaithful. For God is no reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: If we ſucced them in their ſins, we ſpoke all that againſt ourſelves. And as we condemned them, God and others will condemn us, if we imitate them. And though we be not ſo bad as they, it will prove ſad to be too like them.</p>
               <p n="16">16. All the Judgements that God hath executed on them in this age before our eyes, will condemn us if we be unfaithful: Hath he made the idle Shepherds and ſenſual drones, to ſtink in the noſtrils of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? and will he honour us, if we be idle and ſenſual? Hath he ſequeſtred them, and caſt them our of their habitations, and out of the Pulpits, and laid them by, as dead, while they are alive, and made them a hiſſing and a by-word in the Land? and yet dare we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them? Are not their ſufferings our warnings? and did not all this befall them for our examples? If any thing in the world ſhould waken Miniſters to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal and diligence, one would think we had ſeen enough to do it! If the Judgements of God on one man ſhould do ſo much, what ſhould ſo many years judgement on ſo many hundreds of them do? Would you have imitated the old world, if you had ſeen the flood that drowned them! Would you have taken up the ſins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Pride, Fulneſs of bread, Idleneſs, if you had ſtood by and ſeen the flames of <hi>Sodom!</hi>

All the Diſputations and eager conteſts that we have had againſt unfaithful men, and for a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſtry, will condemn us, if we be unfaithful? And ſo will the Books that we have written to thoſe ends. How many ſcore, if not hundreds of Catechiſms are written in <hi>England?</hi> and yet ſhall we forbear to uſe them? How many Books have been written for Diſcipline, by Engliſh and Scottiſh Divines? and how fully hath it been defended? and what reproach hath been caſt upon the adverſaries of it through the Land? And yet ſhall we lay it by, as uſeleſs, when we have free leave to uſe! O fearful hypocriſie! What can we call it leſs? Did we think when we were writing againſt this ſect, and the ſect that oppoſed Diſcipline, that we were writing all that againſt our ſelves? O what Evidence do the Book-ſellers ſhops, and their own Libraries contain againſt the greateſt part, even of the godly Miniſters of the Land! The Lord cauſe them ſeaſonably to lay it to heart.</p>

18. All the daies of faſting and prayer that have been of late years kept in <hi>England</hi> ſo a Reformation, will riſe up in Judgement againſt the unreformed, that will not be perſwaded to the painful part of the work. And I confeſs it is ſo heavy an aggravation of our ſin, that it makes me ready to tremble to think of it. Was there ever a Nation on the race of the earth that hath ſo ſolemnly and ſo long, followed God with faſting and prayer as we have done? Before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament began, how frequent and ſervent were wein ſecret: After that for many years time together, we had a monethly Faſt commanded by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: beſides frequent private and publike Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

What ever was ſometime the means that we lookt at, yet ſtill the end of all our Prayers was Church-Reformation, and therein eſpecially theſe two things; <hi>A faithful Miniſtry; and Exerciſe of Diſcipline in the Church:</hi> And did it once enter then into the hearts of the people, yea or into our own hearts to imagine, that when we had all that we would have, and the matter was put into our own hands, to be as painful as we could, and to exerciſe what Diſcipline we would, that then we would do nothing (but publikely preach) that we would not be at the pains of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing and Inſtructing our people perſonally? nor exerciſe any conſiderable part of Diſcipline at all? It aſtoniſheth me to think of it! What a depth of deceit is it, the heart of man! What, are good mens hearts ſo deceitful? Are all mens hearts ſo deceitful? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I told many ſouldiers and other ſenſual men then, that when they had fought for a Reformation, I was confident they would abhorr it and be enemies to it,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:99578:231"/>
when they ſaw and felt it: thinking that the yoak of Diſcipline would have pincht their necks: and that when they had been catechized and perſonally dealt with, and reproved for their ſin, in private and publike, and brought to publike confeſtion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or avoided as impenitent, they would have ſcorned and ſpurned againſt all this, and have taken the yoak of Chriſt for tyrannie: But little did I think that the Miniſters would have let all fall, and put almoſt none of this upon them, but have let them alone for fear of diſpleaſing them, and have let all run on as it did before.</p>
               <p>O the earneſt prayers that I have heard in ſecret daies heretofore for <hi>a Painful Miniſtry, and for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline!</hi> As if they had even wreſtled for ſalvation it ſelf? Yea they commonly called Diſcipline, <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt; or the Exerciſe of his Kingly office in his Church;</hi> and ſo preached and prayed for it, as if the ſetting up of Diſcipline, had been the ſetting up of the Kingdom of Chriſt. And did I then think that they would refuſe to ſet it up when they might! What is the Kingdom of Chriſt now recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the things indifferent!</p>
               <p>If the God of heaven that knew our hearts, had in the midſt of our Prayers and Cries on one of our Publike monethly Faſts, returned us this anſwer with his dreadful voice, in the audience of the Aſſembly, <hi>You deceitful hearted ſinners; what Hypocriſio is this, to weary me with your cries for that which you will not have if I would give it you! and thus to lift up your voices for that which your ſouls abhor! what is Reformation, but the inſtructing and importunate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading of ſinners to entertain my Chriſt and Grace as</hi>

But Chriſt yet turneth back, and looketh with a merciful eye upon us. O that we had yet the hearts, immediately to go out &amp; weep bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to do ſo, as we have done, no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto us, and now to follow Chriſt through labour and ſuffering, though it were to the death, whom we have ſo far forſaken.</p>
               <p n="19">19. All the Judgements upon the Nation, the coſt, the labour, the blood, and the deliverances, and all the endeavours of the Governors for Reformation, will riſe up againſt us if we now refuſe to be faithful for a Reformation, when it is before us, and at our will.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid ſomewhat of this before. Hath God

The whole Countries may ſay, <hi>Lord we have been plund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ruined or much impover ſhed, we have paid taxes theſe many years, and it was a Reformation that was pretended, and that we were promiſed, in all; and now the Miniſters that ſhould be the inſtruments of it do neglect it:</hi> Many thouſands may ſay, <hi>Lord we ventured our lives in obedience to a Parliament, that promiſed Reformation, and now we cannot have it.</hi> The ſouls of many, that have dyed in theſe wars may cry out againſt us, <hi>Lord it was the hopes of a Reformation that we fought and ſuffered for, in obedience to thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors that profeſſed to intend it; and now the Paſtors reject it by their idleneſs.</hi> The Parliament may ſay, <hi>How long did we ſit and conſult about Reformation; and now the Miniſters will not execute the power that is granted them?</hi> The Nation may ſay, <hi>How oft did we beg it of God, and Petition the Parliament for it, and now the Miniſters deny us the enjoyment of it?</hi> Yea God himſelf may ſay, <hi>How many prayers have I heard! and what dangers have I delivered you from! how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny! and how great! and in what a wonderful manner! And what do you think it was, that I delivered you for? Was it not that you ſhould do my work! And will you betray it, or neglect it after all this?</hi> Truly Sirs, I

know not what others think, but when I conſider the Judgements that we have felt, and the wonders of Mercy that my eyes have ſeen, to the frequent aſtoniſhment of my ſoul, as I know it is great matters that theſe things oblige us to, ſo I am afraid leſt they ſhould be charged on me as the aggravations of my neglect. I hear every exaſperated party ſtill flying in the faces of the reſt, and one ſaith <hi>It was you that killed the King,</hi> and the other ſaith <hi>It was you that fought againſt a Parliament, and put them to defend themſelves, and drencht the land in blood.</hi> But the Lord grant that it be not <hi>we,</hi> if we prove negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in our Miniſtry, and betray the Reformation that God hath called us to, that ſhall have all this blood and miſery charged on us, yea though we had never any other hand therein: And that the Lord ſay not of us, as of <hi>John,</hi> even when he had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> by his command, becauſe he accompliſhed not the Reformation which that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution tended to, <hi>Yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of</hi> Iezrael <hi>on the houſe of</hi> Jehn, Hof. 1. 4.

Again there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt needs ſay, what a bottomleſs depth of deceit is the heart of man! O what heavy charges have we brought againſt many others of theſe times for breaking this ſolemn Vow and Covenant (from which I am far from undertaking to acquit them)
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:99578:234"/>
when yet we that led the way, and drew on others, and daily preach't up Reformation and Diſcipline, have ſo horribly violated this Covenant our ſelves, that in a whole Countrey it is rare to find a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that hath ſet up Diſcipline or private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And he that can ſee much done towards it in <hi>England,</hi> hath more acquaintance, or better eyes then I have.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Alſo in our frequent ſolemn Humiliation days in the time of our deep diſtreſs and fear, how pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and earneſtly did we beg deliverances, <hi>not as for our ſakes, but for the Church and Goſpel ſake,</hi> as if we had not cared what had become of us, ſo that the Reformation of the Church might go on, and we promiſed if God would hear and deliver us, what we would do towards it. But O how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful have we been to thoſe Promiſes! as if we were not the ſame men that ever ſpoke ſuch words to God! I confeſs it filleth my own ſoul with ſhame, to conſider the unanſwerableneſs of my affections and Endeavours to the many fervent prayers, rare deliverances, and confident Promiſes of thoſe years of adveſity! And ſuch experiences of the almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible unfaithfulneſs of our hearts, is almoſt enough to make a man never truſt his heart again; and Conſequently to ſhake his Certainty of ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Have we now, or are we like to have any higher Reſolutions, then thoſe were which we have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken! And it tends alſo to make us queſtion in the next extremity, even at the hour of death, whether God will hear and help us any more, who have forfeited our Credit with him by proving ſo unfaithful. If ſo many years publike humiliations ſpurred on by
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:99578:234"/>
ſuch calamities as neither we nor our fathers for many Generations had ever ſeen, had no more in them then now appears, and if this be the iſſue of all, how can we tell how to believe our ſelves hereafter? It may makes us fear leſt our caſe be like the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Pſal</hi> 78. 34, 35, 36, 37, 43, 42, 57. Who <hi>when he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned, and enquired early after God: and they remembred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, Nevertheleſs they did flatter him with their mouth: and they lyed unto him with their tongues; For their heart was not right with God, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.

Moreover, if we will not be faithful in duties that we are engaged to, our own Agreements and Engagements which remain ſubſcribed by our hands, and are publiſhed to the view of the world, will riſe up in judgement againſt us and condemn us. We have engaged our ſelves under our hands near three years ago, that we will ſet up the exerciſe of Diſcipline, and yet how many have neglected it to this day without giving any juſt and reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe? We have now ſubſcribed another Agreement and Engagement, for Catechizing and Inſtructing all that will ſubmit. We have done well ſo far; But if now we ſhould flag and prove remiſs and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial in the performance, Our ſubſcriptions will condemn us; this days humiliation will condemn us. Be not deceived: God is not mocked: it is not
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:99578:235"/>
your Names only, but your hearts and hands alſo that he requireth: There is no dallying with God by feigned Promiſes; He will expect that you be as good as your words. He will not hold him guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that by falſe Oaths, or Vows, or Covenants with him doth take his holy Name in vain? <hi>When thou voweſt a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleaſure in fools; pay that which thou haſt vowed. Better it is that thou ſhouldſt not vow, then that thou ſhouldſt vow and not pay; ſuffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſin: neither ſay thou before the Angel, that it was an Error; wherefore ſhould God be angry at thy voice, and deſtroy the work of thy hands,</hi> Eccleſs. 5 4 5, 6.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you what will come on it, if you ſhall not ſet your ſelves faithfully to this work, to which you have ſo many obligations and engagements? and what an unexcuſable thing our neglect would be, and how great and manifold a condemnation it would expoſe us to. Truly Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, if I did not apprehend the work to be of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great moment, to your ſelves, to the people, and to the honour of God. I would not have troubled you with ſo many words about it, nor have preſumed to have ſpoken ſo ſharply as I have done. But when it is for life and death men are apt to forget their reverence, and courtefie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, commonly called Good manners! For my part I apprehend this as one of the beſt and greateſt works that ever I put mine hand to in my life. And I verily think that your thoughts of it are as mine: and then you will not think my words too many or too keen. I can well remember the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:99578:235"/>
time when I was earneſt for the Reformation of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Ceremony: and if I ſhould be cold in ſuch a ſubſtantial matter as this, how diſorderly, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable would my Zeal appear! Alas, can we think that the Reformation is wrought, when we caſt out a few Ceremonies, and changed ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and geſtures, and forms! O no Sirs! it is the converting and ſaving of ſouls that is our buſineſs: Thats the chiefeſt part of the Reformation that doth moſt good, and tendeth moſt to the ſalvation of the people. Let others take it how they will, I will ſo far ſpeak my conſcience for your juſt encouragement, as to ſay again, that I am verily perſwaded that as you are happily agreed and combined for this work, ſo if you will but faithfully execute this Agreement, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with your former Agreement for Diſcipline, you will do much more for a true Reformation, and that peaceably without meddling with controverted points then I have heard of any part of <hi>England</hi> to have done before you, and yet no more than is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably, your Duty.</p>

               <p>I Am next to anſwer ſome of thoſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which backward minds may caſt in our way. And 1. ſome may object, that <hi>this courſe will take up ſo much time that a man ſhall have no time to follow his ſtudies: Moſt of us are young and raw, and have need of much time to improve our own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which this courſe will prohibit us.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: 1. We ſuppoſe them whom we perſwade to this work, to underſtand the ſubſtance of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and to be able to teach it others: And the addition of lower and leſs neceſſary things, is not to be preferr'd before this needful communication of the fundamentals. I highly value common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and would not encourage any to ſet light by it: But I value the ſaving of ſouls before it. That work which is next the end muſt be done, whatever be undone: Its a very deſirable thing for a Phyſician to be throughly ſtudied in his art; and to be able to ſee the reaſon of his experiments, and to reſolve ſuch difficult controverſies as are before him: But if he had the charge of an Hoſpital, or lived in a City that had the raging Peſtilence, if he would be ſtudying <hi>de fermentatica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:99578:236"/>
muſt follow his own ſtudies, I ſhould take that man for a prepoſterous ſtudent, that preferr'd the remote means before the end it ſelf of his ſtudies: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I ſhould think him but a civil kind of Murderer. Mens ſouls may be ſaved without knowing, whether God did predetermine the creature in all its acts? whether the underſtanding neceſſarily determines the wil? whether God works Grace in a Phyſical or Moral way of cauſation? What free-will is? Whether God have <hi>ſcientiam mediam?</hi> Or poſitive decrees <hi>de malo culpae;</hi> with a hundred ſuch like, which are the things that you would be ſtudying when you ſhould be ſaving ſouls. Get well to heaven, and help your people thither, and you ſhall know all theſe things in a moment, and a thouſand more which now by all your ſtudies you can never know: and is not this the moſt expeditious &amp; certain way to knowledg.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you grow not extenſively in knowlege, you will by this way of diligent practice obtain the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive more excellent growth: If you know not ſo many things as others, you will know the great things better then they: For this ſerious dealing with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for their ſalvation, will help you to far deeper apprehenſions of their ſaving principles, then will be got by any other means. And a little more of the knowledge of theſe is worth all the other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the world. O when I am looking heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and gazing towards the inacceſſible light, and aſpiring after the knowledge of God, and find my ſoul ſo dark and diſtant, that I am ready to ſay, [I know not God; he is above me: quite out of my reach] this is the moſt killing and grievous Ignorance! One thinks I could willingly exchange
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:99578:237"/>
all other knowledge that I have for one glimpſe more of the knowledge of God and the life to come. O that I had never known a word in Logick, Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor known what ever School-men ſaid, ſo I had but one ſpark more of that light that would ſhew me the things that I muſt ſhortly ſee. For my part, I conceive that by ſerious talking of everlaſting things, and teaching the Creed and ſhorteſt Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, you may grow more in knowledge (though not in the knowledge of more things) and prove much wiſer men, then if you ſpent that time in common or curious leſs neceſſary things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet let me add, that though I count this the chief, I would have you to have more; becauſe thoſe ſubſervient ſciences are very uſeful: and therefore I ſay, that you may have competent time for both: Loſe none upon vain recreations and employn ents: Trifle not away a minute: Conſume it not in needleſs ſleep: Do that you do with all your might: and then ſee whether you have not a competent time. If you ſet apart but two daies in a week in this great work that we are Agreed on, you may find ſome for common ſtudies out of all the other five.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. We may take time for neceſſary Recreation for all this? An hour or half, an hours walk before meat, is as much Recreation as is of neceſſity for the health of moſt of the weaker ſort of ſtudents. I have reaſon to know ſomewhat of this by long experience. Though I have a body that hath languiſhed under great weakneſſes many years, and my diſeaſes have been ſuch as require as much exerciſe as almoſt any in the world, and I have found exerciſe the principal means of my preſervation till now, and therefore
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:99578:238"/>
have as great reaſon to plead for it as any man that I know alive, yet I have found that the foreſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion hath been bleſſed to my preſervation (though I know that much more had been like to have tended to my greater health.) And I do not know one Miniſter of an hundred, that needeth ſo much as my ſelf. Yea I know abundance of Miniſters that ſcarce ever uſe any exerciſe at all (though I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it not in them) I doubt not but it is our duty to uſe ſo much exerciſe as is of neceſſity for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our health, ſo far as our work requireth: elſe we ſhould for one daies work loſe the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of many: But this may be done, and yet the works that we are engaged in, be done too. On thoſe two daies a week that you ſet apart for this work, what hinders but you may take an hour or two to walk for the exerciſe of your bodies? Much more on other daies.</p>
                  <p>But as for thoſe men that limit not their Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their ſtated hours, but muſt have them for the pleaſing of their voluptuous humor, and not only to fit them for their work, ſuch ſenſualiſts have need to ſtudy better the nature of Chriſtianity, and learn the danger of living after the fleſh, and get more morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſelf-denyal before they preach theſe things to others. If you muſt needs have your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, you ſhould not have put your ſelves into that calling that requireth you to make God and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice your pleaſure, and reſtraineth you ſo much from fleſhly pleaſures. Is it your baptiſmal engagement to fight againſt the fleſh? and do you know that much of the Chriſtian warfare conſiſteth in the combate between the fleſh and the ſpirit? and that is the very
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:99578:238"/>
difference between a true Chriſtian and a wicked wretch, that one liveth after the ſpirit, and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the deeds and deſires of the body, and the other liveth after the fleſh? and do you know that the overcoming the fleſh is the principal part of our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, on which the Crown of life depends; and do you make it your calling to preach all this to others; and yet for all this muſt you needs have your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? If you muſt, then for ſhame give over the preaching of the Goſpel, and the profeſſion of Chriſtian ſelf-denyal, and profeſs your ſelves to be as you are, and as you ſow to the fleſh, ſo of the fleſh ſhall you receive the wages of corruption. Doth ſuch a one as <hi>Paul</hi> ſay? <hi>I therfore ſo run, not as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly: ſo fight I, not as one that beateth the air: But I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection, leaſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt-away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 26, 27. And have not ſuch ſinners as <hi>we,</hi> need to do ſo? Shall we pamper our bodies, and give them their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in unneceſſary pleaſures, when <hi>Paul</hi> muſt keep under his body, and bring it into ſubjection? Muſt <hi>Paul</hi> do this, <hi>leaſt after all his preaching he ſhould be a caſt-away?</hi> and have not we cauſe to fear it of our ſelves much more? I know that ſome pleaſure it ſelf is lawful: that is, when it is of uſe to the fitting us for our work. But for a man to be ſo far in love with his pleaſures, as that he muſt unneceſſarily waſt his precious time in them, and neglect the great work of God for mens ſalvation, yea and plead for this as if it muſt or might be done, and ſo to juſtifie himſelf in ſuch a courſe, is a wickedneſs inconſiſtent with the common fidelity of a Chriſtian, much more with the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:99578:239"/>
fidelity of a Teacher of the Church: And ſuch wretches as are <hi>lovers of pleaſures, more then lovers of God,</hi> muſt look to beloved of him accordingly, and are fitter to be caſt out of Chriſtian Communion, then to be the chief in the Church for we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>from ſuch to turn away,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for a ſtudent, muſt be ſpecially for the exerciſe of his body, he having before him ſuch variety of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to his mind. And they muſt be as whetting is with the Mower, that is only to be uſed ſo far is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to his work. And we muſt be careful that it rob us not of our precious time, but be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narroweſt bounds that may be. I pray peruſe well Mr. <hi>Wheatley's</hi> Sermon of Redemption of time. 2. And then the labour that we are now engaged to perform, is not likely much to impair our health. Its true, it muſt be ſerious; but that will but excite and revive our ſpirits, and not ſo much ſpend them. Men can talk all the day long of other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters without any abatement of their health: and why may not we talk with men about their ſalvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch great abatement of ours?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is to be underſtood that the direction that we give, and the work which we undertake is not for dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, that be not able to preach or ſpeak, but for men of ſome competent meaſure of ſtrength, and whoſe weakneſſes are tollerable, and may admit of ſuch labours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What have we our time and ſtrength for, but to lay it out for God? What is a Candle made for, but to be burnt? Burnt and waſted we muſt be, and is it not fitter it ſhould be in lighting men to heaven, and in working for God, then in living to the fleſh?
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:99578:239"/>
How little difference is there between the pleaſure of a long life and of a ſhort, when they are both at an end? What comfort will it be at death, that you lengthened your life by ſhortening your work? He that works much; liveth much: Our life is to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to the ends and works of it, and not according to the meer duration. As <hi>Seneca</hi> can ſay of a drone, <hi>ibi jacet, non ibi vivit; &amp; diu fuit, non diu vixit:</hi> Will it not comfort us more at death to review a ſhort time faithfully ſpent, then a long time unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully?</p>

And for the matter of Viſitations and Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if they be for greater ends, or uſe, then our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial imployments are, you may break a Sabbath for them; you may forbear preaching for them, and ſo may forbear this private work; But if it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, how dare you make them a pretence to neglect ſo great a duty? Muſt God wait on your friends? What if they be Lords, or Knights, or Gentlemen? Muſt they be ſerved before God? Or is their diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or cenſure a greater hurt to you, then Gods diſpleaſure? Or dare you think, when God ſhall queſtion you for your neglects, to put him off with this excuſe, <hi>Lord I would have ſpent more of my time in ſeeking mens ſalvation, but that ſuch a Gentleman and ſuch a friend would have taken it ill if I had not waited on them.</hi> If you <hi>yet ſeek to pleaſe men, you are no longer the ſervants of Chriſt.</hi> He that dares ſpend his life in fleſh-pleaſing and man-pleaſing, is bolder then I am. And he that dares waſt his time in comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth little conſider what he hath to do with it. O that I could but improve my time according to my convictions of the neceſſity of improving it! He that
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:99578:240"/>
hath lookt death in the face as oft as I have done, I will not thank him to value his time. I profeſs I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at thoſe Miniſters that have time to ſpare, that that can hunt, or ſhoot, or bowl, or uſe the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations two or three hours, yea whole daies almoſt together, That can ſit an hour together in vain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; and ſpend whole daies in complemental vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations, and journeys to ſuch ends. Good Lord, what do theſe men think on! when ſo many ſouls about them cry for their help, and death gives no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite; and they know not how ſhort a time their people and they may be together? When the ſmalleſt Pariſh hath ſo much work that may imploy all their diligence night and day! Brethren, I hope you are content to be plainly dealt with. If you have no ſenſe of the worth of ſouls, and of the preciouſneſs of that blood that was ſhed for them, and of the glory that they are going to, and of the miſery that they are in danger of; then are you no Chriſtians, and therefore very unfit to be Miniſters: And if you have, how can you find time for needleſs recreations, viſitations or diſcourſes? Dare you like idle Goſsips, chat and trifle away your time, when you have ſuch works as theſe to do, and ſo many of them? O pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time! How ſwiftly doth it paſs away! How ſoon will it be gone! What are the 40 years of my life that are paſt! Were every day as long as a moneth, me thinks it were too ſhort for the work of a day! Have we not loſt enough already in the daies of our vanity? Never do I come to a dying man that is not utterly ſtupid, but he better ſees the worth of time! O then if they could call time back again, how loud would they call? If they could but buy
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:99578:240"/>
it, what would they give for it? And yet can we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to trifle it away! Yea and to allow our ſelves in this, and willfully caſt off the greateſt works of God! O what a befooling thing is ſin, that can thus diſtract men that ſeem ſo wiſe! Is it poſſible that a man of any true compaſſion and honeſty, or any care of his Miniſterial duty, or any ſenſe of the ſtrictneſs of his account, ſhould have time to ſpare for idleneſs and vanity?</p>
                  <p>And I muſt tell you further Brethren, that if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might take ſome time for meer delight which were not neceſſary, yet ſo cannot you; for your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking binds you to ſtricter attendance then other men are bound to. May a Phyſitian in the plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, take any more relaxation or reereation then is neceſſary for his life, when ſo many are expecting his help in a caſe of life and death! As his pleaſure is not worth mens lives, ſo neither is yours worth mens ſouls. Suppoſe your Cities were beſieged, and the enemy on one ſide watching all advantages to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize it, and on the other ſeeking to fire it with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes which are caſt in continually. I pray you tell me now, if certain men undertake it as their office to watch the ports, and others to quench the fire that ſhall be kindled in the houſes, what time will, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe men for their recreation or relaxation? When the City is in danger, or the fire will burn on and prevail if they intermit their diligence! Or would you excuſe one of theſe men if he come off his work, and ſay, I am but fleſh and blood, I muſt have ſome pleaſure or relaxation? At the utmoſt ſure you would allow him none but of neceſſity?</p>
                  <p>Do not grudge at this now and ſay, This is a hard
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:99578:241"/>
ſaying, who can bear it? For it is your mercy; and you are well, if you know when you are well, as I ſhall ſhew you in anſwering this next Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Of what uſe and weight the duty is, I have ſhewed before land how plainly it is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And do you think God doth not require you to do all the good you can? Will you ſtand by and ſee ſinners gaſping under the pangs of death, and ſay, God doth not require me to make my ſelf a drudge to ſave them? Is this the voice of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial or Chriſtian Compaſſion? or rather of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and diabolical cruelty I Doth God ſet you work to do, and will you not believe that he would have you do it? Is that the voice of obedience, or of rebellion? It is all one whether your fleſh do prevail with you to deny obedience to acknowledge duty, and ſay plainly I wil obey no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then it pleaſeth me. Or whether it may make you wilfully reject the evidence that ſhould convince you that it is a duty, and ſay I will not believe it to be my duty unleſs it pleaſe me. Its the true Character
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:99578:241"/>
of an hypocrite, to make a Religion to himſelf of the cheapeſt part of Gods ſervice, which will ſtand with his fleſhly ends and felicity; and to reject the reſt, which is inconſiſtent therewith. And to the words of Hypocriſie, this objection ſuperaddeth the words of groſs impiety. For what a wretched Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny is this againſt the moſt high God, to call his ſervice a ſlavery and drudgery! what thoughts have theſe men of their Maſter, their work and their wages? the thoughts of a believer or of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel; Are theſe men like to honour God, and promote his ſervice that have ſuch baſe thoughts of it themſeves? Do theſe men delight in Holineſs, that account it a ſlaviſh work? Do the believe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Miſery of ſinners, that account it ſuch a ſlavery to be diligent for to ſave them. Chriſt ſaith that he that denieth not himſelf and forſaketh not all and taketh not up his croſs and followeth him, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be his Diſciple. And theſe men count it a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to labour hard in his vineyard, and deny their eaſe, in a time when they have all accomodations and Encouragements? How far is this from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking all? and how can theſe men be fit for the Miniſtry that are ſuch enemies to ſelf-denyal, and ſo to true Chriſtianity? Still therefore I am forced to ſay, that all theſe Objections are ſo prevalent, and all theſe carnal reaſonings hinder the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in a word, hence is the chief miſery of the Church, <hi>that ſo many are made Miniſters before they are Chriſtians.</hi> If theſe men had ſeen the diligence of Chriſt in doing good, when he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his meat to talk with one woman, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. and when they had no time to eat bread, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 22.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:99578:242"/>
would not they have been of the mind of his carnal friends that went to lay hold on him, and ſaid, He is beſides himſelf, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. They would have told Chriſt he made a drudge or a ſlave of himſelf, and God did not require all this ado. If they had ſeen him all night in prayer, and all day in preaching and healing, it ſeems he ſhould have had this cenſure from them for his labour! I cannot but adviſe theſe men to ſearch their own hearts, whether they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly believe that word, that they preach? Do you believe indeed that ſuch Glory attends thoſe that dye in the Lord, and ſuch Torment attendeth thoſe that dye unconverted? If you do, how can you think any labour too much, for ſuch weighty ends? If you do not, ſay ſo, and get you out of the vine ard, and go with the Prodigal to keep ſwine, and undertake not the feeding of the Flock of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Do you not know that it is your own benefit which you grudge at? The more you do, the more you receive: the more you lay out, the more you have coming in: If you are ſtrangers to theſe Chriſtian Paradoxes, you ſhould not have taken on you to peach them to others. At the preſent, our incomes of ſpiritual life and peace are commonly in way of duty; ſo that he that is moſt in duty hath moſt of God: Exerciſe of Grace increaſeth it: And is it a ſlavery to be more with God, and to receive more him, then other men? It is the chief ſolace of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul to be doing Good, and receiving by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and to be much exerciſed about thoſe Divine things which have his heart. A good ſtomack will not ſay at a feaſt, what a ſlavery is it to beſtow my
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:99578:242"/>
time and pains ſo much to feed my ſelf? Beſides, that we prepare for fuller receivings hereafter: we ſet our Talents to uſury, and by improving them we ſhall make five become ten, and ſo be made Rulers of ten Cities. We ſhall be judged according to our works. Is it a drudgery to ſend to the utmoſt parts of the world, to exchange our trifles for Gold and Jewels? Do not theſe men ſeek to Juſtifie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, that make all diligent godlineſs a drudgery, and reproach it as a preciſe and tedious life, I ſay, they will never believe but a man may be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all this ado? Even ſo ſay theſe in reſpect to the works of the Miniſtry, They take this diligence for ungrateful tediouſneſs, and they will not believe but a man may be a faithful Miniſter without all this ado! It is a hainous ſin to be Negligent in ſo great a buſineſs: but to approve of that negligence, and ſo to be impenitent, and to plead againſt duty as if it were none, and when they ſhould lay out themſelves for the ſaving of ſouls, to ſay <hi>I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God requireth it;</hi> this is ſo great an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the ſin that (where the Churches Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity doth not force us to make uſe of ſuch, for want of better) I cannot but think them worthy to be caſt out as the rubbiſh, and <hi>as ſale that hath loſt its ſavour, that is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghil, but men caſt it out: he that hath ears to hear</hi> (ſaith Chriſt in theſe words) <hi>let him hear, Luke</hi> 14. 34. 35. And if ſuch Miniſters become a by-word and reproach, let them thank themſelves: for it is their own ſin that maketh them vile, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 13. And while they thus debaſe the ſervice of the Lord, they do but debaſe themſelves, and

He that made them, knew why he did it, and will expect the performance of them. Is infinite Goodneſs it ſelf to be queſtioned or ſuſpected by us, as making bad or unmerciful Laws? Nay it is meer mercy in him that impoſeth this great duty upon us? If Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be required to be as diligent in Hoſpitals or Peſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes or with other patients, to ſave their lives, were there not more mercy, then rigor in this Law? what, muſt God let the ſouls of your Neighbours periſh, to ſave you a little Labour and ſuffering: and this in mercy to you?

                  <p n="2">2. And for a ſupply of Paſtors, Chriſt will take care. He that impoſeth duty, hath the fulneſs of the Spirit, and can give men hearts to obey his Laws. Do you think Chriſt will ſuffer all men to

be as cruel, unmerciful, fleſhly and ſelf-ſeeking as you? He that hath undertaken himſelf the work of our Redemption, and born our tranſgreſſions, and been faithful as the chief Shepherd and Teacher of the Church, will not loſe all his Labour and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for want of Inſtruments to carry on his work, nor will he come down again to do all himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no other will do it: but he will provide men to be his Servants and Uſhers in his School that ſhall willingly take the labour on them, and rejoyce to be ſo imployed, and account that the happieſt life in the world which you account ſo great a toil, and would not change it for all your eaſe and carnal pleaſure, but for the ſaving of ſouls, and the propagating of the Goſpel of Chriſt, will be content to <hi>bear the burden and heat of the day, and to fill up the meaſure of the ſufferings of Chriſt in their bodies, and to do what they do with all their might, and to work while it is day, and to be the ſervants of all, and not to pleaſe themſelves but others for their Edification, and to become all things to all men that they may ſave ſome, and to endure all things for the elects ſake, and to ſpend and be ſpent for men, though the more they love, the leſs they ſhould be beloved, and ſhould be accounted their enemies for telling them the truth;</hi> ſuch <hi>Paſtors</hi> will Chriſt provide his people <hi>after his own heart, that will feed them with knowledge:</hi> as men that <hi>ſeek not theirs, but them.</hi> What, do you think Chriſt can have no ſervants, if ſuch as you ſhall with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas turn to the preſent world and forſake him?</hi> If you diſlike his ſervice, you may ſeek you a better where you can find it, and boaſt of your gain in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: but do not threaten him with the loſs of
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:99578:244"/>
your ſervice. He hath made ſuch Laws as you will call ſevere, for all that will be ſaved as well as for his Miniſters (though he impoſe not on them the ſame employment): for all muſt <hi>deny themſelves and mortifie the fleſh, and be crucified to the world, and take up their Croſs and follow Chriſt, that will be his Diſciples:</hi> And yet Chriſt will not be without Diſciples, nor will he hide his ſeeming hard terms from men to tice them to his ſervice, but will tell them of the worſt, and then let them come or chuſe: He will call to them before hand to count what it wil coſt them, and tell them <hi>that the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have neſts, but the ſon of man hath not where to lay his head;</hi> he comes <hi>not to give them worldly Pea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and</hi> Proſperity, but to call them to <hi>ſuffer with him that they may raign with him, and in patience to poſſeſs their ſouls,</hi> and conquer, that they may be crowned with him and ſit down on his throne. And all this he will cauſe his choſen to perform. If you be at that paſs with Chriſt as the <hi>Iſraelite:</hi> were once with <hi>David,</hi> and ſay <hi>will the ſon of</hi> Jeſſe <hi>give you fields and vineyard?

I would it were not too much long of Miniſters, that a great part of the people are ſo obſtinate and contemptuous? If we did ſhine and burn before them as we ſhould, had we convincing Sermons and convincing lives, did we ſet our ſelves to do all the good we could what ever it coſt us: Were we more humble and meek, more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and charitable, and let them ſee that we ſet light by all worldly things in compariſon of their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; much more might be done then is, and the mouthes of many would be ſlopt, and though ſtill the wicked will do wickedly, yet more would be tractable, and the wicked would be fewer and calmer then they are. If you ſay, that the ableſt and godlieſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the world have had as untractable and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pariſhoners as any others, I anſwer, that even
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:99578:245"/>
able godly men have ſome of them been too Lordly and ſtrange, and ſome of them too uncharitable and worldly, and backward to coſtly, though neceſſary works, and ſome of them have done but little in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, when they have done excellently in publike; and ſo have hindred the fruit of their labours. But where theſe impediments are abſent, experience tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us that the ſucceſs is much greater, at leaſt, as to the bowing of people to more calmneſs and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs: but we cannot expect that all ſhould be brought to ſo much reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

O Brethren write it on your ſtudy doors, or ſet it as your Copy in Capital letters ſtill before your eyes: Could we but well learn two or three lines of it, What preachers ſhould we be? 1. For our general buſineſs, [SERVING THE LORD WITH ALL HUMILITY OF MIND.] 2. Our ſpecial work, [TAKE HEED TO YOUR SELVES, AND TO ALL THE FLOCK.] 3. Our Doctrine, [REPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANCE TOWARDS GOD, AND FAITH TOWARD OUR LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST.] 4. The place and manner of Teaching, [I HAVE TAUGHT YOU PUBLIKELY, AND FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE.] 5. The Object, and internal manner, [I CEASED NOT TO WARN EVERY ONE NIGHT AND DAY WITH TEARS] This is it that muſt win ſouls and preſerve them. 6. His innocency and ſelf-denyal for the advantage of the Goſpel, [I HAVE COVETED NO MANS SILVER OR
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:99578:247"/>
GOLD.] 7. His patience, [NONE OF THESE THINGS MOVE ME, NEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER COUNT I MY LIFE DEAR.] 8. And among all our motives, theſe have need to be in Capital letters before our eyes. 1. We overſee and feed THE CHURCH OF GOD, WHICH HE HATH PURCHASED WITH HIS OWN BLOOD. 2. [GRIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOUS WOLVES SHALL ENTER IN AMONG YOU, NOT SPARING THE FLOCK] and [OF YOUR OWN SELVES SHALL MEN ARISE SPEAKING PERVERSE THINGS, TO DRAW AWAY DISCIPLES AF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER THEM.] Write all this upon your hearts, and it will do your ſelves and the Church more good, then twenty years ſtudy of thoſe lower things, which though they get you greater applauſe in the world, yet ſeparated from theſe, will make you but ſounding braſs, and tinkling Cymbals.</p>
                  <p>The great advantage of a ſincere heart is, that God and Glory, and the ſaving of ſouls are their very <hi>end:</hi> and where that <hi>end</hi> is truly intended, no labour or ſuffering will ſtop them, or turn them back. For a man muſt have his <hi>end,</hi> whatever it coſt him: He ſtill retains this leſſon, whatever he forget, [ONE THING IS NECESSARY] and <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God,</hi> and therefore ſaies, <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon me, and wo unto me if I preach not the Goſpel.</hi> And this is it that will moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually make eaſie all our labours, and make light all burdens, and make our ſufferings ſeem tollerable, and cauſe us to venture on any hazards in the way.
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:99578:248"/>
That which I once made the Motto of my colours in another warfare, I deſire may be ſtill before my eyes in this, (which yet according to my intentions, is not altogether another.) On one ſide, <hi>He that ſaveth his life ſhall loſe it.</hi> On the other, <hi>Nic propter vitam vivendi perdere cauſas;</hi> Which Doctor <hi>Io. Reignolds</hi> thought had reaſon enough in it, to hold him to his labours though it coſt him his life. He that knoweth that he ſerveth a God that will never ſuffer any man to be a loſer by him, need not fear what hazards he runs in his cauſe: And he that knows that he ſeeks a prize, which if obtained will infinitely over-match his coſt, may boldly engage his whole eſtate on it, and ſell all to purchaſe ſo rich a Pearl. Well Brethren, I will ſpend no more words in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting wiſe Merchants to ſuch a bargain, nor telling Teachers themſelves of ſuch common Truths; and If I have ſaid more then needs already, I am glad. I hope now I may take it for granted, that you are Reſolved of the utmoſt diligence and fidelity in the work. On which ſuppoſition I ſhall now proceed.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſo happy a work which we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, that it is a thouſand pities it ſhould be deſtroyed in the birth, and periſh in our hands. And though I know that we have a knotty generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deal with, and that its paſt the power of any of us all to change a carnal heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the effectual grace of the Holy-Ghoſt; yet it is ſo uſual with God to work by means, and to bleſs the right endeavors of his ſervants, that I cannot fear,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:99578:249"/>
but great things will be done, and a wonderful blow will be given to the Kingdom of Darkneſs by our undertaken work, if it do not miſcarry through the fault of the Miniſters themſelves. And the main dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is in theſe two defects. 1. Of diligence. 2. Of skill. Againſt the former I have ſpoken much alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. As for the later, I am ſo conſcious of my own unskilfulneſs, that I am far from imagining that I am fit to give directions to any but the younger, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced of the Miniſtry; and therefore muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſo much Juſtice in your interpretation, as that you will ſuppoſe me now to ſpeak to none but ſuch. But yet ſomething I ſhall ſay, and not paſs over this part in ſilence, becauſe the number of ſuch is ſo great, and I am ſo apprehenſive that the welfare of the Church and Nation, doth much depend on the management of this work.</p>
               <p>The points wherein you have need to be ſolicitous are theſe two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To bring your people to ſubmit to this courſe of private Catechizing or Inſtruction. For if they will not come at you, what good can they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To do the work ſo as may moſt tend to the ſucceſs of it, when they do come to you.</p>
               <p>And for the firſt, the beſt directions that I can give are theſe following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The chief means of all is, for a Miniſter ſo to behave himſelf in the main courſe of his Miniſtry and life, as may tend to convince his people of his ability, ſincerity and unfeigned Love to them. For if they take him to be ignorant, they will deſpiſe his Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and think themſelves as wiſe as he. And if they
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:99578:249"/>
think him ſelf-ſeeking, or hypocritical, and one that doth not mean as he ſaith, they will ſuſpect all that he ſaith and doth for them, and will not be regardful of him. And if they think he intendeth but to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer over their conſciences, and to trouble and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them, or meerly to exerciſe their wits and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, they will flie away from him as an adverſary, and from his endeavours as noxious and ungrateful to them. Whereas when they are convinced that he underſtandeth what he doth, and have high thoughts of his abilities, they will Reverence him, and the eaſilyer ſtoop to his advice. And when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of his uprightneſs, they will the leſs ſuſpect his motions: And when they perceive that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth no private ends of his own, but meerly their good, they will the ſooner be perſwaded by him. And becauſe thoſe that I write to are ſuppoſed to be none of the moſt able Miniſters, and therefore may deſpair of being reverenced for their parts; I ſay to ſuch;</p>
               <p n="1">1. You have the more need to ſtudy and labour for their increaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt neceſſarily have that which <hi>Ameſius</hi> makes the loweſt degree tollerable, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>ſupra vulgus fidelium:</hi> and it will produce ſome reverence when they know you are wiſer then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that which you want in ability, muſt be made up in the other qualifications; and then your advice may be as ſucceſsful as others.</p>
               <p>If Miniſters were content to purchaſe an intereſt in their people at the deareſt rates to their own fleſh, and would condeſcend to them, and be familiar, and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:99578:250"/>
loving, and prudent in their carriage, and abound ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ability in good works, they might do much more with their people then ordinarily they can do. Not that we ſhould much regard an intereſt in them for our own ſakes, but that we may be more capable of promoting the intereſt of Chriſt, and of furthering their own ſalvation: Were it not for their own ſakes, it were no great matter whether they love or hate us: but what Commander can do any great ſervice by an Army that hate him? and how can we think that they will much regard our counſel, while they abhor or diſ-regard the perſons that give it them? Labour therefore for ſome competent intereſt in your peoples eſtimation and affection, and then you may the better prevail with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But what ſhould a Miniſter do that findeth he hath quite loſt his intereſt in them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> If they be ſo vile a people that they hate him not for any weakneſs, nor through miſ-reports about par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular things, but meerly for endeavouring their good, though in prudence as well as zeal, and would hate any other that ſhould do his duty; then muſt he in patience and meekneſs continue to inſtruct theſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth. But if it be upon any weakneſſes of his, or difference in leſſer opinions, or prejudice meerly againſt his own perſon, let him try firſt to remove the prejudice by all lawful means; and if he cannot, let him tell them, It is not for my ſelf, but for you that I labour: and therefore ſeeing that you will not obey the word from me, I deſire that you will agree to accept of ſome other that may do you that good,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:99578:250"/>
which I cannot:] and ſo leave them, and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther another man may not be fitter for them, and he fitter for another people: For an ingenious man can hardly ſtay with a people againſt their wills; and a ſincere man can more hardly for any Commodity of his own, remain in a place where he is like to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, to hinder the good which they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from another man, who hath the advantage of a greater intereſt in their eſtimation and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſing then this general preparation, the next thing to be done is, To uſe the moſt effectual means to convince them of the Benefit and Neceſſity of this courſe, to their own ſouls. The way to win the conſent of any man to any thing that you offer, is to prove it to be good for him, and to do this in Evidence that hath ſome fitneſs and proportion with his own underſtanding: For if you cannot make him believe that it is Good or Neceſſary for him, he will never let it down, but ſpit it out with loathing or contempt. You muſt therefore preach to them ſome effectual convincing Sermons to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe beforehand; which ſhall fully ſhew them the Benefit and Neceſſity of Knowledge of Divine truths in General, and of Knowing the Principles in ſpecial, and that the Aged have the ſame duty and need as others, and in ſome reſpects much more: <hi>E. G.</hi> from <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. which affordeth us many obſervations ſuitable to our preſent buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="418" facs="tcp:99578:251"/>
As 1. That Gods Oracles muſt be a mans Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Minſters muſt teach theſe, and people muſt learn them of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Oracles of God have ſome Principle; or fundamentals that all muſt know, that will be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe Principles muſt be firſt learned: thats the right order.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It may be well expected that people thrive in knowledge according to the means or teaching which they profeſs: and if they do not, it is their great ſin.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If any lived long in the Church under the means of knowledge, and yet be ignorant of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he hath need to be taught them yet, (how old ſoever he be). All this is plain from the Text: Whence we have fair opportunity by twenty clear convincing Reaſons to ſhew them; 1. The Neceſſity of knowing Gods Oracles. 2. And more eſpecially of the Principles. And 3. eſpecially for the aged, that have ſinfully loſt ſo much time already; that have ſo long promiſed to repent when they were old; that ſhould be teachers to the younger, whoſe ignorance is a double ſin and ſhame; who have ſo little time to learn in, and are ſo near their Judgement; and who have ſouls to ſave or loſe as well as others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Convince them how impoſſible it is to go the way to heaven without knowing it, when there are ſo many difficulties and enemies in our way? and when men cannot do their worldly buſineſs without knowledge, nor learn a trade without an apprentiſhip? Who can love, or ſeek, or deſire that which he knoweth not?
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:99578:251"/>
Convince them what a contradiction it is to be a Chriſtian, and yet to refuſe to learn; For what is a Chriſtian but a Diſciple of Chriſt? and how can he be his Diſciple, that refuſeth to be taught by him? and he that refuſeth to be taught by his Miniſters, refuſeth to be taught by him: for Chriſt will not come down from heaven again to teach them by his own mouth, but hath appointed his Miniſters to keep School and teach them under him: To ſay therefore that they will not be taught by his Miniſters, is to ſay, they will not be taught by Chriſt, and that is to ſay, they will be none of his Diſciples, or no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Abundance of ſuch undenyable Evidences, we have at hand to convince them of their duty. Make them underſtand that it is not an arbitrary buſineſs of our own deviſing and impoſing, but Neceſſity is laid upon us, and if we look not to every member of the flock according to our power, they may periſh in their own iniquities, but their blood will be required at our hands: It is God and not we, that is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver and impoſer of the work: therefore they blame God, more then us in accuſing it: Would they be ſo cruel as to wiſh a Miniſter to caſt away his own ſoul knowingly and wilfully, for fear of troubling them in hindering their damnation? eſpecially ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them fully with the true nature of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial office, and the Churches neceſſity of it: how it conſiſteth in Teaching and Guiding all the Flock; and that as they muſt come to the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as Scholars to School; ſo muſt they be content to give account of their learning, and to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted man by man.</p>
                  <p>Let them know what a tendency this hath to their
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:99578:252"/>
ſalvation; What a profitable improvement it will be of their time? And how much vanity and evil it will prevent? And when they once find that it is for their own good, they will the eaſilyer yield to it.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="3">3. VVHen this is done, it will be very neceſſary that according to our Agreement, we give one of the Catechiſms to every family in the Pariſh, poor and rich, that ſo they might be ſo far without excuſe: For if you leave it to themſelves, perhaps half of them will not ſo much as get them: Whereas, when they have them put into their hands, the receiving is a kind of engagement to learn them: and if they do but read the exhortation (as its likely they will do) it will perhaps convince them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to ſubmit. And for the delivery of them, the beſt way is, for the Miniſter firſt to give notice in the Congregation, that they ſhall be brought to their houſes, and then to go himſelf from houſe to houſe and deliver them, and take the opportunity of perſwading them to the work; and as they go, to take a Catalogue of all the perſons at years of diſcretion in the ſeveral families, that they may know whom they have to take care of, and inſtruct, and whom to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect when it cometh to their turns. I have formerly in the diſtributing of ſome other Books among them, deſired every family to fetch them; but I found more confuſion and uncertainty in that way, and now took this as the better. But in ſmall Pariſhes, either way may ſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="421" facs="tcp:99578:252"/>
And for the charge of the Books, if the Miniſter be able, it will be well for him to bear it: If not, the beſt affected of his people of the richer ſort ſhould bear it among them. Or at a day of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in preparation to the work, let the Collection that is wont to be for the poor, be imployed to buy the Catechiſms, and the people be deſired to be the more liberal, and what is wanting, the well-affected to the work may make it up.</p>
                  <p>And for the order of proceeding in ſmall Pariſhes, the matter is not great, but in greater it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that we take them in order family by family, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the execution a moneth or ſix weeks after the delivery of the Books, that they may have time to learn. And thus taking them together in common, they will the more willingly come, and the backward will be the more aſhamed to keep off.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="4">4. BEſure that you deal gently with them; and take off all diſcouragements as effectually as you can. 1. Tell them publikely, that if they have learnt any other Catechiſm already, you will not urge them to learn this, unleſs they deſire it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For the ſubſtance of all Catechiſms (that are Orthodox) is the ſame: Only our reaſons for offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them this, was the brevity and fulneſs; that we might give them as much as we could in a few words, and ſo make their work more eaſie. Or if any of them had yet rather learn any other (Orthodox) Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, let them have their choice.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="422" facs="tcp:99578:253"/>
2. As for the old people that are of weak memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and not like to live in the world, and complain that they cannot remember the words, tell them that you expect not that they ſhould overmuch perplex their minds about it, but hear it oft read over, and ſee that they underſtand it, and get the matter into their minds and hearts, and then they may be born with, though they remember not the words.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And let your dealing with thoſe that you begin with be ſo gentle, convincing and winning, that the report of it may be an encouragement to others to come.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="6">6. IF all this will not ſerve to bring any particular perſons to ſubmit, do not ſo caſt them off, but go to them and expoſtulate the caſe with them, and know what their reaſons are, and convince them of the ſinfulneſs and danger of their contempt of the help that is offered them. A ſoul is ſo precious that we ſhould not loſe one for want of labour, but follow them while there is any hope, and not give them up as deſperate, till there be no remedy. Before we give them over as dogs or ſwine let us try the utmoſt, that we may have the experience of their obſtinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or renting us, to warrant our forſaking them: Charity beareth and waiteth long.</p>

               <p n="2">2. HAving uſed theſe means to procure them to come in and ſubmit to your teaching, the next thing to be conſidered is, how you ſhould deal moſt effectually with them in the work; And again I muſt ſay, that I think it an eaſier matter by far, to compoſe and preach a good Sermon, then to deal rightly with an Ignorant man for his inſtruction in the Neceſſary Principles of Religion. As much as this work is contemned by ſome, I doubt not but it will try the parts and ſpirits of Miniſters, and ſhew you the difference between one man and another, more fully then Pulpit-preaching will do. And here I ſhall as fitting to my purpoſe; tranſcribe the words of a moſt Learned, Orthodox and godly man, Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> in his Sermon before King <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

(but Impreſ. 3. pag. 34, 35.) <q>Your Majeſties care can never be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently commended, in taking order that the chief heads of the Catechiſm ſhould in the ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry be diligently propounded and explained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people throughout the Land. Which I wiſh were as duely executed every where, as it was pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly by you intended. Great Scholars poſſibly may think, that it ſtandeth not ſo well with their credit, to ſtoop thus low, and to ſpend ſo much of their time, in teaching theſe rudiments and firſt principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt. But they ſhould conſider that the laying of the foundation
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:99578:254"/>
skillfully, as it is the matter of greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the whole building; ſo is it the very Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece of the wiſeſt builder; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wiſe Maſter-builder I have laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſaith the great Apoſtle. And let the learnedſt of us all try it when ever we pleaſe, we ſhall find that to lay this ground-work rightly (that is, to apply our ſelves to the capacity of the common Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to make an Ignorant man to underſtand theſe myſteries in ſome good meaſure) will put us to the tryal of our skill, and trouble us a great deal more, then if we were to diſcuſs a Controverſie, or handle a ſubtile point of learning in the Schools. Yet Chriſt did give as well his Apoſtles, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Evangeliſts, as his ordinary Paſtors and Teachers to bring us all both learned and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unto the Unity of this faith and knowledge: and the neglecting of this, is the fruſtrating of the whole work of the Miniſtery. For let us preach never ſo many Sermons to the people, our labour is but loſt as long as the foundation is unlaid; and the firſt principles untaught, upon which all other Doctrine muſt be builded.</q>

the world will not be got without greater trouble]</q> This, ſome of this, or ſomewhat to this purpoſe may tend to make them more willing to hear you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtruction, or give you an account of their knowledge or practice, which muſt be the work of the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. When you have (to ſpare time) ſpoken thus to them, all, take then the perſons one by one, and deal with them as far as you can in private, out of the hearing of the reſt; For ſome cannot ſpeak freely before others, and ſome will not endure to be queſtioned before others, becauſe they think that it tendeth to their ſhame, to have others hear their anſwers; and ſome perſons that can make better anſwers themſelves will be ready when they are gone to twattle of what they heard, and to diſgrace thoſe that ſpeak not ſo well as they; and ſo people will be diſcouraged, and backward perſons will have pretences to forbear and forſake the work, and ſay, they wil not come to be made a ſcorn or a laughing ſtock. You muſt therefore be very prudent to prevent all theſe inconveniences. But the main reaſon is, as I find by experience, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will better take plain cloſe dealing about their ſin and miſery and duty when you have them alone then they will before others; And if you have not opportunity to ſet it home and deal freely with them, you will fruſtrate all. If therefore you have convenient place, let the reſt ſtay in one room, while you confer with each perſon by themſelves in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther room, Only for the neceſſary avoiding of ſcandal, we muſt ſpeak to the women, only in the preſence of ſome others; and if we do loſe ſome
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:99578:255"/>
advantage by it of the ſucceſs of our inſtructions, there is no remedy: Its better do ſo, then by giving matter of reproach to the malicious, to deſtroy all the work. Yet we may ſo contrive it, that though ſome other be in the room, yet what paſſages are leſs fit for others obſervance, may be ſpoken <hi>ſubmiſſâ voce</hi> that others may be no hearers of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may be placed at the remoteſt part of the room. Or at leaſt let none be preſent but the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame family, that be more familiar, and not ſo likely to reproach one another. And then, in your moſt rouzing examinations and reproofs, deal moſt with the moſt ignorant, and ſecure and vicious, that you may have the clearer ground for your cloſeſt dealing, and the hearing of it may awaken the ſtanders by, to whom you ſeem not ſo directly to apply it. Theſe ſmall things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve obſervance, becauſe they be in order to a work that is not ſmall: and ſmall errors may hinder a great deal of good.</p>

And if they are able to recite but a little or none of it, try whether they can rehearſe the Creed, and the Decalogue.</p>

                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. Then chooſe out ſome of the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt points, and try by further Queſtions how they underſtand them. And therein be careful of theſe things following. 1. That you do not begin with leſs neceſſary points, but theſe which themſelves may perceive are of neareſt concernment to them. As, <hi>E. G.</hi> 
                  <q>[What do you think becomes of men
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:99578:256"/>
when they are dead? [What ſhall become of us after the end of this world? Do you believe that you have any ſin? Or that you were born with ſin? And what doth every ſin deſerve? What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy hath God provided for the ſaving of ſinful miſerable ſouls? Hath any one ſuffered for our ſins in our ſtead, or muſt we ſuffer for them our ſelves? Who be they that God will pardon? and who ſhall be ſaved by the blood of Chriſt? What change muſt be made on all that ſhall be ſaved? and how is it made? Where is our chief Happineſs? and what is it that our hearts muſt be moſt ſet upon?]</q> with ſuch like as theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of asking them nice or needleſs or doubtful and very difficult queſtions, though about thoſe matters that are of greateſt weight in themſelves. Specially be very cautelous how you put them upon definitions or deſcriptions. Some ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited men will be as buſie with ſuch queſtions which they cannot anſwer themſelves, and as cenſorious of the poor people that cannot anſwer them, as if life and death did certainly depend on them. You will ask them perhaps <hi>What is God?</hi> and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective an anſwer muſt you make your ſelves? ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be the <hi>Quid,</hi> and not the <hi>Qualis</hi> that you mean. You may tell what he is not, ſooner then what he is. If you ask <hi>What is faith?</hi> Or <hi>what is Repentance?</hi> how ſorrily would many very learned Divines anſwer you? Or elſe they would not be at ſo great difference among themſelves about them not only <hi>diſagreeing</hi> about the Definitions of them, but ſo <hi>widely diſagreeing.</hi> If you ask them <hi>what is</hi>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:99578:256"/>
                  <hi>Forgiveneſs of ſin?</hi> how many Miniſters may you ask before you have a right anſwer? Or elſe they would not be ſo diſagreed in the point? Much more may I ſay ſo about Juſtification (though perhaps the ſame thing with Remiſſion) ſo if you ask them <hi>what Regeneration is? What Sanctification is?</hi> Why Divines be not agreed, what they are themſelves? But you will ſay perhaps, <hi>If men know not what God is; what Faith, Repentance, Converſion, Sanctification, and Pardon of ſin, or Juſtification be, how can they be true Chriſtians and be ſaved?</hi> I anſwer. It's one thing to know exactly what they be, and another thing to know them in the nature of them in the main, though with a more general, indiſtinct and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted knowledge: and its one thing to <hi>know</hi> and another thing to <hi>tell</hi> what this or that is. The very Name as Commonly uſed doth ſignifie to them and expreſs from them the thing without a Definition: and they partly underſtand what that Name ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, when they cannot tell it you in other words. As they know what it is to <hi>Believe,</hi> to <hi>Repent,</hi> to be <hi>forgiven;</hi> by cuſtom of ſpeech they know what theſe mean, and yet cannot define them, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps put you off with the Countrey anſwer. To Repent is, to Repent; and to be forgiven is, to be forgiven, or if they can ſay, It is to be pardoned, it is fair. Yet do I not abſolutely diſſwade you from the uſe of ſuch queſtions; but do it caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, in caſe you ſuſpect ſome groſs Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in the point: ſpecially about God him ſelf. And (which is the next part of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. In ſuch a Caſe, ſo contrive the predicate into
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:99578:257"/>
your Queſtion that they may perceive what you mean, and that it is not a nice Definition, but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſolution that you expect, and look not after words but things, and there leave them to a bare <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay,</hi> or the meer elocution of one of the two deſcriptions which your ſelf ſhall propound. As <hi>E. G.</hi> 
                  <q>What is God? is he made of fleſh and blood as we are? or is he an inviſible ſpirit? Is he a man or is he not? Had he any beginning? Can he dye? what is faith? Is it a Believing all the word of God? what is it to Believe in Chriſt? Is it all one as to become a true Chriſtian? Or to believe that Chriſt is the Saviour of the world, and to Accept him for your Saviour to pardon, teach, govern and glorifie you? What is Repentance? Is it only to be ſorry for ſin, or is it, The change of  the mind from ſin to God, or both?</q> 
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And as you muſt do thus when you come to hard points as Definitions or the like, ſo in all points where you perceive that they underſtand not the meaning and ſtreſs of your queſtion? there you muſt firſt draw out their anſwer by an Equipollent or expoſitory queſtion, or if that will not do, thus frame the anſwer into your queſtion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand but his <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay:</hi> yea if it be never ſo eaſie a point that you are upon, you muſt do thus at laſt in caſe by the firſt queſtion you have an unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory anſwer. <hi>E. G.</hi> I have oft asked ſome very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, <hi>How do you think of your ſins, ſo many and great ſins ſhall be pardoned?</hi> And they tell me <hi>by their Repenting and mending their lives;</hi> and never mention Jeſus Chriſt. I ask them further, <hi>But do you think that your amendment can make God</hi>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:99578:257"/>
                  <hi>any amendt or ſatisfaction for the ſin that is paſt?</hi> They will anſwer <hi>we hope ſo, or elſe we know not what will?</hi> A man would think now that theſe men had no knowledge of Chriſt at all, in that they make no mention of him; And ſome I find have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed none and when I tell them over the hiſtory of the Goſpel, and what Chriſt is, did and ſuffered and why, they ſtand wondering at it as a ſtrange thing that they had never heard before; and ſome ſay; They never heard this much before, nor knew it, though they came to Church every Lords day. But ſome I perceive do give ſuch anſwers, becauſe they underſtand not the ſcope of my queſtion; but think that I take Chriſts death as granted, and only ask them what ſhall make God ſatisfaction as their part under Chriſt (Though thus alſo they diſcover ſad ignorance.) And when I ask them whether their deeds can Merit any thing of God? they ſay No; but they hope God will accept them. And if I ask further <hi>Can you be ſaved without the death of that?</hi> they ſay, No; And if I ask <hi>what hath he done or ſuffered for you?</hi> They will ſay He dyed for us; or ſhed his blood for us: and will profeſs that they place their confidence in that for ſalvation. Many men have that in their minds, which is not ripe for utterance; and through ill education and diſuſe, they are ſtrangers to the expreſſions of thoſe things which they have ſome Conceptions of. And, by the way you may here ſee the cauſe to deal very tenderly with the common people for matter of knowledge and defect of expreſſion; if they are are teachable, and tractable, and willing to uſe means, and to live obediently: For many even
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:99578:258"/>
ancient godly perſons cannot ſpeak their minds in any tolerable expreſſions: no nor cannot learn when expreſſions are put into their mouths. Some of the moſt pious experienced, approved Chriſtians that I know (aged people) complain exceedingly to me with tears that they cannot learn the words of the Catechiſm, and when I conſider their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that they have lived under the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent helps, in conſtant duty, and in the beſt company for fourty or fifty or ſixty years together, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me what to expect from poor ignorant people that never had ſuch company and converſe for one year or week: and not to reject them ſo haſtily as ſome hot and too high profeſſors would have us do. But this is on the by.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This alſo muſt be obſerved, that if you find them at a loſs, and unable to anſwer your queſtions, drive them not on too hard or too long with queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after queſtion, leſt they conceive you intend but to puzzle them and diſgrace them: but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when you perceive them troubled that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer, then ſtep in your ſelf and take the burden off them, &amp; make anſwer to the queſtion your ſelves; and then do it throughly and plainly, and make a full explication of the whole buſineſs to them, that by your Teaching they may be brought to underſtand it before you leave them. And herein it is comonly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that you fetch up the matter <hi>ab origine,</hi> &amp; take it on in order till you come to the point in queſtion.</p>

When you have done what you ſee Cauſe in the trial of their knowledge, proceed next to inſtruct them your ſelves: And this muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral Capacities. If it be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor that underſtandeth the Fundamentals, fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomewhat which you perceive that he moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, either explaining further ſome of the myſteries of the Goſpel, or laying the Grounds of ſome duty which he may doubt of, or ſhewing the neceſsity of what he neglecteth, or meeting with his ſins or miſtakes, as may be moſt convincing and edifying to him. If it be one that is groſly ignorant, give him a plain familiar recital of the ſum of the Chriſtian Religion in a few words: for though it be in the Catechiſm already yet a more familiar way may better help them to underſtand it. As thus <q>[You muſt know, that from Everlaſting there was one only God that had no beginning, and can have no end, who is not a Body as we are, but a moſt pure, ſpiritual Being that knoweth all things, and can do all things, and hath all Goodneſs and Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in himſelf. This God is but one, but yet three Perſons, the Father, the Son and holy Ghoſt in an incomprehenſible manner, above our reach; yet we have ſomewhat in our ſelves and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that may give us ſome reſemblance of it. As in a man, his Power and his underſtanding and will, be but One ſoul, and yet they are not one faculty, but differ one from another: Or as in the Sun, the Being or Power, and the Heat and the Light, are not all one; and yet there is but one Sun; ſo in a more incomprehenſible manner it is in God. And you muſt know that this One God did
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:99578:259"/>
make all the world by his word; the heavens he made to be the place of his Glory, and made a world of holy Angels to ſerve him, in his Glory: but ſome of theſe did by Pride or other ſin fall from God and are become Devils that ſhall be miſerable in torments for ever, when he had made the reſt of this lower world, he made man, as his nobleſt creature here, even one man and one woman <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and he made them perfect without any ſin or fault, and put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gardan of <hi>Eden,</hi> and forbad them to eat but of one tree in the garden, and told them that if they did, they ſhould dye. But the Devil that had firſt fallen himſelf did tempt them to ſin, and they yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his temptation, and by wilful ſinning they fell under the curſe of Gods Law, and fell ſhort of the Glory of God. But God of his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Mercy did ſend his own ſon Jeſus Chriſt to be their Redeemer, who as he was promiſed in the beginning, ſo in the fulneſs of time 1655. years ago was made man, and was born of a Virgin by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, and lived on earth among the Jews about 33 years, and he preached the Goſpel himſelf and wrought many miracles to prove his doctrine, and bring men to believe in him, healing the lame, the blind, the ſick, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the dead by the word of his mouth by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power; &amp; at the end by the malice of the Jews, &amp; his own Conſent he was offered upon the Croſs, as a ſacrifice for our ſins, to bear that Curſe that we ſhould have born; and when he was buryed, he roſe again the third day, and lived on earth forty dayes after: And before his departure he ſent his
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:99578:259"/>
Apoſtles and other Miniſters to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of ſalvation to the world, and to call home loſt ſinners by Repentance, and to aſſure them in his Name, that if they will but believe in him and take him for their Saviour, and unfeignedly lament their former ſins, and turn from them to God, and will take Everlaſting Glory for their portion, and be content to reſign their carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and deſires, he will pardon freely all that is paſt, and be merciful to them for the time to come, and will lead them up into ſpiritual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and bring them to his Glory when this life is Ended, but for them that make light of their ſins and of his Mercy, and will not forſake the pleaſures of this world for the hopes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſhall be condemned to everlaſting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. This Goſpel Chriſt hath appointed his Miniſters to preach to all the world; and when he had given this in charge to his Apoſtles, he aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into heaven before their faces, where he is now in Glory with God the Father in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ruling all: And at the end of this world, he will come again in that nature, and will call the dead to life again, and ſet them all before him to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and all that truly Repented and believed in him and were renewed by his ſpirit, and renounced this world for the hopes of a better ſhall be judged to live with God in Glory, and ſhall be like to his Angels, and praiſe him for ever; and the reſt that repented not, and believed not in him, but lived to the fleſh and the world, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to everlaſting miſery.

Did you ever find the ſpirit of God by the word, come in upon your underſtanding, with a new heavenly life, which hath made you a new creature? The Lord that ſeeth your heart doth know whether it be ſo or not? Therefore I pray you, ſee that you ſpeak the truth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If he tell you, that he hopes he is converted; all are ſinners; but he is ſorry for his ſins, or the like; then tell him more particularly in a few words of the plaineſt notes, or by a ſhort deſcription, what true converſion is, and ſo renew and enforce the enquiry: as thus: <q>Becauſe your ſalvation or damnation ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon it, I would fain help you a little in this, that you may not be miſtaken in a buſineſs of ſuch conſequence, but may find out the truth before it be too late: for as God will judge us impartially, ſo we have his word before us, by which we may know, now, how God will judge us, then: for this

word tells us moſt certainly who they be that ſhall go to heaven, and who to hell. Now the Scripture tells us that the ſtate of an unconverted man is this; He ſeeth no great matter of felicity in the Love and Communion of God in the life to come, which may draw his heart thither from this preſent world, but he liveth to his carnal ſelf, or to the fleſh, and the main bent of his life is, that it may go well with his body here, and that religion that he hath is but a little on the by, leſt he ſhould be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned when he can keep the world no longer; ſo that the world and fleſh are higheſt in his eſteem, and neareſt to his heart, and God and Glory ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them and further off, and all their ſervice of God is but a giving them that which the world and fleſh can ſpare. This is the true caſe of every unconverted man; and all that are in this caſe, are in a ſtate of miſery. But he that is truly converted, hath had a light ſhining into his ſoul from God, which hath ſhewed him the greatneſs of his ſin and miſery, and made it a heavy load upon his ſoul, and ſhewed him what Chriſt is and hath done for ſinners, and made him admire at the riches of Gods grace in him! O what glad news is it to him, that yet there is hope for ſuch loſt ſinners as he; That ſo many and ſo great ſins may be pardoned! and that this is offered to all that will accept it! How glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he entertain this Meſſage and offer? And for the time to come, he reſigneth himſelf and all that he hath to Chriſt to be wholly his, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by him, in order to the everlaſting glory which he hath promiſed: He hath now ſuch a ſight of the bleſſed ſtate of the Saints in glory, that
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:99578:261"/>
he deſpiſeth all this world as droſs and dung in compariſon of it, and there he layeth up his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and his hopes, and takes all the matters of this life but as ſo many helps or hindrances in the way to that: ſo that the very bent and main care and buſineſs of his life is to be happy in the life to come. This is the caſe of all that are truly converted, and ſhall be ſaved. Is this your caſe, or not? Have you found ſuch a change or work as this upon your ſoul?</q> If he ſay, he hopes, he hath, deſcend to ſome particulars diſtinctly. <hi>E. G.</hi> 
                  <q>I pray you then anſwer me to theſe two or three queſtions. 1.

Can you truly ſay, that your heart is ſo far turned from your former ſins, that you hate the ſins that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly you loved, and love that holy life that you had no mind to before, and that you do not now live in the willful practiſe of any known ſin: Is there no ſin which you be not heartily willing to leave whatever it coſt you? And no duty which you be not willing to perform? 3. Can you truly ſay, that you have ſo far taken the everlaſting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of God for your happineſs, that it hath the moſt of your heart, of your love, deſire, and care: and that you are reſolved by the ſtrength of grace to let go all that you have in the world rather then hazard it; and that it is your daily principal
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:99578:262"/>
buſineſs to ſeek it? Can you truly ſay, that though you have your failings and ſins, yet your main care and the bent of your whole life is to pleaſe God and enjoy him for ever, and that you give the world Gods leavings, as it were, and not God the worlds leavings, and that your worldly buſineſs is but as a travellers ſeeking for proviſion in his jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and heaven is the place that you take for your home.</q>

And therefore deſire him to ſee that it be ſo indeed.

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:99578:262"/>
ful friend, if I ſhould daub with you, and not tell you the truth: If you ſought to a Phyſitian in your ſickneſs, you would have him tell you the truth, though it were the worſt: Much more here; For, there the knowledge of your diſeaſe may by fears increaſe it, but here you muſt know it, or elſe you can never be recovered from it. I much fear that you are yet a ſtranger to the new life of all them that Chriſt will ſave: For if you were a Chriſtian indeed and truly converted, your very heart would have been ſet on God and the life to come, and you would have admired the riches of grace in Chriſt, and you would have made it your buſineſs to prepare for Everlaſting; and you durſt not, you would not, live in any wilful ſin, nor in the neglect of ſuch duties! Alas! what have you done? how have you ſpent your time till now? Did you not know, that you had a ſoul to ſave or loſe? and that you muſt live in heaven or hell for ever! and that you had your life and time in this world for that purpoſe, to prepare for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! Alas! what have you been doing all this while that you are ſo ignorant, or ſo unprepared for death if it ſhould now find you? If you had but had as much mind of heaven as of earth, you would have known more of it, and done more of it, and enquired more diligently after it, then you have done! You can learn how to do your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the world, and why could you not have learned more of the will of God, if you had but minded it. You have neighbours that could learn more, that have had as much to do in the world as you, and as little time? Do you think that heaven
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:99578:263"/>
is not worth your labour? or that its like it can be had without any care or pains? when you cannot have the trifles of this world without? and when God hath bid you, firſt ſeek his Kingdom and the righteouſneſs thereof? Alas Neighbour, what if you had dyed before this hour in an unconverted ſtate what had become of you? and where had you now been? why you did not know all this while that you ſhould live a day to an end! O that ever you would be ſo cruel to your ſelves as to venture your Everlaſting ſtate ſo deſperately as you have done! what did you think of? Did you not all this while know that you muſt ſhortly dye, and be judged as you were then found? Had you any greater work to do? or any greater buſineſs to mind then your ſalvation? Do you think that all that you can get in this world will comfort you at a dying hour, or purchaſe your ſalvation, or eaſe the pains of Hell-fire?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Set theſe things home with a more earneſt voice then the former part of your conference was mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with. For if you get it not to heart, you do little or nothing and that which affecteth not is ſoon forgotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 8. Next this, conclude the whole, with a Practical Exhortation, which muſt contain two parts, Firſt, the duty of the heart in order to a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with Chriſt, and that which is contained in that cloſure: and Secondly, The uſe of external means for the time to come, and the avoiding of former ſins. <hi>E. g.</hi> 
                  <q>[Neighbour, I am heartily ſorry to find you in ſo ſad a caſe; but I ſhould be more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to leave you in it; and therefore let me intreat
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:99578:263"/>
you for the Lords ſake and for your own ſake to to regard what I ſhall ſay to you, as to the time to come. It is the Lords great mercy that he did not cut you off in your unconverted natural ſtate, and that you have yet life and time, and that there is a ſufficient Remedy provided for your ſoul in the blood of Chriſt, and he is yet offered with Pardon and life to you as well as any others; God hath not left ſinful man to utter deſperation for want of a Ranſom by a Redeemer as he hath done the Devils; nor hath he made any exception in the offer or promiſe of pardon and life againſt you any more then againſt any other. If you had yet but a bleeding heart for ſin, and could come to Chriſt believingly for recovery, and reſign your ſelves to him as your Saviour and Lord, and would be a new man for the time to come, the Lord will have mercy on you in the pardon of your ſins, and the ſaving of your ſoul; And I muſt tell you, that as it muſt be the great work of Gods grace to give you ſuch a heart, ſo if ever he mean to pardon and ſave you, he will make this change upon you that I have before mentioned; he will make you feel your ſin as the heavieſt burden in the world, as that which is moſt odious in it ſelf and hath laid you open to the Curſe of God; he will make you ſee that you are a loſt man, and that there is no way but one with you, even ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting damnation, unleſs you are pardoned by the blood of Chriſt, and ſanctified by his ſpirit: he will you make you ſee the need you have of Chriſt, and how much you are beholden to him for his bloodſhed, and how all your hope and life is in
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:99578:264"/>
him he will make you ſee the vanity of this world and all that it can afford you, and that all your happineſs is with God, in that everlaſting life, where with Saints and Angels you may behold his Glory and live in his loves and praiſes, when thoſe that reject him ſhall be tormented with the devils: And becauſe it is only Chriſt the Redeemer that can bring you to that glory, and deliver you from that torment, he will make you look to him as your hope and life, and caſt your burdened ſoul upon him, and give up your ſelves to be ſaved and taught and ruled by him; and he will poſſeſs you with the ſpirit of holyneſs, that your heart ſhall ſet upon God and heaven as your treaſure, and the care of your mind and the buſineſs of your life ſhall be to obtain it, and you ſhall deſpiſe this world and deny your fleſhly intereſts and deſires, and caſt away the ſin with abhorrence which you delighted in, and count no pains too great, nor no ſuffering too dear for the obtaining of that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life with God. Let me tell you, that till this work be done upon you, you are a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, and if you dye before its done, you are loſt for ever: Now, you have hope and help before you, but then there will be none. Let me therefore intreat theſe two or three things of you, and do not deny them me as you love your ſoul. Firſt, That you will not reſt in this Condition that you are in. Be not quiet in your mind, till you find a true converſion to be wrought. Think when you riſe in the morning, O what if this day ſhould be my laſt, and death ſhould find me in an unrenewed ſtate? Think when you are about your
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:99578:264"/>
labour, O how much greater a work have I yet to do, to get my ſoul reconciled to God and poſſeſſed of his Spirit! Think when you are eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or drinking or looking on any thing that you poſſeſs in the world, what good will all this do me, if I live and die an enemy to God, and a ſtranger to Chriſt and his Spirit, and we muſt periſh for ever. Let theſe thoughts be day &amp; night upon your mind till your ſoul be changed. The ſecond thing that I would intreat of you is, that you would bethink you ſeriouſly what a vain thing this world is, and how ſhortly it will leave you to a cold grave, and to everlaſting miſery, if you have not a better trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then this: and bethink you what it is to live in the ſight of the face of God, and to reign with Chriſt, and be like the Angels? and that this is the life that Chriſt hath procured you, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for you and offereth you if you will accept it in and with himſelf upon his eaſie reaſonable terms; bethink your ſelf whether it be not mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſlight ſuch an endleſs glory, and to prefer theſe fleſhly dreams, and earthly ſhadows before it. Uſe your ſelf to ſuch conſiderations as theſe, when you are alone, and let them dwell upon your mind. The third thing that I would intreat of you is, that you will preſently without any more delay, Accept of this felicity and this Saviour: cloſe with the Lord Jeſus that offereth you this eternal life: Joyfully and thankfully accept his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as the only way to make you happy: and then you may believe that all your ſins ſhall be done away by him. My fourth requeſt to you is, that you will reſolve preſently againſt your former ſins:
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:99578:265"/>
find out what hath defiled your heart and life, and caſt it up now by the vomit of Repentance, as you would do Poyſon out of your ſtomach, and abhor the thought of taking it in again. My fifth and laſt requeſt to you is that you will ſet your ſelves cloſe to the uſe of Gods means till this change be wrought, and then continue his means till you are confirmed, and (at laſt) perfected. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot of your ſelves make this change upon your heart and life betake your ſelf daily to God for it by prayer, and beg earneſtly as for your life that he will pardon all your former ſins, and change your heart, and ſhew you the riches of his Grace in Chriſt, and the Glory of his Kingdom, and draw up your heart to himſelf. Follow God day and night with theſe requeſts. 2. That you will fly from temptations and occaſions of ſin, and forſake your former evil company, and betake your ſelves into the company of thoſe that fear God, and will help you in the way to heaven. 3. That you will ſpecially ſpend the Lords day in holy exerciſes both publike and private, and loſe not one quarter of an hour of any of your time, but ſpecially of that moſt precious time, which God hath given you purpoſely that you may ſet your mind upon him, and be inſtructed by him and to prepare your ſelf for your latter end. What ſay you will you do this preſently? at leaſt ſo much of it as you can do if you will. Will you promiſe me to think of theſe things that I before mentioned, and to pray daily for a changed heart till you have obtained it, and to change your Company and Courſes, and fall upon the uſe of
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:99578:265"/>
Gods means in reading or hearing the Scriptures, meditating on them, ſpecially on the Lords day?</q> 
               </p>
               <p>And here be ſure if we can, to get their promiſe, and engage them to amendment, eſpecially to uſe means, and change their company, and forſake actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſinning, becauſe theſe are more in their reach, and in this way they may wait for the accompliſhing of that change that is not yet wrought. And do this ſolemnly, remembring them of the preſence of God that heareth their promiſes, and will expect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. (And when you have afterward opportunity, you may remember them of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direction</hi> 9. At the diſmiſſing of them do theſe two things. 1. Again lenifie their minds by a depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of offence in a word; <hi>E. G.</hi> 
                  <q>[I pray you take it not ill that I have put you to this trouble, or dealt thus freely with you: Its as little pleaſure to me as to you, if I did not know theſe things to be true and neceſſary, I would have ſpared this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to my ſelf and you: But I know that we ſhall be here together but a little while: we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the world to come already; and therefore its time for us all to look about us, and ſee that we be ready when God ſhall call us.]</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is but ſeldom that we our ſelves ſhall have opportunity to ſpeak with the ſame perſons, ſet them in a way for the perfecting of what is begun. 1. Engage the Governor of each family to call all his family to account every Lords day before they go to bed, what they can rehearſe of the Catechiſm: and ſo to continue till they have all learned it perfectly: and
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:99578:266"/>
when they have done ſo, yet ſtill to continue to hear them recite it, at leaſt once in two or three Lords daies, that they may not forget it. For, even to the moſt judicious it will be an excellent help to have ſtill in memory, a ſum of the Chriſtian Doctrine, for matter, method and words. 2. As for the Rulers of families themſelves or thoſe that are under ſuch rulers as will not help them, if they have learnt ſome ſmall part of the Catechiſm only, engage them either to come again to you (though before their courſe) when they have learnt the reſt, or elſe to go to ſome able experienced neighbour, and recite it to them, and take their aſſiſtance when you cannot have time your ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direction</hi> 10. Have all the names of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners by you in a book: and when they come and recite the Catechiſm, note in your Book who come and who do not; and who are ſo groſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as to be utterly uncapable of the Lords Supper and other holy Communion, and who not: and as you perceive the neceſſities of each, ſo deal with them for the future. But for thoſe, that are utterly obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and will not come to you nor be inſtructed by you, remember the laſt Article of our Agreement, <hi>to deal with them as the obſtinate deſpiſers of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be deals with, in regard of Communion, and the application of ſealing and confirming Ordinances:</hi> which is to avoid them, and not hold holy or familiar Communion with them, in the Lords Supper or other Ordinances: and though ſome Reverend Brethren are for admitting their children to Baptiſm (and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with me for contradicting it) yet ſo cannot I be, nor ſhall I dare to do it upon any pretences of
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:99578:266"/>
their Anceſtors faith, or of a Dogmatical faith of theſe Rebellious Parents, ſuppoſing them both to be ſuch as in that Article we have mentioned. To theſe particulars, I add this General.</p>
               <p>

               <p n="1">1. That you make a difference according to the difference of the perſons that you have to deal with. To the dull and obſtinate you muſt be more earneſt and ſharp: To the tender and timerous that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready humbled, you muſt rather inſiſt on direction and confirmation. To the youthful you muſt lay greater ſhame on ſenſual voluptuouſneſs, and ſhew them the nature and neceſſity of mortification: To the Aged you muſt do more to diſgrace this preſent world, and make them apprehenſive of the nearneſs of their change, and the aggravations of their ſin, if they ſhall live and dye in ignorance, or impenitency. To Inferiors and the Younger, you muſt be more free, to Superiors and Elders more reverend: To the rich this world muſt be more diſgraced, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and neceſſity of ſelf-denyal opened, and the damnableneſs of preferring the preſent proſperity to the future, with the neceſſity of improving their talents in well-doing. To the poor we muſt ſhew the great Riches of Glory which is propounded to them in the Goſpel, and how well the preſent things may be ſpared, where the everlaſting may be got. Alſo thoſe ſins muſt be moſt inſiſted on, which each ones age, or ſex, or temperature of body, or calling and employment in the world, doth moſt encline tehm to.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Be as condeſcending, familiar and plain as is poſſible, with thoſe that are of the weaker capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Give them the Scripture proof, the light of full evidence and reaſon of all as you go, that they may ſee that it is not you only, but God by you that ſpeaketh to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be as ſerious in all, but ſpecially in the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory part as you can. I ſcarce fear any thing more, then leaſt ſome careleſs Miniſters will ſlubber over the work, and do all ſuperficially and without life, and deſtroy this as they do all other duties, by turning it into a meer formality: putting a few cold queſtions to them, and giving them two or three cold words of advice, without any life and feeling in themſelves, nor likely to produce any feeling in the hearers: But ſure he that valueth ſouls, and knoweth what an opportunity is before him, will do it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To this end, I ſhould think it very neceſſary that we do both before and in the work, take ſpecial pains with our own hearts; eſpecially to excite and ſtrengthen our Belief of the Truth of the Goſpel, and the Inviſible Glory and Miſery that is to come. I am confident this work will exceedingly try the ſtrength of our belief: For he that is but ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a Chriſtian, and not ſound in the faith, will likely feel his Zeal quite fail him (ſpecially when the duty is
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:99578:267"/>
grown common) for want of a Belief of the things which he is to treat of to keep it alive. An affected fervency and hypocritical ſtage-action, will not hold up in ſuch kind of duties long: A Pulpit ſhall have more of them, then a conference with poor ignorant ſouls: For the Pulpit is the hypocritical Miniſters ſtage: There, and in the Preſs, and in Publike acts, where there is room for oftentation, you ſhall have his beſt, and almoſt all. It is other kind of men that muſt effectually do the work now in hand.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is therefore very meet that we prepare our ſelves to it by private prayer; and if time would permit, and there be many together; if we did begin and end with a ſhort prayer with our people, it were beſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Carry on all (even the moſt earneſt paſſages) in clear demonſtrations of love to their ſouls, and make them feel through the whole, that you aim at nothing but their own ſalvation; and avoid all harſh diſcouraging paſſages, throughout.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If you have not time to deal ſo fully with each one particularly as is here directed, then 1. Omit not the moſt neceſſary parts. 2. Take ſeveral of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that are friends, and will not ſeek to divulge each others weakneſſes, and ſpeak to them in common as much as concerneth all; and only the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Knowledge and ſtate, and convictions of miſery and ſpecial directions, muſt be uſed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals alone: But take heed of ſlubbering it over (uponan unfaithful lazineſs, or being too brief) without a real Neceſſity.</p>

Laſtly, if God enable you, extend your charity to thoſe of the pooreſt ſort, before they part from you: Give them ſomewhat towards their relief, and for the time that is thus taken from their labours: Eſpecially for encouragement of them that do beſt; and to the reſt, promiſe them ſo much when they have learned the Catechiſm.

But if you find him godly and temperate, and that there is any hope of his reduction, then ſee that you do all this privately between him and you only: and let not fall any bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words, nor that tend to his diſparagement. And thus I adviſe, both becauſe we muſt be as tender of the reputation of all good men, as fidelity to them and to the truth will permit: we muſt bear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers burdens, and not encreaſe them, and we muſt reſtore thoſe with a ſpirit of meekneſs, that fall through infirmity; remembring that we our ſelves alſo may be tempted: and alſo becauſe there is ſmall hope that you ſhould ever do them good, if once you exaſperate them, and diſ-affect them towards you.</p>

1. If you are ſo far verſ't in the point in hand as to mannage it well <hi>ex tempore,</hi> or the perſon be temperate and fit for ſuch debates, then come in with your evidence in a diſcourſive way, firſt ſhewing your reaſons againſt the groſſeſt imperfections of his own diſcourſe, and then giving him your grounds from Scripture; not many but rather a few of the cleareſt beſt improved. And 2. When you have done (or without verbal teaching if you find him unfit to learn that way) give him ſome book that moſt effectually defendeth the queſtioned truth, and tell him, <hi>that it is a vain thing to ſay that over ſo oft, which is ſo fully ſaid alreadie, and a man may better conſider of what he hath before his eyes, then of that which ſlideth through his ears, and is miſtaken or forgotten: and therefore you deſire him as an humble learner to peruſe that Book with leiſurely conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe there are the ſame things, that you would ſay to him; and deſire him to bring you in a ſober and ſolid anſwer to the chief ſtrength of it, if after peruſal he judge it to be unſound.</hi> But, if it may be, faſten ſome one of the moſt ſticking Evidences on him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you leave him.

               </p>
               <p>I ſpeak all this only of the tolerable differences that are among men, fearing God.

I conceive its paſt doubt, that differing brethren may well joyn in recommending the truths that they are agreed in to the ignorant people! Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> told King <hi>James</hi> in his Sermon at <hi>Wanſted</hi> on the <hi>Churches Unity,</hi> that he made this motion even to the Papiſts Prieſts themſelves that they might joyn in teaching the people of that barbarous Nation the Common Principles that both were agreed in: A motion too Chriſtian for ſullen factious Zeal to entertain. I will repeat his own words, pag. 33. <q>[The danger then of this ignorance being by the Confeſſion of the moſt judicious Divines of both ſides acknowledged to be ſo great; the woful eſtate of the poor Countrey wherein I live is much to be lamented, where the people generally are ſuffered to periſh for want of knowledge <hi>(he meant the Papiſts)</hi> the vulgar ſuperſtitions of Poperie not doing them half that hurt, that the ignorance of thoſe Common principles of the faith doth, which all true Chriſtians are bound to learn. The conſideration whereof hath ſometime drawn me to treat with thoſe of the oppoſite party to move them, that however in other things we did differ one from another, yet we ſhould joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in teaching thoſe main points the knowledge whereof was ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, and of the truth whereof there was no Controverſie betwixt us. But what, for the Jealouſies which theſe diſtractions in matters of Religion have bred among us, and what, for other reſpects, the motion took ſmall effect: and ſo betwixt us both, the poor people are kept ſtill in miſerable ignorance, neither knowing the grounds of the one Religion nor
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:99578:273"/>
of the other.]</q> So far this learned Chriſtian Biſhop.</p>
               <p>And what wonder if Popiſh Prieſts refuſe this motion, when now among us it is ſo rare a matter to find any in <hi>England,</hi> though he differ only in the point of Infant-Baptiſm, that will calmly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fraudalent deſigns of ſecret promoting his own opinions by it, entertain and proſecute ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the common good! As if they had rather, that Chriſtianitie were thruſt out of the world, or kept under, then Infants ſhould be admitted into the Church! well, let any party or perſon pretend what they will of Zeal or Holineſs, I will ever take the <hi>Dividatur</hi> for an ill ſign: The true Mother ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrs the Diviſion of the Child; and the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth prefer the Common intereſt of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before the Intereſt of a faction, or an opinion, and would not have the whole building endangered, rather then one peg, ſhould not be driven in as he would have it, he had rather a particular Truth (if we ſuppoſe it a truth) ſhould ſuffer, then the whole or the main.</p>
               <p>And having given you this advice what to do with this kind of men in your Conference on the occaſion now in queſtion, ſo I ſhall add a word or two of advice how to carry your ſelf towards them at other times; For the preſervation of the Unity and Peace of your Congregations doth much depend on your right dealing with ſuch as theſe. For (alas for grief and ſhame) it is moſt commonly men that profeſs more then ordinary Religiouſneſs they are the dividers of theſe.</p>

                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:99578:274"/>
1. I muſt premiſe, that the chief part of your work to preſerve the Church from ſuch, doth conſiſt in the prevention of their fall, ſeeing when they are once throughly infected; be the error what it will, they are but ſeldom recovered; but if they be beaten out of the error, which they firſt fell into; they go to another, and perhaps thence to another; but, through a juſt excecation, they ſeldom return to the truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To which end, it is moſt deſirable that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould be of Parts above the people ſo far, as to be able to teach them, and awe them, and manifeſt their weakneſſes to themſelves, or to all. The truth is (for it cannot be hid) it is much long of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that our poor people are run into ſo many factions! and particularly, the weakneſs of too many is not the leaſt cauſe, when a proud Seducer ſhall have a nimble tongue, and a Miniſter be dull or ignorant, ſo that ſuch a one can baffle him, or play upon him in the ears of others, it brings him into contempt, and overthrows the weak: For they commonly judge him to have the beſt cauſe, that hath the moſt confident, plauſible, triumphant tongue. But when a Miniſter is able to open their ſhame to all, it mightily preſerveth the Church from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is neceſſary alſo to this end, that you fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and throughly poſſeſs your people, with the nature, neceſſity, and daily uſe of the great unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Principles of Religion, and of the great ſin and danger of a perverſe zeal about the lower points before the greater are well laid, and let them be made ſenſible how it is the Principles, and not their
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:99578:274"/>
ſmaller Controverſies that life or death doth depend upon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Make them ſenſible of the miſchiefs of Schiſm, and the great and certain obligations that lie upon us, all to maintain the Churches Unity and Peace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When a fire is kindled, reſiſt it in the beginning, and make not light of the ſmalleſt ſpark: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go preſently to the infected perſon, and follow him by the means hereafter mentioned, till he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Specially uſe a fit diverſion: when a ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie begins to endanger the Church, raiſe a greater your ſelf, which you have better advantage to mannage, and which is not like to make a diviſion. That is; let them know that there are far greater difficulties then theirs to be firſt reſolved (ſuch as ſome of the Queſtions before mentioned) and ſo give them a Catalogue of them, and ſet them a work upon them, that they may be matter of avocation from that fore, where the humors begin their conflux, and alſo that they may be humbled in the ſenſe of their ignorance, and their proud ſelf-conceits may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abated.</p>
               <p n="7">7. See that you preach to ſuch auditors as theſe, ſome higher points, that ſtall their underſtandings, and feed them not all with milk, but ſometime with ſtronger meat: For it exceedingly puffs them up with Pride, when they hear nothing from Miniſters but what they know already, or can ſay themſelves: This makes them think themſelves as wiſe as you, and as fit to be Teachers; For they think you know no more then you preach: And this hath ſet ſo many of them on preaching, becauſe they hear nothing from others
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:99578:275"/>
but what they can ſay themſelves; and Miniſters do not ſet them ſuch patterns as may humble them, and deter them from that work. Not that I would have you neglect the great fundamental verities, or wrong the weak and ignorant people, while you are dealing with ſuch as theſe; but only when the main part of your Sermon is as plain as you can ſpeak, let ſome one ſmall part, be ſuch as ſhall puzzle theſe ſelf-conceited men: Or elſe have one Sermon in four or five of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for them: Not by heaping up citations of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor repeating words of Latine or Greek (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when you are convincing them of the difficulty of a Text of Scripture) For they will but deride all this: But take up ſome profound queſtions (ſuch as the Schools voluminouſly agitate) and let them ſee that it is edifying that you intend, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make it as plain as you can; that they may ſee that it is not your obſcure manner of handling, but the matter it ſelf that is too hard for them, and ſo may ſee that they are yet but children that have need of milk, and that you would be more upon ſuch higher points, if it were not that their incapacity doth take you off.</p>
               <p n="8">8. See that you preach as little as may be againſt them in the Pulpit, in any direct manner, oppoſing their ſect by name, or by any reproachful titles: For they are exceeding tender, proud, paſſionate and raſh, ordinarily, that are intangled in a Schiſm: &amp; they will but hate you, and fly from you as an enemy, and ſay you rail. The way therefore is, without naming them, to lay the grounds clearly and ſoundly, which muſt ſubvert their errours; and then the errour will fall of it ſelf. And when you are neceſſitated to deal
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:99578:275"/>
with them directly; do it not by ſhort unſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry applications, and loathed ſnatches, or angring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; but without naming them, take up the Controverſie, and handle it throughly, peaceably, and convincingly, and ſo let them alone in publike: yet be not too long upon it neither: but give them your fulleſt evidence in a few Sermons; not ſaying all that may be ſaid, but chooſing out that which they can have leaſt pretence to quarrel with, and paſſing over that which they may ſay more againſt, or will require more ado to clear and defend.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Be ſure to keep up ſome private meetings, and draw them in among you, and mannage them pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently. By this means you may keep them from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding meetings among themſelves, where they may ſay what they wil behind your back without controle, For moſt Profeſſors are addicted to private meetings, (and well ordered, they are of great uſe to their edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) and if they have not the opportunity of ſuch as they ſhould have, they will gather to ſuch as they ſhould not have. In the mannaging of them (as to the preſent purpoſe) obſerve theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be ſure to be ſtill with them your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let not the main exerciſes of the meeting be ſuch as tend to contention, or to private mens proud oſtentation of their parts, but ſuch as tend to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the people: Not for private men to preach or expound Scripture, nor (as ſome do) to let every one of them ſpeak to queſtions of their own propounding; but to repeat the Sermons that you have preacht, &amp; to call upon God, and ſing his Praiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet let there be ſome opportunity for them to ſpeak, and appear in a learning way. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:99578:276"/>
when you have done repeating, let all that are preſent know, that if they doubt of any thing that was delivered, or would have any thing made plainer to them, or would be reſolved in any thing elſe that concerneth the ſubject in hand (or any other in caſe of need) you deſire them to propound their doubts. And ſo let them have the liberty of queſtioning as learners, while you remain the Teacher, and reſolve all the doubts your ſelves, and do not ſet them on diſputing, by leaving it to them to make the anſwer. And if you have not competent abilities <hi>ex tempore,</hi> to reſolve their doubts, you were much better let paſs this too: but if you have, it will be of very great uſe, both for their edification, and the maintaining of order, and their neceſſary dependance on you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if you perceive them ſo ſet upon the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their own parts for oſtentation, that they are like to divide, if they have not opportunity to do it; be not too ſtiff againſt them; but mildly let them know, that it is for their good that you diſlike it, both becauſe it is an ill ſign of a proud heart, that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teach, then learn, eſpecially where a Teacher by office is in place, and where there is no neceſſity; and alſo becauſe you fear it will not tend to the beſt edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Flock, but to vain janglings, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite others that are unable to an imitation. Deſire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to know of them, whether they have any truth of God to reveal to them, that you do not reveal? If they have not, why ſhould they deſire needleſly to tell them what they are daily told by you? If they have, it is neceſſary that you know it and conſider of it, before you conſent that it ſhould be taught to your Flock. But if this mild reſiſtance ſatisfie not, let
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:99578:276"/>
them take their courſe a while, rather then ſeperate from you (unleſs they be already perverſe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Hereticks:) and when they have done their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, tell them that as you give libertie to all, to propound their doubts about what you have deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vered, ſo you muſt take the like libertie that you give: And ſo propound, firſt, whether the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of people are like to be more edifyed, by ſuch obtuſions of variety, or by faſtening well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their memories the things that they have lately heard? and ſo whether ſuch exerciſes or repetitions be more neceſſary? And then open the weakneſſes of the diſcourſe; the miſ-expounding of Scriptures, the errors in matter, in Method, and in words and that not in a contemptuous or diſgraceful way, but as the points wherein you remain unſatisfied. And by ſuch means as theſe you will quickly ſhame them out of their way of oſtentation, and make them give it over.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Make uſe of your Peoples parts to the utmoſt as your Helpers in their places, in an orderly way, under your Guidance; or elſe they will make uſe of them in a diſorderly dividing way in oppoſition to you. It hath been a great cauſe of Schiſm, when Miniſters would contemptuouſly cry down private mens preaching, and withall deſire not to make any uſe of the Gifts that God hath given them for their aſſiſtance; but thruſt them too far from holy things, as if they were a prophane generation. The work is like to go poorly on, if there be no hands imployed in it, but the Miniſters. God giveth not any of his gifts to be buryed, but for common uſe. By a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent improvement of the gifts of the more able

Chriſtians, we may receive much help by them, and prevent their abuſe; even as lawful marriage pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth fornication And the uſes you muſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally put them to are theſe. 1 Urge them to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in Teaching and praying with their own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; ſpecially Catechizing them, and teaching them the meaning of what they learn, and whetting it on their affections: And there if they have a mind to preach to their children and ſervants, (ſo they undertake not more, then they are able to do) I know no reaſon, but they may. 2. Urge them to ſtep out now and then to their poor Ignorant Neighbours, and catechize and inſtruct them in meekneſs and patience from day to day, and that will bring them more peace of Conſcience, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning them. 3. Urge them to go oft to the Impenitent and ſcandalous ſinners about them, and deal with them with all poſſible skill and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet alſo with love and patience, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting reforming and ſaving of their ſouls. 4. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with their duty of watching over each other in brotherly love; and admoniſhing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting one another daily and if any walk ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, to tell them their fault before two or three, after the contempt of private reproof; and if that prevail not, to tell the officers of the Church, that they may be further proceeded with, as Chriſt hath appointed. 5. At your private meetings and in days of humiliation or thankſgiving in private, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them in prayer, and in ſuch learning Queſtions as is aforeſaid. 6. If there be any very ignorant or ſcandalous ſinner that you know of and you cannot poſſibly have time your ſelves to ſpeak to them at
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:99578:277"/>
that ſeaſon, ſend ſome of thoſe that are able and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to do it in your ſtead, to inſtruct the ignorant, and admoniſh the offenders, as far as a private man, on a meſſage from a Miniſter, and in diſcharge of his own duty may go. 7. Let ſome of them be choſen to Repreſent the Church: or to ſee that they have no wrong, and to be their Agents to prepare all Caſes of Diſcipline for publike audience, and to be preſent with the Church officers at appointed meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to hear the Evidences that are brought in againſt any ſcandalous impenitent ſinners, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern how far they are valid and how far the perſons are obliged to make ſatisfaction, and give publike teſtimony of Repentance or to be further proceeded againſt. 8 Let ſuch as are fit, be made ſubſervient officers, I mean Deacons: and then they may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you help in a regular way, and will by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation diſcern themſelves obliged to maintain the unity of the Church and authoritie of the Miniſtrie, as they have ſome participation of the Employment and honour, and ſo by a complication of Intereſts you will make them firmer to the Church: But then ſee that they be men Competently fit for the place.</p>
               <p>I am perſwaded, if Miniſters had thus made uſe of the parts of their ableſt members, they might have prevented much of the Diviſions and diſtractions and apoſtacie that hath befaln us: For they would have then found work enough upon their hands for high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts then theirs, without invading the Miniſtrie, and would rather have ſeen cauſe to bewail the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefection of their abilities to that work which doth belong to them. Experience would have convinced
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:99578:278"/>
and humbled them more, then our words will do. A man may think he can ſtir ſuch ablock, or pluck up a tree by the roots, that never tryed; but when he ſets his hands to it, he will come off aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And ſee that you drive them to diligence in their own works, and let them know what a ſin it is to neglect their families, and their ignorant miſerable neighbours &amp;c and then they will be kept humble, and have no ſuch mind to be running upon more work, when they feel you, ſpurring them on to their own, and rebuking them for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; nor will they have any leiſure for ſchiſmatical Enterpriſes, becauſe of the conſtancy and greatneſs of their employment.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Still keep up Chriſtian love and familiarity with them, even when they begin to warp and make defection; and loſe not your intereſt in them, while you have any thoughts of attempting their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If they do withdraw into ſeparated meetings, follow them, and be among them, if it may be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, enter a mild diſſent as to the lawfulneſs of it; but yet tell them, that you are willing to hear what it is that they have to ſay, and to be among them for their good, if they will give you leave, for fear leſt they run to further evil. And be not eaſily removed; but hold on, unleſs they reſolvedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude you. For 1. You may thereby have the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a moderate gentle oppoſing their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and ſo in time may manifeſt the vanity of their courſe: 2. And you will prevent much of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent reviling, and groſſer venting of further Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which they will do more freely where there is no
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:99578:278"/>
Contradicter. They may ſay any thing when there is none to gainſay them, and make it ſeem good in the eyes of the weak. 3. And by this means, if any ſeducers from abroad come in to confirm them, you will be readie to oppoſe them: And ſo at the leaſt you will do much to prevent the increaſe of their party. It hath been a very great cauſe of the ſchiſms in <hi>England,</hi> that Miniſters have only (too many) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned them, &amp; when they have withdrawn into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſeparated meetings, have talk't againſt them to others, or reproved them in the Pulpit &amp; in the mean time fled away from the faces of them, or been ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to them, while they have given Seducers oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to come among them &amp; be familiar with them without contradiction, and to have the advantages of deceiving them, and even doing what their liſt. O that the Miniſtrie had been more guiltleſs of thoſe Errors and Schiſms that they talk againſt! But its eaſier to chide a ſectary in the Pulpit, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a Teſtimony againſt them, then to play the skilful Phyſician for their Cure, and do the tenth part of the duty that lieth upon us, to prevent and heal ſuch calamitous diſtempers. I am not finding fault with Prudent Reprehenſions of them in Publike, or Teſtimonies againſt them: but I think too many of us have cauſe to fear, leſt we do but publikely proclaim our own ſhame in the guilt of our negligence or imprudent weakneſſes; and leſt in Condemning them and Teſtifying againſt them, we Teſtifie againſt and Condemn our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="13">13. If you be not well able to deal with them, do as I before adviſed: Give them the beſt book on that ſubject to peruſe.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:99578:279"/>
14. If all this will not do, get the fitteſt neighbour Miniſter that you know to come over and help you: Not in Publike, nor as a ſet Diſputation, (without neceſſity;) but let him come as occaſionally, and <hi>ex improviſo,</hi> come upon them in one of their private meetings, as deſirous to ſee and hear them, and ſo take the opportunity to deal with them. And if after that there be any Diſputations appointed, be ſure to obſerve the old rule, fight with them on their own ground, and keep up the war in their quarters, and let it come as little as you can into your own: and therefore go to their Aſſemblies, but let them not come into yours. For with them, you can loſe little, and may gain much: but at home, you can gain little, but its two to one, will loſe ſome, let the error be never ſo groſs. The Sectaries commonly obſerve this courſe themſelves, and therefore you will have much ado to get their conſent to bring your diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into their own Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Let not the authors of the Schiſm out-do you, or go beyond you in any thing that is good: For, as truth ſhould be more effectual for ſanctification, then errour; ſo if you give them this advantage, you give them the day; and all your diſputation will do but little good: For the weaker people judge all by the outward appearance, and by the effects, and be not ſo able to judge of the Doctrine in it ſelf: They think that he hath the beſt cauſe, whom they take to be the beſt man.</p>
               <p>I extend this rule both to Doctrine and Life <hi>E. G.</hi> If a Libertine preach for Free-grace, do you preach it up more effectually, then he: be much upon it, and make it more glorious on right grounds, then
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:99578:279"/>
he can do on his wrong. If on the like pretences, he magnifie the Grace of Love, and (in order to cry down fear, and humiliation) be all for living in pure Love to God: do not contradict him in the aſſertive, but only in the negative and deſtructive part; but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go him, and preach up the Love of God, with its motives and effects, more fully and effectually then he can do, on the corrupt grounds on which he doth proceed: Or elſe you will make all the ſilly people believe that this is the difference between you, that he is for Free-Grace and the Love of God, and you are againſt it: For if you dwell not upon it in your preaching as well as he, they will not take notice of a ſhort conceſſion of profeſſion. So if an Enthuſiaſt do talk all of the Holy-Ghoſt, and the light, and witneſs, and Law within us: Fall you upon that ſubject too, &amp; do that well which they did ill; and preach up the office of the Holy-Ghoſt, his indwelling and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the light, and teſtimony, and Law within us, better then they. This is the moſt effectual way of ſetling your people againſt their ſeductions. So if you be aſſaulted by Pelagians; if they make a long ſtory to prove that God is not the Author of ſin; do you fall upon the proof of it too: If they plead for Free-will, do you plead for that Free-will which we have (the natural liberty, which none deny, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in a ſelf-determining power, and ſuppoſing actual indetermination) and deny only that Liberty which the will hath not: (that is, 1. Either a freedom from Gods Government. 2. Or from the neceſſary guidance of the Intellect, and Moral force of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. 3. Or that true Spiritual, Ethical freedom from vicious inclinations, which conſiſteth in the Right
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:99578:280"/>
Diſpoſition of the will: though the ſanctified indeed have this in part; and that predominantly.) So if any Pelagian or Semi-Pelagian, will go about induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to prove mans power (or rather impotency) to will or do evil; do it as effectually as he: For this is indeed but to prove a man a ſinner, under pretence of proving him free, or at leaſt to prove him defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctible (if it be not the ill inclination, but the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſinning that they defend: in which caſe, we can ſay more, then they. So if they go about labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to prove, that Chriſt dyed for all: I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do it as effectually, as they; that it might appear to the people, that the difference between us is not in this, that they would magnifie the riches of grace above me, or that I would leave ſinners hopeleſs and remedileſs, and without an object for faith, any more then they: nor that I abuſe or reject expreſs Scriptures, when they own them in their proper ſenſe: But I would let them know, that the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie lyeth elſewhere; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Chriſt in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, had not a ſpecial Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Reſolution (in complyance with his Fathers predeſtinating will) infallibly and effectually to ſave his choſen, even ſuch and ſuch by name, in making his blood applyed, effectual to the pardon of all their ſins, and to give them his ſpirit to ſeal them unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: having no ſuch Will, Intention, Reſolution, in dying (no more then his Father had in predeſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) as to the reſt of the world. So if one that is for private mens preaching come and inveigh againſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters for inhibiting them to uſe the gifts of God for the edification of the Church, I would not preſently ſet to thwart him: but I would rather fall a perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:99578:280"/>
private men to uſe their gifts, in all the waies that I even now mentioned; and ſharply chide them for uſing them no more; and then among my Cautions, or reprehenſions, meet with his deſired abuſe in the end. And what I have ſaid by way of inſtance in theſe few points, I mean in all others: Preaching truth is the moſt ſucceſsful way of confuting error: and I would have no Seducer to have the glory of out-going us in any good, and ſo not in befriending or defending any truth. Once more <hi>E. G.</hi> If a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian ſhould fall a pleading for the Churches Peace, and for Unity upon the antient ſimplicity of faith, I would labour to out-go him in it: and then would ſhew that the antient ſimple faith condemned him. If he would plead Reaſon for Scripture or the Chriſtian Religion, I would endeavour to out-go him in it, and he ſhould not have opportunity to glory that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had Reaſon for what he held, and I had none. But I would ſhew that as I have Reaſon to believe the Scripture, ſo that Scripture condemneth his errors. If a Separatiſt will plead for the Neceſſity of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and Diſcipline, ſo would I as well as he: and ſhew him that it is only Diſorder, and Confuſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with right order and diſcipline that I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in him or thoſe of his way. And ſo would I do by others in this caſe.</p>
               <p>And you ſhould be as loath that they ſhould out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go you in the Practiſe of a Holy and Righteous life, any more, then in ſounder diligent teaching. Do any of them expreſs a hatred of ſin, and deſire of Church Reformation? So muſt we do more. Do any of them uſe to ſpend their time when they meet together in holy diſcourſe, and not in vain janglings? Let us do
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:99578:281"/>
ſo much more: Are they unwearied in propagating their opinions? Let us be more ſo in propagating the Truth: Will they condeſcend to the meaneſt, and creep into houſes to lead captive the ſillyeſt of the Flock? Let us ſtoop as low, and be as diligent to do them good. Are any of them loving to their party, and contemners of the world? Let us be lovers of all, and ſpecially of all Saints; and do good to all, as we have power; and ſpecially to all the houſhold of faith; and love an enemy, as well as they can do a friend. Let us be more juſt then they; and more merciful then they; and more humble, and meek, and patient then they: For this is the will of God, that by well-doing we may put to ſilence the Ignorance of fooliſh men. Let us excell them in a holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, righteous, merciful, fruitful, heavenly life, as we do in ſoundneſs of Doctrine: that by our fruits we may be known, and the weaker ſort of our people may ſee the truth in this reflexion, that cannot ſee it in itſelf, and that our Light may ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee our converſation, and glorifie our Father which is in heaven, and even they that obey not the word, may without the word be won by the converſation of their Teachers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 2. O how happy had <hi>England</hi> been; how happy had all the Church been, if the Miniſters of the Goſpel had taken theſe courſes! It would have done more againſt Errors and Schiſm, then all our chiding at them hath done, or then all the force can do which we deſire from the Magiſtrate.</p>

THree ſorts of perſons that we may meet with in our conference, are now over, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The groſly ignorant and unconverted. 2. The doubting troubled believer. 3. The Cavilling Queſtioniſt, or ſeduced Schiſmatick. The fourth that I ſhould ſpeak of in this Direction, is, Thoſe that by a profeſſed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to learn and obey, and by other ſigns, do give us ſome probability, that they may have true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith, and yet by their ignorance, or luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs (being not noted for any ſpecial profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Godlineſs), or by ſome uneven walking, do make our fears to be as great or greater then our hopes: ſo that we are between hope and fear of them, doubting the worſt of their preſent ſafety, though we have not ground to charge them to be unconverted, impenitent, unſanctified perſons. I think half that come to me are of this ſort: and ten of this ſort (if not 40) for one that I dare flatly ſay are unregenerate. Now it may be a great difficulty with ſome younger Miniſters what they ſhould do with this ſort of people where they have no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to determine of them as Godly or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, what ever their fears or hopes may be.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe I ſhall only briefly ſay this. 1. The firſt Directions may ſuffice in the main, for dealing with theſe: and are as much fitted to theſe as to the worſt. As we may tell a Notorions, ungodly man, <hi>Your caſe is miſerable, you are a child of death:</hi> ſo may we tell theſe, <hi>I much fear your Caſe is ſad; theſe are ill ſigns: I wonder how you dare ſo hazard your ſalvation;</hi> And ſo abating of the confidence of our Cenſures
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:99578:282"/>
according to the ſeveral degrees of the hopeful good, that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them, we may ſee in the firſt caſe, how to deal in this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And I would adviſe you to be very cautelous how you paſs too haſty or abſolute Cenſures on any that you have to do with; becauſe it is not ſo eaſie a matter to diſcern a man to be certainly graceleſs that profeſſeth himſelf a Chriſtian, as many do imagine it to be; And you may do the work in hand as well without ſuch an abſolute concluſion as with it, as the former examples (which will ſerve all with a little alteration do) ſhew.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The general deſcriptions of the Miniſterial work, may ſupply the reſt. I ſhall only add in a word. 1. Keep them cloſe to the uſe of private and publike means. 2. Be oft with the luke-warm to awaken them rouzingly; and with the careleſs to admoniſh them. 3. Take the opportunity of ſickneſs which will bow their hearts and open their ears. 4. See that they ſpend the Lords day, and order their families, aright. 5. Draw them from temptations and occaſions of ſin. 6. Charge them to come and ſeek help in all great ſtreights and open their temptations and dangers before they are ſwallowed up 7. Strike at the great Radical ſins. Self-ſeeking, fleſhly mindedneſs, ſenſuality, Pride, wordlineſs, Infidelitie, &amp;c. 1. Keep them to the Reading of Scripture and good books, and direct them to thoſe that are likeſt to awake them. 8. Engage their godly neighbours to have an eye upon them. 9. Keep up Diſcipline to awe them: 10. Maintain the life of Grace in your ſelves that it may appear in all your Sermons to them; that every one that comes cold to the Aſſembly may have warming helps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he depart.</p>
                  <p>I have done my Advice, and leave you to the Practice. Though the proud may receive it with ſcorn and the ſelfiſh and ſlothful with ſome diſtaſt and indignation; I doubt not, but God will uſe it, in deſpight of the oppoſitions of ſin and Satan, to the awakening of many of his ſervants to their duty, and the promoting of the work of a Right Reformation: and that his much greater bleſſing ſhall accompany the preſent undertaking, for the ſaving of many a ſoul, the Peace of you that undertake and perform it, the exciting of his ſervants through the nation to ſecond you, and to increaſe Purity and the unity of his Churches, <hi>Amen.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:99578:283"/>
have thought it not unmeet to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with another work to that end, which we have ſet afoot in this County, and to propound it to your Conſideration, and humbly invite you to an univerſal imitation. You know, I doubt not, the great inequality in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial abilities, and that many places have Miniſters that are not qualified with convincing lenity, awakening gifts: Some muſt be tolerated in the neceſsity of the Church, that are not likely to do any great matters towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ignorant, ſenſual, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men: And ſome that are learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, able men, and fitted for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, may yet be unfit to deal with thoſe of the lower ſort. I ſuppoſe if you peruſe the
<pb facs="tcp:99578:283"/>
whole Miniſtry of a County, you will not find ſo many, ſuch live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convincing Preachers as we could wiſh. And I take it for granted that you are ſenſible of the weight of eternal things, and of the worth of ſouls; and that you will judge it a very deſirable thing that every man ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed according to his Gifts, and the Goſpel in its Light and Power ſhould be made as common as poſsibly we can: Upon theſe and many the like Conſiderations, the Miniſters in this County reſolved to chooſe out four of the moſt lively, yet ſober, peaceable, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox men, and to deſire them once a moneth to leave their own Congregations to the aſsiſtance of ſome other, and to beſtow their
<pb facs="tcp:99578:284"/>
labour in the places where they thought there was moſt need; And as we were reſolving upon this work, the Natives of this County inhabiting the City of <hi>London,</hi> having a cuſtom of feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together once a year, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at their feaſt collected ſome moneys by contribution, for the maintaining of a weekly Lecture in this County, (beſides other good works) did (by their Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) deſire us to ſet up the ſaid Lecture, and to diſpoſe of the ſaid moneys in order thereto; And their judgements upon conſulation did correſpond with our deſign. So that the ſaid money being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfie another that ſhall in their abſence, preach in their own places, we imploy it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
<pb facs="tcp:99578:284"/>
and have prevailed with ſome Brethren to undertake this work.</p>
            <p>I propound to your conſideration, Reverend Brethren, and to you, the Natives of each County in <hi>London,</hi> Whether the ſame work may not tend much to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church, and the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of ſouls, if you will be pleaſed ſpeedily and effectually to ſet it afoot through the Land? Whether it may not, by Gods bleſsing be a likely means, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate the ignorant and awaken the ſecure, and countermine Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, and hinder the ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Satans Itinerants, and win over many ſouls to Chriſt, and ſtabliſh many weak ones in the faith? And not doubting, but
<pb facs="tcp:99578:285"/>
your judgements will approve of the deſign, I humbly move, that you will pleaſe to contribute your faculties to the vvork; <hi>viz</hi> That the <hi>Londoners</hi> of each County will be pleaſed to manifeſt their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence to this end, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the moneys to the hands of the moſt faithful, Orthodox Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and that they will readily and ſelf-denyingly undertake the work.</p>
            <p>I hope the Gentlemen, Natives of this County will be pleaſed to pardon my publiſhing their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſeeing my end is only the promoting of mens ſalvation, and the common good.</p>
            <p>And that you may fullyer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſcope of our deſign; I ſhall annex the Letters directed
<pb facs="tcp:99578:285"/>

his Church, and therefore muſt needs be ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous thereof: and it is that which the ſpirit of Grace where it abideth, doth proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſpoſe the heart to deſire: By convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the excellency and neceſſity of this work, and of our own duty in order thereto, and by the excitation of undeſerved Grace, our hearts are carried out, to long after a more general and effectual illumination and ſaving Converſion of the inhabitants of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in which we live: Which while we were but entring upon a conſultation to promote, it pleaſed God (without our knowledge of it) to put the ſame thoughts into the hearts of others. The Natives of this Country of <hi>Worceſter</hi> who dwell in <hi>London,</hi> meeting at a feaſt, (as is their yearly uſe) collected a ſum of money for the ſetting of 8. poor boies to trades and towards the maintaining of a week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lecture, and have committed the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this laſt to our care: And upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with their Stewards, and among our ſelves, both they and we are ſatisfied, that a moveable Lecture on the Lords Day, is the likelyeſt way for the improvement of their Charity to the attainment of their ends. For 1. Many people through poverty cannot, and many through negligence will not come to a week day's Lecture: Experience telleth us,
<pb facs="tcp:99578:287"/>
that ſuch are uſually attended but little by thoſe that have the greateſt need. 2. And thus the benefit may extend to more, than if it were fixed in one Place.</p>
            <p>We have therefore deſired our Reverend and Dear Brethren, Mr. <hi>Andrew Triſtram</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter at <hi>Clent,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Oaſland</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Bewdley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Baldwin</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Wolverley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Joſeph Treble</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Church-Lench,</hi> to undertake this work, and that each of them will be pleaſed every fourth Lords day to Preach twice in thoſe places, where they ſhall judge their labours to be moſt neceſſary: and as we doubt not but their own Congregations will ſo far conſent for the good of others: So do we hereby requeſt of you our Brethren, that when any of them ſhall offer their labours for your Congregations, in preaching the ſaid Lecture, you will receive them, and to your power fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them in the work. For as we have no thoughts of obtruding their help upon you, without your conſent; ſo we cannot but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly expect that men fearing God, and deſiring their peoples everlaſting good, will cheerfully and gratefully entertain ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. And we hope that none will think it needleſs, or take it as an accuſing the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of inſufficiency: For the Lord doth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb facs="tcp:99578:288"/>
beſtow his gifts: all that are upright are not equally fitted for the work: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are learned, judicious, and more able to teach the riper ſort, are yet leſs able to condeſcend to the ignorant, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly and fervently to rowze up the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, as ſome that are below them in other qualifications: and many that are able in both reſpects, have a barren people; and the ableſt have found by experience that God hath ſometime bleſt the labours of a ſtranger to do that which their own hath not done. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you therefore interpret not this as an accuſation of any, which proceedeth from the Charity of our worthy Countrey-men in <hi>London,</hi> and from the earneſt deſires of them and us to further the ſalvation of as many as we can. And that you may have no jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of the perſons deputed to this work; we aſſure you that they are approved men, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, ſober, peaceable, and of upright lives, happily qualified for their Miniſterial work, and zealous and induſtrious therein; and ſo far from being likely to ſow any errors or cauſe diviſions, or to draw the hearts of people from their own faithful Paſtors, that they will be forward to aſſiſt you againſt any ſuch diſtempers in your Flocks. Not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, but as you ſerve the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb facs="tcp:99578:288"/>
and are under the ſame oblations as we, ſo as many as are heartily addicted to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice will readily promote ſo hopeful a work, we commend you and your labours to the bleſſing of the Lord.</p>
