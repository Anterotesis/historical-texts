            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And when we do obey in a Caſe of Miſcommanding, it is not a doing evil, that good may come of it, as ſome do miſconceive: but it is only a ſubmitting to that which is ill commanded, but not evil in him that doth ſubmit. It is the Determiner that is the cauſe of the

                  <p>Argument 1. <hi>That which is not directly, or conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially forbidden by God, remaineth lawful: A ſtinted Liturgy is not directly, or conſequentially forbidden by God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remaineth lawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is undoubted, becauſe nothing but a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition can make a thing unlawful. <hi>Sin is a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Law: where there is no Law, there is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion:</hi> And yet I have heard very Reverend men an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this, <hi>That it is enough that it is not commanded, though not forbidden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Which is plainly to deny both Scripture and Civil Principles.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>Minor, That a ſtinted Liturgy is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,</hi> we need no other proof, than that no Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 361.</note> can be produced.</p>
                  <p>Argument 6. <hi>If it be lawful for the People to uſe a ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 364.</note> 
                     <hi>Form of words in Publick Prayer, then is it in it ſelf lawful for the Paſtors: but it is lawful for the People:</hi> for the Paſtors prayer (which they muſt pray over with him, and not onely hear it) is a ſtinted Form to them, even as much as if he had learnt it out of a Book. They are to follow him in his Method and Words, as if it were a Book-Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Argument 7. <hi>It is lawful to uſe a Form in Preaching: therefore a ſtinted Liturgy is lawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Becauſe Preaching is a part of that Liturgy.</item>
                     <item>2. Becauſe the reaſon is the ſame for Prayer, as for that, in the main.</item>
                  </list>

Argument 8. <hi>That which hath been the practice of the Church in Scripture-times, and down to this day, and is yet the practice of almoſt all the Churches of Chriſt on earth, is not like to be unlawful: but ſuch is the uſe of ſome ſtinted forms of Publick Service: therefore, &amp;c.</hi> That it was ſo in the <hi>Jews</hi> Church, and approved by Chriſt, I have ſhewed. That it hath been of ancient uſe in the Church ſince Chriſt, and is at this day in uſe in <hi>Africk, Aſia, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> even among the Reformed Churches in <hi>France, Holland, Geneva,</hi> &amp;c. is ſo well known, that I think I need not ſtand to prove it: yea, thoſe few that ſeem to diſuſe it, do yet uſe it, in <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and other parts of Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> it ſelf, I never rejected it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 421.</note> becauſe it was a Form, nor thought it ſimply unlawful becauſe it was ſuch a Form; but have made uſe of it, and would do again in the like caſe.</p>
