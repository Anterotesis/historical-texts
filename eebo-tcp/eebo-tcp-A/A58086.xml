         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>I Need not ſtrive much to prove the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of this
<hi>Book,</hi> if you conſider, that the moſt accompliſhed Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that ever charm'd his Author with Eloquence and
Reaſon, began with it; much leſs ſhall I have difficulty to
ſhew its <hi>profitableneſs</hi> to any who looks about and ſees how
many fair Eſtates are every day gained by the Profeſſors of
this <hi>Noble Science,</hi> to which this little Book muſt open the
door and let them in: But leaſt of all need I ſuſpect, that
whoever is convinced of theſe two Points, its <hi>Necessity</hi> and
<hi>Profitableneſs,</hi> will fail to peruſe and eſteem it.</p>
            <p>Though no name of any Authour appears to it, yet my
<hi>Lord Cook</hi> in his <hi>preface</hi> to his <hi>Tenth Report</hi> aſcribes it
to <hi>William Raſtal,</hi> that reverend Judge; who was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
knowing both in the Common and Statute Law of
this Land, as appears by the many <hi>Leraned Expoſitions</hi>
and <hi>Excellent Caſes,</hi> which every where occur in it. And
we may probably gueſs it to be written by him originally in
<hi>French</hi> only, having ſome cauſe to ſuſpect the Tranſlation
to be done by a leſs skilful Hand: For though by the
many Impreſſions of it, and careleſneſs of Printers,<note place="margin">V. J. Cow. Interpreter.</note> it has
ſuffered much (as other Books of like nature daily
do) yet ſome Objection lay againſt the <hi>Tranſlator</hi>
himſelf as (to omit others) <hi>Chapter</hi> is defined
to be <hi>Locum in quo fiunt communes tractatus Collegia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum,</hi>
which was Engliſhed thus odly, <hi>A Place wherein
common Tracts of men Collegiate are made.</hi> And for
Errors of the Preſs, they were very numerous and ſtrangely
unhappy: as <hi>diſſeiſed</hi> for <hi>die ſeized, Common Law</hi> for
<hi>Canon Law, deep</hi> for <hi>deer, neceſſary</hi> for <hi>acceſſary, tiel</hi>
for <hi>viel, rather,</hi> for <hi>either, owner</hi> for <hi>power,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtaverunt,
ſans compulſion,</hi> was Engliſhed <hi>by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
In the word <hi>Gild</hi> two whole Lines were omitted in
<pb facs="tcp:29491:3"/>
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> imperfect; ſo likewiſe in <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,</hi>
and other words. There was alſo a miſtake in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy
in the word <hi>Pape,</hi> where <hi>Rome</hi> was ſaid to be 1500
<hi>miles</hi> from hence, full 500 too much. And ſtill as Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
were iterated, <hi>Errat's</hi> increaſed.</p>
            <p>Beſides the very many Faults which were thus crept into
this Book, it was ſo extreamly miſalphabeted, that ſome words
could not be found without much difficulty, I had almoſt ſaid
not at all: for if the <hi>Reader</hi> finds not the word he ſeeks in
its true place, he commonly lays by the Book with deſpair.</p>
            <p>To remedy theſe encreaſing Evils, I was willing to beſtow
my endeavour: Firſt, by adding above an hundred Words
with Explications in their proper places, and <hi>making refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi>
to others, where needful. Secondly, by <hi>Correcting</hi>
the whole Work in what I found amiſs, and retrenching ſome
antiquated and tautological Expreſſions as they occurred.
Thirdly, by <hi>adding</hi> to ſome old words ſuch late Statutes as
alter or concern the Law eſtabliſhed by them. And laſtly, by
digeſting the whole into an exact <hi>Alphabet,</hi> and taking care
to prevent Errors of the Preſs.</p>
            <p>That I intended well, I can give you but my word: how I
have performed, I make my <hi>Reader</hi> Judge.</p>

<hi>Acceſſory</hi> before the Fact is he
that commends or procures ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to do Felony, and is not
there preſent himſelf when the
other does it; but if he be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
then he is called Principal.
<hi>Acceſſory</hi> after the offence is he
that receives, favours, aids, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,
or comforts any man that
hath done any Murther or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
whereof he hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Such an Acceſſory ſhall
be puniſhed, and ſhall have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life and member, as well
as the Principal which did the
Felony: but ſuch an Acceſſory
ſhall never be put to anſwer that
till the Principal be attaint or
convict, or be outlawed thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In Manſlaughter a man
cannot be Acceſſory before the
fact, for Manſlaughter ought to
enſue upon a ſudden debate or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray;

it is Murther, <hi>Co. l.</hi> 4. <hi>fo.</hi> 44.  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is compounded of two words,
namely, <hi>Aggregatio</hi> and <hi>Menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
that is, Agreement of
minds. So that Agreement
is a conſent of minds in ſome
things done or to be done; and

words, <hi>Aggregatio</hi> and <hi>Mentium,</hi>
and by the haſty and ſhort pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing

one word, to wit, <hi>Aggreamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
which is no other than a
joyning, coupling, and knitting
together of two or more minds
in any thing done or to be done.
(See after in <hi>Teſtament.</hi>) And
this Agreement is in three
manners.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is an Agreement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
already at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is an Agreement
after an act done by another, and
is an Agreement executed alſo.</p>
                  <p>The third is an Agreement
executory, or to be done in time
yet to come.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, which is an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
executed already at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
is ſuch whereof menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is made in the Stat. of 25 <hi>E.</hi>
3. <hi>c</hi> 3. of Clothes, in the 4<hi>th</hi> Sat.
which ſaith, That the goods
and things bought by foreſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
being thereof attainted,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29491:21"/>
ſhall be forfeit to the King, if the
buyer have made gree with the
ſeller. In which caſe the word
(<hi>gree</hi>) which is otherwiſe called
Agreement, ſhall be extended to
Agreement executed, that is,
payment for the things.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond manner of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, where one doth a thing
or act, and another agrees or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
thereunto afterwards: as if
one make a Diſſeiſin to my uſe,
&amp; afterwards I agree to it, now I
ſhall be a Diſſeiſor from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
And ſuch Agreement is
an Agreement after an act done.</p>
                  <p>The third agreement is, when
both parties at one time are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
that ſuch a thing ſhall be
done in time to come: and this
agreement is executory, in as
much as the thing ſhall be done
after, and yet there their minds
agreed at one time. But becauſe
the performance ſhall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and the thing upon which
the Agreement was made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to be done, that Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall be called Executory.
And that the Stat. of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 3.
doth prove, which ſaith, That
every Vicar, Parſon, and ſuch
liks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before their actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
or medling with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of their Benefices, ſhall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie,

the King the Firſt-fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp;
if any ſuch Parſon or Vicar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
enter in actual poſſeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
this Agreement is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
executory, as common u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
proves: for it is uſed, that
he, with one or two with him,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29491:21"/>
do make two or three Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for it is to be paid at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
days after. And this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
executory is divided<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into two points: One is
an Agreement executory which
is certain at the beginning, as
is ſaid laſt before of the Firſt-fruits.</p>
                  <p>The other is, when the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
doth not appear at the
firſt, and the parties are agreed
that the thing ſhall be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or payed upon the certainty
known: as if one ſell to another

                     <hi>APpropriations</hi> were, when
thoſe Houſes of Religion,
and thoſe religious perſons,
as Abbots, Priors, and ſuch
like had the Advowſon of any
Parſonage to them and their
Succeſſors, and obtained licence
of the Pope, Ordinary, and
King, that they themſelves and
their Succeſſors from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
ſhould be Parſons there,
and that it ſhould be from
thanceforth a Vicarage, and the
Vicar ſhould ſerve the Cure.
And ſo at the beginning Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations
were made only to
thoſe perſons Spiritual that
could adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and ſay divine Service,
as Abbots, Priors, Deans, and
ſuch like. After by little and
little they were enlarged and
made to others, as namely to a
Dean and Chapter, which is a
Body corporate, conſſſting of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29491:30"/>
many, which Body together
could not ſay divine Service;
and (which was more) to Nuns
that were Prioreſſes of ſome
Nunnery, which was a wicked
thing, in regard that they could
neither adminiſter Sacraments,
nor preach, nor ſay divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the Pariſhioners.</p>
                  <p>And all this was upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Hoſpitality and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
thereof. And to ſupply
theſe defects a Vicar was devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
who ſhould be Deputy to
the Priors or to the Dean and
Chapter, and alſo at the laſt to
the ſaid Abbots, and others to
ſay divine Service, and ſhould
have for his labour but a little
portion, and they to whom the
Appropriations were made
ſhould retain the greater reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues;
and they did nothing for
it, by means whereof Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
decayed in the place where
it ought to have been chiefly
maintained, namely, in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
where the Benefice was,
and where the profits grew:
and ſo it continues to this day,
if not worſe, ſince not only Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Vicar ſhall have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
portion of the Benefice, and
the Abbot and the Covent ſhall
be Parſons, and ſhall have the

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:29491:30"/>

without his aſſent.</p>
                  <p>And after the Church was
appropriated, then was it an
incident inſeparable to the

was ſo appropriated. And
therefore where the Lands of

given by the general words of
an Act of Parliament of 17 <hi>E.</hi> 2.
to the Hoſpitallers, it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged,
That the Hoſpitaliers
by the ſaid Act ſhould not have
the Appropriation, for it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably
annexed to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration

Grand <hi>Cape</hi> lies before

ſummons the Tenant to anſwer

this Capias seises the Land, and

he comes not in, the Land is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.
Yet there is difference
between theſe two courſes of the

this <hi>Miſſio in poſſeſſionem</hi> extends

<hi>Challenge principal,</hi> or perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory,

challenge to the number of

principal and challenge perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory,

ſaith, That a ſubject may be

which though they ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory,

in ſome ſenſe true: For
the King may give or alienate

that when it is once in the

of a Foreſt, becauſe the

rated by the quantity of the land
ſo held: as if it extends to a
whole Knight's Fee, then the
Tenant was bound ſo to attend
his Lord 40 days; and a
Knight's fee was ſo much land
as in thoſe days was accounted
a ſufficient living for a Knight,
and this was 680 acres, by the

for the Laws of this Realm
ſimply, without any other
Law, as Cuſtomary, Civil,
Spiritual, or whatever other
Law joyned to it; as when it is
diſputed in our Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
what ought of right to be
determined by the Common
Law, and what by the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Law, or Admirals Court,
or ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is taken for the
Kings Courts, as the Kings
Bench, or Common Place,
only to ſhew a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and baſe Courts;
as Cuſtomary Courts, Court-Barons,
County Courts, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powders,
and ſuch like: as when
a Plea of land is removed out of
ancient Demeſne, becauſe the
land is Frank-fee, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
at the Common Law,
that is to ſay, in the Kings
Court, and not in ancient
Demeſne, or in any other baſe
Court.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and moſt uſually, by
<hi>Common Law</hi> is underſtood ſuch
Laws as were generally taken
and holden for Law before any
Statute was made to alter the
ſame: as for example, Tenant
for life, nor for years, were not

                     <hi>COnfeſſion of Offence</hi> is, when
a priſoner is appealed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
of Treaſon or Felony,
and broughe to the Bar to be
arraigned; and his Indictment
is read unto him, and he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

                     <hi>Confeſſion</hi> may be made in

confeſſe the offence whereof
he is indicted openly in the
Court before the Iudge, and
ſubmit himſelf to the cenſure
and judgement of the Law:
which Confeſſion is the moſt
certain anſwer and beſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
that may be given to
the Iudge to condemn the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor,
ſo that it proceeds free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and of his own accord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any threats, force, or extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
uſed; for if the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ariſe from any of theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
it ought not to be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
As a woman was indicted
for the felonious taking of
Bread to the value of two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and being thereof ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned,
ſhe confeſſed the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:29491:92"/>
and ſaid, that ſhe did it
by the commandment of her
husband; and the Iudges in
pity would not record her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
but cauſed her to plead
Not guilty to the Felony:
whereupon the Iury found,
that ſhe ſtole the Bread by the
compulſion of her husband a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her will, for which cauſe
ſhe was diſcharged. 27 <hi>Aſſiſ.

                  <p>The other kind of <hi>Confeſſion</hi>
is, when the priſoner confeſſes
the Indictment to be true, and
that he hath committed the
Offence whereof he is indicted,
and then becomes an Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that is, an Accuſer of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who have committed the
ſame Offence whereof he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,

him; and then prayes the Iudge
to have a Coroner aſſigned him,
to whom he may make relation
of thoſe Offences, and the full
circumſtances thereof.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a third kind of
<hi>Confeſſion</hi> made by an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor

in a Church or other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged

                     <hi>COnfiſcate</hi> is derived from the
<hi>Latine Fiſcus,</hi> which origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
ſignifies a Hamper or
Basket, but metonymical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Princes Treaſure,
becauſe in ancient time it
was put in the Hampers or
Frails. And though our King
doth not put his Treaſure in
ſuch things, yet as the <hi>Romans</hi>
have ſaid, that ſuch goods as
were forfeited to the Emperors
Treaſury were <hi>Bona Confiſcata,</hi>
in like manner do we ſay of
ſuch goods as are forfeited to
the Kings Exchequer. And
the title to have theſe goods
is given to the King by the
Law, when they are not
claimed by ſome other: As if
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:29491:93"/>
a man be indicted, that he fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniouſly
ſtole the goods of
another man, where in truth
they are the proper goods of
him indicted, and they are
brought in Court againſt him
as the manner, and he there
asked what he ſays to the ſaid
goods; to which he diſclaimes:
by this Diſclaimer he ſhall loſe
the goods, although that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he be acquitted of the
Felony, and the King ſhall have
them as confiſcated. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is, if he doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
them.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Law is where
goods are found in the Felons
poſſeſſion, which he diſavows,
and afterwards is attainted of
other goods, and not of them;
there the goods which he diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vows
are confiſcate to the King:
But had he been attainted of
the ſame goods, they ſhould
have been ſaid to be <hi>forfeited,</hi>
and not <hi>confiſcate,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his Diſavowment.
So if an Appeal of Robbery
be brought, and the Plaintiff
leaves out ſome of his goods, he
ſhall not be received to enlarge
his Appeal; and foraſmuch as
there is none to have the goods
ſo left out, the King ſhall have
them as confiſcate, according
to the old rule, <hi>Quod non capit
Chriſtus, capit Fiſcus.</hi> And as
in the caſe aforeſaid the Law
puniſhes the owner for his
negligence and connivency, ſo
the Law abhors malice, in
ſeeking the bloud of any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:29491:93"/>
juſt cauſe. And therefore
if <hi>A.</hi> hath the goods of <hi>B.</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,

an Appeal againſt <hi>A.</hi> for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them feloniouſly, and it is

in this caſe theſe goods are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate
to the King, becauſe of the

When the Coroner is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

politick, as Biſhop, Parſon,
Vicar, Maſter of Hoſpital, &amp;c.
no Chattel either in action or
poſſeſſion ſhall go in ſucceſſion,
but the Executors or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators
of the Biſhop, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
&amp;c. ſhall have them; for
Succeſſion in a Body politick
is as Inheritance in caſe of a
body private. But otherwiſe
is in caſe of a Corporation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of many, as a Dean and
Chapter, Mayor and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:29491:107"/>
and ſuch like; for there
they in judgement of the Law
never die.</p>
                  <p>Yet the caſe of the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
of <hi>London</hi> differs from all
theſe, and his Succeſſors may in
his own name have Execution of
a Recogniſance acknowledged to
his Predeceſſor for Orphanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money:
and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in this caſe the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Chamberlain is by
Cuſtome, and the ſame Cuſtome
that hath created him, and made
a Corporation in Succeſſion,
as to the ſaid ſpecial purpoſe
concerning Orphanage, hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
the Succeſſor to take
ſuch Recogniſances, Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp;c. that are made to his
Predeceſſor. And this Cuſtom
is founded upon great reaſon;
for the Executors or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators
of the Chamberlain
ought not to intermeddle with
ſuch Recogniſances, Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp;c. which by the ſaid Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
are taken in the corporate
capacity of the Chamberlain,
and not in his private. But a
Biſhop, Parſon, &amp;c. or any ſole
Corporation, that are Bodies
politick by preſcription; cannot
take a Recogniſance or Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but only to their private,
and not in their politick capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city:
for they want Cuſtome to
take a Chattel in their politick

he ſhall not be Tenant by the

                  <p>And foraſmuch as Iuſtice and

ſhould have ſatisfaction
therefore againſt his falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
and if he hath not ſufficient,

the Common Law gave Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
to the Defendant in an
Appeal, and aſſigned him a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:29491:122"/>
means for the recovery thereof,
when he was acquitted of the
Felony, as it is 48 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 22. But
foraſmuch as the Dammages
againſt the Procurors and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors
were to be recovered by
Original Writ, that is, by
Writ of Conſpiracy, and not
otherwiſe, which was not ſo
ſpeedy remedy as the Heinous

the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> the 2. <hi>An.</hi>

the Plaintiff, except the
Barr be ſuch as acquits the
Defendant of the Felony. And
if the Defendant pleads that
the Appellant is a Baſtard, or
hath an elder Brother, or like
Pleas in barre, and thereby
barrs the Plaintiff; yet he ſhall
not recover Dammages againſt
him, becauſe the Defendant
may be indicted again of the
ſame Felony, and attainted,

Pleas; for by them the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of the Defendant is not
tried, and therefore he ſhall not

The ſame Law is, if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
barrs the Appellant by

But if the Defendant in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal

<hi>cap.</hi> 9. where Coſts are included

is made worſe; and
in this ſenſe Coſts of Suit are
Dammages to the Plaintiff,
for by them his Subſtance is
diminiſhed. But when the
Plaintiff declares the wrong
done to him to the Dammage
of ſuch a ſumme, this is to be
taken relatively for the wrong
which is paſſed before the
Writ brought, and are aſſeſſed
by reaſon of the Treſpaſs afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
and cannot extend to Coſts
of Suit which are future, and
of another nature. See <hi>Co. l.</hi>

for by it not onely all

As a Releaſe of Suits is more

of Demands is more large
and beneficial than either of

releaſed, and more. By Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe

of all Demands to the Diſſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Littleton, fol.</hi> 170. holds,

his Vncle, who enfeoffs
another in fee with Warranty;
if after the Feoffee by his Deed
releaſes to the Vncle all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Demands, by ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
the Warranty, which is
a Covenant real and executory,
is extinct: and the reaſon is,
becauſe that by Releaſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
all the means and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and their cauſes, which
any hath to Lands, Tenements,
Goods, Chattels, &amp;c. are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,

the right and intereſt it ſelf

of all Demands doth not
extend to ſuch Writs by which
nothing is demanded, neither
in Deed nor in Law, but lie
only to relieve the Plaintiff by

wiſe as to make his Will in
his good health, when he is
ſtrong, of good memory, and
hath time and leiſure to ask
counſell (if any doubt were)
of the Learned, that then he
ſhould not live long after; and
therefore they deferre it to ſuch
time when it were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to apply themſelves
to the diſpoſitions of their
Souls, than of their Lands or
Goods, except it were that by
the freſh memory and recital
of them at that time, it might
be a cauſe to put them in mind
of ſome of their goods or lands
falſly gotten, and ſo move
them to reſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
at that time the penning of
ſuch Wills is commonly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Miniſter of
the Pariſh, or to ſome other
more ignorant, who knows not
what words are neceſſary to
make an Eſtate in Fee-ſimple,
Fee-tail, for term of life, or
ſuch like, beſides many other
miſchiefs: I will therefore
here ſet down ſome of thoſe
Caſes that are moſt common
in ignorant mens mouths,
and carry, by the wiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of the Judges,
a larger and more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſenſe in Wills, than in
Deeds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, if one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
to <hi>J. S.</hi> by his Will all his
Lands and Tenements; here
not only all thoſe Lands that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:29491:143"/>
he hath in poſſeſſion do paſs,
but all thoſe that he hath in
Reverſion, by virtue of thoſe
words, Tenements.</p>
                  <p>And if Lands be deviſed to a
man to have to him for ever, or
to have to him and his Aſſigns;
in theſe two caſes the Deviſee
ſhall have a Fee-ſimple. But if
it be given by Feoffment in ſuch
manner, he hath but an Eſtate
for term of life.</p>
                  <p>And if a man deviſe his Land
to another, to give, ſell, or do
therewith at his pleaſure or
will; this is Fee-ſimple</p>
                  <p>A Deviſe made to one and to
his Heirs males doth make an
Eſtate-tail: But if ſuch words
be put in a Deed of Feoffment,
it ſhall be taken for Fee-ſimple,
becauſe it doth not appear of
what body the Heirs males ſhall
be begotten.</p>
                  <p>If Lands be given by Deed
to <hi>J. S.</hi> and to the Heirs males
of his body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who hath iſſue a
daughter, who hath iſſue a ſon,
and dies; there the Land ſhall
return to the Donor, and the
ſon of the Daughter ſhall nor
have it, becauſe he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
himſelf by Heirs males, for
his mother is a let thereto:
But otherwiſe it is of ſuch a
<hi>Deviſe,</hi> for there the ſon of the
daughter ſhall have it, rather
then the Will ſhall be void.</p>
                  <p>If one deviſe to an Infant
in his mothers belly, it is a
good Deviſe; but otherwiſe by
Feoffment, Grant, or Gift;
for in thoſe caſes there ought to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:29491:143"/>
be one of ability to take preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or otherwiſe it is void. See
14. <hi>El. Dy.</hi> 304.</p>
                  <p>A Deviſe made in Fee-ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
without expreſſe words of
Heirs, is good in Fee-ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>But if a Deviſe be made to
<hi>J. N.</hi> he ſhall have the Land
but for term of life; for thoſe
words will carry no greater
Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>If one will that his ſon <hi>J.</hi>
ſhall have his Land after the
death of his wife; here the wife
of the Deviſor ſhall have the
Land firſt for term of life. So
likewiſe if a man deviſe his
goods to his wife, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the deceaſe of his wife, his
ſon and heir ſhall have the Houſe
where the goods are; there the
ſon ſhall not have the Houſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the life of the wife: For it
doth appear that his intent
was, that his wife ſhould have
the Houſe alſo for her life,
notwithſtanding it were not
deviſed to her by expreſs words.</p>
                  <p>If a Deviſe be to <hi>J. N.</hi> and
to the Heirs females of his body
begotten, after the Deviſee hath
iſſue a ſon and daughter, and
dies; here the daughter ſhall
have the Land, and not the ſon,
and yet he is the moſt worthy
perſon, and Heir to his father:
but becauſe the Will of the dead
is, that the daughter ſhould have
it, Law and Conſcience will ſo
alſo.</p>

                     <hi>DOwer,</hi> by the Law of the

<hi>Dower,</hi> by the Cuſtome of
ſome places, is to have half

is alſo a Writ that lies where
a man is ſole ſeiſed, during the
Coverture between him and
his wife, of Lands or Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

where by poſſibility the

if ſuch a man die, his wife ſhall
recover the third part of all the

was ſole ſeiſed any time during

<hi>Dower unde nihil habet,</hi> though
he died not ſeiſed, and though he
made Alienation thereof in his

two men were ſeiſed of
Lands to the uſe of one of them,
and he to whoſe uſe, &amp;c. died
before the ſaid Statute, his

Alſo if a woman bring a Writ
of Dower, ſhe ſhould recover
Dammages for the profit run
after the death of her husband,
if he died ſeiſed thereof: but if
any Alienation or Eſtate were

But in divers caſes a
woman ſhall not have Dower,

to his Offence, and ſhall
ſuffer death, if they knew of
the Fact; yet one doth ſuch an
act, and comes to his wife, who
knowing thereof doth receive
him, and gives him meat and
drink, ſhe ſhall not be Acceſſary
nor Felon; for by the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <p>And thus <hi>Equity</hi> doth correct
the generality of the Law in

                  <p>The other <hi>Equity</hi> is defined

although the Execution was

the Hiſtory of <hi>Battel Abbey,</hi>
where <hi>Richard Lucie</hi> Chief Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of <hi>England,</hi> in the time of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have blamed a mean
Subject, for that he uſed a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Seal, whereas that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
(as he ſaid) to the
King and Nobility only.</p>
                  <p>At which time alſo (as <hi>J.
Roſſe</hi> notes it) they uſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave
in their Seals their own
Pictures and Counterfeits, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with a long Coat over
their Armors. But after this,
the Gentlemen of the better
ſort took up the Faſhion, and
becauſe they were not all War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
they made Seals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
with their ſeveral
Coats or Shields of Arms,
for difference ſake, as the ſame
Author reports. At length,
about the time of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the third, Seals became very
common; ſo that not only ſuch
as bare Arms uſed to Seal,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:29491:192"/>
but other men alſo faſhioned
to themſelves Signers of their
own devices, ſome taking the
Letters of their own Names,
ſome Flowers, ſome Knots
and Flouriſhes, ſome Birds
and Beaſts, and ſome other
things, as we now yet daily
ſee uſed.</p>
                  <p>Some other manners of Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beſides theſe have been
heard of among us; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
third, by which he gave to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

<q>
                        <l>The Hop and the Hop-Town,</l>
                        <l>With all the bounds upſide

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like to this was ſhewed
me by one of my Friends in
a looſe Paper, but not very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
written, and therefore he

<hi>Powlen Royden</hi> my Hop and
my Hop-Lands, with all the
bounds up and down, from
Heaven to Earth, from Earth
to Hell, for thee and thine to
dwell, from me and mine, to
thee and thine, for a Bow and
a broad Arrow, when I come

that this is ſooth, I bit this

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:29491:192"/>
of <hi>Magge, Maud,</hi> and
<hi>Margery, and</hi> my third ſon
<hi>Henry,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo that of <hi>Alberick de Vere,</hi>
containing the Donation of
<hi>Hatfield,</hi> to which he affixed a
ſhort black-hafted knife, like
an old half-peny whittle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a Seal: with Divers
ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>But ſome peradventure will
think, that theſe were received
in common uſe and cuſtom and
that they were not the devices

Charter and Writing, that
hath no Seal annexed, to be
as ancient as the Conqueſt;
whereas indeed Sealing was
not commonly uſed till the time
of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. as hath been
already ſaid.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Delivery,</hi> though it be ſet
laſt, is not the leaſt; for after a
Deed is written and ſealed, if it
be not <hi>delivered,</hi> all the reſt is
to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>Delivery</hi> ought to be
done by the party himſelf, or his
ſufficient Warrant; and ſo it
will binde him whoſoever wrote
or ſealed the ſame: and by
this laſt act the Deed is
made perfect, according to the
intent and effect of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Deeds the Delivery is to
be proved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, Writing and
Sealing, without Delivery,
is nothing to purpoſe: Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Delivery, where there
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:29491:193"/>
is no Writing: work nothing:
And Writing and Delivery,
without Sealing, make no

                  <p>And in every Caſe where a

ſues a Writ of <hi>Formedon,</hi> by

a <hi>Lineal Warranty,</hi> whereby the

But if he may not by any

the Iſſue in tail ſhall be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
without any Aſſets. And
the cauſe that ſuch a <hi>Collateral
Warranty</hi> is a Bar to the Iſſue
in the tail is, for that all War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranties,
before the Statute of
<hi>Glouceſter,</hi> which diſcended to
thoſe who are Heirs to the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantors,
were Bars to the ſame
Heirs to demand any Lands,
except the warranties that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
by Diſſeiſin; and for that
the ſaid Statute hath ordained,
That the warranty of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall be no Bar to his
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:29491:212"/>
Son for the Lands which come
by the Heritage of the Mother,
nor the Warranty of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall be no Bar to the Son
for the Lands which come by the
Heritage of the Father; and
neither the Stat. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.
nor any other Statute, hath
ordained any remedy againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other <hi>Collateral Warranty;</hi>
therefore ſuch Warranty is yet
in force, and ſhall be a bar to the
Iſſue in tail, as it was before the
Statute.</p>
                  <p>And it behoves that every
Warranty, whereby the Heir
ſhall be barred, diſcend by
courſe of the Common Law to
him who is Heir to the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantor;
elſe it ſhall be no Bar:
for if the Tenant in Tail of
Lands in Borough Engliſh,
where the youngeſt ſon ſhall
Inherit by the Cuſtome, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continues
the tail, and hath Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
two ſons, and the Vncle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſes

Warranty, and dies, and the
younger Son brings a <hi>Formedon;</hi>
yet he ſhall not be barred by
ſuch Warranty, <hi>cauſa qua ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</hi>
And if any man make a
Deed with <hi>Warranty,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
his Heir ſhould be barred, and
after the Warrantor be attaint
of Felony; his Heir ſhall not be
barred by ſuch Warranty, for
that ſuch Warranty cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
upon him, the blood being
corrupt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Warranty beginning by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiſin</hi>
is, if the ſon purchaſe
Lands, and let them to his
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:29491:213"/>
Father for years, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Deed infeoffs a
ſtranger, and binds him and his
Heirs to Warranty, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dies, whereby the warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
diſcends to the ſon; yet this
warranty ſhall not bar the ſon,
but the ſon may well enter not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
becauſe this
<hi>Warranty began by Diſſeiſin,</hi>
when the Father made the
Feoffment, which was a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin
to the ſon. And as it is
ſaid of the Father, ſo it may be
ſaid of every other Anceſtor.
And the ſame Law is, if the
Anceſtor be Tenant by <hi>Elegit,</hi>
or by Statute-Merchant, and
make a Feoffment with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,
ſuch Warranties ſhall be
no Bars, becauſe they begin by

                  <p>
                     <hi>LIvery of Seiſin</hi> is a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
uſed in Conveyance of
Lands and Tenements, where
an Eſtate in Fee-ſimple, Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,
or a Free-hold ſhall paſs.
And it is a Teſtimonial of the
willing departing of him who
makes the Livery from the
thing whereof Livery is made.
And the receiving of the Livery
is a willing Acceptance by the
other party of all that whereof
the other hath deveſted himſelf.
And it was invented as an open
and notorious thing, by means
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:29491:243"/>
whereof the common People
might have knowledge of the
Paſſing or Alteration of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
from man to man, that
thereby they might be the better
able to try in whom the right
and poſſeſſion of Lands and
Tenements were, if they ſhould
be impanelled in Juries, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
have to do concerning
the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The common manner of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of Seiſin</hi> is thus: If it
be in the open Field, where is
no Building or Houſe, then one
that can read takes the Writing
in his hand, if the Eſtate paſs
by Deed, and declares to the
ſtanders by the cauſe of their
meeting there together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
then openly reads the Deed,
or declares the effect thereof;
and after that is ſealed, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
who is to depart from the
Ground takes the Deed in his
hands, with a Clod of the earth,
and a Twig or Bough, if any
be there, which he delivers to
the other party in the name of
Poſſeſſion or Seiſin, according
to the form and effect of the
Deed there read or declared.
But if there be a Dwelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
or Building upon the
Land, then this is done at the
Door of the ſame, none being
left at that time within the
Houſe; and the party delivers
all aforeſaid, with the Ring
of the Door, in the name of
Seiſin or Poſſeſſion; and he
that receives the Livery enters
in firſt alone, and ſhuts the door,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:29491:243"/>
and preſently opens it again,
and lets them in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it be
a Houſe whereto is no Land or
Ground, the Livery is made
and Poſſeſſion taken by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of the Ring of the Door
and Deed only. And where it
is without Deed, either of Lands
or Tenements, there the party
declares by word of mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
witneſs, the Eſtate that he
means to depart with, and then
delivers Seiſin or Poſſeſſion in
manner aforeſaid; And ſo the
Land or Tenement doth paſs
as well as by Deed, and that by
force of the Livery of Seiſin.
It was agreed in <hi>Gray's Inne</hi> by
Maſter <hi>Snagge,</hi> at his Reading
there in Summer, <hi>Anno</hi> 1574.
That if a Feoffor deliver the
Deed in view of the Land,
in name of Seiſin, that is
good, becauſe he hath a Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in himſelf. But otherwiſe it
is of an Attorney, for he muſt
go to the Land, and take Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
himſelf, before he can give
Poſſeſſion to another, according
to the words of his Warrant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>MOrtgage, or Morgage</hi> is, when
a Man makes a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to another on ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that if the Feoffor pay
the Feoffee at a certain day
40 li. of money, then the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offor
may re-enter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In
this caſe the Feoffee is called
Tenant in <hi>Morgage.</hi> And as
a Man may make a Feoffment
in Fee in <hi>Morgage,</hi> ſo he may
make a Gift in Tail, or a Leaſe
for Life or Years in <hi>Morgage.</hi>
And it ſeems the cauſe why it
is called <hi>Morgage</hi> is, for that it
ſtands it doubt whether the
Feoffoe will pay the mony
at the day appointed or not;
and if he fail, then the Land
which he laid in <hi>gage</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of payment of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is gone from him for ever,
and ſo <hi>dead</hi> to him upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
but if he pay the mony,
then is the <hi>gage dead</hi> as to the
Tenant, that is, the Feoffee.
And for this cauſe it is called
in <hi>Latine, Mortuum vadium,</hi> as
<hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith; or rather <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum
vas,</hi> as I think.</p>
                  <p>Alſo if a Feoffment be made
in <hi>Morgage</hi> upon condition, that
if the Feoffor pay ſuch a ſum
at ſuch a day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the
Feoffor dies before the day,
yet if the Heir of the Feoffor
pay the ſum at the ſame day to
the Feoffee, and the Feoffee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
it, the Heir of the Feoffor
may enter. But in ſuch caſe
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:29491:254"/>
if there be no day of payment
expreſſed, then ſuch Tender of
the Heir is void, becauſe when
the Feoffor dies, the time of
Tender is paſt; otherwiſe the
Heirs of the Feoffor ſhall
have time of Tender for ever,
which would be inconvenient,
that one ſhall have a Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simple
to him and his Heirs
defeaſible always at the pleaſure
and will of others. But in the
firſt caſe the time of Tender
was not expired by the death of
the Feoffor.</p>

he have not any Iſſue, and that

                  <p>Alſo Partition by Agreement
may be made by the Law, as
well by Word without Deed,
as by Deed. And if they are
of full age, the Partition ſhall
remain for ever, and ſhall never

                  <p>But if the Lands be to them

dies the Wife may diſagree
from the Partition. Alſo if the

makes Partition, when ſhe

Pleading, when any will
not directly affirm, nor directly
deny anything that is alledged
by another, or which he himſelf
alledges. And it is in two ſorts.
One is, when one pleads any
thing which he dare not directly
affirm, or cannot plead for
doubt to make his plea double:
As if in conveying to himſelf a
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:29491:283"/>
Title to any Land, he ought
to plead divers Diſcents by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
perſons, and he dare not
affirm that all they were ſeiſed
at the time of their death, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he could do it, it ſhall be
double to plead two Diſcents;
of both which each by it ſelf
may be a good Bar. Then the
Defendant ought to plead and
alledged the matter, interlacing
this word <hi>proteſtando,</hi> as to ſay,
that ſuch a one died (by <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation</hi>)
ſeiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that is
to be alledged by Proteſtation,
and not to be traverſed by the
other. Another Proteſtation is,
when one is to anſwer to two
matters, and yet by the Law
he ought to plead but to one;
then in the firſt part of the Plea
he ſhall ſay to the one matter,
<hi>proteſtando,</hi> and <hi>non cognoſcendo</hi>
this matter to be true, and
makes his Plea farther by theſe
words, <hi>Sed pro placito dicit, &amp;c.</hi>
And this is for ſaving to the
party (that ſo pleads by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation)
the being concluded
by any matter alledged or obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
againſt him, upon which he
cannot joyn iſſue; and is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but an excluſion of the
Concluſion; for he that takes
the Proteſtation excludes the
other party to conclude him.
And the Proteſtation ought
to ſtand with the ſequel of the
Plea, and not to be repugnant,
or otherwiſe contrary.</p>

for that ſuch an Heir is Tenant

that is a <hi>Remitter</hi> to the Heir:

                     <hi>VOlunt</hi> is, when the Tenant
holds at the Will of the
Leſſor, or Lord: and that is in
two manners.</p>
                  <p>One is, when I make a
Leaſe to a man of Lands, to
hold at my Will, then I may
put him out at my pleaſure:
but if he ſow the Ground, and
I put him out, then he ſhall
have his Corn, with egreſs
and regreſs till it be ripe, to
cut and carry it out of the
ground.</p>
                  <p>Such Tenant at Will is not
bound to ſuſtain and repair
the Houſe, as Tenant for
years is: But if he make
wilful waſte, the Leſſor ſhall
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:29491:331"/>
have againſt him an Action of
Treſpaſs.</p>
                  <p>Alſo there is another Tenant
at Will of the Lord, by Copy
of Court-Roll, according to
the Cuſtome of the Mannor:
and ſuch a Tenant may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
the Land into the hands
of the Lord, according to the
Cuſtom, to the uſe of another
for Life, in fee, or in tail; and
then he ſhall take the Land of
the Lord, or his Steward,
by Copy, and ſhall make Fine
to the Lord. But if the Lord
put out ſuch a Tenant, he hath
no remedy but to ſue by Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And if ſuch a Tenant
will implead another of the
Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ought to enter
a Plaint in the Court, and
ſhall declare in the nature of
what Writ he will, as the caſe
lies.</p>
