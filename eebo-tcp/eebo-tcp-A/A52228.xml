            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>News from the Seſsions, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AT this Seſſions for <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and Goal-delivery of Newgate, amongſt many other Criminals of diverſe kinds, <hi>George Allen</hi> for the heinouſneſs of his barbarous crime, was ſadly remarkable above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Having not onely committed a bloody mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſuch as was aggravated to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by being perpetrated on a poor innocent of the weaker ſex, and the neareſt Relation in the VVorld: This inhumane Fact was done on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> of this inſtant <hi>February</hi> in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening. In the Fields behind <hi>Iſlington</hi> (lately the bloody ſcene of ſeveral lamentable Tragedies, as that of the eminent Quaker who drown'd himſelf in VVheelers-pond on Friday night the 12<hi>th.</hi> inſtant whoſe corps was not found till Thurſday laſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother perſon ſince killed in a fray not far from thence. The manner how this <hi>Allen</hi> came to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and diſcovered was thus. The murthered par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty his wife, and he had for a long time lived at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; inſomuch that ſhe was forced to leave him, and return home to <hi>Uxbridge</hi> her native place, to live with her friends, and had lived from him there for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Two years: During which time he being by trade a Butcher, workt as journy-man with one of that profeſſion in an Alley in <hi>Turn-Mill-Street</hi>; but the week before the murther committed he went down thither, and ſeeming very willing to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106142:3"/>
by fair words prevailed with the womans cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and good nature to live with him again, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing for to uſe her far more kindly for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and accordingly on Friday the fifth inſtant they came up together from thence to London, and arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Grays-Inn Lane</hi> juſt as it began to be dark, but he pretending that his Lodging was a great way off, led her from thence round through Hatton-Garden, and ſo again into the fields, where he inveigled her along till they came as aforeſaid behind Iſlington, near the Gravel-pits, and there carrying her pattins for her with one of them he knockt her on the head, and leaving her dead went home to his Lodging in <hi>Turn-Mill-ſtreet</hi>: next morning her body was found, and comming to ſtrip her, in her ſtocking they found her wedding ring, which 'tis more than probable ſhe had hid there, that he might not take it away from her, it being his uſual cuſtome formerly to plunder her of every thing of any value to ſupply his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagencies. The rumour of a woman ſo found, who by all circumſtances appear'd to have been murthered, ſpreading about the country, ſoon came to <hi>Uxbridge</hi> where her Father and Uncle were living, who no ſooner heard it but they were ſtruck with a kind of prophetical apprehenſion, that it might be this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon murthered by her unnatural Husband. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered a friend that was comming to London to inquire after it, who comming to Iſlington knew the ſlain perſons cloaths, and thence concluding on violent preſumptions that her husband muſt indeed have a hand in it, immediately procures a Warrant and apprehends him in <hi>Newgate Market,</hi> before the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106142:3"/>
Juſtice of Peace, he abſolutely denyed all, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed he parted with his Wife at <hi>Grays-Inn-Lane</hi> end, and ſince had neither ſeen nor known what was become of her. But being committed to Newgate, and forced (for he was very unwilling) to go to hear the Sermon there the next Lords day. It ſeems the ſame made ſome impreſſion on his ſpirit, for the next Day being cloſely examined, he confeſt he did K<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll her, and that the intention of the murther firſt entred into his heart as they were paſſing over Hatton-Garden, and that he did it with one of her Pattins, which was ſufficiently proved now in Court, for notwithſtanding ſuch his acknowledgement at the Barr, he pleaded, <hi>Not Guilty</hi>: It was alſo proved by ſeveral perſons from <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly attempted to Poyſen her, and to that purpoſe had ſent her ſeveral times Poyſon, which once before had like to have coſt her her life, and alſo that here in <hi>London</hi> he kept company, and was in League with another woman, whom he had promis'd Marriage, and appointed a day for that purpoſe: telling her, his wife in the Country had married another man; and therefore he was free to diſpoſe of himſelf: yet being queſtioned, he now cleared that perſon, and affirmed that ſhe neither inſtigated him, nor was privy to this Murther. There was likewiſe a letter produced and read, which he owned to be of his writeing, it was dated on the Munday after the Fact, directed to his Wives Father (contrived on purpoſe to conceal his Guilt) for therein he acquainted them his wife was very well, and that he had taken a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

houſe, beyond <hi>London,</hi> at <hi>Stratford, &amp;c.</hi> All which making his Murtherous intention ſo apparent he could not at laſt deny that he Kill'd her, but ſaid it, on provocation of ill Language, and that ſhe tore him by the Hair, whereupon he did indeed ſtrike her a blow with her Pattin, and left her on the ground, but did not think to have Killed her; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to give any account why he led her that way, at that time o'th night, his deſign was evident: Being askt what he had to ſay for himſelf, one of the Honourable Judges, no leſs Gravely then Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly told him his Condition, required him rather to ſay much againſt himſelf, as being Guilty of ſo great and horrible a ſin, of which he feared he was not ſufficiently ſenſible: To which the Priſoner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that indeed he was not ſenſible of it, and that he hoped that the Court would pitty him: and ſo deſired Tranſportation. But was told, that our Laws are more Juſt then to allow that favour to ſuch bloody Criminals: ſo he was left to the Jury, who Immediately brought him in Guilty of Murther.</p>
            <p>There was alſo one <hi>John Harter,</hi> Endicted for Felony, his Caſe appeared on proof to be thus: a Gentleman of <hi>Barkſhire</hi> uſually lying at an Inn in <hi>Old-Fiſh-ſtreet,</hi> where this <hi>John</hi> was Oaſtler, being to go forth o'th Town early on Munday Morning, the 15<hi>th.</hi> inſtant, deſired him to get his Horſe ready, which being done, he having One hundred and Twenty pounds to carry down with him, lays it on the Saddle, and then ſteps into his Chamber, or the Kitchin to fetch his Coat: Whilſt he was gone, <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106142:4"/>
having notice of the Money, mounrs the Steed, and rides away with the Money directly to <hi>Cain-wood,</hi> where taking out ſo much of the Mony as he thought fit far his preſent Occaſion, which was to buy him a Perriwigg and new Suit, that he might paſs undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he hides the reſt there, and brings the horſe into a By-Lane neer <hi>Holloway,</hi> and there leaves him tyed, and comes back to <hi>Lon<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Jury at firſt brought him in, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> as ſuppoſing it could not be Felony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Horſe was delivered by the Owner into the Oaſtlers Cuſtody, But upon the advice of the Court, that he had no ſuch ſpecial cuſtody committed to him, and the Witneſſes better explaining his former Teſtimony, they amended their Verdict, and found him Guilty.</p>
            <p>A perſon was indicted for robbing a Woman in the Evening near <hi>Thistle worth</hi>; who teſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

A Shepheard hearing her cry out, making to her reſcue, ſavv them at a diſtance and purſued one of them near half a mile, of whom he gave a deſcription ſo like the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at Bar that he was apprehended and preſented upon ſuſpition.
