            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the defects of the Doctors diſcourſe, of this Subject.</head>
               <p>TWo things me thinks I finde wanting in this

of a Sacrifice, <hi>Properly</hi> ſo called, the other is
how it can properly be termed a Sacrifice, and yet
be onely commemorative, or repreſentative as he
cals it.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe, unleſſe the thing be
firſt defined, whereof men diſpute, all their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
muſt needs prove fruitleſſe in the end, this
then becauſe the Doctor hath omitted, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to finde out the definition of a Sacrifice
<hi>Properly</hi> ſo called. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 10. Book
<hi>de Civit. Dei</hi> and 6. <hi>cap.</hi> teacheth that, <hi>Verum ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium
eſt omne opus quod agitur ut ſancta ſocietate inhaerea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Deo relatum ſcilicet ad illum finem boni, quo veraciter
beati eſſe poſsimus.</hi> Where by <hi>verum</hi> I do not beleeve
that he underſtands a truth of <hi>propriety,</hi> but of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
and ſo much I think will eaſily appear by
thoſe words of his in the Chapter going before.
<hi>Illud quod ab hominibus appellatur Sacrificium, ſignum eſt
veri Sacrificii,</hi> where undoubtedly by the true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
he underſtands either the inward Sacrifice of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112896:3"/>
the heart, or the Sacrifice of religious actions flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from thence, which he makes to be the true
Sacrifice in regard of excellency, though <hi>improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
ſo called, and the outward Sacrifice to be but a
ſigne of this, though <hi>Properly</hi> ſo called; In which
regard <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his firſt Book <hi>de Miſſa,</hi> and ſecond
Chapter rejects this definition, or rather deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as not agreeing to a Sacrifice <hi>Properly</hi> ſo called,
which he proves by many reaſons, and thereupon
brings another of his own which is this, <hi>Sacrificium
eſt oblatio externa facta ſoli Dea, qua ad agnitionem humanae
infirmitatis &amp; profeſsionem divinae majeſtatis à legitimo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrores
aliqua ſenſibilis &amp; permanens ritu myſtico conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
&amp; tranſmutatur.</hi> The particular parts of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
he afterwards explicates, and tels us that
the laſt word <hi>tranſmutatur</hi> is therefore added, <hi>Quia
ad verum Sacrificium requiritur, ut id quod offertur Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Sacrifi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

eſſe id quod antea erat.</hi> And leaſt we ſhould miſtake
him, within a while after he repeats the ſame in
effect again, giving us a double reaſon thereof,
whereof the latter is <hi>quia Sacrificium eſt ſumma prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatio
Subjectionis noſtrae ad Deum, ſumma autem illa pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatio
requirit ut non uſus rei Deo offeratur ſed ipſa etiam
ſubſtantia, &amp; ideo non ſolum uſus ſed ſubſtantia conſuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
And this condition in a Sacrifice <hi>properly</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
is likewiſe required by our own men, as namely
by Doctor <hi>Field</hi> in his Appendix to his third Book
of the Church.<note place="margin">Pag. 207.</note> If we will Sacrifice a thing unto
God (ſaith he) we muſt not onely preſent it unto
him, but conſume it alſo. Thus in th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Leviticall
law, things ſacrificed that had life were killed,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112896:4"/>
things without life, if they were ſolid, were burnt,
if liquid, powred forth and ſpilt.</p>
               <p>Now this ground being thus laid, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
learn of the Doctor what ſenſible thing it is
in his Sacrifice, which is thus deſtroyed or conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in regard of the being or ſubſtance thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                  <hi rend="sup">a</hi> He muſt of neceſſity anſwer (as I conceive) that
either it is the elements of bread and wine, or the
ſacred Body and Bloud of Chriſt; but how the
bread and wine may be ſaid to be conſumed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their ſubſtance, without admitting tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation
I cannot imagine, unleſſe perchance
he will ſay that it is by eating the one, and drinking
the other; but theſe being acts common to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
with the Prieſt, if the eſſence and perfection
of the Sacrifice ſhould conſiſt in this, he will be
forced to admit of ſo many Sacrificers, as there
are Communicants, which I preſume he will not
acknowledge. And if he will have it ſtand in the
eating and drinking of the Prieſt alone, in caſe he
ſhould put it up again before it be conſumed, the
Sacrifice muſt needs be fruſtrated, and if he keep
it within him, and ſo conſume it by digeſtion, the
Altar will rather be his ſtomack, then the Lords
Table.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Sacrifice of Chriſtians <hi>properly</hi> ſo
called, being but one, and that by many degrees
more noble and excellent then any, either before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
or under the law, <hi rend="sup">b</hi> if <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> were the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
matter thereof, it would both overthrow the
unity of the Sacrifice, in as much as both theſe are
often renewed, and in it ſelf be of leſſe valew and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112896:4"/>
dignity then many of the Jewiſh Sacrifices, which
I think the Doctor will not grant. But <hi>happily he</hi> will
ſay that thoſe elements, though in themſelves they
be of no great value, yet in regard of myſticall
ſignification, they farre excell the Sacrifices of the
Jews. Whereunto I anſwer, that thoſe of the Jews
beſides, that they were Sacrifices indeed <hi>properly</hi> ſo
called, in themſelves they had the ſame ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and were chiefly to that end ordained by the
Author of them, the main difference being, that
they looked unto Chriſt to come, but we unto the
ſame Chriſt already come, by meanes whereof our
happineſſe is that, that now by Gods bleſſing we
need no Sacrifices properly ſo called, but reſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and wholly upon that all-ſufficient Sacrifice
which he once for all offred up for us.</p>
               <p>It remaines then that if the Bread and Wine be
not the Subject matter of this Sacrifice, the Body
and Bloud of Chriſt muſt be, and that not ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically,
but <hi>properly,</hi> otherwiſe the Sacrifice it ſelf
cannot be <hi>proper,</hi> which aſſertion will of neceſſity
inferre either the tranſubſtantiation of the Pontiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
or the <hi rend="sup">c</hi> 
                  <hi>conſubſtantiation</hi> of the Ubiquitaries.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
And again, If the Body and Bloud of Chriſt be the
ſubject matter of the Sacrifice, it muſt be viſibly
and ſenſibly there, according to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> own
definition before laid down; Neither will it ſuffice
to ſay (as he doth) that it is viſible under the ſpecies
of Bread and Wine, for ſo it may be viſible to the
faith of thoſe that beleeve it, but to the ſenſe (which
is the thing he requires as a neceſſary condition in a
Sacrifice properly ſo called) it is not viſible. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:112896:5"/>
can that be ſaid properly viſible, which is not
ſo in it ſelf, but in another thing, for then the ſoul
might be ſaid to be viſible, though it be onely ſeen
in the body, and not in it ſelf; nay, the ſoul might
better be ſaid to be ſeen in the body, then the body
of Chriſt in the bread, in as much as the ſoul is the
eſſentiall form of the body, but I truſt they will
not ſay, that the Body of Chriſt is ſo in regard of the
accidents of bread.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, how the Body and Bloud of Chriſt may
be truely, and properly ſaid ſo to be conſumed, <hi>ut
planè deſtruatur, ut deſinat eſſe id quod ante erat, ut ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia
conſumatur,</hi> (which the Cardinall likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
in his Sacrifice <hi>properly</hi> ſo called)<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>for my</hi> part
I muſt profeſſe, I cannot poſſibly underſtand, for
to ſay as he doth, that the Body of Chriſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
in the Sacrifice not <hi>ſecundum eſſe naturale,</hi> but
<hi>Sacramentale,</hi> cannot reach to his phraſe of <hi>planè de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruitur,
ſubſtantia conſumitur,</hi> as any weak Scholler
may eaſily diſcern, and in truth he doth in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of this point (touching the eſſence of this
Sacrifice, wherein it conſiſts, and the manner of
conſuming the Body of Chriſt therein) ſo double
and ſtagger as a man may well ſee he was much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
therein,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Miſsa cap. 27.</note> wandring up and down in a laba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynth,
not knowing which way to get out, and ſo <hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
I leave him.</p>
               <p>The other defect which I finde in the Doctors
diſcourſe, touching this point is, that he doth not
ſhew us how a commemorative, or repreſentative
Sacrifice (as he every where termes it) is a Sacrifice
<hi>properly</hi> ſo called. This propoſition that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112896:5"/>
is a commemorative Sacrifice properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
I ſhall eaſily grant if the Word properly be
referred to the adjunct not to the Subject. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative
it is <hi>properly</hi> called, but <hi>improperly</hi> a
Sacrifice. And herein I think do all writers agree,
as well Romiſh as Reformed (I mean that it is a
Sacrifice Commemorative) and therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
diſputes the point in no leſſe then 27. Chapters of
his firſt Book <hi>de Miſſa,</hi> againſt the Reformed Divines
to prove that it is a Sacrifice <hi>properly</hi> ſo called, and
yet acknowledgeth that his adverſaries confeſſe it
to be a Sacrifice Commemorative, but himſelf and
his adherents, though together with the Proteſtants
they acknowledge it to be a Sacrifice Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
yet they reſt not in that, becauſe they knew
full well, it was not ſufficient to denominate it a
<hi>proper</hi> Sacrifice. And in very truth it ſtands with
great reaſon that the Commemoration or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a thing ſhould be both in nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of ſpeech diſtinct from the thing it comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morates
or repreſents; As for the purpoſe, he who
repreſents a King upon the ſtage<hi rend="sup">f</hi>, is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
a King, yet in propriety of ſpeech he cannot be
ſo tearmed, unleſſe he likewiſe be a King in his own
perſon; And therefore it is that we confeſſe the
Jewiſh Sacrifices to be <hi>properly</hi> ſo termed, becauſe
they were not onely prefigurative of the Sacrifice
of Chriſt upon the Croſſe, but were really and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
ſo in themſelves, and if this could once be
ſoundly demonſtrated of the Euchariſt, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
would ſoon be at an end, but till then in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we have a repreſentative Sacrifice can no more
prove it to be a Sacrifice properly ſo called, then
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:112896:6"/>
the prefiguration of the Jewiſh Sacrifices without
any further addition could prove them ſo to be,
which I preſume no Divine will take upon him to
maintain.</p>
               <p>Now that which confirmes me herein is that both
the maſter of the Sentences, and <hi>Aquinas,</hi> the two
great leaders of the Schoolemen terming the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt
a <hi>commemorative,</hi> withall they held it to be
an <hi>improper</hi> Sacrifice, and to this purpoſe they both
alleage the authorities of the Fathers; which makes
me beleeve that they conceived the Fathers, who
in their writings frequently call it a Sacrifice to be
underſtood and interpreted in that ſenſe; The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of them in his 4. Book and 12. deſtinction makes
the queſtion, <hi>Quaeritur ſi quod gerit ſacerdos propriè
dicatur Sacrificium vel immolatio, &amp; ſi Chriſtus quotidiè
immoletur vel ſemel tantum immolatus ſit,</hi> to which he
briefly anſwers, <hi>Illud quod offertur &amp; conſecratur à
ſacerdote vocari Sacrificium &amp; oblationem, quia memoria
&amp; repraeſentatio veri Sacrificii &amp; ſanctae immolationis
factae in ara crucis;</hi> which is as much in effect as if he
had ſaid it is a commemoration of the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe, but in it
ſelf improperly ſo called, and that this is indeed
his meaning it ſufficiently appears throughout that
diſtinction.</p>
               <p>With <hi>Lombard</hi> doth <hi>Aquinas</hi> herein likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
<hi>Parte. 3. quaeſt. 73. art. 4. in concluſione Euchariſtiae
Sacramentum ut eſt dominicae paſsionis commemorativum,

ſaith not <hi>Sacrificium eſt,</hi> but onely <hi>nominatur,</hi> and
what his meaning therein was, appears of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
which is this. <hi>Hostia videtur idem eſſe quod Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium,

ſicut ergo non proprie dicitur Sacrificium ita nec

yet he takes it as granted that it is <hi>Sacrificium

doth he ſhape this anſwer, <hi>Ad tertium dicendum quod

framing their lives and actions
according to the law of nature. Which Words
(ſaith the Doctor) relate not onely to their morall
converſation as good men, but to their carriage
in reſpect of Gods publike worſhip as religious
men.</q> But by this gloſſe I doubt he corrupts the
text of the Author, ſure I am, the words he alleageth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:112896:7"/>
out of him do not reach home to his interpretation,
neither do I think it can be maintained, or that it
was the minde of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that the Patriarchs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Moſes</hi> worſhipped God, <hi>according to a voluntary
kinde of piety.</hi> Which is by the Apoſtle in expreſſe

had relation to the <hi>Meſsias</hi> that was to come (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

can affirm that they framed their religion according

               <p>The Doctor inſtanceth in the Sacrifices of <hi>Cain</hi>
and <hi>Abel,</hi> which he ſeemeth to ſay were offred by
the light of nature, whereas of <hi>Abel</hi> we read, that
<hi>by faith he offered unto God a more excellent Sacrifice then
Cain.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb 11. 4.</note> Now faith there cannot be without obedience,
nor true obedience without a precept, and if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
it be ſaid that the excellency of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was from faith, not the Sacrifice it ſelf, for then
<hi>Cain</hi> ſhould not have offered at all, I thereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that although <hi>Cain</hi> did not offer by faith, or

did it by inſtruction from his Father, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
from God. And beſides his Sacrifices being

               </p>
               <p>The Doctors next inſtance is <hi>Noahs</hi> Sacrifice,
touching which the ſame may be ſaid as formerly
of <hi>Abels,</hi> neither indeed can we with reaſon ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that God ſhould in other matters by divine
inſpiration, ſo particularly inſtruct him, and leave
him onely to the light of Nature, in the worſhip
of himſelf, or that <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of incorrupt
nature was inſtructed by God in the duties of his
ſervice, and his poſterity therein left to the light of
corrupt nature.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, ſomethings there are by the Doctor
affirmed of this Sacrifice, not ſo juſtifiable I doubt
as were to be wiſhed; as firſt that it was an Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſticall
Sacrifice, not typicall, whereas all Divines
that I have ſeen, make all the Sacrifices commanded
by God, as well before the law, as under the law to
have been typicall. That is ſome way ſignificant
of Chriſt to come, they being all as ſo many viſible
Sermons of that all ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fficient Sacrifice, through
which God is onely well pleaſed with thoſe which
worſhip him. And again, the text making it by the
Doctors own confeſſion an Holocauſt or burnt
offring which <hi>Noah</hi> offred, I ſee not how he can
onely make it Euchariſticall, in as much as <hi>Philo</hi> the
Jew (who ſhould know what belonged to the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Sacrifices) in his Book purpoſely written
of that Subject, thus writes of them. <hi>Sacrificia omnia
ad tria redegit legiſlator, Holocauſtum, pacifica ſive ſalutare,
&amp; Sacrificium pro peccatis. Noahs</hi> Sacrifice then being
a burnt offring, it could not be meerely Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
but I rather beleeve it might participate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of all three kindes, and as little doubt but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112896:8"/>
that it was in all three reſpects ſignificative of
Chriſt to come.</p>
               <p>The Doctors third inſtance, is in <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> who
indeed is ſaid to have been a Prieſt of the moſt high
God, and that being a Prieſt, he offred Sacrifice, I
make no doubt, but very much doubt whether he
offred Sacrifice, or were a Prieſt by the light of
nature, eſpecially conſidering that Chriſt himſelf
was a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whereas the Doctor confidently makes <hi>Sem</hi>
to have been the eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Noah,</hi> he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
againſt him, not onely the learned <hi>Iunius,</hi> but
<hi>Lyranus, Toſtatus, Genebrard,</hi> and the Hebrew Doctors.
And again, whereas he ſeemes to follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
opinion heretofore received, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi>
was <hi>Sem;</hi> I think he cannot be ignorant that both
<hi>Paraeus</hi> and <hi>Pererius</hi> have proved the contrary by ſo
invincible arguments, as there needs no further
doubt to be made thereof.</p>
               <p>The Doctors concluſion of this argument drawn
from the light of Nature is this, That there was
never any nation, but had ſome religion, nor any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
(if men civilized) but had Altars, Prieſts,
and Sacrifices as a part thereof, or dependents
thereupon. The former part of which poſition I
will not examine, though our planters in <hi>Virginia</hi>
and <hi>New-England,</hi> can not (as they report) finde any
acts of religion exerciſed by the natives of thoſe
Countries, but for the latter part thereof, I know
not why he ſhould exclude the uncivilized nations,
from acts flowing from the light of nature, ſuch as
he makes the uſe of Sacrificing to be, unleſſe withall
he will exclude them from the uſe of reaſon. And
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:112896:9"/>
ſurely were the uſe of Sacrifices grounded upon the
light of nature, not upon Divine precept; I do not
ſee why the Jews ſhould be tyed to offer them onely
at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> nor yet why the Mahometans (who
farre exceed the Chriſtians in number, and in civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
are little inferiour to many of them) ſhould uſe
no Sacrifice at all.</p>
               <p>Laſtly for the <hi>Grecians, Romans,</hi> and other nations,
who uſed Sacrifices as the principall act of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
it may well be that they borrowed it from
the Church of God by an apiſh imitation, or that
they received by tradition from their predeceſſors,
who were ſometimes of the Church of God (which
are the conjectures of the Doctor himſelf) either
of which might ſerve without deriving it from the
light of nature.</p>

               <p>From the teſtimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the Doctor comes

to the words of inſtitution recorded by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>

have been the place, to lay the foundation for a
new Sacrifice and Prieſthood if any ſuch <hi>properly</hi> ſo
called had been intended by our Saviour under the
Goſpell, but neither there, nor in the Evangeliſts
do we finde any mention at all of either of theſe;
which the Doctor perceiving well enough, goes on
from the words of inſtitution, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23, 24, 25. and
tels us that if they expreſſe not plain enough the
nature of this Sacrifice to be commemorative, we
may take thoſe that follow by way of commentary,
<hi>Verſ. 26. For as often as ye cate this bread, and drink this
cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> Which words
are doubtleſſe directed to all the faithfull in the
Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and in them to all Chriſtians, ſo
as the Doctor will be forced either to prove his
Sacrificing from eating and drinking, and withall
to admit all Chriſtians to do Sacrifice (againſt both
which in the ſame leaf he ſolemnly proteſts) or to
ſeek out ſome other place to prove it.</p>
               <p>But for the Prieſthood he pretends to have found

writes thereof. Neither did Chriſt by theſe words,
Do ye this in remembrance of me, erect any new
ſucceſſion of Sacrificers to offer him up really unto
his Father, nor ever did any ancient learned Father
ſo expound it. Chriſts meaning is clear by the words
that follow, for he ſaith not onely, <hi>do ye this,</hi> but he

               <p>By all which it appears, that neither the words
of inſtitution <hi>Hoc facite</hi> are ſufficient to ground the
Prieſthood, and power of Sacrificing upon them;
nor yet that they are to be reſtrained to the Clergy
as the Doctor would have it; Nay thoſe words of
the Apoſtle, which he brings as a commentary upon
the words of inſtitution to clear the point, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>And if we ſhould grant that which he demands,
that <hi>Hoc facite</hi> were to be referred onely to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Chriſt himſelf, and directed onely to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
and their Succeſſours, yet it muſt firſt be
proved that Chriſt himſelf in the inſtitution of the
Sacrament, did withall offer a Sacrifice <hi>properly</hi> ſo
called; which for any thing that appeares in the
text cannot be gathered from any ſpeech which he
then uttered, or action which he did, or geſture
which he uſed. That he conſecrated the Elements
of Bread and Wine to a myſticall uſe, as alſo that
he left the power of conſecration onely to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and their Succeſſours we willingly grant, but
that at his laſt Supper he either offered Sacrifice
himſelf, or gave them commiſſion ſo to do, that
as yet reſts to be proved. Neither do I yet ſee what
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112896:12"/>
the Doctor will make to be the Subject of his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
either Bread and Wine, or his own Body and
Bloud; if the former, he will (for any thing I know)
ſtand ſingle; if the latter, in a proper ſenſe, he
will be forced to joyn hands with Rome, and ſo fall
into a world of abſurdities; Laſtly, whereas the
Doctor diſputes wholly for a <hi>commemorative</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
that if our Saviour could not be ſo, in as much
as Commemoration implies a calling to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of a thing paſt, but his Sacrifice upon the
Croſſe, which we now commemorate, was then to
come; <hi>Prefigurative</hi> it might be, <hi>Commemorative</hi> it
could not be.</p>
               <p>The Doctor goes on, and confidently aſſures us
that S. <hi>Paul</hi> in whom we finde both the Prieſt and
the Sacrifice, will help us to an Altar alſo, and to
that purpoſe referres us to the laſt to the <hi>Hebrews,

that we ſee (ſaith he) that in this Sacrifice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
the Chriſtian Church, by our Lord and

the firſt is to celebrate the memoriall of our

                     </gap>. This our Commemoration
for a Sacrifice; The ſecond, that we ſhould offer
to him the Sacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving,
which is the reaſonable Sacrifice of a Chriſtian
man, and to him moſt acceptable; finally he
joynes both together in the concluſion of that
Book, and therein doth at full deſcribe the nature
of this Sacrifice, which is this as followeth.
Therefore (ſaith he) we Sacrifice and offer, as it
were with incenſe, the memory of that great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
celebrating the ſame according to the
myſteries by him given unto us, and giving thanks
to him for our ſalvation, with godly Hymnes and
Prayers to the Lord our God, as alſo offering
our whole ſelves both ſoul and body, and to his
High Prieſt which is the Word. S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e here (ſaith
the Doctor) <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth not call it onely the
memory or Commemoration of Chriſts Sacrifice,
but makes the very memory and Commemoration
in and of it ſelf to be a Sacrifice, which <hi>inſtar
omnium,</hi> for and in the place of all other Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we are to offer to our God, and offer with the
incenſe of our Prayers and praiſes.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:112896:14"/>
In this diſcourſe out of <hi>Euſebius</hi> the Doctor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
that what he had alleaged, did not reach
home to his purpoſe, endeavours to make it up by
the addition of this laſt clauſe, as if <hi>Euſebius</hi> made
the memory or commemoration of the Sacrifice of
Chriſt to be in and of it felf a Sacrifice; and this he
would collect from theſe words of his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which he tranſlates <hi>for,</hi> and <hi>as</hi> a Sacrifice, whereas
both Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Raynolds,</hi> and others
of our beſt learned Divines tranſlate it <hi>inſteed</hi> of a
Sacrifice. Now that which is inſteed of a Sacrifice,
cannot be indeed, and of it ſelf <hi>properly</hi> ſo called.
And beſides, how we ſhould be ſaid to offer up our
Commemoration for a Sacrifice, as the Doctor
affirmeth, I cannot underſtand, ſince <hi rend="sup">k</hi> Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is an action, and being ſo, it cannot (as I
conceive) in propriety of ſpeech be the thing Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed,
which muſt of neceſſity be a ſubſtance as
it ſtands in oppoſition to accidents; ſo that if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſanctification of the Creature, nor the
Commemoration of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, nor
the offering up of our ſelves, or praiſe, and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
can amount to a Sacrifice properly ſo called,
ſurely the Doctor hath not yet found it in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

there to be ſeen of Sacrificing, or Offring, or Altar,
or any ſuch matter; The form it ſelf of Ordination
runnes thus [<hi>Receive the holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſinnes thou

               <p>This indeed the Romaniſts quarrell at, as being a

                  </note> but the learned Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
of it, and our holy orders, hath in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
fully anſwered that crimination of theirs, and
withall clearly opened the point, in what ſenſe we
are in that Book of Ordination called Prieſts: <q>If
you mean (ſaith he) no more by Prieſt, then the
holy Ghoſt doth by Presbyter, that is a Miniſter
of the New Teſtament, then we profeſſe, and are
ready to prove that we are Prieſts, as we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the Book of Common-prayer, and the form
of ordering, becauſe we receive in our ordination
authority to preach the Word of God, and to
Miniſter his holy Sacraments. Secondly, if by
Prieſts you mean Sacrificing Prieſts, and would
expound your ſelves of ſpirituall Sacrifices, then
as this name belongeth to all Chriſtians, ſo it may
be applyed by an excellency to the Miniſters of
the Goſpel. Thirdly, although in this name you
have relation to bodily Sacrifices, yet even ſo
we be called Prieſts by way of alluſion. For as
Deacons are not of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> yet the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers do commonly call them Levites al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
to their office, becauſe they come in place
of Levites, ſo the Miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be called Sacrificers, becauſe they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the ſonnes of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and come in place of
Sacrificers. Fourthly, for as much as we have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112896:16"/>
authority to Miniſter, the Sacraments and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Euchariſt, which is a repreſentation
of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, therefore we may be
ſaid to offer Chriſt in a Myſtery, and to Sacrifice
him objectively,</q> by way of Commemoration.]
In all theſe reſpects we may rightly and truely be
called Prieſts, as alſo becauſe to us it belongeth,
and to us alone to conſecrate the Bread and Wine
to holy uſes, to offer up the prayers of the people,
and to bleſſe them, yet in all theſe reſpects, the
ſpeech is but figurative, and conſequently our
Prieſthood and Sacrifices cannot be proper.</p>
               <p>Now for the Liturgy, it is true that the Miniſter
is there likewiſe ſometimes called a Prieſt, and as
true it is that ſometimes alſo he hath the name of a
Miniſter there given him; but the Lords Table
though it be there often named, is never called an
Altar, nor the Sacrament in which he repreſents,
and commemorates the death of Chriſt, is in that
reſpect, ſo much as once called a Sacrifice, muchleſſe
<hi>properly</hi> ſo termed, as will appear when we come to
examine the Doctors arguments for a Sacrifice
drawn from that Book. In the mean time I muſt

with <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> as that he was not onely a Prieſt
but a King,<note place="margin">Heb <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

was our Saviour a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech,</hi>

will challenge to our ſelves a Prieſthood after his

too hard a task for any man to make good. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts

of the reformed Churches; beſides our Doctor hath

of our Church, with the obſervable words of
profound <hi>Hooker,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib 5 cap. 78.</note> who was well known to be no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
thereunto. <q>Becauſe (ſaith he) the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
part both of Heatheniſh, and Jewiſh ſervice
did conſiſt in Sacrifice, when learned men declare
what the word Prieſt doth properly ſignifie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the minde of the firſt impoſer of the
name, their ordinary Scholies do well expound
it to imply Sacrifice; ſeeing then that Sacrifice is
now no part of the Church Miniſtry, how ſhould
the name of Prieſthood be thereunto rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed?
Surely even as S. <hi>Paul</hi> applyeth the name
of fleſh, unto that very ſubſtance of fiſhes, which
hath a proportionable correſpondence to fleſh;
although it be in nature another thing, whereupon
when Philoſophers will ſpeak warily they make a
difference betwixt fleſh in one ſort of living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:112896:17"/>
and that other ſubſtance in the reſt, which
hath but a kinde of Analogy to fleſh. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
contrariwiſe having matter of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
whereof to ſpeak, nameth them indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
both fleſh. The Fathers of the Church with like
ſecurity of ſpeech, call uſually the Miniſtery of
the Goſpel, Prieſthood in regard of that which
the Goſpel hath proportionable to ancient Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
namely the Communion of the bleſſed
Body and Bloud of Chriſt, <hi>although it have proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
now no Sacrifice.</hi> As for the People, when they
hear the name, it draweth no more their mindes
to any cogitation of Sacrifice, then the name of a
Senator, or of an Alderman cauſeth them to think
upon old age, or to imagine that every one ſo
termed, muſt needs be ancient becauſe yeers were
reſpected in the firſt nomination of both. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to paſſe by the name, let them uſe what dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
they will, whether we call it a Prieſthood, or
a Presbyterſhip, or a Miniſtery; it skilleth not,
although in truth the word Presbyter doth ſeeme
more fit, and in propriety of ſpeech more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
then Prieſt, with the drift of the whole
Goſpel of J<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſus Chriſt, for what are they that
imbrace the Goſpel, but Sonnes of God? What
are Churches, but his families? Seeing then we
receive the adoption and ſtate of Sonnes by their
Miniſtery, whom God hath choſen out for that
purpoſe, ſeeing alſo that when we are the Sonnes
of God, our continuance is ſtill under their care
which were our Progenitors, what better title
could there be given them, then the reverend
name of Presbyters, or fatherly guides? The holy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:112896:17"/>
Ghoſt throughout the Body of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
making ſo much mention of them, doth
not any where call them Prieſts. The Prophet
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> I grant doth, but in ſuch ſort as the ancient
Fathers <hi>by way of Analogy.</hi> A Presbyter according
to the proper meaning of the New Teſtament, is
he unto whom our Saviour hath committed the
power of ſpirituall procreation.</q> By which lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
diſcourſe of this venerable man, and as the
Doctor himſelf ſomewhere calls him incomparable
now a bleſſed Saint in Heaven, it evidently appears
that he held both a Sacrifice, and a Prieſthood in
the Church, but neither of them in a <hi>proper</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and conſequently in his opinion the Doctor
hath gained little to his purpoſe from the Book of
ordination, and ſurely as little I preſume will he
gain from that which follows, and comes now to
be examined.</p>

                     </gap>lated chiefly to points in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
but in the Book of Homilies, &amp;c.</q> Thus the
Doctor.</p>
               <p>Why, but he had told us before, that the Church
declares her ſelf poſitively in the Book of Articles,
touching this preſent buſineſſe, and now when we
expected the declaration to be made good, he puts
us over to the Book of Homilies, and yet had he
gone on in that very Article by him alleaged, he
ſhould there have found ſomewhat againſt Popiſh
Sacrifices, which that Article calls (or rather our
Church by that Article) <hi>blaſphemous Fables,</hi> and <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
deceits.</hi> Nay the very firſt words vouched by
the Doctor out of the Article, are in my judgement
ſufficient to cut the throat of any other Sacrifice of
Chriſt, or any Chriſtian Sacrifice <hi>properly</hi> ſo called.
For if the offring of Chriſt once made be perfect,
it cannot be again reiterated, commemorated it may
be, and muſt be reiterated, it cannot be; now rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
it is which makes it a Sacrifice <hi>properly</hi> ſo
called, not a bare commemoration or repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as hath already been ſhewed. And beſides the
Doctor might have found another Article touching
the Supper of the Lord,<note place="margin">Art. 28.</note> where it is called a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our redemption by Chriſts death, but of
any Sacrifice not a word, though there had been the
proper place to have ſpoken of it, had our Church
conceived that any ſuch had been <hi>properly</hi> ſo termed;
but on the other ſide, Tranſubſtantiation is there
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112896:18"/>
condemned as being repugnant to Scriptures, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
the nature of a Sacrament, giving occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to many ſuperſtitions; yet how a Sacrifice of the
body and bloud of Chriſt <hi>properly</hi> ſo termed, can be
admitted without the admiſſion of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
together with it, I muſt confeſſe for mine own
part I am yet to ſeek, and ſhall be willing to learn
from any that can farther inſtruct me.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor repoſing little confidence, it
ſhould ſeem in the Articles, refers us to the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
to them let us go, and truely, if I be not much
miſtaken, he will finde as little help from theſe, as
from the Articles: That which he alleageth, is taken
from the firſt words of the Homily Sacrament, the
words are as followeth:<note place="margin">Part. 1</note> 
                  <q>The great love of our
Saviour Chriſt to mankinde doth not onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in that dear bought benefit of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſatisfaction by his death and paſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
alſo, that he hath kindly provided that the ſame
moſt mercifull work, might be had in continuall
remembrance, amongſt the which means is the
publike celebration of the memory of his pretious
death at the Lords Table; our Saviour having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
and eſtabliſhed the remembrance of his
great mercy expreſſed in his paſſion in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his heavenly Supper. Here (ſaith the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor)
is a commemoration of that bleſſed Sacrifice
which Chriſt once offred, a publike celebration
of the memory thereof, and a continuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of it by himſelf ordained.</q> Yea, but that
which the Doctor from theſe words (picked here
and there in the Homily) ſhould have inferred, and
concluded is a Sacrifice in it ſelf <hi>properly</hi> ſo called,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112896:19"/>
not a memory, a remembrance, a commemoration
of a Sacrifice. And beſides, he who attentively
reads that part of the Homily, will eaſily finde that
it there ſpeaks of the commemoration thereof, not
ſo much by the Prieſt, as by the People; neither
doth it ſo much as once name any Sacrifice at all,
ſave onely in diſavowing, and diſallowing it, as
may be ſeen in the Page there following,<note place="margin">Pag. 198.</note> part wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Doctor taketh for his own purpoſe, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<q>That the Lords Supper is in ſuch ſort to be
done and Miniſtred, as our Lord and Saviour did,
and commanded it to be done, as his holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
uſed it, and the good Fathers in the primitive
Church frequented it. So that (ſaith he) what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hath been proved to be the purpoſe of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
the practiſe of the holy Apoſtles, and
uſage of the ancient Fathers, will fall within the
meaning, and intention of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>
Doubtleſſe it will, but that a Sacrifice <hi>properly</hi> ſo
called, hath been proved to be either the purpoſe
of the inſtitution, or the practiſe of the Apoſtles,
or the uſage of the ancient Fathers, that I utterly
deny. And ſurely it ſhould ſeem that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> denies it too, by the words there following
within a few lines; <q>We muſt take heed (ſaith the
Homily) leaſt of the memory it be made a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
leaſt of a Communion it be made a private
eating, leaſt of two parts, we have but one, leaſt
applying it to the dead, we looſe the fruit that be
alive; Let us rather in theſe matters follow the
advice of <hi>Cyprian</hi> in like caſes, that is, cleave faſt
to the firſt beginning hold faſt the Lords tradition,
do that in the Lords Commemoration, which he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:112896:19"/>
himſelf did, he himſelf commanded, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
confirmed.</q> Whereby it ſhould ſeem they held
the purpoſe of our Saviours inſtitution, and the
practiſe of his Apoſtles to have been, not a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<hi>properly</hi> ſo termed, but onely a Commemoration
of his death and paſſion. And this to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
their meaning farther appears toward the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of the ſame part of the Homily, where
ſpeaking of the death of Chriſt, and the efficacy
thereof to the worthy Receiver, they thus go on.
<q>Herein thou needſt no other mans help, <hi>no other
Sacrifice, or oblation, no Sacrificing Prieſt,</hi> no Maſſe, no
means eſtabliſhed by mans invention.</q> By which
it is evident, that they held all other Sacrifices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
that of Chriſt himſelf on the Croſſe, and all
other Sacrificing Prieſts, beſide Chriſt himſelf to
be eſtabliſhed by mans invention, and how the
Doctor profeſſing that he offers up a Sacrifice <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi>
ſo called, can poſſibly free himſelf from the
title and office of a <hi>Sacrificing Prieſt,</hi> I muſt profeſſe
is beyond the compaſſe of my brain. All which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
I think his ſafer way had been not to have
touched upon the Homily, ſpecially conſidering
that the Lords Table is there named above or about
twenty times, but is not ſo much as once called an
Altar. But perchance he will finde ſome better
help from the Liturgy, which comes now to be
examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We will next (ſaith he) look into the <hi>agenda,</hi>
the publike Liturgy of this Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where firſt
we finde it granted, that Chriſt our Saviour is the
very Paſchall Lamb that was offred for us, and
hath taken away the ſinnes of the world, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:112896:20"/>
ſuffering death upon the croſſe for our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he made there of his own oblation of himſelf
once offred, a full, perfect and ſufficient Sacrifice,
oblation and ſatisfaction, for the ſinnes of the
whole world; and to the end that we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
remember the exceeding great love of our
Maſter, and onely Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, thus dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for us, and the innumerable benefits which
by his pretious bloudſhedding he hath obtained
to us, he hath inſtituted and ordained holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
as pledges of his love, and continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his death, to our great and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
comfort inſtituting, and in his holy Goſpel
commanding us to continue a perpetuall memory
of that his pretious death,</q> till his coming again.</p>
               <p>In which words I do not ſee, what it is that makes
for the Doctors purpoſe, but ſomewhat I ſee which
makes againſt him; as namely, The Sacrifice of
Chriſt upon the Croſſe is full, perfect and ſufficient
in it ſelf, which being ſo, ſurely there needs no
more Sacrifices, no more Prieſts, no more Altars,
<hi>properly</hi> ſo called; And for the <hi>memory</hi> or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
there mentioned (if I be not much miſtaken)
he will never be able thence to inferre ſuch a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
and ſurely I think the Church never intended
he ſhould.</p>
               <p>In the next place he inſtanceth in the conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<q>Then followeth (ſaith he) the conſecration
of the Creatures of Bread and Wine, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his death and Paſſion, in the ſame
words and phraſes which Chriſt our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
unto his Apoſtles, and his Apoſtles,
unto the Fathers of the Primitive times, which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:112896:20"/>
now as then is to be done onely by the Prieſt,
[Then the Prieſt ſtanding up, ſhall ſay as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth]
to whom it properly belongeth, and upon
whom his ordination doth conferre a power of
miniſtring the S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>crament, not given to any other
order in the holy Miniſtry.</q> Had the Book ſaid,
Then ſhall the Prieſt ſtand up, and offer Sacrifice, it
had been to the Doctors purpoſe; but then ſhall the
Prieſt ſtand up and <hi>ſay,</hi> makes little for him, unleſſe
he had been injoyned to ſay ſomewhat, which had
implyed a Sacrifice which I do not yet finde; words
indeed of conſecration I finde, and thoſe proper to
the Prieſt, but any words of Sacrificing in that act,
I finde not, yet had our Church conceived, that to
have been a Sacrifice there, indeed had been the
proper place to have expreſſed her ſelf. That the
ordination appointed by our Church, conferreth
upon the perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ordained, a power of miniſtring
the Sacrament not given to any order in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
I ſhall eaſily grant; but that his ordination
giveth him, not any power of Sacrificing (which
is the point in queſtion) hath already out of the
form it ſelf eſtabliſhed by authority been clearly
ſhewed.</p>
               <p>From the words of conſecration, the Doctor goes
on to the prayer, after the Communion, and here
indeed he findes a Sacrifice, but ſuch a one as (all
things conſidered, he hath very little reaſon to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
therein. <q>The memory or Commemoration
of Chriſts death (ſaith he) thus celebrated, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Sacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
repreſentative of that one and onely expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Sacrifice, which Chriſt once offred for us,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:112896:21"/>
all the whole Communicants, beſeeching God to
grant that by the merits and death of his Sonne
Jeſus Chriſt, and through faith in his bloud, they
and the whole Church may obtain remiſſion of
their ſinnes, and all other benefits of his Paſſion;
Neither ſtay they there (ſaith he) but forthwith
offer, and preſent unto the Lord themſelves, their
ſoules and bodies to be a reaſonable, holy, and
lively Sacrifice unto him. And howſoever as they
moſt humbly do acknowledge, they are unworthy
through their manifold ſinnes, to offer to him any
Sacrifice, yet they beſeech him to accept, that
their bounden duety and ſervice; In which laſt
words, that preſent ſervice which they do to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, according to their bounden duties,
in celebrating the perpetuall memory of Chriſts
pretious death, and the oblation of themſelves,
and with themſelves the Sacrifice of praiſe, and
thankſgiving in due acknowledgement of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
and comforts by him received, is humbly
offred unto God for, and as a Sacrifice, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
avowed for ſuch, as from the tenour and
coherence of the words,</q> doth appear moſt plainly.
Hitherto the Doctor, as if now he had ſpoken home
and full to the point indeed; whereas if we take
a review of that which hath been ſaid, we ſhall
ſoon finde it to vaniſh into ſmoak.</p>
               <p>That prayer then af<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er the Communion, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in this manner. <q>O Lord and heavenly Father
we thy humble ſervants, entirely deſire, thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
goodneſſe, mercifully to accept this our
Sacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving.</q> I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Doctor, firſt of what kind this Sacrifice
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:112896:21"/>
of thankſgiving is, and then by whom it is offred;
for mine own part I never heard that the Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Sacrifice of Chriſtians, was other then ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
improperly termed a Sacrifice; and I preſume
the Doctor himſelf will not ſtick to grant as much
as he doth, that the people joyn with the Prieſt in
this prayer. From whence it will infallibly follow,
That either the people together with the Prieſt
offer unto God a S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>crifice <hi>properly</hi> ſo called, or that
the Sacrifice thus offred by them, both <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſo called
improperly; let him take which he pleaſe of the
two, and then tell me what he can make of this
Sacrifice. Now that which hath been ſaid of this
Euchariſticall Sacrifice, of praiſe and thankſgiving,
is likewiſe to be underſtood of the obedientiall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
(if I may ſo call it) which follows after,
conſiſting in their offring to the Lord, their ſelves,
their ſouls and bodies, as a reaſonable holy and
lively Sacrifice unto him: And in truth I cannot
but wonder, that the Doctor ſhould inſiſt upon this,
conſidering he requires a materiall Altar for his
Sacrifice, derives his Prieſthood from <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi>
appropriates it to the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors,
makes it ſtand in commemoration or repreſentation,
and laſtly, every where with ſcorn enough, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the people from any right thereunto, but
thus we ſee how a weak cauſe is driven by all kinde
of means, be they never ſo poor to fortifie it ſelf:
And yet, as if now he had made a full, and finall
conqueſt, he concludes this argument drawn from
the authority of our Church; <q>Put all together
(ſaith he) which hath been here delivered from
the Book of Articles, the Homilies, and publike
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:112896:22"/>
Liturgy, and tell me if you ever found a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
concord then this, between <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and
the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                  </q> in this preſent buſineſſe;
And then goes on to parallell the words of <hi>Euſebius</hi>
with thoſe of our Liturgy, which I confeſſe agree
very well, but neither the one, nor the other ſpeak
home to his purpoſe, or mention any Sacrifice <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi>
ſo called, to be offred in the Church of Chriſt,
as he hath been ſufficiently ſhewed.</p>

Chriſti per ipſam veritatem reddebatur, poſt adventum
Chriſti per Sacramentum memoriae celebratur.</hi> Now had
he conceived the Euchariſt to be a Sacrifice <hi>properly</hi>
ſo called, in all likelyhood, he would have termed
it <hi>Sacrificium memoriae</hi> in relation to the Sacrifices as
well before the death of Chriſt, as the Sacrifice it
ſelf of his death, <hi>Sacramentum memoriae</hi> then is that
ſaith the Biſhop, which with S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> we hold,
and no Chriſtian I think will deny, nay more then
ſo, we may ſafely with the Biſhop grant, that it is
not onely a Sacrament but a Sacrifice, but whether
in a <hi>proper</hi> ſignification that is the queſtion, and this
the Doctor doth not clear out of the Biſhop, but
rather the Biſhop, the contrary out of S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>

which he lived to publiſh himſelf, and thus
begins it, <hi>Credunt noſtri inſtitutam à domino Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
in ſui commemorationem, etiam Sacrificii ſui, vel (ſi
ita loqui liceat) in Sacrificium commemorativum.</hi> See the
modeſty of this deep Divine, making doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he might give it the name of <hi>Sacrificium comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morativum</hi>
or no, which doubtleſſe he would never
have done, had he thought it had been a Sacrifice
<hi>properly</hi> ſo called; Neither would he ſo often in that

ſo weary, and ſo wiſe a man would never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<hi>Vocem</hi> ſo often, had he beleeved the thing.
To the words by the Doctor ſtood upon, <hi>Tollite de
miſſa tranſubſtantiationem nec diu nobiſcum lis erit de Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio;</hi>
it may be replyed in the Biſhops own words
immediately following, which may well ſerve as
a commentary upon theſe going before: <hi>Memoriam
ibi fieri Sacrificii damus non inviti,</hi> ſo as his meaning
ſeems to be <hi>lis non erit de Sacrificio,</hi> conditionally that
by <hi>Sacrificium</hi> they underſtand <hi>memoriam Sacrificii,</hi> as
we do, neither in truth do I ſee how the crutch of
Tranfubſtantiation being taken away, a Sacrifice
<hi>properly</hi> ſo called, can well ſtand upon its own feete.</p>
               <p>From the Biſhops anſwer to the Italian Cardinall,
the Doctor leads us back again to his anſwer to the
French Cardinall, and there hath found an Altar
ſuteable to his Sacrifice; If we agree about the
matter of the Sacrifice, ſaith the Biſhop, there will
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:112896:23"/>
be no difference about the Altar,] but about the
former, ſure I am, we agree not as yet, nor I doubt
ever ſhall agree (they making that the Subject which
we make onely the object of this Sacrifice) and
conſequently the difference is like ſtill to remain
about the Altar. That the Lords Table may fitly
be called an Altar, the Biſhop indeed affirmeth, but
that it may <hi>properly</hi> be ſo called, that he affirmeth
not, nor as farre as we may conjecture by his words
ever intended it: <hi>Fitly,</hi> I grant it may be ſo called,
and yet figuratively too. That Chriſt was fitly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Lamb, we all willingly yeild, yet withall that
he was not properly but figuratively ſo called, no
man I preſume will deny. The Altar (ſaith the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
in the ſame Chapter) in the Old Teſtament, is
by <hi>Malachy</hi> called <hi>Menſa domini;</hi> and of the Table
in the New it is ſaid <hi>Habemus Altare,</hi>

in the Old, ſo likewiſe is the Lords Table, by the
Apoſtle improperly called an Altar in the New
Teſtament. Neither indeed can the Biſhop (as I
conceive be otherwiſe underſtood, the Sacrifice
which he allows, conſiſting (by his own deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, in the ſame place) in repreſentation by
the breaking of the Bread and powring forth of the
Cup) which may objectively, that is improperly

the Book it ſelf, I have not now by me, but that the
Archbiſhop any where affirmeth either the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative

ſo good opinion of your underſtanding, though
weak, that you will conceive the bleſſed Sacrament
of the Altar, or the Communion Table (which you
pleaſe) to be a Sacrifice.] And the Doctor having
a while infiſted upon theſe words, in anſwer to his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:112896:25"/>
adverſary, goes on out of the Biſhops Book. Walk
you at random, and at rovers in your bypaths if you
pleaſe, I have uſed the name of Altar for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Table, according to the manner of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and am like enough ſometimes to uſe it ſtil; nor
will I abſtain notwithſtanding your oggannition to
follow the ſteps and practice of antiquity, in uſing
the words Sacrifice and Prieſthood alſo. Finally
(ſaith the Doctor) he brings in Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
thus, That he beleeveth no ſuch Sacrifice of
the Altar as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, and that he
fancieth no ſuch Altars as they imploy, though he
profeſſed a Sacrifice and an Altar.) Now for an
ſwer to this teſtimony, he that will be pleaſed but
to peruſe that chapter, will I preſume, deſire no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſatisfaction, the Biſhop having therein ſo
clearly and fully unfolded himſelf, as if the Doctor
will ſtand to his judgement in the point, he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
be caſt.</p>
               <p>To the firſt allegation then, where the Doctor
makes a ſtop, the Biſhop thus goes on. Not propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory,
as they call it (I will uſe this word. call it,
leſt you challenge me upon Popery for uſing propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory)
for the living and the dead, not an <hi>externall,
viſible, true,</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Sacrifice, but onely repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,
commemorative, ſpirituall Sacrifice; where
the Biſhop as we ſee in downright and direct tearms
denies the Euch<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſt to be a Sacrifice <hi>properly</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and for this immediatly he voucheth the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Doctor <hi>Rainolds,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Rainolds</hi> (ſaith he) and Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that though we have no <hi>proper Altar,</hi> yet Altar
and Sacrifice have a mutuall relation and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:112896:25"/>
one upon another. And herein doth the Biſhop
profeſſe himſelf fully to accord with them.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond allegation; The Biſhop between
the words vouched by the Doctor, brings in theſe;
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Pagan Altars (which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and truely Altars) Tables, and why may not
we name the Lords Table an Altar? whereby it
appears, that he held the Lords Table an Altar in
none other ſenſe than as the Pagan Altars were Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that is both <hi>improperly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the third allegation touching Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi>
he thus brings him in not farre from the beginning
of that chapter: But I rather chooſe (ſaith he) to
ſpeak in our Biſhop <hi>Mortons</hi> words, apologizing for
Proteſtants againſt Papiſts; It may be I have taken
licence in uſe of tearms, but no errour in Doctrine
can you finde, for to put off your imputation, from
farther faſtning, I beleeve no ſuch ſacrifice of the
Altar, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, I fancy no ſuch
Altars as they imploy, though I profeſſe a Sacrifice
and an Altar.] In the ſame Reverend Biſhops
words, the Lords Table being called <hi>improperly</hi> an
Altar, can no more conclude a Sacrifice underſtood
<hi>properly,</hi> than when as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calling <hi>Titus</hi> his
ſonne according to the faith, which is <hi>improperly,</hi> a
man may contend Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was his naturall father,
according to the fleſh.] In which words we have
both the Biſhops, and thoſe excellently learned in
<hi>terminis terminantibus,</hi> directly oppoſite to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
opinion, though by him alleadged in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

of which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh hath no reference to
the Maſſe, which they hold to be a <hi>proper</hi> and reall

the Jewiſh Prieſthood, for the advancing of the
Prieſthood of Chriſt, argueth impregnably to the
diſavowing of all reall Sacrifice thenceforth in the
