            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Shall not trouble thee, Reader, nor my self, with a long Apology for the publishing this Treatise. How demurely soever I should pretend to the contrary, I fear thou wilt still be apt to imagin, that I had a tolerable good opinion of it, before I ventur'd it to the Press; and truly I my self cann't well conceive, how any man should be over ambitious of being publickly laught at. If it be in any measure suited to the General Good, (for which I intended it,) I may at least expect thy pardon; but if upon the perusal thou shalt find it otherwise, I ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously acknowledge my self to have been mistaken. My Design in this Work is, to render the Rules of those excellent Arts, which the Title-page pretends to, so plain and obvious, as that they may be easily apprehended without the Assistance of a living Master. And if there were nothing new in the whole, but the perspicuity of the Principles, and easiness of the Method (which out of civility to my self I must deny) yet those alone are sufficient to vindicate me in this Publication; and I hope thou wilt not be angry, that I am a Well-wisher to thy Vnderstanding. For when I consider'd, that among the many good Books of this Nature, that are abroad in the
<pb facs="tcp:30766:4"/>
World (though written by Persons of greater knowledge than I dare pretend to) some were so learned and obscure, as not to be understood, unless by those who have already made a considerable proficiency in these things; others, so voluminous and prolix that they fright the endeavours of such who cannot spend their whole time this way: I was willing, according to my abilities, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate both these inconveniences, and accordingly applied my self to the composure of something, which for its plainness and brevity might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to those of mean Capacities and small Leisure; and this Book is the result of those Contemplations. Whether I have accomplish'd my purpose or no, I make thee the Iudge; requiring only that thou censure impartially of the Author and his Endeavours, without being offended that he is desirous to do thee a courtesie. I shall not here expatiate in the praise of the Arguments I treat of, nor give thee one line of Encomium: though out of the great affection I bear to these Arts, I find a strange inclination in my self to be rhetorical, yet I am resolv'd not to affront thee; for truly their usefulness and excellency is so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally known, that to tell thee of it as a new thing, were to suppose thee a Person of more than ordinary ignorance; only (as I said before) I must be so civil to my self too, as to inform thee, that (besides the <hi>Introduction</hi> to <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and the <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Interest,</hi> of which I challenge no more than thou shalt find thy self very willing to give me) that Part which concerns the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
<pb facs="tcp:30766:4"/>
of <hi>Solids, viz.</hi> the <hi>Prismoid, Cylindroid, &amp;c.</hi> is wholly new, and never before made publick. The bulk is bigger than at first by me intended; but to gratifie the Book-seller, the <hi>Vulgar Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick</hi> was an Appendix, though previous to the rest. But if one, or other, or all, prove either profitable or pleasant to thee, I am sufficiently oblig'd to subscribe,</p>

                     <p>The Proof of <hi>Subtraction</hi> is by adding the <hi>Subducend</hi> and <hi>Remainder</hi> together, and their Aggregate must always be equal to the <hi>Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi> as you may see by the last Example.</p>

                        <hi>DIvision,</hi> both in whole Numbers and Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, is by young Practitioners found to be more difficult than any of the four Species; it will therefore require a little more industry in the Learner: But when once had, there will appear small difference between the Operation herein, as in any the precedent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Division</hi> is also constituted by three Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, and a fourth by accident, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend,</hi> a <hi>Divisor,</hi> and a <hi>Quotient:</hi> The fourth is a <hi>Remainder,</hi> which doth not always happen to be.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dividend</hi> is the Number to be divided.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Divisor</hi> is the Number by which the other is to be divided.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Quotient</hi> is the Number found out by the Division.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Remainder</hi> is that which is left of the Dividend after the Division is ended, and is always less than the Divisor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If 12 be to be divided by 4, then is 12 the Dividend, 4 the Divisor, and the Quotient will be 3.</p>
                     <p>If 13 be divided by 3, then 13 is the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend, 3 the Divisor, 4 the Quotient, and there will be a Remain, which is here 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:30766:30"/>Decimal Fractions, or mixt Numbers, are divided after the same manner as whole Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are divided, only care must be had in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a true value to the Quotient. To perform which, observe well this General Rule.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The first Figure in the Quotient is always of the same denomination with that Figure which stands (or is supposed to stand) over the Unity place in the Divisor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the manner of placing your Figures, and the way of dividing, there are many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by divers Writers of <hi>Arithmetick:</hi> The way of placing the Divisor under the Dividend, is the most apt for giving a value to the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; but the rasing of Figures, and repeating the Divisor so often, is found an inconvenience; which to avoid, observe the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
                     <p>Being to divide 2487.04 by 53.6, I place them in this order:
53.6 ) 2487.048 (</p>
                     <p>Then I consider if the Divisor were placed under the Dividend, the Unity place in the Divisor, here 3 would stand under the 8 in the Dividend, I then set a mark over the head of the 8, and conclude the first Figure in the Quotient to be of the same denomination with it, which is Tens, in whole Numbers.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus found the value of the first Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the Quotient, I proceed to the division, and inquire, how many times 5 in 24? I find 4; I then set 4 in the Quotient, and go back, multiplying the whole Divisor by that Figure, and subduct the Product out of the Dividend, placing the Remainder underneath as part of a new Dividend: Thus 4 times 6 is 24, from 27, and there remains 3, which I place under the 7; again, 4 times 3 is 12, and 2 that I borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is 14, from 18, and there remains 4, which I place under the 8, as in the Example; then 4 times 5 is 20, and 1 I borrowed is 21, from 24, and there remains 3, which I place under the 4. For my new Dividend, I bring down the next Figure, here a Cypher, and post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone it to the Remainder, and the Example will stand thus:

                     </p>
                     <p>Then proceeding in my Division, I ask, how many times 5 in 34? finding 6 times, I then place 6 in the Quotient, and as before say, 6 times 6 is 36, from 40, and there remains 4, which I set down under the Cypher; then 6 times 3 is 18, and 4 I borrowed is 22, from 23,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30766:31"/>
and there remains 1, which I place under the 3; then 6 times 5 is 30, and 2 I borrowed is 32, from 34, and there will remain 2, which I place under the 4; then to this Remainder I bring down the next Figure in the Dividend, postponing it as I did the Cypher, and they will stand thus:

                     <p>Having placed a Cypher in the Quotient, I add another to the Dividend, and make it 800; and then inquire, how many times 5 in 8? finding once, I put 1 in the Quotient, working as before: Where note, So long as there is a Remainder, if you add Cyphers and work after this manner, you may have as many Decimals as you please.</p>

                     <p>There are many Tables of Compound In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest Printed in sundry Books for the valuation of Leases and Annuities, but they are generally made for yearly Payments, when indeed by the common and most usual Covenants in Leases the Tenant is obliged to pay quarterly; and in Leases of great value, there will be found a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable difference in the true worth, (so great, that 25 <hi>l. per</hi> Quarter is as good as 102 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s. per Annum.</hi>) I have therefore presented the Reader with a Table fitted to such Quarterly Payments, the Use of which Table I doubt not but will be very easily found by the Examples that follow.</p>

                     <p>Here note, if any of the precedent Tunns be cloathed by Curveture, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Bases being Circular or Elliptical) the last Product ought to be divided by 1.27324, then will the Quotient exhibit the Cubick Inches in that Solid. But if the Question be Ale Gallons, let your Coefficients be divided by 282; if Beer Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels be required, divide the Coefficients by 10152, the number of Inches in a Beer Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. In all flat sided Figures, and for those Solids, whose Peripatasma is constituted by Circles or Ellipsis, the Divisor for Beer Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels is 12926&gt;, for Ale Barrels 11490&gt;,

                  <p>THe Corner-stone in the whole Fabrick of Cask-Gauging, as full, was long since laid by Mr. <hi>Oughtred,</hi> taking a Cask to be the Frustum of a Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roid, under which capacity they are generally received, though indeed there have been, and daily are found some Cask differing in form, and really are more Parabolical than Spheroidal, I shall therefore lay down a plain Method for the performance of the Work (<hi>viz.</hi> finding their Content) under these four Considerations:
<list>
                        <item>As Spheroidal,</item>
                        <item>As The Frustum of a Parabolical Spindle,</item>

These severally, with and without a Table of Area's of Circles.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as the Dimensions must be the first thing known, before the Content can be found, I shall therefore shew the young Tyro, how by some of the Dimensions to find the rest, if any obstruction prohibit the taking of all.</p>
