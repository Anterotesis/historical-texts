            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96011:6"/>
His care of this City; Of the true Protestant Religion, and of the Priviledges of Parliament; His Majestie takes in good part, the intimation given by the Petitioners of the fears and distractions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City now seems to be. And though Hee conceives Hee did on Wednesday at the Guild-Hall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie most of those particulars, is pleased to adde this further An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> That for the sad businesse of <hi>Ireland,</hi> His Majestie cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly expresse a greater sence then He hath done, there being nothing left on His Majesties part unoffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or undone.

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> For the Tower: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie wonders, that having removed a Servant of good Trust and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from that Charge, onely to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the fears of the Citie, and put in another of unquestionable Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and known abilitie, the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners should still entertain those fears; and whatever preparation of Strength is there made, is with as great an Eye of safety and advantage to the Citie, as to his Majesties own Person, and shall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96011:7"/>
be equally imployed to both.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> For the fortifying of White-Hall with Men and Munition in an unusuall way: His Majestie doubts not, but the Petitioners have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the strange provocation He hath received to entertain that Guard: That by the disorderly, and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous conflux of people at VVestmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and VVhite-Hall, his Majesties great Councell was not onely disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but his own Royall Person in danger, most seditious language be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uttered even under His own windows, whilest the examination and punishing such Tumults by the course of Law were interrupted and stopped. And if any Citizens were wounded or ill intreated, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie is confidently assured, that it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96011:7"/>
hapned by their own evill and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt demeanours.</p>
            <p n="4">

Neither doth His Majestie know, what discovery hath been lately made of fire-works in the hands of any Papist.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5</hi> For His going to the House of Commons (when His attendants were no otherwise armed then as Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen with swords) His Majestie is verily perswaded, That if the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners knew the clear grounds upon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96011:8"/>
which those persons stand accused of high Treason, and what will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against them (which in due time they shall be acquainted with) and considered the gentle way His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie took for their apprehension (which He preferd before any course of violence, though that way had been very justifiable; for His Majestie is very well assured that it is notoriously known, That no priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament can extend to Treason, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie, or breach of the Peace) the Petitioners would beleeve his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties going thither was an Act of grace and favour to that House, and the most peaceable way of having that necessary service for the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of those persons performed; specially, if such Orders have been

made (which his Majestie is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to beleeve) for the resistance of all lawfull Authority, as are discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of.</p>

            <p>And this extraordinary way of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying a Petition of so unusuall a nature, his Majesty is confidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, will be thought the greatest instance can be given of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties clear intention to his Subjects, and of the singular estimation He

hath of the good affections of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which He beleeves in gratitude will never be wanting to His just Commands and service.</p>
