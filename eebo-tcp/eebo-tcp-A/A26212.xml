         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And that foolish ſonne, would exaſperate the tender hart of his father, who (hauinge reproached the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) would preſume to vſurpe the honour of the inheritance, before he had diſpoſed himſelf to pennance. What is this, ô my deare Father,

I haue neglected to forſee the darts before they came; but now that I behold my death at hand, I am full of trouble. I added wounds to wounds, becauſe I feared not, to add crimes to crimes. My ancient ſcarrs, I haue broken through with new violence; becauſe my late iniquities, haue correſponded with my ancient ſinns; and that which thy diuine phiſick had cured, and cloſed; the itch of my frenſy, hath opened againe.

I taſted the ſweetnes of the apple; thou the bitternes of gall. Eue laughs, &amp; congratulats my ſinn with me; but Mary weeps and takes compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with thee. Behold, O Kinge of glory, behold how my impiety, and thy piety, are made apparent by one another. Beholde how my iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice &amp; thy Iuſtice are made cleerly manifeſt. What! O my King, and my God, shall I render for all thoſe things, which thou haſt beſtowed on me? For there is nothinge to be found in the hart of man, which can beare any portion to thy ſingular benefites. Can the sharpnes of mans conceite, thinke of any thinge, to which the mercy of God may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared? Noe, it is not in the power of a creature to performe any ſeruice that can make full amends to his Creator.</p>
               <p>But yet, O Sonne of God, there is ſomewhat in this admirable diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of thine, there is ſome what, wherein my frailty may anſweare, in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44014:24"/>
ſome ſmall proportion to what I owe if by the viſitation of thy holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt, my contrite hart, may crucify my flesh with the vices, and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcences therof. And when this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour is granted me by thee, I doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, as it were, beginn to ſuffer ſweetly with thee, becauſe thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt vouchſafe to dye for my ſinns.</p>
               <p>And thus by the victory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, he is prepared through thy help, toward an euident triumph; ſo that the ſpirituall perſecution being ouercome, he fears not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt himſelfe, for the loue of thee, to a materiall ſword. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if it be pleaſinge to thy mercy, the weakenes of our condition wil bee able, accordinge to our litle ſtrength, to correſpond with the greateneſſe of our Creator.</p>
               <p>This, O deare Ieſus, is that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial medicine: this is the antidote of thy loue. I beſeech thee, by thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient mercyes of thyne, infuſe ſome ſuch thing into my wounds, as wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby, I (caſting vp the contagion of vipers, which I haue ſuckt) may be reintigrated to my former health,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44014:24"/>
and that vpon the taſte of the Nectar of thy diuine ſweetnes, I may be drawen to deſpiſe the inticeinge va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this world, with my whole hart; and that, by thy goodnes, I may not be freighted with any aduerſity which can happen here; but, being mindefull of that nobility which is to laſt for euer, I may ſtill loath the windes of this tranſitory world. Lett nothinge, I beſeech thee, be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to me, witheut thee.

Lett all things, I beſeeche thee, growe baſe, &amp; odious without thee. That which is contrary to thee, lett it be troubleſome to me, and lett thy good pleaſure, be my eternall deſire. Lett it be à tedious thing to me, to reioyce without thee; and lett it delight me, to be greiued for thee. Lett thy very name, be a ioy to my hart; and lett the comfort of thy memory, bring my tears, which may be the bread I feed on, day and night, whileſt I ſeeke thy lawe. And lett that lawe be eſteemed by me, beyonde thouſands of gold and

Make mine ears ſtand open to thy Commaundements. And I beſeech thee, by thy holy Name, lett not my hart decline towards the words of malice, to the makeinge of excuſes vpon excuſes, of my ſinns: and I beſeech thee alſo, by that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble humility of thine, that the foote of pride may not come towards me, and that the hand of a ſinner may not ſtirre me.</p>

               <p>BEholde, O thou Omnipotent God, the Father of my Lord, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thou graciouſly, and haue mercy on me. I beſeech thee, I ſay, ſince whatſoeuer I haue conceiued to be beſt, I haue deuoutly offerred; and whatſoeuer I haue found to be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44014:25"/>
moſt excellent, I haue humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to thee. I haue left nothing in my ſelfe, which I haue not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to thy Maieſty; Nothinge now remaines for me to adde, for I haue faſtned all my hope on thee. I haue directed to thee, thyne owne deare Sonne, who is mine Aduocate. I haue placed that glorious ofſpringe of thine, as a mediatour betweene thee, and me. I haue placed him, as I ſaid, for an interceſſour; by whoſe meanes I hope for pardon. I haue offred by theſe wordes of myne, that Word of thine, who, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was ſent, for the pardon of my ſinnes; and I haue recounted to thee, the Paſſion of thy moſt Holy Sonne, which I beleeue he hath endured for me. I beleeue that the Deity was ſent by thee, and that it tooke vpon it ſelfe, my humanity; wherein he diſdained not to ſuffer blowes, fetters ſpittings, and ſcornes; yea euen the Croſſe, Nailes, and Launce.</p>
               <p>His Humanity was intertained with the cryes of infancy; it was bound in by the ſwathinge cloathes of that tender age; it was vexed by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44014:26"/>
the labour, and ſweat of his youth; it was extenuated alſo by faſtinge, afflicted by watchinge, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out by trauelling. It was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes loaden with ſtirpes, and torne in ſunder with other torments. It was ranked amongſt the dead, and when once it was indued with the glory of Reſurrection, he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it into the ioyes of heauen. This is that, which muſt appeaſe thee, and this muſt propitiate for me.</p>
               <p>Obſerue therefore here, O God with mercy, what Sonne thou haſt begotten, and what ſlaue thou haſt redeemed. Obſerue who is the Maker, and deſpiſe not the thinge which he hath made. Imbrace thou the sheepheard with ioy, and with mercy looke vpon that sheepe, which he hath brought home vpon his owne shoulders. This is that moſt faithfull sheepheard, who with many, and greate laboures, hath fought this poore sheepe, which ſo long was erring vp and downe, by thoſe abrupt, and rocky hills, and by thoſe precepices, which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke thoſe vallies. And who when
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44014:26"/>
it was euen dyinge, through the faintneſſe to which it was growen by that tedious errour, and exile; yet as ſoone as he could meete with it, he did with ioy putt himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath it; and with an admirable exerciſe, and ſtrife of charity, he raiſed it out of that profound pitt of confuſion; and haueinge impriſoned it in his owne boſome, by deare imbracements, he brought that one which he had loſt, to the ninty nine which remayned.</p>
               <p>Behold, O Lord my Kinge, and my God Omnipotent! Behold how the good Paſtor brings thee, that which thou haſte committed to his charge. He vndertooke the ſaluation of man by thy direction, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores him to thee, free from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Behold how thy moſt deare Sonne reconciles thy Creature to thee, which had wandred from thee ſo farr. Behold how that meeke Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of mine, brings back to thy flocke, that which the violent theefe had driuen away. He reſtoreth that ſlaue to thy ſight, whome his owne conſcience had made a fugitiue; that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44014:27"/>
he, who of himſelfe deſerued pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, by meanes of him, may obteyne pardon; and that he to whome hell was due for his ſinnes, by the meanes of ſo great a Captaine, may confide that he shalbe recalled to his country. I was well able, O holy Father, to offend thee of my ſelfe; but of my ſelfe, I was not able to appeaſe thee. Thy beloued Sonne, O my God, is become my helper, participateinge of my humanity, that he might cure my infirmity; that ſo from whence the cauſe of mine offence was growen, from thence he might offer the Sacrifice of praiſe to thee; and might therby make me acceptable to thy mercy; ſince, he showeth himſelfe, ſitting at thy right hand, as a confort of my ſubſtance, and nature. Behold, this is my hope, this is all the confidence I haue. If thou deſpiſe me, as thou haſt reaſon for my ſinn, yet looke back vpon me at leaſt with mercy, for the loue of thy beloued Sonne. Conſider that, in thy Sonne, wherby thou maiſttake pitty vpon the ſlaue.</p>
               <p>Behold the miſtery of his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44014:27"/>
and pardon the ſenſuality of my conuerſation. As often as thou beholdeſt the wounds of thy bleſſed Sonne; I beſeech thee, lett my wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes shrink out of thy ſight. As often as thy pretious blood, lookes read from that holy ſide, I beſeech thee, that the ſpotts of my corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be washed away. And as flesh prouoked thee to wrath, ſo lett flesh, I beſeeche thee, incline thee to mercy. And in fine, as flesh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced vs to ſinn, ſo lett flesh bring vs back to pardon. It is much that my impiety diſerueth; but yet it is much more which the piety of my Redeemer doth iuſtly exact. My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice is great, I confeſſe it: but farr greater is the Iuſtice of my Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For, as much as God is Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to man, ſo much is my malice inferior to his goodnes, both in quantity and quality.</p>
               <p>For in what hath man ſinned, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Sonne of God, being made Man, hath not redeemed him? What pride was able to ſwell ſo highe, as that ſo great humility would not be able to beate it downe? What domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44014:28"/>
of death could be ſo abſolute, which the torment of the Croſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by the Sone of God, will not deſtroy. Infaillibly, O my God, if the faults of a ſinfull man, and the grace of him who redeemed them, be putt into an equall ballance, the Eaſt will not be found ſo farr diſtant from the weſt; nay the loweſt parte of hell, will not be found ſo farr diſtant from the higheſt pich of heauen, as they two will be.</p>
               <p>Now therfore, O thou moſt excellent Creator of light, pardon my faults, through the immenſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of thy beloued Sonne. Lett now I beſeech thee, his piety pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiate for my impiety; his modeſty for my peruerſity; his meekenes for my rudenes; his humility for my pride; his patience for my impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; his benignity for my harshnes; his obedience for my diſobedience; his tranquillity for my vnquietneſſe, his ſweetenes for my bitterneſſe; his mildneſſe for my anger; and let his charity ouerworke my cruelty.</p>

               <p>We doe therfore thank thee. O moſt Clement, and benigne louer of mankind; who when we were not, didſt powerfully create vs, by Ieſus-Chriſte thy Sonne our Lord. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were loſt, by our owne fault, thou didſt admirably deliuer, and recouer vs. I giue thankes to thy mercy; many thanks doe I giue thee with the whole affection of my hart; who (through that vnſpeakable charity, wherewith thou didſt vouchſafe, with ſtrange goodnes, to loue vs miſerable, and vnworthy Creatures) didſt ſend thyne onely begotten Sonne, from thyne owne boſome, for our common good; ſo to ſaue vs ſinners, who were then the ſonns of wrath. I giue thee thanks for his holy Incarnation, and Natiuity, and for his glorious Mother, of whom he vouchſafed to aſſume flesh for vs, and our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; that as he was true God of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44014:34"/>
God, ſo he might alſo, be true man of man. I thanke thee for his Croſſe and Paſſion, for his death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; for his Aſcenſion into heauen, and for his ſeat of Maieſty at thy right hand. For vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fortieth day after his Reſurrection, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge aboue all the heauens (whileſt his Diſciples were lookeing on) and being ſeated at thy right hand, he did according to his promiſſe, powre forth the Holy Ghoſte vpon the Children of adoption.</p>
               <p>I thank thee, for that moſt ſacred effuſion of his moſt pretious Blood, wherby we are redeemed; and withall, for that Sacred, and Holy, and quickninge Miſtery of his Body and Blood, which dayly we eate and drinke in the Church, and wherby we are washed and ſanctified, and made partakers of that one ſupreame diuinity. I thank thee for this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and vnſpeakable charity of thine, wherby thou haſt ſo loued, and ſaued vs, vnworthy creatures, by that onely, and beloued Sonne of thine. For thou didſt ſo loue the world, as to giue thy onely begotten

Sonne, that euery one who beleeued in him, might not perish, but haue eternall life. And this is eternall life, that we may knowe thee our true God, and whome thou haſt ſent Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus-Chriſte, by right faith, and by works which are worthy, and ſutable to that faith.</p>

               <p>O Immenſe Piety, O ineſtimable Charity; that thou might free thy ſlaue, thou haſte deliuered vpp thy Sonne; God is made man to the end that wretchd man, might be drawen out of the prower of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. How inſpeakably a benigne louer of man, is thy Sonne our God, to whoſe bowels of mercy, it ſeemed not ſufficient, that he should dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish himſelfe, ſo much as to be made man of the true Virgin Mary; vnleſſe withall, he had vndergone the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Croſſe, shedding ſo his Blood for vs, and for our ſaluation. Our mercyfull God came downe; he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44014:35"/>
came, through his owne pitty, and goodneſſe; he came to ſeeke, and ſaue, that which was loſte. He ſought his loſt sheepe, he ſought and found it, and he brought it home vpon his owne shoulders into his folde. Being a mercifull Lord, and extreamely deare Paſtour. O Charity! O Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! who euer heard of ſuch things as theſe? who is he, that vpon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſinge of theſe bowels of mercy, will not be amazed? who will not wonder? who will not reioyce, for that exceſſiue Charity of thyne, wherewith thou louedſt vs; Thou didſt ſend thy Sonne in the likeneſſe of the flesh of ſinn, that by ſinn he might condemne ſinn, and that we might be made thy iuſtice in him. For he is the true vnſpotted lambe, who hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away the ſinns of the world who hath diſtroyed our death, by dyinge, and reſtored our life, by his Reſurrection. But what can we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to thee, O our God, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitts of thy mercy, which are ſo greate? What praiſes, and what thanks can we giue? For althouge we did poſſeſſe that knoweledge and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44014:36"/>
power, which the Angells haue, yet should we be vnable, to make returne of any thing which might be worthy of thy mercy and goodnes. If all the parts of our body, were conuerted into tongues, this meaneſſe of ours would neuer yet be able to anſweare thee with due praiſe. For that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Charity, which thou haſte beene pleaſed to shew to vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Creatures, through thyne onely pitty, and goodnes, doth farr tranſcend all our knoweledge. For thy So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne our God, did not aſſume the Angelicall nature, but the ſeed of Abraham, being made like to vs, in all things except ſinn. And ſo our Lord, takeinge the Nature, not of Angells, but of men vpon him, and glorifying it with the Stole of holy Reſurrection, and immortality; he exalted vs aboue all the Heauens, aboue all the Quires of Angells, and aboue Cherubine, and Seraphine, placeing it at thy right hand. And this Nature, doe the Angells praiſe, and the Dominations adore; and all the Vertues of Heauen tremble to behold aboue them all, God-Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:44014:36"/>This is all my hope, and all my confidence. For there is in Ieſus-Chriſte, our Lord himſelfe, a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the flesh, and blood of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of vs. Where then any parte of me reignes, there I am confident I alſo reigne. Where my flesh is glorified, there doe I conceiue my ſelfe to be glorious. Where my blood doth beare Dominion, there do I finde my ſelfe to rule. Though I be a ſinner, yet I cannot diffide not to participate in this grace. Though my ſinns keepe me back, yet my ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce calls me on. Though my offences shutt me out, yet my communion of nature with him, reiects me not. For God is not ſo cruell, that he can forgett man, and not remember the thinge which he bears about himſelfe; and which, for my ſake, he tooke vpon him, &amp; which for my ſake he ſought. No, our Lord God is full of meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and benignity; and he loues his flesh, his body, and his bowells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the ſame God, and Lord Ieſus-Chriſte, who is moſt ſweete, moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne and moſt clement; in whoſe perſon we are already riſen, and are

We are his members and his flesh; and he in fine, is our head; and of theſe parts, the whole body is made, as it is writen: Bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh and they shalbe two in one flesh.

In the meane tyme this I know, that it goes ill with me, when I want thee O Lord. And not onely is it ill with me, in reſpect of the things which are without me, but in reſpect of them alſo which are within me. For whatſoeuer plenty there may be in the world, which is not my God, is noe better to me, then meere begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

For we are drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe faſt enough, by the waight of our frailty; but by thy guifte we are kindled, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vpward, and we are inflamed, and we fly on, whither we are goe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, which is towards the peace of Ieruſalem.

Though therfore the firſt of all the creatures was a kinde of Wiſdome (Which was made to be a rationall, &amp; intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall mind; inhabiting thy holy Citty, our mother which is aboue, and which is free, and eternall in the Heauens) &amp; what Heauens but thoſe Heauens of the Heauens, which praiſe thee, becauſe this is that, wherof it is ſaid, The Heauens of the Heauens to our Lord, &amp; although we finde no Tyme before that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe it was before the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tyme, as being the firſt of all the creatures; yet neuertheleſſe thou art before it. O Eternall God, the Creator of all things, from whome, as ſoone as it was made, it tooke a beginninge, though not indeed, of Tyme, becauſe Tyme was not then created; but yet a beginninge of that nature, which it was come to haue.

               <p>In fine, that creature doth ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear to thee, our true God, who art truely eternall, that although it be not coeternall to thee, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is not diſcharged, nor diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thee, into any variety, or viciſſitude of tyme.

For to ſuch, an one ô Lord as loues thee, as much as thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt, thou doſt cleerly diſcouer thy ſelfe, and it ſufficeth him.

ſing praiſe to his holy Name. O my ſoule, bleſſe our Lord, and forgett not all his benefitts. O all yea workes of our Lord, bleſſe our Lord, in all the places of his dominion. Let vs praiſe God, whome the Dominations adore, whome Cherubin and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin, with a neuer ceaſing voice, proclame, Holy, Holy, Holy. Let vs ioyne our voyce, to the voice of the holy Angells, and lett vs praiſe this Lord, who is common to vs both, to the vttermoſt of our power. For they praiſe our Lord, moſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, and inceſſantly, who are alwayes plunged in that diuine contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not by a glaſſe, or in a figure, but face to face.</p>
               <p>But who shalbe able to ſay, or ſo much as to thinke, what kinde of innumerable multitude of bleſſed Spiritts, and celeſtiall powers, that is, which ſtandeth in the ſight of our Omnipotent Lord God? What glory, what endles feſtiuity they enioy, by the viſion of God? What delight, without any defect? what ardour of loue, not tormenting, but delighting? who can ſay, what deſire
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44014:58"/>
there is, of the viſion of God, when they haue ſaciety, and how they can haue ſaciety with deſire? where in nether deſire, procures any payne, nor ſaciety breeds any loathinge? How they growe to be happy, by adhearing, to that ſupreame beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? How they growe to be made light, by their coniunction with that true light? How by euer beholdinge the immutable Trinity, themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues are changed into immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</p>
               <p>But how shall we be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that higth of Angelicall dignity, when we are not able, ſo much as to finde out, the nature of our owne ſoule? what kinde of thing is that, which is able to giue life to flesh, and yet is not able ſo much as to conteyne it ſelfe in good thoughts? what kinge of thing is this, ſo ſtrong, and ſe weake, ſo little, and ſo great; which ſearcheth into the ſecrets of God, and riſeth into contemplation of celeſtiall things; and is prooued to haue found out, with ſuch ſubtill power of witt, the skill of ſo many arts, for the vſe of man? what kind
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44014:59"/>
of thing is this, which knoweth ſo many other things, and yet is ſo wholyignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of how it ſelfe comes to be made? For although many doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things be ſaid by many about the beginninge of the ſoule, yet we finde it to be a certaine intellectual ſpiritt, a ſpirit made by the power of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; liueinge after a ſort immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, and quickninge the body which it doth ſuſtaine, ſubiect to mutability, and forgetfulneſſe which is often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by feare, and extolled by ioy. O admirable thinge, and to which all aſtonishment is due. Of God, the Creator of vs all, who is vnſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incomprehenſible, we read, we ſpeake, and we write exceſſiuely, ſublimely, &amp; wounderfull things, without any ambiguity at all but whatſoeuer we ſay of Angells, and ſoules, we are not ſo well able to prooue.</p>
               <p>But yet lett the minde paſſe on euen from theſe thinges, and tranſcend all that which is created. Lett it runn and riſe, and flutter, and fly through; and lett it fix the eyes of Faith, as eagerly as it can, vpon him who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44014:59"/>
all things. I will therfore, make certaine ſtepps of riſeinge in my hart; and by them I will aſſend into my ſoule; and by the pureſt power of my minde, I will aſſend to my Lord, who remaines ouer my head.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer is viſibly ſeene, whatſoeuer is imagined, though in a moſt ſpirituall manner, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue farr of, from the ſight of my hart and minde, with a ſtrong hand. Let the pure and ſimple power of my vnderſtanding paſſing on, with a ſpeedy flighte towards him, arriue to him who is that Creator himſelfe both of Angells and ſoules, and all things elſe.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed is that ſoule, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh inferior things, and aſpireth to them, which are ſublyme; and placeing the ſeat of her habitation, in thoſe highe vnhaunted wayes, doth conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate the Sunn of Iuſtice, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe mighty rocks, with eagles eyes. For there is nothinge ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and ſo delightfull, as with the sharpe ſight of the minde, and the eager deſire of the hart, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template this God himſelfe alone,

and after a wounderfull manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſibly to beholde him who is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, &amp; ſo, to taſte, not the ſweetnes of this world, but of another; and to behold not this inferior; kind of light, but another. For this light, which is shutt vp in place, is alſo ended in tyme, its varied by the interruption of night; and this light, which is common to vs with wormes, and other vnreaſonable beaſts, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that other ſouueraigne light, is rather to be called night then light.</p>

Let our voice therfore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelfe beyond the Angells, and lett man contemplate God, with an carneſt minde; and lett him, with what words he can, expreſſe Gods praiſes, to God himſelfe. For it is all reaſon, that the Creature should praiſe his Creator, ſince he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to create vs, that we might praiſe him, when yet he had noe need of our praiſes. For his vertue is incomprehenſible, he needeth none, but is all ſufficient for himſelfe. Our Lord is great, and his vertue is great, and of his wiſdome there is noe end. Our Lord God is great, and highly worthy to be prayſed. Let our ſoule therfore loue him, let our tongues ſing of him, and our hand write of him; and let the faithfull hart im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it ſelfe, onely, in theſe holy thoughts. Let the man of ſpirituall deſires, and a contemplator of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial myſteries, be dayly recreated, with the moſt delicious food of this heauenly contemplation; that ſo being fully fed, with this heauenly

For we doe not pretend, to finde out any beginninge, of that ſupreame goodneſſe, which thou thy ſelfe art, from whence all things, by which all things, and in which all things: but we ſay, that all other things, are good by the participation of that goodnes, For thy diuine Eſſence, did euer, and doth ſtill want Matter, although it doe not want Forme, namely that Forme which was neuer formed, the Forme of all Formes, that moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Forme, which when thou doſt imprint vpon particuler things (as it might be ſome ſeale) thou makeſt them, without all doubte,

And yet we doe not therefore ſay, that thou filleſt all things, as if they did conteyne thee, but rather ſo, as that they be conteyned by thee. Nor yet doſt thou fill them all by partes, nor is it to be thought, by any meanes, that euery creature receiues thee after the rate of the bigneſſe which it ſelfe hath: that is to ſay, the greater, the greater parte: &amp; the leſſe the leſſe: ſince thou thy ſelfe, art in them all, &amp; all of them in thee: whoſe Omnipotency concludeth all things nor can any man finde a way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make eſcape from thy power, For he, who hath thee not wel. pleaſed, wilbe ſure not to eſcape thee, being offended; as it is written, neither from the Eaſt, nor from the

The imme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſity of thy diuine greatnes is ſuch, that we muſt knowe thee to be whithin all things, and yet not included, and without all thinges, yet not excluded. And therefore thou art interior, that thou maiſte conteyne all things: and therefore thou art exterior, that by the immenſity of thy greatnes, thou maiſte conclude, all things. By this therefore, that thou art interior, thou art showed to be the Creator; but by this, that thou art exterior, thou art proued to be the Gouernour of them all. And leaſt all things which are created, should be without thee, thou art interior; but thou art exterior, to the end that all things may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in thee.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44014:66"/>
vnderſtand them not. The inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vnity therfore of thy nature, cannot haue the perſons ſeperable, becauſe as thou art Trinity in Vnity, and Vnity in Trinity, ſo thou canſt not haue ſeparation of perſons.</p>
               <p>It is true, that thoſe perſons are named ſeuerally; but yet thou art ſo pleaſed to show thy ſelfe, O God, thou Trinity, to be inſeperable in thy perſons, as that there is noe name belonginge to thee in any one of them, which may not be referred to another, according to the rules of relation. For as the Father to the Sonne, and the Sonne to the Father; ſo the Holy Ghoſte is moſt truely referred, both to the Father &amp; So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. But thoſe names, which ſignify thy ſubſtanec, or perſon, or power, or Eſſence, or any thing which properly is called God, doe equally agree to all the perſons; As great God, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent and eternall God; and all thoſe things which naturally are ſaide of thee, O God. Therefore there is noe name, which concernes the nature of God, which can ſo agree to God the Father, as that it
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44014:66"/>
may not alſo agree to God the Sonne, as alſo to God the Holy Ghoſte. As for example, we ſay the Father is naturally God, but ſo is the Sonne naturally God; and ſo alſo is the Holy Ghoſte naturally God; and yet not three Gods, but naturally one God, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſte: Therfore art thou ô Holy Trinity, inſeperable in thy perſons, as thou art to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode by our mind, although thou haue ſeperable names in worde; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou doſt by no meanes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a plurall number, in the names belonging to thy nature. For herby it is showed, that the perſons cannot be deuided in the bleſſed Trinity, which is one true God, becauſe the name of any one of the Perſons, doth euer relate to an other of them. For if I name the Father, I shew the Sonne; if I ſpeake of the Sonne, I proclame the Father: if I ſpeake of the Holy Ghoſte, it is neceſſarily to be vnderſtoode, that he is the Spiritt of ſome other, namely of the Father, and of the Sonne. Now this it that true Faith, which flowes from ſound

               <p>O Ieſus, our Redemption, our Deſire, and our Loue; thou God of God, giue helpe to me, who am thy ſeruant. I inuoKe thee, I call vpon thee, with a mighty crye, and with my whole hart. I inuoke thee into my ſoule, enter into it, &amp; make it fitt for thy ſelfe, that thou maiſt poſſeſſe it without ſpott, and wrinckle. For to a moſt pure Lord, a moſt pure habitation is due. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify me therfore, who am the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell which thou haſt made. Euacuate me of malice, and fill me with grace, and ſtill keepe me full, that I may be made a Temple, worthy to be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by thee, both here, and in the other euerlaſting world. O thou moſt ſweete, moſt benigne, moſt loueing, moſt deer, moſt powerfull, moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable, moſt pretious, moſt amiable, moſt beautifull God: thou who art more ſweete then hony, more white
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44014:75"/>
then any milk or ſnow, more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then Nectar, more pretious then gold or jewells, and more deere to me, then all the riches and honors of the earth. But what doe I ſay, O my God, O thou my onely hope, and my ſo abundant mercy? What doe I ſay, O thou my happy, and ſecure ſweetnes? What doe I ſay when I vtter ſuch things as theſe? I ſay what I can, but I doe not ſay what I should.</p>
               <p>O that I could ſay ſuch things, as thoſe Quires of Angells doe vtter, in thoſe celeſtiall Hymns O how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly would I euen ſpend, &amp; powre out my whole ſelfe, vpon thy prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? O how faine would I, moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly, and moſt indefatigablie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime thoſe Hymns of celeſtiall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody, in the middeſt of thy Church, to the praiſe and glory of thy Name; But becauſe I am not able to doe theſe things compleatly, shall I therefore hold my peace: woe be to them, who hold their peace of thee, who looſeſt the tongues of dumm perſons, and makeſt the tongues of children eloquent. Woe woe be to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44014:76"/>
them who hold their peace of thee, for euen they who ſpeak moſt, may be accompted to be but dumbe, when they doe not ſpeake thy praiſe.</p>
               <p>But now who shalbe able wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to prayſe thee, O thou vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Wiſdome of the Father? But yet although I finde noe wordes whereby I may ſufficiently vnfold thee, who art the Omnipotent, and Omniſcient Word; I will yet; in thy meane tyme ſay what I can, till thou biddeſt me come to thee, where I may ſay that of thee, which is fitt, and which I am bound to ſay. And therefore I humbly pray, that thou wilt not haue an eye, ſo much to that which I ſay now in deed, as to that which I ſay in my deſire. For I deſire (and that with a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) to ſay that of thee, which is fitt and iuſt, becauſe it is fitt that thou be praiſed; and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all honor is due to thee Thou ſeeſt therefore, O God, thou who knoweſt of all ſecrett things, that thou art more deer to me, not onely then the earth, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44014:76"/>
all that is therein, but that thou art more acceptable, and amiable to me, then heauen it ſelfe, and all that it conteynes. For I loue thee, more then heauen, and earth, and all thoſe other things which are in them; Nay theſe tranſitory things are without doubt not to be beloued at all, if it weare not, for the loue of thy Name. I loue thee, O my God, with a greate loue, and I deſire to loue thee yet more.</p>
               <p>Giue me grace, that I may euer loue thee as much as I deſire, and as much as I ought, that thou alone maiſt be all my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all my meditation. Let me conſider thee, all the day long without ceaſinge; let me feele thee, euen when I am ſleeping, by night; let my ſpiritt ſpeake to thee; lett my minde conuerſe with thee; let my hart be illuſtrated with the light of thy holy viſion; that thou being my Director, and my Captayne, I may walke on, from vertue to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and that at laſt, I may ſee thee, the God of Gods in Syon. Now as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44014:77"/>
in a glaſſe, or in a cloude; but then face to face, where I shall knowe thee, as I am knowen.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed are the cleane of hart, for they are the men who shall ſee God. Bleſſed are they who dwell in thy howſe, O Lord, for euer, and for euer, shall they praiſe thee. I beſeech thee therefore, O Lord, by all thy mercyes, whereby we are freed from eternall death, mollyfy my hart, which is hard, &amp; ſtony, and rocky, and ſteely, with thy powerfull, and moſt ſacred vnction; and grant, that by the fire of contrition, I may beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me a liueing ſacrifice before thee, in euery moment of my life. Make me euer to haue a contrite and humbled hart, in thy preſence, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tears. Grant that through my great deſire of thee, I may be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deade to this world; and that I may forgett theſe tranſitory things, through the greatnes of my loue, and feare of thee; and this ſo farr forth, as that I may neuer reioyce nor mourne, nor feare any thinge, which is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall; and that I may not loue them; leaſt ſo I be eyther corrupted by

And becauſe the loue of thee, is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as death, I beſeech thee that the fiery and mellifluous force of thy loue, may ſuck vp, and deuoure my whole minde, from all thoſe things which are vnder heauen; that I may in heare to thee alone, and be fedd with the memory of thy onely ſweetnes.</p>
               <p>O Lord, I beſeech thee, I beſeech thee, and ſtill I beſeech thee, that the moſt ſweete odour of thee, and thy mellifluous loue may deſcend, and enter into my hart, Lett that admirable, and vnſpeakable fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grance of thy ſauour, come into me, which may kindle an euerlaſtingly a burning deſire of thee in my hart, and which may draw out from thence, thoſe vaynes of water which ſpring vp to eternall life. Thou art immenſe, O Lord, and therfore it is but reaſon that thou be loued and praiſed, beyond all meaſure, by them whome thou haſt redeemed with thy pretious Blood. O thou moſt benigne louer of man.

Iudge, to whome the Father gaue all power of Iudgment; Thou ſeeſt how vniuſt a thinge it is, that the children of this world, the children of night, and darknes, should with a more ardent deſire, indeauour, and ſtudy, and ſeeke perishing riches, and tranſitory ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, then we thy ſeruants doe loue thee our God, by whome we are created and redeemed. But if on the other ſide, a man will affect ſome man, with ſo great loue, as that one of them will ſcarce indure the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the other; if the Spouſe be tranſported, with ſo great ardour of affection to her fellow Spouſe, that through the greatnes of her loue; shee can take noe reſt, nor beare the abſence of that deareſt freind, without deep ſorrowe; with what loue, with what labour, with what feruour ought that ſoule, which thou haſte eſpouſed to thy ſelf by Faith, and other mercyes, loue thee her true God, and her moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Spouſe, who haſt ſo loued, and ſaued her, and haſte done ſo many, and, ſo great thinges for her good.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44014:80"/>
For although this world haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne delights and loues belonging to it, yet doe they not ſo delight, as thou O God. In thee the iuſt man is indeed delighted, becauſe thy loue is ſweete, and quiet; for the harts which thou doſt poſſeſſe, thou filleſt with tranquillity, ſweetnes, and delight, On the other ſide, the loue of this world, and of the flesh, breeds anxiety, and pertubation, and depriues thoſes ſoules of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes into which it enters; for it doth euer ſollicite them, with ſuſpitions, perturbations, and many fears. Thou art therefore the delight of iuſt perſons, &amp; that iuſtly. For the ſtrength of reſt and peace, is with thee, and a life vncapable of pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. He who enters into thee, O deere Lord, enters into the ioy of his Lord and shall haue nothing more to feare; but shall finde himſelfe to be perfectly well, in the moſt excellent place which can be thought; and he will ſay, This is my reſt for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nityes, this shalbe my habitation, for I haue choſen it; And agayne, Our Lord gouernes me, and nothing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44014:81"/>
shalbe wantinge, in that place of full feedinge; yea there it is, that he hath lodged me.</p>
               <p>Sweete Chriſt, deare Ieſus, fill my hart for euer, I beſeech thee, with the vnquenchable loue, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall memory of thee; in ſuch ſort, as that I may all burn vp, like any eager flame, in the ſweetnes of thy loue, which many waters, may neuer be able to extinguish, in me. Grant O moſt ſweete Lord, that I may loue thee, and that through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the I may diſcharge my ſelfe of the waight of all carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; and of the moſt greiuous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of all earthly concupiſcences, which impugne, and oppreſſe my miſerable ſoule, that running lightly after thee, in the odour of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious oyntements, till I be effectually ſatisfyed with the viſion of thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auty, I may, with all ſpeed, arriue thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct. For there are two kindes of loues; one good, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther badd; one ſweete, and another bitter, and they cannot both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in one hart. And therefore if any man loue any thinge, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44014:81"/>
of thee, thy loue, O Lord, is not in him. That loue of ſweetnes, and that ſweetnes of loue; not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting but delightinge; a loue, which remaineth ſincerely, and chaſtely for all eternity, a loue which euer burnes, and is neuer quenched.</p>
               <p>O ſweete Chriſte, O deer Ieſus, O Charity! my God, inflame me all with thy fire, with thy loue, with thy ſweetnes and delight, with thy ioy &amp; exultation, with thy pleaſure and ardent deſire which is holy, and good; chaſte, and pure, ſecure, and ſerene; that being all full of the ſweetnes of thy loue, and all burnt vp, in the flame of thy charity, I may loue thee, O God, with my whole hart, and with all the marrow of my affections; haueing thee ſtill, and euery where, in my hart, in my mouth, and before my eyes, ſo that there may neuer be any place open in me, for any adulterine or impure loue.

Heale me, O Lord, and I shalbe healed, doe thou ſaue me, and I shalbe ſaued; thou, who cureſt the ſick, and conſerueſt the ſound; thou who with the onely beck of thy will, reſtoreſt that which is in decay, and ruine. For if thou vouchſafe to ſowe good ſeede in thy feild, which is my hart, it will firſt be neceſſary, that, with the hand of thy pitty, thou shouldeſt pluck vp the thornes of my vices.</p>
               <p>O moſt ſweete, moſt benigne, moſt loueing, moſt deer, moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, moſt amiable, and moſt beautifull God, infuſe, I beſeech

Write, with thy finger in my hart, the ſweete memory of thy mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifluous Name, which may neuer be blotted out againe. Write thy will, and thy lawe, in the tables of my hart, that I may haue both thy lawe, and thy ſelfe, O Lord of immenſe ſweetnes, at all tymes and places, before myne eyes. Burne vp my mynde with that fire of thyne, which thou did'ſt ſend into the world, and did'ſt deſire that it might be much kindled; that I may daily offer to thee, abundance of tears, the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a troubled ſpirit, and contrite hart.</p>

But whileſt I call to mind her ſo great vertue, and conſtancy, I am racked with greife, and confounded with shame, becauſe I finde my ſelfe too miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie caſt downe, towards vanity. But if she wept ſo bitterly, and did ſo perſeuer in weepinge, who onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to haue a ſonne; how ought my ſoule to lament, and continue in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, which ſeekes and loues God, and earneſty deſires to get home to him?

She had already entered into the ſepulcher once and agayne; but that which in it ſelfe, ſeemes too much, ſeemes not enough, to one that loues. The vertue of a good worke is perſeuerance; and becauſe she loued thee beyond the reſt, and loueing wept, and weeping ſought, and ſeeking perſeuered, therefore did she deſerue, to be the firſt of all others to finde the out; and to ſpeake with thee. And not onely that, but she was the firſt proclamer of thy glorious Reſurrection, to thy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; thy ſelfe thus directing, and ſweetly commaunding that it should be ſo, Goe, and will my brethren that they paſs on into Gallile; they shall ſee me there, But now, if that woeman wept, and continued in weepinge, who ſought the liueing, amongſt the dead, and who tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thee but with the hand of

How ought ſuch a ſoule to lament and weepe, which loues thee with her whole hart, and couetts to ſee thee with her whole deſire?

               <p>O my God, let me be all offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp, vpon the altar of my hart; and let me be receyued by thee as a moſt acceptable ſacrifice to thee in the odour of ſweetnes.</p>

               <p>O Lord Ieſus, O Holy Ieſus, O good Ieſus, who dideſt vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to dy for our ſinns, and to riſe agayne, for our Iuſtification; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, by that glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of thyne, raiſe me vp from the ſepulchre of all my vices, and ſinns; &amp; dayly giue me a part, in thy Reſurrection by grace, that I may obteyne to be made a true pertaker of thy Reſurrection to glory. O thou moſt ſweete, moſt benigne, moſt loueinge, moſt pretious, moſt amiable, and moſt beautifull, Lord, who dideſt aſcend vp to heauen, in a triumph of glory; and beinge a moſt puiſſant Kinge doſt ſitt at the right hand of thy Father: Drawe me vpward, that I may runn after thee, in the purſute and ſent of thy odoriferous oyntments.

Nay, rather drawe me to thy very ſelfe, who art the true liueinge fountayne; that ſo accordinge to the vttermoſte of my capacity, I may drinke that, where-vpon I may for euer liue, O thou my God, and my life. For thou haſte ſaid, with thy holy and bleſſed mouth: If any man thirſt, let him come to me, and drinke. O thou fountayne of life, grant to my thirſty ſoule, that it may alwayes drinke of thee; that, accordinge to thy holy and faithfull promiſſe, the liueing waters may flowe from me, O thou fountayne of life, fill my minde, with the torrent of thy delight, and inebriate my hart with the ſober ebriety of thy loue; that I may forget all vaine, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d earthly things, and may perpetually haue thee, and thee alone, in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; as it is written: I haue beene mindfull of God, and I was delighted.

That my hart may be there, where thou art, who art my incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, diſireable, and extreamely amiable treaſure. For in the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of this life, wherein we are toſſed with ſtormes to and fro ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding vs; and where there is noe ſecure caſtinge of anchor; nor place more eminent, wher-vpon the Doue may place her foote, &amp; repoſe her ſelfe in ſome ſmale meaſure; there is noe where, any ſafe peace; noe where any ſecure quietnes, but euery where warrs and ſtrife; all places full of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes; fighting without, and fears within.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44014:88"/>
Therefore doth this ſoule of myne, which is my companion, and my freind, and which colmes all weary, from trauellinge, vpon a long, and laborious way, lye languishinge, and torne in ſunder, by thoſe vanityes, which it paſſed by; and it doth hunger, and thirſt extreamely; and I haue nothinge to ſett before it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am a poore creature, and a meere begger. Thou ô Lord my God who art rich in all things, and art a moſt plentifull imparter of celeſtiall ſatiety, giue foode to it being weary, recolect it being ſcattered; and repair it being torne in peeces.</p>

               <p>My hart is a high ſea. ſwelling vp with waues. Thou, who dideſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund both windes and ſeas, where vpon great tranquillity did followe, come downe, and walke vpon theſe Waues of my hart; that all my thoughts may become ſerene and quiet; to the end that I may embrace thee, my deare, and onely Lord; and that I may contemplate thee (who art the ſweete light of myne

               <p>Let my memory ſleepe, let it ſleepe, I beſeeche thee, O my Lord God, from all ſinn and vice. Let it hate iniquity, and loue ſanctity. For what is more beautifull, what is more delightfull, then in the middeſt of the deepe darkenes, and the many bitter ſorrowes of this life, to pante towards that diuine ſweetnes of thine, and to aſpire to that eternall beatitude; and there to haue our harts fixed, where it is moſt certaine that true ioy is to be found, O thou moſt ſweete, moſt loueinge, moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne, moſt deare, moſt precious, moſt deſirable, moſt amiable, and moſt beautifull Lord, When shall I be able to ſee thee: When shall I apppeare before thy face?

Vvhen shall I paſſe on into that admirable, and moſt goodly houſe of thine? where the voice of ioy and exultation, is euer ringing out, in thoſe Tabernacles of the Iuſt? Bleſſed are they who dwell in thy houſe, O Lord, for euer, and for euer, shall they praiſe thee. Bleſſed are they, &amp; truely bleſſed; whome thou haſt choſen, and aſſumed into that celeſtiall inheritance. Beholde how thy Saints, O Lord, doe florish like the Lilly; they are filled with the euer ſpringinge plenty of thy houſe; &amp; thou giueſt them to drink of the torrent of thy delights. For thou art the fountayne of life, and in thy light they shall ſee light; in ſo high degree as that they who are but a light illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by thee, ô God, who art the illuminateing light, doe yet shine in thy ſight, like the Sunn it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>O how admirable, how pretious, and how beautifull, be the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44014:90"/>
of thy houſe O thou God of all ſtrength? This ſinfull ſoule of mine is carried with extreame deſire to enter thyther. O Lord, I haue loued the beauty and order of thy houſe; and the place of the habitation of thy glory. One thinge I haue begged of our Lord, and I will neuer leaue to begg the ſame; that I may dwell in the houſe of our Lord, all the days of my life. As the Stagg runns panting towords the fountaines of water, ſo doth my ſoule runn thirſtinge after thee, O God. When shall I come, and once appeare before thy face? When shall I ſee my God, after whome my ſoule is in a deadly thirſt? When shall I ſee him, in the land of the Liueinge; for in this land of the Dyinge, he cannot be ſeene, with mortall eyes. Vvhat shall I doe, miſerable creature that I am; beinge bound vp, hand and foote, by theſe chaynes of my mortality, What shall I doe? Whileſt we remaine in this body, we wander from our Lord. Vve haue not here any permanent Citty, but we are looking after another, which is to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44014:91"/>
come, for our habitation is in heauen Vvoe be vnto me, for that my abode nere is prolonged. I haue dwelt with the inhabitants of Cedar; and my ſoule hath beene too true a dweller there. Vvho will helpe me to the winges of a doue, that I may fly and reſt? Nothinge can be ſo delightfully deare to me as to be with my Lord. It is good for me to adheare to my God. Grant to me, ô Lord, whileſt I am confined to this mortall flesh, that I may adheare to thee, as it is written: He who adhears to our Lord, becometh one ſpiritt with him.</p>
               <p>Grant me, I beſeech thee, the wings of Contemplation; that beinge indued therewith, I may fly vp a pace towards thee. And becauſe all that which is ſinfull, and weake, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keinge downeward, ô Lord hold hold thou my hart, that it may not rush into the bottomes of this darke valley; that by interpoſition of the shadow of the earth, it may not be ſeuered from thee, who art the true Sunn of Iuſtice; and ſo may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from beholdinge celeſtiall
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44014:91"/>
things, by the drawinge of black cloudes ouer it. Therefore am I aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reinge to thoſe ioyes of peace; and to that moſt calme and delight-full ſtate of light. Hold thou faſt my hart in thy hand; for vnleſſe it be by thee it will neuer be able to rayſe it ſelfe to thinges aboue. Thither doe I make all haſte, where ſupreame peace doth reigne; and where eternall tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is reſplendent. Hold faſt, and guide my ſpiritt, and raiſe it; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to thy good will; that ſo thy ſelfe beinge the guide therof, it may aſcend into that region, where there is an eternal ſpring; and where thou feedeſt Iſrael for euer, with the food of truthe; that there (at the leaſt with ſome ſwifte, and catchinge thought). I may now lay hold of thee, who art that Souereigne Vviſdome, remaineinge ouer all things, and gouerninge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducteinge all things.</p>
               <p>But to the ſoule which is ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and ſtruglinge towards thee, there are many thinges which call vpon it, by way of giueinge it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment. O Lord, I beſeeche thee,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44014:92"/>
that they may all be putt to ſilence, by thy commandement. Lett my very ſoule be ſilent to it ſelfe. Lett it paſſe by all things: Lett it tranſcend all thinges created, and diſpatch them all away from it ſelfe. Lett it arriue to thee, and vpon thee, who art the onely Creator of all things: let it faſten the eyes of Faith: let it aſpire towards thee: let it be wholy atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to thee: let it meditate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee: let it contemplate thee: let it place thee euer before her eyes, and lock thee vp in her hart: thee who art the true and ſoueraigne good, &amp; that ioy, which muſt neuer haue an end.</p>
               <p>Many Contemplations there are, whereby a ſoule which is deuoute to thee, may be admirably intertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; fedd; but in none of them is my ſoule ſo delighted, and laid to reſt, as in the thought of thee; and when it thinks and contemplates, thee alone. How great is the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of that ſweetnes of thine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou doſt admirably inſpire the harts of thy louers? How admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is that deernes of thy loue, which they enioy who loue nothinge but
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44014:92"/>
thee; who ſeeke nothinge, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, ſo much as to thinke of any thinge but thee. Happy, ſoules are they, whoſe onely hope thou art: and whoſe onely worke, is Prayer. Happy is that man, who ſits in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and ſilence, and ſtands ſtill vpon his guard, day and night; and who, whileſt he is impriſoned in this poore litte body of his, may yet be able in ſome proportion, to haue a taſte of thy diuine ſweetnes.</p>
               <p>I beſeech thee, ô Lord, by thoſe pretious wounds of thyne, which thou wert pleaſed to beare vpon thy Croſſe, for our ſaluation; and from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that precious Blood did flow, whereby we are redeemed; be pleaſed to wounde this ſinfull ſoule of myne, for which thou didſt alſo vouchſafed to dye. Wound it with the fiery and moſt puiſſant dart of thy exceſſiue charity. For the Word of God is full of life, and efficacy; and it is more penetratiue then any sharp two-edged ſword. Thou art that choiſe arrow, and that moſt sharp ſword, which is able, by thy power, to pearce through the hard buckler of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44014:93"/>
mans hart. Strike through my hart, with the dart of thy loue, that my ſoule may ſay to thee: I am woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with thy loue. And doe it in ſuch ſort, as that out of this very wound of thy loue, abundance of tears may ſtreame downe from mine eyes, day and night. Stricke through, O Lord, ſtrike through, I beſeeche thee, this moſt hard hart of mine, with the deare, &amp; ſtrong pointed launce of thy loue; and pearce downe yet more deepely into the moſt interiour parte of my ſoule, by the mighty power of thy hand. And ſo drawe forth out of this head of mine abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of water; and from theſe mine eyes, a true fountaine of tears, which may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flowe, through my exceſſiue loue, and deſire of the viſion of thy beauty. To the end that I may mourne, day and night, admittinge of no comfort, till I shall obteyne to ſee thee, in thy celeſtiall bedd of ſtate: Thee, who art my beloued, and moſt beautifull Spouſe, my Lord and my God. That beholding there (in the ſociety of ſuch as thou haſt choſen) that glorious, and admirable, &amp; moſt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44014:93"/>
beautifull countenance of thine, (which is topp full of all true ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenes,) I may with profound humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity adore thy Maieſty. And then at laſt, being replenished, with the celeſtiall, and vnſpeakable iubila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternall ioy, I may cry out with ſuch as loue thee, and ſay: Beholde, that which I aſpired too, I ſee. That which I hoped for, I haue, That, which I deſired, I inioy. For to him am I conioyned in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whome being yet on earthe, I loued witth my whole power: I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with entire affection; and I inheared to, with inuincible loue.

Behold, O Lord, how my iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes haue ouergrowne my head, and how they oppreſſe me, as any heauy burden might doe. And vnleſſe thou, whoſe property it is to haue mercy, and to forgiue, be pleaſed to put the hand of thy Maieſty vnder me, I shall not faile to be miſerably drowned in that bottomleſſe pitt.</p>
               <p>Conſider, O Lord God, and ſee, becauſe thou art holy; and behold how my enemy inſulteth ouer me, ſaying, God hath forſaken him, I will perſecute him, and take him, for there is none to deliuer him. But
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44014:96"/>
thou, O Lord, how long? Conuert thy ſelfe to me, and deliuer my ſoule, and ſaue me for thy mercyes ſake. Haue mercy vpon thy Sonn, whome thou didſt begett weth noe ſmall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of thine, and doe not ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my wickednes, as thereby to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gett thyne owne goodnes,</p>
               <p>Who is that Father, which will not deliuer his Sonne? Or who is that Sonne, whome the Father will not correct with the ſtaffe of pitty? Therefore, O my Father, and my Lord, though it be true that I am a ſinner, yet I leaue not, for all that, to be thy Sonne, becauſe thou haſte both made me, and made me agayne. As I haue ſinned, ſo doe thou reforme me; and when thou shalt haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me by thy correction, deliuer me then to thy Sonne. Can the Mother forgett the Childe of her wombe? Yet ſuppoſeing she could, thou haſt promiſed, O Father, that thou wilt not forgett him.</p>
               <p>Behold I cry out, and thou heareſt me not, I am tormented with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, and thou comforteſt me not; What can I ſay, or what shall I doe,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44014:96"/>
moſt wretched creature that I am? I am vtterly without all comfort, and I am caſt of from the ſight of thyne eyes,. Woe is me, from how great happineſſe, into how great miſery am I fallen? Whither was I goeinge, and yet where am I arriued? where am I, or rather where am I not? To whome did I aſpire, and yet now, what kinde of things be they, for which I pant, and ſighe? I haue ſought for happineſſe, and behold I hawe mett wish infelicity. Bebold I am euen dyinge, and Ieſus is not with me &amp; without fayle it is better for me not to be at all, then not to be with Ieſus; it is better for me not to liue at all, then to liue without life.</p>
               <p>But thou, O Lord Ieſus, and what is become of thyne ancient mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes? wilt thou be anggry with me for euer. Be thou appeaſed, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeche thee, and haue mercy on me, and doe not turne thy face from me; thou, who for the redeeminge of me, didſt not turne thy face from ſuch as did reproch, and ſpitt at thee.

Haue mercy on me, leaſt I deſpaire, and grant that I may repoſe in hope; and if I haue committed that for which thou maiſte condemne me: yet thou haſte not loſt, that for which thou art wont to ſaue ſinfull men.</p>

Behold how, being protected vnder the shadowe of thy mercy, I come runninge to thy Throne of glory, askinge par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of thee, and crying out, and knocKinge, till thou take pitty of me. For if thou haſte called vs to take the benefit of thy pardon when we ſought it not, how much more shall we obteyne it, when we ſeeke it? Doe not, O moſt ſwete Ieſus, remember thy Iuſtice againſt this ſinner, but be mindfull of thy benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity towards thy creature. Be not mindfull of thy wrathe, againſt him who is guilty; but be mindfull of thy mercy, towards him who is in

               <p>O Lord Ieſus Chriſte, my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, my mercy, and my ſaluation; I praiſe thee, I giue thee thanks, though they carry noe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to thy benefits. Though they be very voide of deuotion, though they be leane, in reſpect of the fatnes of that moſt ſweete loue of thee which I deſire; yet ſuch as they are, not ſuch, I confeſſe, as I owe, but ſuch as I am able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, my ſoule is now paying to thee. O thou hope of my hart, and thou vertue of my ſoule, and the life and end of all my intentions, lett thy moſt powerfull dignity ſupply that, which my moſt fainte weaknes doth endeauour. And if I haue not yet deſerued ſo much of thee, as to loue thee ſo much as I ought, yet at leaſt I haue an earneſt deſire to. performe the ſame O thou my light, thou ſeeſt my conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, O Lord, all my deſires are
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44014:103"/>
before thee. And if I endeauour to doe any thing which is good, it is thou who beſtoweſt it vpon me. If that be good, O Lord, which thou inſpireſt, or rather becauſe the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which I haue to loue thee is good: grant me that, which it is thy will that I should deſire, and grant that I may obteyne to loue thee, as much as thou requireſt. I giue thee praiſe, and thankes, for what I haue, leſt otherwiſe thy gnift might proue vnfruitfull to me, which thou haſt beſtowed, of thyne owne free will. Perfect that which to haſt begunn, and giue me that, through thy mercy, which thou madeſt me deſire, without any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of mine. Conuert, O moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne Lord, my dull heauineſſe, into a moſt feruent loue of thee. To this, O my moſt mercifull Lord, my prayer, my memory, my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thy benefitts, doe all tend, that thou maiſte kindle thy loue in me. Thy goodes, O Lord, created me, thy mercy, when I was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did cleanſe me from original ſinn, thy patience, after that I was
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44014:104"/>
washed in Baptiſme, hath tolerated, nourished and expected me, when I was all wrapped vp, in the filth of other ſinns. Thou, O my good Lord, didſt expect my amendement, and my ſoule expecteth the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy holy grace, that I may come to pennance, and goode life. O my God, my Creator, my expecter, and my feeder I thirſt after thee, I ſigh towards thee, and vehemently deſir to attaine to thee. And as the poore childe, beinge depriued of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his moſt benigne father, doth inceſſantly weepe and cry out and imbrace, by his memory, that fathers face, with his whole hart, ſo I (not ſo mueh as I should) but ſo much as I can, am mindefull of thy Paſſion, mindfull of thy ſtroakes, mindfull of thy ſtirpes, mindfull of thy wounds, mindfull how thou wert murthred for me, how thou wert embalmed, how thou wert buried; and mindfull alſo of thy glorious Reſurrection, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſcenſion. Theſe things doe I hold faſt, with vndoubted faith, I lament the miſeries of my banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44014:104"/>
I hope for the onely conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thy coming, and I deſire the glorious contemplation of thy face.</p>
               <p>Woe be vnto me, in that I was not able to behold that Lord of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, being humbled to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of men; to the end that he might exalt men, to the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Angells, when God, being offended, dyed, that man who offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, might liue. Vvoe be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that I obteyned not to be amazed, in being preſent at that ſpectacle of admirable and ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable piety. Vvhy, why, at leaſt, O my ſoule doth not the ſword of moſt sharp ſorrow pearce thy hart, ſince thou wert not able to haue endured, that launce which wounded the ſide of thy Sauiour; ſince thou could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not behold thoſe hands and feete of thy Creator, to be ſo violated with nayles, and the bloode of thy Reddeemer, ſo hydeouſly to be shedd?

               <p>Vvhat tears shall I beleeue did bedewe? and bathe thy moſt ſweet holy Face, when thou dideſt behold that Sonne of thyne, who was alſo thy God, &amp; thy Lord, extended vpon the Croſſe, without any falt of his? and that flesh, which was of thyne owne flesh, to be ſo wickedly torne, by wretched people: wiih what kinde of ſobbing ſighes, shall I conceaue thy moſt pure hart to haue beene torne, when thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thoſe words, Woeman, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de thy Sonne, and the Diſciple, Vvoeman beholde thy Mother; when thou tookeſt the Diſciple for the Maſter, and the ſeruant for the Lord.</p>
               <p>O that I had beene the man, who tooke downe my Lord from
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44014:105"/>
the Croſſe, with that happy Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph? That I had embalmed him with odours?

O that with thoſe happy woeman, I had beene frighted, by that bright viſion of thoſe Angells; and had heard that meſſage of the Reſurrection of our Lord: That meſſage of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: That meſſage ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and deſired. O that I had heard theſe words from the mouth of the Angell, Doe not feare, you ſeeke Ieſus crucifyed, but he is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, he is not here.</p>
               <p>O thou moſt meeke, moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne, moſt ſweete, and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lord! when wilt thou giue me a ſight of thee? for yet I neuer ſawe thât incorruption of thy bleſſed body; I neuer kiſſed thoſe places of thy wounds. &amp; that pearcinge of the nayles; I neuer bathed thoſe ouuertures of thy true,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44014:106"/>
thy admirable, thy ineſtimable, and incomparable Flesh and Blood, with the tears of ioy. When wilt thou comfort me, and when wilt thou giue me cauſe to conteyne this ſorrow of mine? For indeed this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row will not end in me, as long as I shall be in pilgrimage, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my Lord.</p>
               <p>Vvoe be to me, O Lord, woe be to my ſoule; for thou who art the comforter therof, dideſt goe thy wayes out of this world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as biddeing me fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. When thou dideſt putt thy ſelfe vpon thoſe new wayes of thyne, thou gaueſt thy bleſſing to thy ſeruants; but I was not there Thou wert carried vp to heauen in a cloude, but I ſaw it not. The Angells promiſed, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt returne; but I heard them not. Vvhat shall I ſay, what shall I doe, whither shall I goe, where shall I ſeeke him, &amp; when shall I finde him? Vvhome shall I aske? Vvho will declare to my beloued that I languish for loue? The ioy of my hart is gone. My mirth is changed into ſorrow. My very flesh and my

and I am euen now vpon peris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing; I am thy creature, and am euen very now, vpon dying. I am the worke of thy hands, and I am, euen now, reduced to nothing.

But yet, who am I, that am ſpeakinge to thee? Woe be to me, O Lord, haue mercy on me, O Lord: on me, who am a rotten carkas, the food of wormes, a ſtinkeing pott, and that

               <p>But yet ſtill what am I? a darke abyſſe, a wretched peece of earth, a childe of wrath, a veſſell euen made fitt for reproach; begotten with impurity, liueing in myſery, and dying in agony.

One is killed by the ſword, another is corrupted by poyſon; and another ends his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life, by the ſurpriſe of ſome ſtrange and ſodayne feare, And now beſides, and beyond all theſe things, a huge miſery it is, that as nothing is more certayn then death, ſoe of nothing is a man more vncertayn, then of the tyme when he shal dy. When he thinkes he ſtandeth faſteſt, he is tripped vp, and his hope peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth.

               <p>I will therfor confeſſe my miſery to thee; I will confeſſe to thee, O thou my Father, and my Lord, that maker of Heauen and Earth, that ſoe I may be admitted, to approche thy mercy. For I am made wholly miſerable, and am reduced to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and I knew it not. For thou art truth and I was not with thee. My iniquityes haue wounded me, and I was not troubled thereat. For thou art life, and I was not with thee.</p>
               <p>They brought me to nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was not with thee, who art the Word, whereby all things were made, and without it nothing, and therefore did I become nothing without thee. For that is nothing which leades to nothing. All things are made by him; whatſoeuer are made; and what kinde of things where they? God ſawe all thoſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44014:120"/>
things which he made, and they were very good. All things which are made, were made by the Word, and whatſoeuer things were made by that Word, are very good. Why are they good, in regard that all things are made by the Vvord, &amp; without it nothing is made? Becauſe nothing is good withaut a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of that ſouueraigne Good But ſinne is there, where that Good is not: and for that cauſe, it is euen nothing. For euill is nothing, but a priuation of good; as blindenes is noe other thing but a priuation of light. Sinne therefore is nothing becauſe it is made without the Vvord, without which nothing is made; and that is ſinne or euill which is depriued of that good, whereby all things are made, which haue any beeing. But now thoſe things which are not, are not made by him; and conſequently they are nothing. Therefore thoſe things are euill, which are not made, becauſe all things which are made, are made by the Vvord, and all things which are made by the Vvord are good. Since
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:44014:120"/>
therefore all things are made by the Vvord, ſinne is not made by it; and therefore it remaynes that all things, which are not made, be not good, for as much as all things which are made, be good, and therefore thoſe things are euill, which are not made: and therefore they are nothing, becauſe nothing is made, without the Vvord. Sinne therefore is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe it is not made. But then how is it euill, if it be nothing? Becauſe euill is a priuation of that good, whereby that which is made is good.</p>
               <p>To be therefore whithout the Vvord, is to be euill, which yet is not properly to be; becauſe nothing is without it. But what is it to be ſeparated from the word? If thou deſire to knowe this, learne firſt what this Vvord is. The Vvord of God ſayth, I am the Vvay, the Truth, and the Life. To be ſeparated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the Vvord, is to be out of the Vvay, and without Truth, and life; and therefore without it, is nothing, and ſo it is euill, in being ſeparated from the Vvord, whereby
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:44014:121"/>
all things were made very good. To be ſeparated then from the Vvord, whereby all things were made, is noe other thing, then to faile, and to paſſe from being a fact, to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; becauſe nothing truely is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. As often therefore as thou departeſt from good, thou doeſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate thy ſelfe from the Vvord, becauſe the Vvord is good; and ſoe thou groweſt to be nothing, becauſe thou art without the Vvord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which nothing is made.</p>
               <p>Now therefore O Lord, thou O light, haſt illuminated me, that I might ſee thee: I ſawe thee, and I knowe my ſelfe; for ſoe often haue I growen to he nothing, as I haue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated my ſelfe from thee; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I forgett that good which thou art, therefore did I growe to be wicked. Woe be to me, wretched man, how came it to paſſe, that I knewe not that by forſakeing thee, I grewe to be nothing? but why doe I aske, how I could be ignorant thereof, if I were nothing? we knowe what it is to be nothing, that it is not, which is nothing; and that the thing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:44014:121"/>
which is not good, is not, becauſe it is nothing. If therefore I were not, when I was without thee, I was as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and as an idoll, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Vvhich hath eares indeede, but it heareth not; noſtrells, but it ſmelleth not; eyes, but it ſeeth not; a mouth, but it ſpeaketh not; hands, but it feeleth not; feete, but it walketh not; and it hath all the lineaments or parts of a body, but yet without that ſenſe, which, belongeth to them.</p>

Yea and thy truth ſaith this. For they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the Angells and they are the ſonnes of God. And what are they but ſonnes of God, if they be equall to Angells. They shall indeede be ſonnes of God, becauſe the ſonne of man, is made the ſonne of God. When therefore I conſider this, I am bould to ſay, that man is not ſomewhat leſſe then the Angells:
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44014:125"/>
nay, he is not onely equall to the Angells, but ſuperiour to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man is God, and God is a man, &amp; not an Angell. And therefore I will ſay, that man is the moſt worthy crsature, becauſe the Word which was in the beginning God, with God; the Word, whereby God ſayd, let light be made, and light was made (that is the Angelicall nature) the Word, Whereby God created all things, in the beginning: the ſame Word was made flesh, and dwelt amongſt vs, and we haue ſeene his glory.</p>
               <p>Behoulde the glory, wherein I glory, when I glory as I ought. Behoulde the ioy, wherewith I ioy, when I ioy as I ought. O Lord my God, my life, and the entire glory of my ſoule; I confeſſe to thee O Lord, my God, that when thou dideſt create me capable of reaſon, thou dideſt, in ſome reſpect, make me equall to the Angells, becauſe I may be perfected by thy word, ſoe farre, as that I may arriue to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality with the Angells: and that I may haue the adoption of thy

               <p>Let me giue praiſe to thy Name, O Lord, who by creating me, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thine image, and likenes, haſte ordayned me to be capable of ſoe great glory, as that I may be made thy ſonne. Trees are not capable of this; ſtones are not capable; nor in fine, any of thoſe things, which are moued, or growe in the ayre, or in the Sea, or on the earth, becauſe he did not giue them power, by the Word, to become his ſonnes; becauſe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:44014:126"/>
they are not capable of reaſon. For this power doth conſiſt in reaſon, whereby we knowe God. But he gaue this power to men, whome he created capable of reaſon, according to his owne image, and likenes. And I alſo, O Lord, am, by thy grace, a man, and by grace, I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thy Sonne, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be.</p>
               <p>From whence came this fauour to me, O Lord, thou ſoueraigne truth, and thou true ſouueraignity, &amp; thou who art the beginning of all thy creatures? whence came this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me, that I had a capacitie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſonne of God, which they had not? Thou art he, who remaineſt for euer, who dideſt create all things at once. At once thou dideſt create men, and beaſts, and ſtones, and the plants of the earth. Noe merits, of any of them, did preceede, noe former priuiledge was due to them. For thou didſt create them all, out of thine owne meere goodnes; and all the creatures were equall in merits, becauſe none of them had any merits at all.</p>

Thy prayſe O Lord, is thy very ſelfe. Lett all thy workes prayſe thee, according to the multitude of thy greatenes: Thy prayſe, O Lord, is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible.

               <p>Helpe me; O Lord my life, and let me not perish in my wickednes. If thou haddeſt not created mee, O Lord, I had not beene; and becauſe thou dideſt create me, Behold I am. But if now thou doe not gouerne me, behold I am noe more. For neither my merits, nor any priuiledge of

For (as I was ſaying, ô Lord) I thought once that I was ſome-what of my ſelf; I conceiued, that I was ſufficient by my ſelf; nor did I diſcerne, that thou wert he that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned

               <p>Thou, O Light, diddeſt open myne eyes, and diddeſt rowſe mee vp, and illuminate mee; and I ſawe, that the life of man vpon earth, is all temptation; and that noe flesh muſt preſume to glory before thee, for ſoe noe man liueing can be iuſtifyed. For if there be any good in him, whether it be great, or little, thy guift it is, and nothing is ours, but that which is naught. Of what ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall any flesh be able to vant? Shall he glory in ſinne. This is not glory but miſery. May he glory in that which is good?

For hee who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth glory to himſelfe, and not to thee, out of the good he doth, that man is noe better, then a theefe, and

For he who will be prayſed for any guift of thyne, and ſeeketh not thy glory, but his owne therein, although he be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by men, for that guift of thyne, yet he is diſprayſed by thee; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that he ſought not ſoe much thy glory by it, as his owne. And now he who is prayſed by men, whileſt thou diſprayſeſt him, shall not be defended by men, when thou iudgeſt him, nor deliuered by them, when thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt him.</p>
               <p>But thou, O Lord, who diddeſt frame me in my mothers wombe, do not ſuffer me to fall vnder ſo greate a reproofe, as that I should be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with procureing to robb thee, of thy glory. To thee be glory, of whome all good things are; and to vs, confuſion of face, and miſery, vnles thou vouchſafe to haue mercy on vs. But thou haſt mercy, O Lord, thou haſt mercy vpon vs all, who hateſt none of thoſe things which thou haſt made; and who beſtoweſt of thy good guifts, vpon vs; &amp; doſt enrich vs, O Lord our God, with

without thy bleſſing; and of it ſelfe, it yeilds no other fruite, then confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſinne and death. If euer I had any good thinge, I receiued it of thee; Whatſoeuer good I haue now is thine, and of thee I haue it. If euer I ſtood faſt, I ſtood by thee; but whenſoeuer I fell, of my ſelfe I fell; and for euer had I weltered in that myre, if thou haddeſt not rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mee. And for euer had I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued blinde, vnles thou haddeſt illuminated mee. When I fell, I had neuer riſen, vnles thou haddeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth thine hand. And when afterward thou diddeſt raiſe mee, I had inſtantly retournend to fall, vnles thou haddeſt ſuſteyned mee: and I had perished very often, vnles thou haddeſt gouerned mee. So perpetually, O Lord, ſoe perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually was I preuented by thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and grace; deliuering me from all my ſinnes, ſaueing me from all ſuch as are paſt; ſolliciteing me againſt ſuch as were preſent, and fortifying me, againſt ſuch as might be future; Cutting of, before my face, thoſe ſnares of ſinnes, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44014:142"/>
the occaſions, and cauſes thereof. For, vnles thou haddeſt alſo done this fauour to me, I might haue committed any ſinne in the whole world. And I know, O Lord, that there is noe kinde of ſinne, which any one man did euer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt, which another man may not alſo committ, if the helpe of the Creatour, whereby man is made, be wanting. But thou art the cauſe why I committed them not: Thou diddeſt commaund that I should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne from them, &amp; thou dideſt infuſe thy grace, that I might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue in thee. For thou, O Lord diddeſt gouerne mee for thy ſelfe; and thou diddeſt keepe me both for thy ſelfe, and for my ſelfe: and thou diddeſt giue me light &amp; grace to the end that I might not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and euery other ſinne.</p>

For he is that great, and redd dragon, that ancient ſerpent,

and he is called the Deuill, and Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haueing ſeauen heads, and tenn hornes. Whoſe imployment is, to inueigle this greate huge Sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in innumerable creatures are ſtill creeping, creatures; greate, and ſmall; that is to ſay, ſeuerall kindes of deuills, who ſtudy nothing els, day and night, but how they may walke theyre round, ſeeking whome they may deuoure, vnles thou deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them. For this is that ancient Dragon, who ſprung vp firſt, in that paradiſe of pleaſure, and who with his tayle, drawes the third parte of the ſtarrs of heauen after him, and brings them downe to the earth; he who is poyſon, corruptes the waters of the world, that ſoe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who drinke thereof, may dye, and who tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples vpon gold, like ſo much durte; and into whoſe mouth, the riuer of Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan flowes; and he is growen to that preſumption, that he feares non at all. And who shall be able to defend vs from the crushing of his teeth? who shall be able to deliuer vs out of his iawes, but thou, O Lord, who haſt broken all the heades of that huge Dragon.</p>

For to this, doth he direct his continuall ſtudy: vpon this is his cheife deſire imployed, that he may deuoure the ſoules which thou haſt created. And therefore, O my God, wee cry out to thee; deliuer vs from this daily aduerſary of ours, who whether wee ſleepe, or wake, or eate, or drinke, or whatſoeuer els wee doe, is preſſing vpon vs, by all meanes, and by many fraudes, and tricks, he is addreſſing poyſoned arrowes againſt vs, both priuately and publikely, that ſoe he may deſtroy our ſoules. And yet O Lord, ſoe ſtrangely miſerable are wee made, as that although we ſee this Dragon continually comeing towards vs, with his mouth wide open, ready to deuoure vs; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles, wee ſleepe, and wee are eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wanton againe in our ſlouth as if wee were ſecure before him, who yet couets nothing but our deſtruction.</p>

               <p>ANd thou, O Lord, who art my Light, illuminate myne eyes, that I may ſee and walke in thy light, and not ſtumble vpon the ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the enemy. For who shall be able to auoyd ſuch a multitude of ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, vnles he ſee them; and who shall be able to ſee them, vnles he be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by thy light? For that father of darkenes, hides all thoſe ſnares, in his owne darkenes; that all they may be taken by them, who are in his darkenes; and who are the ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of darkenes; not diſcerning thy light, wherein, whoſoeuer walketh needes not feare. For he who walkes by day, ſtumbles not; but he ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles who walkes by night: for the light is not in him.</p>
               <p>Thou O Lord art Light, thou art the light of the ſonnes of light; thou art the Sunne, which knoweth not what belonges to ſetting; that day wherein thy children walke without
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44014:145"/>
ſtumbling; and without which, all they who walke are in darkenes, as being deſtitute of thee, who art the light of the world. Behould wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer daily, that by how much the more, any man is eſtranged from thee, who art the true light, ſo much the more intricately is he wrapped vp in the darkenes of ſinne. And how much the more he is in darkenes, ſo much the leſſe can he diſcerne the ſnares, which are ſpred for him, in his wayes. And ſoe by not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neing them, he falleth often into them, and is taken by them; &amp; which deſerues to ſtrike vs full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſuch a man, doth not ſoe much as knowe, that he is fallen: Now he, who knowes not that he hath taken a fall; will care ſoe much the leſſe to riſe, as he ſtill conceiueth, that he ſtands.</p>
               <p>But thou, O Lord, my God, thou true light of the mynde, illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate now myne eyes that I may ſee thee, and knowe thee, and not tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble headlong downe, in the ſight of myne enemyes. For this mayne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary of ours, doth labour euen

to exterminate vs outright; whileſt wee, the whyle, begg of thee, that thou wilt make him melt before our face, as wax doth, vpon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of fyre. For hee, O Lord, is that cruell theefe, firſt, and laſt, who tooke counſell, how he might robb thee of thy glory, but ſoe, being puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed and ſwollen vp, he burſt, and fell vpon his face, and thou diddeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate him downe from that Holy Hill of thyne; and from the middeſt of thoſe bright ſtones, in the middeſt, whereof he had once beene walkeing. And now, O Lord my God, and my life, he neuer giueth ouer to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thy children, euer ſince he fell.</p>
               <p>And out of his hatred to thee, O Mighty King, he procureth to deſtroy thy creature, which thy Omnipotent goodnes hath created, according to thyne owne Image; to the end that he may poſſeſſe thy glory, which himſelfe loſt, by pride. But crush thou him to peeces, O ſtrong Champion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deuoure thy lambes; and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate vs, that wee may diſcerne the ſnares, which he hath prepared
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44014:146"/>
for vs; and make vs able to eſcape, and arryue to thee, O thou ioy of Iſraell.</p>
               <p>Thou beſt knoweſt all theſe things thou knoweſt his contentious ſpirit, and his moſt ſtiffe neeke. Nor doe I ſpeake of theſe things, as pretending to diſcouer them to thee, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all things, and from whom noe little thought can lye hidd. But make my iuſt complaint againſt this enemy of mine, before the feete of thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty; that ſo thou mayeſt both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him, and ſaue vs, thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Whoſe ſtrength thou art.</p>
               <p>This enemy of ours, O Lord, is full of craft, and shifts, nor can thoſe intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate wayes of his, be eaſily traced out, no nor ſo much as the ayre of his coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be diſcerned by vs, vnles we be illuminated by thee. For ſometimes he is here, &amp; ſometimes he is there. Now he shewes himſelfe like a lambe, and then like a wolfe; now like darkenes, and then like light; and according to the ſeuerall qualityes of perſons, according to the variety of tymes, and places; and according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary chaunge of things, he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44014:146"/>
ſeuerall temptations. For to the end that he may deceiue ſad peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he pretends himſelfe to be ſad for company. To the end that he may delude, ſuch as are in ioy, he faynes himſelfe alſo to reioyce. That he may beguile ſuch as are ſpirituall, he transformeth himſelfe, into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light. That he may inſinuate himſelfe, and by that meanes crush ſuch as are ſtrong, he takes the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a lambe, that he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure ſuch as are meeke, he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes the face of a Wolfe. All theſe things he takes vpon him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſimilitude and proportion of the temptations, which he meanes to vſe. As ſome, he frights with a nocturnall feare, others, by the arrow which flyes by day, others, by the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines which walkes by night; others, by expreſſe aſſault, and others by that deuill of high noone.</p>
               <p>Now, who is he that can thinke himſelfe a match for this enemy ſo farr, as that he may ſo much as know him; and who did euer reach to the bottome of his craft? Who shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale the makeing of his garment to

Behould he hideth his arrowes in his quiuer, and he couers his ſnares, vnder a shew of light; &amp; ſoe he is leſſe ſubiect to be vnderſtood, vnleſſe O Lord, O thou hope of ours, we beg light from thee, whereby we may diſcerne all things. For not onely doth he ſtriue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs in the ſenſuall workes of flesh and blood; nor onely in the exerciſe of vice, which is eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; but euen amongſt our moſt ſpirituall actions, he hideth certain ſubtile ſnares; &amp; vnder the colour of vertue, he puts on vice, &amp; transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes himſelfe into an Angell of light. theſe, and many other things, O Lord our God, doth this very ſonne of Beliall, this Satan, endeauour to bring againſt vs. And now as a Lyon, then as a Dragon, both manifeſtly and ſecretly, interiourly, and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly, both by day and night, he is laying traynes for vs, that ſoe he may deſtroy our ſoules.

For I well know that ingratitude doth much offend thee, which is the roote of all ſpirituall miſcheife; and a kinde of dry and parching wynde, which blaſteth all goodnes; and it shutteth vp the fountayns of diuine mercy towards man; and by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, both our ill deedes which were dead gett life againe; &amp; our good deedes which liue, doe quickly growe to dy, and haue noe more life afterward.</p>

               <p>How often had that Dragon euen ſwallowed mee vp, and thou O Lord diddeſt drawe mee out of his mouth? How often haue I ſinned, when he was ready to haue deuoured mee, but thou O Lord my God diddeſt defend mee? When I did wickedly againſt thee, when I tranſgreſſed thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, he ſtood ready to ſnatch mee away into hell, but thou forbadeſt him. I offended thee, and the while, thou defendedeſt mee. I did not feare him, and yet thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt preſerue mee. I departed from thee, &amp; made offer of my ſelfe to myne enemy; but thou diddeſt fright him ſo, as that he should not dare to carry me away.</p>
               <p>Theſe benefits diddeſt thou beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towe vpon me, O Lord my God; and I wretched creature knew it not. Full often haſt thou freed mee, from the uery iawes of the Deuill, and ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched me out of the mouth of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44014:148"/>
Lyon; and full often haſt thou brought me back againe from hell, though I was ignorant thereof. For I deſcended euen towards the very ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of hell, and thou heldeſt me back from goeing in. I drewe neare the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of death, and thou wert the cauſe why they opened not themſelues to receiue mee. Thou alſo, O my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, haſt often deliuered me from corporall death, when I was ſubiect to great ſickenes. And when I found my ſelf in many daungers, by ſea, by land, by fyre, by ſword, and many other wayes; thou wert euer deliuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mee, euer preſent to mee, and euer ſaueing mee with great mercy.

But thy mercy and thy grace, O Lord my God, preuented mee, and gaue mee deliuerance from that death of my body, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from the death of my ſoule.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other benefits diddeſt thou imparte to mee, but I was blinde, and knew them not, till

But now, O thou light of my ſoule, O Lord my God, my life, by which I liue, and the light of mynes eyes, by which I ſee; Behould, thou haſt illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mee, and now I knowe thee, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe my ſelfe to liue by the guift of thy hand; and I giue thankes to thee Which though they be meane, and poore, &amp; full of diſproportion to thy benefits, yet they are the beſt, which my frailty can affoord. For thou alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, art my God, my benigne Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, who doeſt loue our ſoules, and hateſt none of thoſe things, which thou haſt made.</p>

               <p>Now therefore I ſee theſe things, O Lord my God, and I knowe them, by thy light; and my ſoule doth euen faynt, and is ſicke with loue, vpon the conſideration of thy great mercy towards mee; ſince thou haſt ſnatched my ſoule, out of that lower Hell, and haſt brought mee back againe, to life. For I was all plunged in death, and thou haſt wholy reuiued mee. Be therefore all my life and beeing thyne; and I doe wholly offer my whole ſelfe vp to thee. Let my whole ſpirit, my whole harte, my whole body, and my whole life, liue to thee, O thou my ſweete life; for thou haſt deliuered me wholly, that thou mighteſt poſſeſſe me wholy, thou haſt intirely repaired me, that ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thou mayeſt haue mee intirely.

My whole life which perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my miſery, was raiſed vp by thy mercy, thou who art that mercifull God, and full of pitty, which thou doeſt extend, in thy goodnes, to thouſands of ſuch as loue thy Name.

And thou doeſt oblige mee to thee, in euery moment of my life; ſince in euery moment therof, thou imparteſt great benefits to mee.</p>
               <p>As therefore, there is noe houer or point of time in my whole life, wherein I am not aſſiſted by thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; ſoe alſo ought there not to be

But euen this I cannot doe, ſaue by thy guift onely to whome euery good guift belongeth, and euery excellent grace is deſcending from thee the Father of Lights, with whome there is noe tranſmutation, nor shadow of chaunge. For it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of thee, taking mercy that wee loue thee. Thine, O Lord is this guift to whome euery good thing belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth.

And to the end that man might be wholly thine hee is entitled to a dominion ouer all thy workes. For thou haſt created all exteriour things, for the body; the body for the ſoule; and the ſoule for thy ſelfe; to the end that man might tend onely to thee, &amp; might loue onely thee, poſſeſſing thee, by way of comforte to himſelfe; and thy creatures, by way of receiuing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice from them.

Then shall they be in fruition, of thoſe moſt excellent delights in the houſe of our Lord; in compariſon whereof all thoſe things which here we ſee, may well goe for nothing.

For the other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary occaſions of man, thou haſt giuen beaſts to carry him. And thou haſt imparted the birds of the ayre, the fish of the ſea, and the fruites of the earth for his refection. Thou haſt alſo created out of the earth ſeuerall medicines, which may be applyed to the ſeuerall infirmities of men; and thou haſt prepared particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, which are to encounter and reuerſe thoſe particular-inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which may occurre.

               <p>Theſe are thoſe happy Citizens, of Ieruſalem, that ſupernall Citty, that mother of ours, which is aboue, and they are ſent in miniſtery, to them, who are to take hold of the inheritance of ſaluation; that they may deliuer them from theyr ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, and guard them in all theyr

wayes; that they may comfort and admonish thy children, and offer vp theyr prayers in the ſight of the glory of thy Maieſtie. For they loue theyr fellow-Cittizens, by whoſe ſociety they expect that the ruine of the Schiſme which was made by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Angells may be repayred.</p>
               <p>They doe therefore aſſiſt vs, with greate care, and watchfull endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour at all tymes, and in all places ſuccouring vs, and making proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt our neceſſityes; and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing with great ſollicitude, betwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vs and thee, O Lord; preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſighes, and ſobs to thee, that they may obtayne for vs, an eaſy pardon, from thy mercy; and may bring downe from thee, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired benediction of thy grace. For they walke with vs, in all our wayes; they goe in, and out with vs; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with greate attention, how vertuouſly, and piouſly wee conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in the middeſt of a wicked nation; with great endeauour, and deſire, we ſeeke the Kingdome of God, and the iuſtice thereof; with how greate feare and trembling wee ſerue thee;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:44014:163"/>
and how alſo wee exult towards thee; in the ioy of our harts.</p>
               <p>They helpe ſuch as are takeing paynes; they protect ſuch as are at reſt; they encourage ſuch as fight; they crowne ſuch as conquer; they reioyce with ſuch as ioy, (I meane ſuch as ioy in thee) and they ſuffer with ſuch as ſuffer, I meane ſuch as are in ſufferance for thee.</p>
               <p>They haue a mighty care of vs. Great is the ardour of theyr affection towards vs; and all this for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they beare to that ineſtimable charity, where-with thou loueſt vs, For they loue them, whom thou lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; they keepe them whom thou keepeſt, and they forſake them whom thou forſakeſt. Nor doe they loue the workers of wickednes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou hateſt all the workers of iniquity; and deſtroys all them who ſpeake lyes. As often as wee doe well, the Angels ioy, and the Deuills grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue. But as often as wee ſwarue from vertue, wee make the Deuill glad, and wee depriue the Angels of theyr ioy. For they haue ioy by one ſinner, doeing pennance; but the Deuill
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:44014:163"/>
hath ioy, when pennance is giuen ouer, by a good man.</p>
               <p>Graunt them therefore, O Father, graunt that they may euer reioyce concerning vs; and that thou mayeſt euer be prayſed by them, in vs; and that both they, and wee, may be brought into one, &amp; the ſame sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foulde; that together wee may confeſſe to thy Holy Name, O thou Creatour, both of men, and Angels.</p>
               <p>Whileſt I am calling theſe things to minde before thee, I confeſſe to thee with prayſe, that theſe are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te benefits, whereby thou haſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured vs, whileſt thou giueſt thy Spirits for Angels, to aſſiſt vs. Thou haddeſt already beſtowed, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was contayned vnder the vaut of heauen, yea and thou reputeſt that as but little, which is contayned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heauen, vnles thou mayeſt alſo, add thoſe things, which are aboue the heauens.</p>
               <p>Lett all thy Angels prayſe thee alſo, for this, O Lord; Let all thy workes alſo, confeſſe to thee; and let all thy Saints themſelues bleſſe

thee for it. O thou our Supreame honour, thou haſt too highly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs; and thou haſt beautifyed, and enriched vs with many guifts.</p>
               <p>Thy Name, O Lord, is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reable ouer the whole Earth. For what is Man, that thou shouldeſt magnify him, or ſoe apply thy harte towards the loue of him.

Is not euery Man liueing, a kinde of vniuerſality of vanity? And yet doſt thou thinke it worthy for thee, to caſt thyne eyes vpon him, and to bring him with thee into Iudgement?</p>

When it poſſeſſeth thee, the deſire therof is fully ſatisfied: and there reſteth then, noe more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly which it can deſire. But when it is found to deſire any thing exteriourly, it is cleere, that it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth

not thee interiourly; vpon the haueing of whome, there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing more to be deſired.

But if it deſire not that totall Good, it remaineth that it muſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſome-what which is not that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Good, and which therefore cannot be that ſoueraigne Good; and conſequently not God, but a Creature.</p>
               <p>Now, as long as it deſires a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is ſubiect to continuall hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

open places of the citty, of this world, in ſearch of thee; but I found thee not, becauſe I did foolishly loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke that abroade, which was within. I ſent all my exteriour ſenſes, as my Ambaſſadours abroad, that ſoe I might ſeeke thee; but I found thee not, becauſe I ſought thee ill. For I ſee, O my light, and my God, who haſt illuminated mee, that I ſought thee ill, by theyr meanes, becauſe thou art within, and yet they ſcarce can tell how thou diddeſt enter. For the eyes will ſay, if he were not of ſome colour, he came not in, by vs. The eares ſay thus, if he made noe noiſe, he did not paſſe by vs. The noſe ſaith, if he had no ſmell, I know nothing of him.

For I raunged ouer all things in ſeekeing thee; and for the loue of them, I loſt my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>I asked the earth, if it were my God, and it told mee, noe; and all things which are vpon the earth

made the ſame confeſſion. I asked the Sea, and thoſe Abyſſes, and the creeping creatures which are therein &amp; they anſwered, Wee are not thy God, thou muſt looke him aboue vs. I asked the ſtable ayre, and the whole ayre, with all the inhabitants thereof, ſayd, Anaxinenes is decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I am not thy God.

               <p>Thou art my God, and the Lord of all thoſe good things, which thou haſt created, and with thee doe ſtand the cauſes of all things which are ſtable; yea and the beginning of all things, which in themſelues be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, are yet, and doe remayne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable with thee; And the reaſons of all things, not onely which are eternall, and rationall, but euen of ſuch as are temporary and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, doe yet liue eternally with thee: tell O my God, this humble ſeruant of thyne; tell, ô mercifull God, this miſerable creature of thine whence groweth ſuch a creature as man, but from thee?

               <p>Therefore thou, ô Lord, diddeſt make all things, and now do I aske, who made mee? Thou ô Lord did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt make mee, without whome nothing was made.

Art not thou God incomprehenſible, and immenſe, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who onely poſſeſſeſt immortality, and doſt inhabite an inacceſſible light, whome, noe man hath euer ſeene or can ſee. Art not thou that hidden God of inſcrutable Maieſty, the onely perfect knower, and admirable contemplator of thy ſelfe? who did euer perfectly knowe that, which he neuer ſawe, and thou haſt ſayd in thy truth, Noe man shall ſee mee and liue.

thou thy ſelfe? For thou alone, art God Omnipotent, ſuperlaudable, and ſuperglorious, and ſuperexal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſupreme; and thou art na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſupereſſentiall, in theſe moſt holy, and moſt diuine Scriptures.

               <p>How therefore haue I knowen thee, O Lord my God, who art moſt high, ouer all the earth, and aboue all the heauens; whome nether Cherubin, nor Seraphin, doe exactly knowe, but theyre faces are vayled with the wings of theyr contemplation, before him, who ſitteth vpon that high Imperiall Throne; cryeing out, and ſayeing, Holy; Holy, Holy Lord God of hoaſts, The Earth is full of thy glory As for thy Prophet, he was all in trembling, and he ſayd, Woe be vnto mee, for I haue held my peace; becauſe I am a man of polluted lipps.

But yet howſoeuer, it is not without thee, but in thee; becauſe thou art the light which haſt illuminated mee. For as thou art to thy ſelfe, thou art onely knowen to thy ſelfe; but as thou art to mee by thy mercy and grace, thou art knowen to mee.</p>
               <p>But what art thou vnto mee? Tel me O mercifull Lord, who am thy miſerable ſeruant; tell me by thy mercy, what thou art to mee. Say to my ſoule, I am thy ſaluation. Doe not hide thy face from mee; leſt if thou doe, I dye. Suffer me to ſpeake;

For to ſee the face of the liueing God, is to poſſeſſe the ſoueraigne good.

I might iuſtly haue deſpayred, by reaſon of my exceſſiue ſinnes, &amp; vices &amp; of thoſe infinite negligences and faults which I haue commited, and which I dayly do commit, by thought word and deed, and by all thoſe meanes, wherby the frailty of mans nature may ſinne, vnleſſe the Vvord my God, had become flesh; and had dwelt amongſt vs. But now I dare not deſpaire; becauſe he growing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to thee, euen to the death, and that the very death of the Croſſe, did take that hand-writing of our ſins, and nayling it to the ſame Croſſe did crucify both ſinne and death. In him therefore, doe I ſecurely conceaue hope, who ſitteth at thy right hand and interceedes for vs. And confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in him, I truſt I shall arriue to

               <p>O My ſoule, returne toward that heauenly Citty wherin we are written, and enrold as Cittizens. And as Cittizens amongſt the Saints, &amp; the houshold ſeruants of God, and as the heires of God and coheires of Chriſt our Lord. Let vs conſider that excellent felicity of this citty of ours, to the very vttermoſt of what we are able. Let vs therefore ſay with the Prophet: O how glorious thinges are ſayd of thee, thou Citty of God, the habitation which is made
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:44014:209"/>
in thee, is, of them who are all full of ioy. For thou art founded in the exultation of the whole earth. No old age is in thee, nor any miſery which is wont to wayte vpon old age. In thee, there is no man lame, of arme or legg, nor crooked nor other wiſe deformed; when once they meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becoming perfect man, in the meaſure of the age, of the fulneſſe of Chriſt. What is more happy then ſuch a life where there is no fear of pouerty, nor no incommodity of ſicknes; where no man is offended, no man is angry, no man enuious, no deſire doth ſolicite vs; there is no appetite of meate, no man is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by thirſting after honour and power; there is no feare of the Diuell, or the craft of thoſe infernall ſpirits; all terrour of hell is farre off, there is no death either of body or ſoule, but a life which is made full of ioy by the guift of immortality. In fine, there is no kind of ill, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, but all thinges are full of agreement &amp; proportion, for as much as the concord of all the Saints is intierely one; all things are full of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:44014:209"/>
peace and ioy; all things are quiet, and ſerene. An euerlaſting ſplendor there, is not like that of this Sunne of ours, but another, which is ſo much more bright, at it is more bleſſed. For that Citty (as we read) shall need neither Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, nor Moone; but our Lord omnipotent, will illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate it, and the Lambe is the bright lampe therof. Where the Saints shall shine like ſtarres, and they who inſtruct many others, like the ſplendour of the firmament. No night shalbe therefore there, no darknes, no concourſe of clowds, no incommodity at all of heat or cold; but ſuch a temper of things there wil be, as neither the eye hath ſeene, nor the eare hath heard, nor can it enter into the hart of any other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but ſuch as shalbe thought worthy to enioy it; Whoſe names are written in the booke of life. But it exceedeth all theſe thinges to be aſſociated to the Quires of Angells and Archangells; to behold the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes and the Prophets, to ſee the Apoſtles, and all the Saints; yea to ſee our owne parents &amp; friends.
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:44014:210"/>
Theſe things indeed are glorious, but yet ſtill incomparably a more glorious thing it is to behold the preſent face of God; &amp; to looke vpon that vnlimitted light of his.

               <p>THE ſoule which is beautifyed by the Image, and dignifyed by the reſſemblance of God, hath grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d inough within it ſelfe (which is alſo imparted by the ſame God) wherby she may be aduiſed to remain perpetually within him; or at leaſt to return towardes him, if she chance to haue beene ſeparated by her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or rather by her defectes. And not only hath she ground of ſolace in the hope which she may conceaue
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:44014:210"/>
of pardon and mercy; but yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, she may alſo preſume to aſpire, euen to the marriage of the Word, and to contract a league of friendship with God; and togeather with that king of the Angells, to be drawing in the ſame ſweet yoake of loue. Now all this is performed by the ſame loue, if the ſoule do make it ſelfe like to God by her will, as already she is like him by nature; and if she loue him, as she is beloued by him. For only loue, amongſt all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, paſſions &amp; feeling ſenſes of the ſoule, is the thing whereby a creature may anſwere the benefits of a Creatour; and repay, after a ſort, what it oweth, though it be not in any equall manner.</p>
               <p>Where loue entreth in, it draweth &amp; captiueth all other affections of the mind, to the dominion therof. Loue alone, is ſufficient, &amp; is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it ſelfe, and for it ſelfe. Loue is the merit, it is the reward, it is the cauſe, it is the fruit, it is alſo the vſe of the fruit; for by loue, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to God. Loue maketh that two ſpirits grow to be one. Loue

Loue maketh vs firſt to order and compoſe our liues; afterward it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth vs to conſider of all thinges which are preſent, as if they where abſent; and, in the third place, it enableth vs to behold internall, and ſupernall thinges, with a cleane and pure eye of the hart.

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:44014:211"/>

He that loues, doth of himſelfe draw confidently neere to God, and expreſſeth himſelfe in a familiar manner, without perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or feare: He looſeth his labour and liues in vane, who loues not. But he that loueth, doth ſtill carry his eyes erected towardes God, whome he loueth, whom he deſireth, vpon whom he meditateth, in whome he delighteth, by whome he is fedd, and euen made fat. Such a louing and deuout perſon, doth ſo ſing, and ſo he reades, and in all his actions he is ſo ful of circumſpection, and care, as if God were euer preſent before his eyes, and ſo indeed he is. He doth ſo pray, as if he were taken, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before the face of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, in his ſoueraigne Thron, Where thouſands of thouſands are ſeruing him, and a million of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are preſent with him. When loue viſiteth a ſoule, it awaketh her,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:44014:212"/>
if she be aſleep; it counſelleth, &amp; ſoftneth, and doth wound the hart. It illuminateth thoſe thinges which are darke; it vnlocketh thoſe thinges which are shut vp; it inflameth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe things which are cold; it mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a harsh, vntoward, &amp; impatient minde; it puts ſinne to flight; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth all carnall affection, it amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth manners, it reformeth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth the ſpirit, and it bridleth the light acts, and euill motions of ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery youth. All theſe thinges are done by loue, when it is preſent, but vpon the departure thereof, the ſoule begins already to be faint, &amp; weake, as if the fire were withdrawne from vnderneath a pot which had beene ſeething.</p>

               <p>A Great thing is loue, wherby the ſoule, of her ſelfe, doth confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently approach to God, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly inheare to God, doth fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:44014:212"/>
aske queſtions of God, and conſulteth with him, vpon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The ſoule which loueth God can neither thinke, or ſpeake any other thing, she contemneth all thinges elſe, she loatheth all. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer she conſidereth, whatſoeuer she ſaith, it ſmells of loue, it ſauours of loue; ſo truly doth the loue of God, make her all, his owne. Whoſo euer deſires to haue the knowledge of God, let him loue. In vaine doth any man giue himſelfe to reading, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, to preaching, to praying, if he do not loue. The loue of God, begetteth loue in a ſoule, &amp; makes her bend her ſelfe towards him. God loueth, to the end that he may be loued againe. When he loueth, he deſireth no other thing, but to be beloued; as knowing that they who loue him, are to be made happy by that loue. The ſoule which loues, doth renounce al her owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affections, and doth wholy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply her ſelf to loue; that ſo she may be able to pay loue, with loue. And yet when she shall haue ſpent what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer she either hath, or is, vpon
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:44014:213"/>
the loue of that torrent which flowes out, from that ouer tunning fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of loue; we muſt take heed of thinking, that there is any equality of ſpringing plenty afforded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene that loue, and this loue: bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene God, and the ſoule; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene the creatour, and the creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. And yet, on the other ſide, if the ſoule do loue, as much as it can; there can be nothing ſaid to be wanting, where al is giuen. Let not that ſoule feare, which loues; but let that other tremble, which loueth not. The ſoule which loues, is caried on by praiers, she is drawn by her deſirs, she diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth her merits, she shuts her eyes againſt his Maieſty, she opens them to delight in his beauty: she lodgeth her ſelf in him, who is her ſauing health, and she treateth with him after a confident manner. By loue the ſoule doth ſtep aſide, and doth grow into exceſſe, beyond the ſenſes of the body; ſo that she which feeleth God, doth no longer feele her ſelfe. This is done, when the ſoule (being allured by the vnſpeakeable ſweetnes of God) doth ſteale her
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:44014:213"/>
ſelfe, as it were, from her ſelfe; or rather when she is forcibly carried, and ſo doth ſlip from her ſelfe, that she may inioy God with ſupreme delight. Nothing were ſo highly ſweet, if withal it were not extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shorte. Loue giueth familiarity with God; familiarity giues a daring to aoproach; that daring giueth guſt; that guſt giueth hunger. The ſoule which is touched with the loue of God, can think of nothing els, can deſire nothing els; but doth often ſigh and ſay, As the Hart deſireth the fountains of water, ſo doth my ſoule deſire thee, O my God.</p>

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:44014:216"/>
ſpirit, adorned with vertues, ranc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with Angells, be ſure thou loue him, by whome thou art ſo much beloued. Make him thy buſines, who hath made thee his. Seeke him who ſeeketh thee, loue thy louer, by whome thou art beloued; by whoſe loue thou art preuented, and who is the cauſe of thyne. He is thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thy reward, thy fruit, thy vſe, &amp; thy end. Be thou carefull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, who is ſo carefull of thee; be attentiue to him, who is attentiue to thee, be pure with him who is pure; be holy with him, who is holy. Such as thou doſt appeare in the ſight of God, ſuch art thou to expect that he will appeare to thee. God who is ſo ſweete, ſo meeke, and ſo full of mercy, doth require that thou shouldſt be ſweet, and meeke, and gentle, &amp; humble, and full of mercy. Loue him who hath drawne thee out of the lake of miſery, and the filth of durt. Chooſe him for thy friend, aboue all thy friends; who when all they shall fayle thee, will be euer ſure to make good thy truſt, at the day of thy death. When
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:44014:217"/>
all thy friends are departing from thee, he will not leaue thee, but he will defend thee, againſt thoſe roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lyons, who are sharpe ſet vpon theyr prey. And he will leade thee by a Country, wherewith thou art not yet acquainted, and he will bring thee to thoſe ſtreets of the celeſtiall Sion; &amp; there he will place thee, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Angels, before the face of his owne Maieſty, where thou shalt heere that Angellicall Muſicke of., Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth. There is the Canticle of ioy, the voyce of exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and thankſgiuing; the voyce of prayſe, and that euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Alleluya. There is that high heape of happynes, that ſuperemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t glory, that ſuperaboundant gladnes, &amp; all good thinges put togeather. O ſigh thou ardently, O my ſoule; &amp; deſire vehemently that thou mayſt arriue at that heauenly citty, whereof ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thinges are ſayd, &amp; where of all the inhabitants, are ſo full of ioy. By loue thou mayſt aſcend. Nothing is impoſſible, nothing is hard to one who loues. The ſoule which loues aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:44014:217"/>
often; and doth familiarity runne too &amp; fro, through thoſe ſtreets of the Celeſtiall Hieruſalem. Sometimes viſiting the Patriarkes &amp; the Prophets; ſometymes admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe armyes of Martyrs, and Confeſſors; &amp; contemplating ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes the Quires of Virgins. The heauen and the earth, withall which is therein, doe neuer ceaſe to let me know, that I ought to loue my Lord my God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXV. That nothing can ſuffice the ſoule, but the ſupreme Good.</head>
               <p>THe hart of man which is not fixed in the deſire of eternity, can neuer be ſtable and firme, but is more wauering then the wind; and it paſſeth from one thing to another, ſeeking reſte where it cannot be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For in theſe fraile &amp; tranſitory thinges, where the affection the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof is impriſoned, it can neuer finde true repoſe. Becauſe our ſoule is of ſo great dignity, that no Good, but
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:44014:218"/>
only the ſupreme Good can ſatisfy it; and withall it is of ſo great liberty, that it cannot be conſtrained to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſinne. It is therefore the proper will of euery one, which is the cauſe of his ſaluation or damnation; ſo that nothing more rich, can be giuen to God, then a good will. A good will draweth God downe to vs, &amp; it addreſſeth vs vp to him. By a good will we loue God, we chuſe him we runne to him, we arriue to him, and we poſſeſſe him. O how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a thing is this good will, wherby we are reformed, according to the reſemblance of God, and are made like to him. So amiable to God is this good will, as that it refuſeth to inhabit that hart wherin a good will is not to be found. A good will doth make that ſupreme Maieſty of the Trinity ſtoop downe to it For, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth illuminate it towards the knowledge of truth; Charity doth inflame it towards the loue of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the Paternity doth preſerue, that which it did create, that it may not perish.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. VVhat the knowledge of truth is.</head>
               <p>WHat is that knowledg of truth? It conſiſteth firſt in a mans knowing himſelfe, &amp; in being that which a man ought to be, and in reforming that which should be amended. It doth therefore conſiſt in knowing and louing the Creatour, for this is the whole good of man. See then how vnſpeakable the loue of this diuine loue is. It made vs of nothing; and it gaue vs whatſoeuer we haue. But becauſe we loued the guift, more then the giuer, we fell into the ſnare of the diuell, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his ſlaues. Then did God, being moued to mercy, ſend his Sonne to redeeme thoſe ſlaues, and he alſo ſent the holy Ghoſt, to the end, that he might make thoſe ſlaues his ſonnes. He gaue the Sonne as a price of our redemption, and the holy Ghoſt, for the priuiledge of his loue; and ſo he imparteth his whole ſelfe, as the inheritance of
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:44014:219"/>
our adoption. So doth God, as being moſt pittifull, &amp; moſt mercifull, through the deſire which he hath of the loue of man, not only impart his mercyes, but his very ſelfe, that ſo he might recouer men; not ſo much to him, who is God, as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. That men might be borne of God, God was firſt born of man.</p>
               <p>Who then is he that hath a hart ſo hard, as that it cannot be ſoftned by this loue of God? this loue I ſay of his ſo preuenting, &amp; ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which made him be content to become man for the loue of man? Who now wilbe able to hate a man, whoſe nature and reſemblance he ſeeth in the humanity of God? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faillibly whoſoeuer hateth him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth God, and ſo he deſtroyeth whatſoeuer he doth. For God was made man for man; that as already he was mans Creatour, ſo alſo he might be his redeemer, and that he might purchaſe him, out of his owne ſtocke. And to the end that God might be beloued by man, in a more familiar manner, he appeared in the ſimilitude of man; that ſo both
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:44014:219"/>
his externall and internall ſenſes, might be made happy in God; the eye of his ſoule being intertained, &amp; fed by his diuinity, &amp; the eye of his body by Gods humanity; to the end, that whether he should worke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly or outwardly, this human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which he created, might be able to feed deeply, &amp; ſweetly vpon him.</p>

               <p>THis Sauiour of ours, was borne for vs, he was crucified and he died for vs, that ſo by his death he might deſtroy ours. And becauſe that bunch of grapes of his flesh and bloud, was carried to this wine-preſſe of the Croſſe, &amp; becauſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion thereof being made, the new winer of his Diuinity began to flow from thence, the holy Ghoſt was ſent downe, wherby the veſſels of our harts were to be prepared, and new wine to be put into new skins; that firſt our harts might be cleanſed,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:44014:220"/>
leaſt els the wine powred in, should be polluted; and that afterward, they should be tyed vp, leaſt otherwiſe when it were infuſed, it might be ſpilt. That they might (I ſay) be cleanſed from all ioy, which could be taken in ſinne; and that they might be faſtened againſt all ioy which could be taken in vanity. For that which is good, can neuer come, vnles firſt that be ſent away, which is euill. The ioy which is taken in ſinne, polluteth; and the ioy which is taken in vanity, ſcattereth vs. The ioy which is taken in ſinne, maketh the veſſell fowle, and the ioy which is taken in vanity, maketh it to be full of holes. Ioy is taken in ſinne, when ſinne is loued, and ioy is taken in vanity, when tranſitorie things are beloued. Caſt the refore away, that which is euill, that thou mayſt receaue that which is good. Powre out all bitternes, that thou mayſt be filled with ſweetnes. The holy Ghoſt is ioy &amp; loue. Caſt out the ſpirit of the diuell, &amp; the ſpirit of the world, that thou maiſt receaue he ſpirit of God. The ſpirit of the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:44014:220"/>
Diuell, breedeth a ioy in ſinne; and the ſpirit of the world, breedeth a ioy in vanity. Now both theſe ioyes are naught; for the one of them hath vice in it, the other giueth occaſion to vice. The ſpirit of God will come when theſe wicked ſpirits are caſt out; and it will enter into the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of thy hart, and will produce a good ioy, and a good loue, whereby the loue of the world, &amp; the loue of ſinne, shall be put to flight. The loue of the world, doth intice and deceaue; the loue of ſinne, doth pollute, and carry on to death. But the loue of God doth illuminate the mind, it doth purify the conſcience, it makes the ſoule reioyce, &amp; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates God.</p>

               <p>HE, in whome the loue of God remaines, is euer thinking how he may arriue to God; how he may leaue the world; how he may decline

When he is ſitting, when he is walking, when he is reſting, &amp; in fine whatſoeuer he be doing, his hart departeth not from God. He exhorteth all men to the loue of God, he recommendeth it to all men, &amp; he proueth to all the world, both by his hart, and by his tongue, and by his workes, how ſweet the loue of God is, and how bitter that is of the world. He deſpiſeth the glory of the world, he diſcouereth it to be full of affliction; and he declareth how fond they are, who place their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence therin. He wondreth at the blindnes of men, for louing ſuch thinges as thoſe; he wondreth, how it is poſſible for all men not to forſake theſe tranſitory, and fraile things of the world. He conceaueth that euery one should find taſt in that which is ſo ſauoury to himſelfe, that euery one should loue that which he likes ſo well; that euery one should deſire that which is ſo plainely diſcerned

               <p>THen indeed is the hart in true repoſe, when it is all fixed by deſire in the loue of God; &amp; when it couets nothing els, but in him, in whom it delighteth with ſweetnes, and whom it enioyeth with delight.

He is not lyable to a little fault, who in prayer, whilſt he is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with God, doth eaſely wander out of his ſight, as if God did nether heare, nor ſee him. Yet this is done, when he followeth his owne impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and euill thoughts, and when he preferreth any poore and baſe creature (towards whome the ſight of minde is eaſely withdrawne) before God.

If friendship they shall loue God more then themſelues, &amp; God will loue them better them they can loue themſelues; becauſe

they loue him, &amp; themſelues &amp; one another, in him; &amp; he loueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp; them, by himſelfe. If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with one another be eſteemed; they haue all but one will, becauſe they haue no other will, but the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme will of God. If power, they shall haue the ſame dominion ouer their owne will which God hath ouer his. For as God can do what he will by himſelfe, ſo shall they be able to do what they will by him. And as they cannot will any thing but what he wills; ſo wil he will, whatſoeuer they will; &amp; ſo what they will cannot chuſe but be. If wealth &amp; honour, God doth place his good and faythfull ſeruants ouer many goods; yea they shall be called the ſonnes of God, and Gods; and they shalbe his heires, &amp; the coheirs of Chriſt. If true ſecurity, they shall be as certainly aſſured, that no good thing shall be euer wanting to them, as they shall be ſure that neither they wil forgoe it willingly, nor that he who loueth them, will take it away againſt their will, whome he ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth; nor yet that there is any thing

mightier then God, which is able to ſeparate him and them from one another. Now what kind of ioy, and how great muſt that needs be, where ſuch a good as this, is to be inioyed.</p>

               <p>O Thou hart of man, thou poore hart, thou hart which knoweſt what belonges to cares and miſeries, by experience; or rather which art euen ouer-welmed by them, how much wouldſt thou reioyce, if thou didſt abound with all thoſe bleſſings. Aske thy moſt inward powers if they would be able to containe the ioy, which would grow to thee, by ſuch felicity as that. But now if any other, whom thou didſt abſoluty loue, as thou didſt loue thy ſelfe, should poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the ſelfe ſame beatitude, with thee; thy ioy would be doubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wouldſt reioyce no leſſe for him, then for thy ſelfe. And if two or three, or many more were
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:44014:228"/>
poſſeſſors of it, thou wouldſt reioyce for euery one of them, as for thy ſelfe; ſuppoſing that thou louedſt euery one of them as thy ſelfe. What kinde of thing, will therfore, that perfect Charity be, of innumerable Angels, &amp; bleſſed men, ſince no one loueth another leſſe then himſelfe; &amp; no otherwiſe will euery one reioyce, for any other then for himſelfe. If therfore the hart of man will ſcarce be able to containe it ſelf for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ioy, which himſelfe will takes in ſo great a good; how will he be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this ſo great ioy, of ſo many others?</p>
               <p>Againe, looke how much more a man loues another, and ſo much more doth he reioyce at his good. And now, as in that ſupreme felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, euery one will, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, loue God better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and all the reſt; ſo alſo will he, without compariſon, reioyce more in the felicity of God then in that of himſelfe, &amp; of all the reſt of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Saints. And if they shal loue God withal their hart, all their mind, and al their ſoule, in ſuch ſort as that
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:44014:229"/>
yet all their hart, &amp; all their minde, &amp; all their ſoule cannot ſufficiently comprehend the dignity of that loue; without faile they will alſo reioyce with all their hart, withal their mind, &amp; withall their ſoule, ſo that all their hart, mind, &amp; ſoule, shall not be able to containe the fulnes of that ioy.</p>

               <p>O My God, and my Lord, my hope, &amp; the ioy of my hart; tell my ſoule, if this be that ioy, wherof thou haſt ſaid by thy ſonne, Aske, &amp; you shall receiue, that ſo your ioy may be full. For I haue found a certaine ioy, which is full, and more then full; the hart, the mind, the ſoule, and the whole man being full thereof: But yet in heauen there will be another ioy beyond meaſure, greater then this is. There, they who are to enioy it, shall not enter into all that ioy; but they, being all full of ioy, shall enter into
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:44014:229"/>
that ioy of their Lord. Tell me O Lord, tell thy ſeruant, &amp; tel it to my hart within, if this be that ioy, into which thoſe ſeruants of thine shal enter; who are to enter into the ioy of their Lord? But euen that ioy wher with thy elect shall reioyce, hath neither bene ſeen with the eye, nor heard by the eare, nor hath it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the hart of man. So that yet, I haue not bene able to ſay, O Lord, how great that ioy is, which thy Elect shall enioy. It is certaine, that they shall ioy as much as they loue, &amp; they shall loue as much, as they shall knowe thee O Lord. But how great shall that loue be? It is certaine that neither the eye hath ſeene, nor the eare hath hard, nor hath it entred into the hart of man, in this life, how much they shal knowe &amp; loue thee, in that other life, O my God, I beſeech thee that I may knowe thee; that I may loue thee, that I may ioy in thee. And if, in this life, I may not do it to the full, yet at leaſt make me profit in it more, &amp; more, that at laſt I may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue to that fullnes. Let the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:44014:230"/>
which heere I haue of thee, proceed further that ſo it may there, be full. Let my loue of thee increaſe heere, that ſo it may be full there; &amp; that heere, my ioy, may be great in hope, &amp; there, full, in deede. O Thou true God, I beg, that I may receiue what thou haſt promiſed, that ſo my ioy may be fulfilled. In the meane tyme, let my minde medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon it; let my tongue ſpeake of it; let my hart loue it; let my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe worke vpon it; let my ſoule be hungry and euen my very flesh thirſt after it; and let my whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance deſire it; till ſuch tyme as I shall enter into the ioy of my Lord, where I may remaine for euer. Amen.</p>
