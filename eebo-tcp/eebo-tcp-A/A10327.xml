            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to the matter now in

that it is the drift
of my discourse to shew

concerning <hi>Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mum

me) in his thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
my drift and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that I, but a young
man, should so transgresse
against the fashion of the
<hi>Vniversitie,</hi> as to cry
downe <hi>Aristotles</hi> credit.
But when he shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that I am enjoyned,
as I am a publike Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to deliver sound and
true opinions, not errors
in the expounding of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
I hope hee will not
censure mee too hardly.
Will hee demand what
reasons induced me to be
of a contrary opinion to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16010:10"/>
most of <hi>Aristotles</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
now a days? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if I have any judgment
at all, the vulgar and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall
Expositors of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
do always, as much
as they can, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more then they
ought, adhere unto him in
their expositions. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as the <hi>Romans</hi> did
highly extoll all <hi>Neroes</hi>
actions, yea his Villanies,
as sacred; in like manner
they, as it were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
al <hi>Aristotles</hi> sayings,
though never so false, doe
greatly applaud him. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therfore very inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
after the truth, when

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16010:11"/>
I had rather concuire in

great Clerks, then to hold
an errour with <hi>Aristotle.</hi> I
heartily wish, that this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
were well setled in
your minds, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that so, I might

and you lesse irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse
in heating those
things, which should be
as well pleasing, as they
are wont to be distastfull
unto you. But because this
conceit is so deeply roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in you, namely, that
<hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion, which
hath been approved and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16010:12"/>
defended with the great
labour and pains of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned Interpreters
cannot be shaken; I wish
you not sodainly to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
this conceit of yours,
although you see it so
strongly opposed by so
many, and so great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities;
onely I crave, that
you wold not obstinately
prejudicate those things
which I shal speak against
it. I suppose, that such, as
are not obstinately bent
in defending <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
will grant, that so great
authorities have some
weight, but yet they will
deny, that <hi>Aristotles</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16010:12"/>
can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed with
any Arguments drawne
from his own Principles.
I will not complain, that I
am hardly dealt withall
by them, who will have
the question decided by
those Principles, which
being falsly framed have
caused this false opinion,
which I so dislike, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when <hi>Aristotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
useth first of all to
shake the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of those
Philosophers he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
in the fundamentall
points, before he confutes
them; as we may observe
in <hi>Plato's Idea.</hi> But yet I
will accept of this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16010:13"/>
to prove <hi>Aristotle</hi> to
be in a manifest errour by
his own Principles. But
because there are some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, which for the
present doe more concern
us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I intreat your patience,
that the handling of this
point may be deferred till
another time; for as the
husbandman, when hee
intends to til his ground,
that is overrunne with
briats and thornes, doth
first rid the ground of
them, that hee may the
more conveniently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in his tillage, &amp; sow
his seed; even so, before
your mindes can be setled
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16010:13"/>
in the true opinion of
<hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> some
distinctions, which, (like
thornes and briars) have
encumbred them, must be
removed; that so the see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
of truth may take deeper
root, and spring up more
fruitfully.</p>
            <p>For there is risen up in
this last age of the world,
a sort of men unknowne
to the Ancients, &amp; hated
of the Learned, who, not
out of any desire to si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t
out the truth, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
their own perverse

to defend grosse
absurdities with their no
lesse absurd, and foolish
distinctions; in very deed
they doe expose them to
the judgement of all wise
men to bee laughed at.
There was one <hi>Callico</hi> (as
<hi>Eustathius</hi> reports) none
of the wisest, when hee
went to sleepe, used to lay
a brasse pot under his
head for a pillow; an hard

for his doltish pate; at the

well pleased with his
hard pillow, hee filled the
pot with straw, to make it
softer; the pot certainly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16010:14"/>
was not softer, but it was
enough for <hi>Callico,</hi> all the
while the fool perswaded
himselfe that it was softer.

that out of an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

they would be all

who, when he came <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consul</hi>

them earnestly to
leave off all wranglings,
and to spend no more

which if they would

likewise to hold with

not <hi>Distinguishers</hi> like un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to

well enough, that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
do dissent in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?
and what then?
they, like pittifull men,
go about to reduce them
to an unity on equall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
But, because an

why doest thou

that <hi>Epicurus</hi> placed <hi>Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that <hi>Zeno</hi> assigned it to

in the comprehension &amp;
composition of all good

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16010:18"/>
Why else didst
thou refute the first opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the second Book,
and the second opinion
in thy fourth Book? Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou not understand
Distinctions, how, and in
what manner all these o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
may bee true in
<hi>their kinde?</hi> For wheras
<hi>Epicurus</hi> resolves Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes
to be <hi>Summum
Bonum,</hi> hee means carnall
Felicity; <hi>Zeno</hi> Vertue; he
meanes Felicity simply;
And whereas <hi>Aristotle</hi>
ascribes <hi>Summum Bonum</hi>
to united, and compacted
good things, hee meanes
added, or associated Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16010:18"/>
Why didst thou <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>

Philosophers would
much wonder, that a
foolish fellow understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
not, that these distinctions
are frivolous by the very
definition of <hi>Summum
Bonum;</hi> which is termed
of all Philosophers the
upshot of all things, as
that, whereon all other
good things depend, but
Blessednesse it selfe is
no where subsisting one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in GOD. <hi>Cicero</hi>
would exclaime against
the words and manners
of these doltish monsters,
and tell them, that they
had disgraced all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
with their basenesse.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16010:22"/>
Thus would <hi>Cicero</hi> speak.

For certaine it is

But if you teach false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
which I ought

not to believe; it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd

me to believe them. If you
would have men believe
what you teach, you must
teach those things, which
you ought to teach; if you
will not discharge your
duty in teaching, I will
not discharge mine in the
hearing; for oftentimes
the Teachers authority is
very prejudiciall to the
Scholers profit. Thus said
<hi>Cicero,</hi> I like not that <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean
ipse dixit</hi> in

that are bound must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey;
what must, if thy
commands be unjust? A
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16010:29"/>
Scholar must bee credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
if you teach false
doctrine? Hee that hath
twice suffered shipwrack
is but a fool to trust <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi>
Wherefore if they
will be ruled by mee; let
them leave these poore
shifts, and sticke fast to
their surest refuge, as men
use to doe in dangerous
cases; namely, that they,
which speak against <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
doe not understand
<hi>Aristotles</hi> meaning. They
think, perhaps, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
was a jugler, which
casts a mist <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

O poore shift! So
<hi>Cicero</hi> reports of <hi>Torqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
who, when <hi>Epicurus</hi>

said, that when the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens

they make an admirable
harmony, but men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
heare it. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

and <hi>Alexander Aphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saeus</hi>
himselfe do interpret
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> as I do? What
if I shew those notable
Champions and Lights
of the Christian Church
both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>
Doctors, doe not onely so
expound, but also confute
<hi>Aristotle?</hi> What refuge
have they then? I know
not what answer they wil
make to <hi>Cicero, Laertius,</hi>
and <hi>Alexander;</hi> unlesse
perhaps they will say
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16010:31"/>
that credit is not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to examples; at least
wise, that the places cited,
are but probable, not true.
And mee thinkes I smell
what they will say of
Christian Writers. They
wil not (except I be much
mistaken) deny, that those
things, which so worthy
men have wrote against
<hi>Aristotle</hi> are true, and yet
they will deny that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
cried. How then can
it be possible, that in this
very point they write tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
that <hi>Aristotle</hi> erred, &amp;
yet (say they) <hi>Aristotle</hi>
erred not? You shall
heare: there is a twofold
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16010:32"/>
               <hi>Truth;</hi> a <hi>Philosophicall
Truth,</hi> and a <hi>Theologicall
Truth. Aristotle</hi> was in an
error according to a <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall
Truth,</hi> and in that
sense he is blame worthy;
but <hi>Aristotle</hi> erred not in
a <hi>Philosophicall Truth,</hi> for
in that sense hee could not
bee mistaken without
doubt, for hee is a miracle
of Nature. What is this I
heare? A <hi>Philosophicall
Truth?</hi> and a <hi>Theologicall
Truth?</hi> This is pulling in
pieces, not distinguishing.
Now indeed, I nothing
marvell at those men, who
use to scoffe and deride
the <hi>simple Truth,</hi> when
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16010:32"/>

that they have quite

same, which it is said to
be. Therefore as Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
teach, that Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16010:33"/>
cannot stand together
at one, and the same time
in the same subject; so the
same Philosophers teach,
that contradictories can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
both be true of one
and the same thing. Is it
not then a shame for our
<hi>Logicians</hi> to disable, and
enervate the very first
Principles of <hi>Logicke?</hi>
For wheras <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth
teach, that to affirme and
deny the same thing not

also in the particular must
needs be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictorious;
these men do in very deed

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16010:34"/>
ô thou Apostle, <hi>Paul</hi> I
am sorry for thee! why
doest thou dispute with
the <hi>Stoicks</hi> &amp; <hi>Epicureans</hi>
at <hi>Athens,</hi> of the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the dead, and the
life to come? It needs no
controversie at all. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all Philosophers
doe flatly deny the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the body, yet
it is in a philosophicall
truth; but thou <hi>Paul</hi> dost
affirme it in a <hi>Theologicall
truth,</hi> as thou hadst lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of <hi>Christ.</hi> But why
dost thou dissent from all
Philosophers to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
Why doest thou
not permit the <hi>Athenians</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:16010:34"/>
to believe Philosophers?
Doest thou thinke they
will the more hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Christians for that?
It is not reasonable to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Eusebius</hi> the benefit
of this distinction; For he
was in an error. He knew
not this twofold truth.
Hee sayes <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth
impugne, and gainsay the
Scriptures, in that hee did
ascribe felicity to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
welfare of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in that hee said that
Gods Providence exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not to every subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing; in that hee said
the World was eternall,
not created, and that the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16010:35"/>
soule of man was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
but mortall. <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
affirmes, that in all
these points <hi>Aristotles</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
are flat against
the Scriptures. Thou art
mistaken <hi>Eusebius! Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
doth not thwart the
Scriptures. Thou must
learne to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
a <hi>Philosophicall
Truth,</hi> and a <hi>Theologicall
Truth.</hi> Come hither <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
come <hi>Augustine,</hi>
come all the rest of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi>
and learne of our
<hi>Philosophers,</hi> that there is
one Truth in Divinity, &amp;
another Truth in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
They do Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16010:35"/>
much wrong. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
reports, how that
one bid a Painters boy
who had painted a Cock
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l-favouredly to chase a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all right Cocks from
his picture. Those men
that doe alienate divine
Truth, doe the very same
thing. Yet if these men
had bin Painters, I doubt
not, but they would have
distinguished, that they
had painted well accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the truth of the
Picture, though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the truth of
the Cocks nature. But as
<hi>Tiridates</hi> King of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
called that wicked
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16010:36"/>
Wretch <hi>Nero</hi> his God;
So <hi>Aristotles</hi> Patrons, do
ascribe the name of Truth
to the vaine Opinion of
Philosophy. Which if it
be once granted, what can
be so absurd, but it may
be defended, or what so
false, but it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
either with an <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,
Platonicall, Stoicall,</hi>
or <hi>Turkish</hi> Truth; or with
a Papisticall, or Hereticall
Truth; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, which
way not? And in this
manner, as <hi>Democritus</hi>
not satisfied with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of one World, drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of infinite Worlds;
so we not contented with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16010:36"/>
one truth, shall conceive
innumerable truths of
our owne braine. But this
will be the issue of all at
last in despight of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
that as <hi>Varro</hi>
reckons up 30000 Gods
amongst the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
when indeed there was
but one onely; even so,
when they have forged
30000 Truths, they shall
finde but one only, and
that is the simple Truth,
which they so deride.
Here before I proceed a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
further, lest these
things perhaps exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which I have allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
(and I very gladly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16010:37"/>
desire they may be) are
not to be found in <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
which I have cited
out of <hi>Eusebius;</hi> yee shall
understand, that they are
not to be found in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Eusebius. Trapezun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
who was <hi>Aristotles</hi>
great friend, translated
<hi>Eusebius</hi> his Books <hi>de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angelica
praeparatione</hi>
into the Latine tongue.
Fourteene of his Books,
which contain a consuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Heathens and
Philosophers, <hi>Trapezun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
translated into Latin,
but as for his fifteenth
Booke, which <hi>Eusebius</hi>
wrote almost altogether
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16010:37"/>
against <hi>Aristotles</hi> errours,
as concerning mans Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
the Worlds Fterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Providence of
God, and the Souls Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
<hi>Trapezuntius</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver
medled with that.
Therefore lest any man,
being deceived with the
Table of the Booke, doe
traduce me, ye shall know
that Latine <hi>Eusebius de
Evangelica praeparatione</hi>
wants the fifteenth Book,
in which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained the
things by me alleaged If
any will look for it, hee
may finde it in the <hi>Greeke</hi>
Copy. Study therfore the
<hi>Greek</hi> tongue, that ye may
be able to discern the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16010:38"/>
of Interpreters,
which is too frequent in
prophane writings, but
chiefly in the Scriptures.
What <hi>Eusebius</hi> thought
fit to write for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the <hi>Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith,
Trapezuntius</hi> thought
not fit to be expounded,
because it weakned <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi>
credit. How much
worse then hee, are our
men in these dayes, who,
fearing lest they should
savour too much of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
desire to heare
young Striplings speake
finely, and to defend by
arguments, points repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to godlines; but are
loth to hear those things,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16010:38"/>
which are consonant to
godlinesse. And yet they
love Piety, they love Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
So, I think, as the
Ape loves her puppies, or
as <hi>Iuno</hi> loved <hi>Hercules;</hi>
They love exceedingly;
they kill with loving;
They love, as <hi>Thais</hi> loved
<hi>Phaedria.</hi>

of Philosophers? But
what does this concerne
us say they? Wee may
speak as Philosophers, we
are not Divines yet. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines?
It is a womans
priviledge to say what she
list; for without doubt
they will never bee Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
unlesse perhaps
they be Popes, as (some
say) <hi>Ioane</hi> was of yore;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16010:39"/>
and albeit they may bee
such, they may not bee
Divines for all that. But
why do they separate the
bounds of Divinity and
Philosophy, like the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
I thinke this was
the Deputies doing. But
yet we may speak as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.
What? as <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>goras,</hi>
when hee denied
there was a God? as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoras,</hi>
when hee doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
whether there was a
God or no? as <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
when hee takes away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Providence from God?
These are the words of
Atheists. What then? as

               <hi>Plato,</hi> when hee sets up a
Purgatory? or <hi>Porphyrius,</hi>
who sayes that <hi>Angels</hi> are
to be worshipped? or as
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> when he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Free-will?</hi> Let <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
picke out such stuffe
for themselves. What
then? shall we say with
<hi>Epicurus</hi> that the soule is
mortall? with <hi>Aristippus,</hi>
that <hi>Pleasure</hi> is <hi>Summum
Bonum?</hi> or with <hi>Plato</hi>
that a mutuall Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Wives is to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated?
No, wee allow
none of these? But wee
would have <hi>Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
not <hi>Sermons.</hi> What
is a <hi>Declamation?</hi> Is it to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16010:40"/>
deny that to be a <hi>Poeme,</hi>
which wants fabulous
matter? or shall not that
be called a <hi>Declamation,</hi>
which is not stuffed with
impiety? If such are no
better, than base Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
which esteeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wittily spoken, but
that which is obscene;
what kinde of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
are they which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
nothing spoken O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator-like,
but that which
is prophane? But wee
would heare Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
points. If they be true
and good they dissent not
from holy things. If they
bee naught and untrue,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16010:41"/>
what are they to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?
The <hi>Persia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> thought
it a great fault in a childe,
either to lie, or speak cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly;
Do yee make our
Christian Youth worse
then the Heathen? would

have you speak like wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

and <hi>Plato</hi> the <hi>Princes of

superstitious. Doe ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

became a wretched

the <hi>Platonicall</hi> dreames of

errours, first entred into

And is the world

They little thinke,

Well said <hi>Socrates;</hi> such
as the minde is, such is
thy speech. Speech is the
badge of the minde. Is
thy speech corrupt? thy
thoughts are impure. A
prophane tongue, and a
true Christian will never
agree. What pains Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
bestow in the
Church, Philosophers
destroy in the Hall. Beate
downe the affections as
much as you can, and lop
off the sprouts, yet they
will spring again, quench
the firebrands, yet they
will kindle againe. Yee
should inure your selves
from tender age to the

rageth. Take heed

What have wee to doe
(say they) with this
over-busie godlinesse and
Holinesse? Wee leave
that to Divines, let
them preach CHRIST
devoutly, What have
wee Philosophers to doe
with Divinitie? It is
not our profession. Let
us speake like <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
like Philosophers. For
whereas the Apostle
commands the CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOSSIANS

lest they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
through Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,

that (say they)
belongs not to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but onely to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.
It is written in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
unto the CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOSSIANS,
and
Geographers say, that
COLOSSUS was a
Citie, but COLOSSAE
(without doubt) was a
Divinitie Schoole; or
at least-wise because it
is written unto Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
it is an advice, not a
precept; of which sort
there are some things in
the Gospell, which are
not prescribed to all, but
to compleate Christians;
as the Expositors of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi>
Moralls do teach.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16010:49"/>
shall we leave off the old
want of defending <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
whom the most
learned of the Vniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have so long time
highly esteemed? nay, we
will rather with the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinians</hi>
maintain all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotles</hi>

not according to a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

so farre forth as wee
are Philosophers, not as
we are Christians. Thus
do these men in their cups
bragge, and brave it out,

what thinke you will
become of the Christian,
if the Philosopher bee
thrust down to Hell? Let
no body wrest my words
otherwise, than I mean; I
know not how it may fall
out, that I may hereafter
lay the fault upon your
tongues, seeing that those
things, which I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
true, through your
misreporting them, may
be accounted false. I have
at the last bid farewell to
obscene Poets, such as
(for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> most part) are not
to be taught to children.
I have fetched this out of
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16010:51"/>
Confessions who aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<hi>Terence</hi> expresly not
worthy to be read, and
blame such Grammarians
as expound him. If this
seemes absurd to them,
why doe they finde fault

But let no man so

though I should say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
children must be fed

I would not have
the thing it selfe, but the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16010:54"/>
abuse thereof abolished,
and the proper use therof
restored again. I doe not
say, that hee offendeth
that reades profane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
so that he doe but

but this I take to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

when profane things
are believed; for then art
thou foyled, when thou
givest credit to them.
And in that case. I hold
it dangerous to defend
them; for therby perhaps
thou hurtest others, or
else art hurt thy self. Thou
must also take heed not
onely what thou defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
but also what, and in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16010:55"/>
what manner thou rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest;
For although thou
doest but touch those
things, that thou readest,
yet be not so carelesse; for
many things, but touched
doe hurt, and sometimes
kil. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> makes
mention of a little Fly
called a <hi>Cynips,</hi> which is
of so small a substance,
that, unlesse you be very
sharp-sighted, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discern her, yet when
shee fastens on you, shee
will sting soundly, so that
shee, that you could not
perceive co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to sting,
you shall too late repent
her stinging. But if your
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16010:55"/>
judgements bee not so
sharp-sighted, to discern
those, which I call the
stings of philosophy, yet
know, that Philosophy is

               <hi>Cynips,</hi> which uses to
sting heedlesse men; feele
it not after it is too late.
The veriest foole that is
learnes wit after a shrewd
turn. The byting of an

one cannot be sensible of
death approaching, but it

certain witnesses, so fresh

this manner of

and by how much

The Sun ofttimes

But if any <hi>Novice</hi>

at these things, which

let him refute mine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He shall not need to
goe to the <hi>Augustinian</hi>
Monkes, let him writewithin
his owne walls;
Words are but winde,
writings will stick by it,
let the learned judge. I
will most willingly give
him a copy of mine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And so I doe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
againe, and againe
intreat the <hi>Aristotelians,</hi>
if they have any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

beare any true affection
either to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
or the Truth,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16010:67"/>
that they will confute
mine opinions. If they
cannot doe it (for I doubt
not of their good will to
do it) let them leave their
wonted obstinacie, and
yield to the truth. Let
them not object, they are
not suffered to speak their
minds openly, they have
place enough to write
their mindes, and that
they may do more freely,
and upon better delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I acknowledge
mine own weaknesse, no
man more, but strong is
the Truth. I doe not so
much distrust my selfe, as
I trust to my Cause. A
very child may mayntain
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16010:68"/>
a good cause; but <hi>Cicero</hi>
himsefe is not a sufficient
Patron for a bad cause
But I would wish them
to provide new distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for these, which I
have handled, have been

not twice, but a

the stomack of <hi>Polyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
himself is not able to
disgest, so that it is no
mervaile our Schollers
are sicke so often, when
they are crammed with
such distinctions. If any
more sober minded hath
either not understood, or
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16010:68"/>
not approoved what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to mine abilitie I
rather pointed at, than
explained, by reason of
the shortnesse of the time,
I intreat him to come to
mee; hee shall finde mee
most ready to teach what
I know, or to learn what
I know not: We do not
all know all things, I may
erre, I am willing to be
instructed. This onely I
crave, that no man doe
rashly carpe at what is
done; I neither contemne
nor condemne the studie
of Philosophy. But I see
a deeper wound concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
There are some in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16010:69"/>
whose hearts impious
profanenes is so fast roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that they make piety
not onely to seeme harsh
and unsavoury to others,
but to be rejected and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
by themselves. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
wrote long agoe (<hi>that the

the name of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>)
so it may be as truly
said in our times, that the
enemies of the Faith lie
couched under the name
of Philosophy. I know
indeed there are many
that erre through lack of
knowledge, but I mean
the obstinate, and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16010:69"/>
Patrons of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy;
of whom would
to God that were untruly

speak againe with griefe,
<hi>The enemies of the faith
lie couched under the

be thought of some to be
their enemy, now I have
rub'd their soares: So
mad <hi>Orestes</hi> in <hi>Euripides</hi>
called his sister <hi>Electra</hi> a

But her brothers outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

censures disquiet mee,
when they are whole,
they will give me thanks.
The Physician must bear
with the frowardnesse of
his patient; For I am not
ignorant how many and
how bitter grudgings I
shall meet with all, which
did I know to bee spent
upon these trifles of
mine, I should be very
stupid, if I should not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
them as matters of
great importance, both
for your benefit, true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
sake, and Gods glory,
which (the Lord is my
witnesse) I onely aime at.
These may seeme light
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16010:70"/>
matters, but the trees vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
consists in the root.
The Scriptures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
writings are like <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
twins, laughing
together, weeping toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

But yet let all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

to Pretie doe their
worst, wee may defend
Philosophy even to
death, we may study pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Arts, but so, as they
bee referred to pious
things. This was the
minde of that good old
man Master <hi>Richard Fox,</hi>
whose Image is every day
before our eys; This one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was his chiefest care.
And howsoever hee fell
into the error of the times,
yet all his care was, that
Religion, Piety, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Exercises should flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
and increase daily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us. Who, seeing
hee hath left behind the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16010:71"/>
expression of this his
good desire rather in the
Statutes of the house, than
in our behaviour (which
is to be lamented) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee seemes to speake
to us all continually, as a
father to his children in
this manner.</p>
            <p>Wheras I did heartily
desire you young men, my
sonnes by adoption, and
brethren in Christ, to be
brought up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, which is
true blessednesse; lest the
thorny cares of the world
should choake the spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seeds of godlinesse in
you, I built an house for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16010:72"/>
you, that so you being
freed from carking cares,
might wholy apply your
studies. I provided nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
for your bodies,
and soules. I admonished
you to be mindfull, that
your place assigned you
on earth was not perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
but transitory, and
that you have here no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
City, but must
look after one in Heaven.
I have ordained for you
Professors of the tongues,
and Arts, that so you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the knowledge
of them in your younger
yeeres, might be enabled
to underrgoe weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16010:72"/>
hereafter. I besee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ched
you in the bowels of
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that you
would devote all your
studies to Gods glory. I
have declared to the
World, that this College
of mine was founded for
Divinitie sake. I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
the other Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
to designe all their
labours, and studies to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
the Divine.
I have earnestly exhorted,
and enjoyned you all to
strive, and contend with
all possible diligence for
the knowledge of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
I had good hope,
that this Colledge would
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16010:73"/>
have sent forth many
both excellently learned
men, and sound Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who being well sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
themselves with
heavenly wisdom, would
make the unsavory minds
of others to relish pietie,
bring the light of the
Gospell to them that sit
in darknesse, restore the
sick to health, refresh the
poore, strengthen the
weak, direct them that go
astray, and raise up the
dead by the Gospell. But
alasse my hopes are fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;
my labours are all
in vaine; yea, so short of
arriving at the desired ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16010:73"/>
that they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with a tempest
in the very mid-way.

I trust, Christians are
not made impious by

corrupt weake Schollers
with your <hi>Epicurean</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnesse

of life. Thus
the streams, which should
refresh the dry soules of

spring apace, are quite
dried up in the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
so the fruit is perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
