            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore, to ſatisfye the Reaſonable and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, who deſire to be rightly inform'd, the Manner or Method of Our Settlements are thus: The Country from the Mouth (that is, from the Sea) to the Head of <hi>Delaware-River,</hi> is about <hi>Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> and <hi>Fifty</hi> Miles in Length, and is divided into <hi>One Hundred</hi> Shares, or <hi>Proprieties;</hi> as may be ſeen by the Deeds made to every <hi>Purchaſer</hi> thereof; every <hi>Proprietor</hi> naturally having a Conſiderable Quantity of his Land lying by the <hi>River</hi>-ſide: I ſay, every <hi>Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> having a great Part of his Propriety contigious to that Noble and Navigable <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Delaware,</hi> is an Accomodation of no ſmall Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
            <p>Then, as to the <hi>Government;</hi> one out of each of theſe <hi>Hundred Proprieties,</hi> is to be freely choſen by the Inhabitants thereof, to meet and ſit as a General-Aſſembly, to make and alter Laws, to hear and redreſs all manner of Grievances whatſoever: And not any, the leaſt Tax, either in Money or Goods, or any other Services, upon any Pretence whatſoever, to be impoſed on the People, but by the Conſent of theſe their Repreſentatives in the General-Aſſembly: And this Aſſembly is to meet Annually upon a Day certain, as is Irrevocably ordained in one of the Chapters of Our <hi>General Conceſſions,</hi> as a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving from the Diſcourſe we had formerly, about the <hi>South-Weſt-Part</hi> of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> lying upon the <hi>Bay</hi> and <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Delaware,</hi> perceived a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in you, to be particularly informed thereof, from the Obſervations I had either made My Self, in my ſeveral Voyages into thoſe Parts, or from the Collections I took from the <hi>Engliſh, Swedes,</hi> or <hi>Hollanders</hi>; and perceiving ſeveral of your Ingenious, Publick-ſpirited <hi>Friends</hi> were ingaged therein with <hi>Your Self,</hi> and that it was to be looked upon no longer for your own particular Curioſity, but as a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Concern, from the Thriving Genius of ſuch Worthy Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers: Which, together with the Kindneſs I bear to Your Self, and the Perſon that made our Acquaintance, obliged Me, as ſoon as I could, to comply with your Commands.</p>
            <p>Then be pleaſed to know, that the Lord <hi>Delaware,</hi> Governor of <hi>Virginia, Anno</hi> 1611. during his Stay in thoſe Parts, ſpent one whole <hi>Summer</hi> in making a particular Search of all that Part of <hi>America</hi>; lying, and being Situate betwixt <hi>Cape-Auguſtine</hi> on the <hi>South-Weſt,</hi> to <hi>Cape-Porpus</hi> on the <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi> which is from 28. to 44. Degrees of <hi>North-Latitude,</hi> and 430. Leagues by that Shoar; and having viſited and viewed all the Remarkable <hi>Bays</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> as alſo, particularly Inſpected the <hi>Clime</hi> and <hi>Soyl</hi> of all thoſe Parts, pitched upon this Place, which is now called
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51753:4"/>
               <hi>New-Jerſey</hi>; which <hi>River</hi> the Lord <hi>Delaware</hi> called after his own Name, and by which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have known it ever ſince. And it is not to be queſtioned, had not Death prevented his Purpoſes, but that he had prevailed with the then <hi>Lords-Commiſſioners,</hi> (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Virginia-Company</hi>) to have removed that <hi>Colony</hi> to this Place: Which, without doubt, had prevented the Death of very many Thouſands of the <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi>; who have, ſince that time, found their Graves in <hi>Virginia,</hi> by reaſon of the many <hi>Boggs, Swamps,</hi> and <hi>Standing-Waters,</hi> which corrupt the Air of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> And to ſhew you, that the Lord <hi>Delaware</hi> was not ſingular in this Point, ſee the Character given of it by <hi>Jeronama Beeckman</hi> of <hi>Stetin,</hi> in a <hi>Tract</hi> of his Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. This <hi>Beeckman</hi> was ſent thither with a Great <hi>Cargoe</hi> from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> by <hi>John Luſſingen,</hi> and <hi>Peter Coyman,</hi> Eminent Merchants of that City; who truſted him with all their Concern, Laden on Two Ships, the <hi>Orania,</hi> and the <hi>Ickeabome</hi>; who Return'd in about <hi>Fourteen</hi> Months, bringing them Back in all ſorts of <hi>Furs, Skins,</hi> and <hi>Poltry,</hi> clear Profit <hi>One Hundred</hi> and <hi>Thirty</hi> Pounds, <hi>per Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Thus much in General; but to come to Particulars:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This <hi>Province</hi> (I mean the <hi>South-Weſt-Part</hi> of it, borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Delaware</hi>) is Situate parallel to the moſt Happy of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of the World; and is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſtored with all Sorts of Timber, and other Materials for the Building and Equipping of Ships, Structure of Houſes, making of Cabinets, and all other Curious Joyner's Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is <hi>Sumach,</hi> and ſeveral other Drugs for the Uſe of <hi>Dyers</hi>; beſides, ſome Trees there are, that produce both <hi>Gums,</hi> and <hi>Medicinal Oyls,</hi> as is obſerved by Doctor <hi>Adrian Vander-dunke,</hi> who ſearched that <hi>Country</hi> at his own proper Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there is all Sorts of <hi>Engliſh-Corn,</hi> and may be Two Harveſts of ſeveral Sorts of <hi>Grain,</hi> in one Year: As alſo, that a Poor Man by his Reaſonable Labour, can in the ſame Space of Time make <hi>Fifteen Thouſand</hi> Pipe-Staves, which are worth on the Place <hi>Sixty</hi> Pounds; but at the <hi>Canaries, Three Hundred</hi> Pounds; which, according to an ordinary Calculation, is but Three Weeks Sail, and the Tranſportation is accounted but half at moſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That in this <hi>Province</hi> there is not only as good <hi>Iron-Mines</hi> as are in any Parts of the World; but alſo, great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency from the Multitude of <hi>Brooks</hi> for <hi>Iron-Mills</hi>; which in the making thereof, would alſo clear the Ground of <hi>Wood,</hi> and fit it for Planting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:51753:4"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That <hi>Vines</hi> grow naturally all over this <hi>Province</hi>; of which, Wild as they are, <hi>Wines,</hi> and very Good <hi>Brandy</hi> have been made: And, I am well aſſured, if thoſe <hi>Vines</hi> were Tranſplanted and Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated accordingly, there might be Rich and Generous <hi>Wines</hi> made in the <hi>Weſt-Part</hi> of <hi>New-Jerſey:</hi> But if <hi>Vine-Stocks</hi> of the <hi>Greek, Calabrian,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> with the <hi>Candian-Grapes,</hi> were Tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into this <hi>Province,</hi> (thoſe <hi>Countries</hi> where theſe <hi>Grapes</hi> are in Perfection, lying parallel to This) there would certainly be a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which may enrich both <hi>England,</hi> and all thoſe Countries, to the Envy of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That the Art, Uſe, and Excellency of the <hi>Silk-Worm</hi> might be had in this <hi>Province,</hi> with great Conveniency; the <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-Trees</hi> growing there Wild, very numerous, and the Leaves to be had for gathering; whereas the <hi>French</hi> Nobility and Gentry make a Great Revenue of <hi>Mulberry-Trees</hi>; beſides their Fruits, the Leaves of every Tree being Farmed in <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> as in Goodneſs, from <hi>Five</hi> Shillings to <hi>Twenty</hi> Shillings, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>per Annum.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> raiſed <hi>Anno</hi> 1671. <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand</hi> Ducats on the Leaves of <hi>Mulberry-Trees</hi> alone, as he doth Yearly about the ſame Sum.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur Le Telliere,</hi> Great Uncle to the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Lovoy,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State to the preſent <hi>French King,</hi> writ Obſervations on this Subject, <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. affirming, That <hi>Silk-Worms</hi> were Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> in the Year 1540. and that they had not been in <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Provence</hi> in <hi>France</hi> above <hi>Sixty</hi> Years; &amp; yet the Revenue of <hi>Silk</hi> in thoſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> was more worth both to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Nobility,</hi> than the Product of <hi>Wine, Oyl, Woad,</hi> and all other Fruits whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur Agume,</hi> in his Obſervations on that Subject Printed at <hi>Lyons, Anno</hi> 1654. ſayes, That in <hi>Forty</hi> Years, the making of <hi>Silk</hi> in the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> had brought into the <hi>Exchecquer</hi> or <hi>Financy</hi> of that <hi>Crown, Fifty Seven</hi> Millions of <hi>Livers,</hi> which is about <hi>One Hundred</hi> and <hi>Twenty Thouſand</hi> Pounds, <hi>per Annum,</hi> Cuſtom for the Raw <hi>Silk</hi> only.

The <hi>Air</hi> of this <hi>Province</hi> is very Serene, Sweet, and Wholſome, which renders the <hi>Clime</hi> much more agreeable to <hi>European</hi> Bodies, than the ſevere Colds of <hi>New-England,</hi> or the ſulphurous Heat in <hi>Virginia</hi>; where, I ſay, the Bogs, Marſhes, and corrupt Standing-Waters, have ever been very Noxious to the Planter.</p>
            <p>The Soyl of this <hi>Province</hi> is very Rich and Fruitful; and, for the moſt part, upon a Riſing Level; and where it is interlaced with Hills, they are rather Gradual Proſpects, than troubleſom Aſcents for above an Hundred Miles from the Sea. And where it is any whit Mountainous or Rocky, there are alſo Valleys extream Rich and Fertile: Beſides, thoſe Mountains have ſtore of <hi>Black-Lead, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, Sulphur, Copper,</hi> &amp;c. the which is confirmed by the Writings of <hi>Tararapha,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Gallane,</hi> Son to the preſent <hi>Preſident of Nants,</hi> a Perſon of great Quality, who ſpent the Years 1668, 69, and 70. in the Diſcovery of moſt of the <hi>Lakes, Mountains,</hi> and <hi>Countries, West,</hi> from <hi>Quebeck</hi> to the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Florida,</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Carolina.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I mention This as well for your own Curioſity, as that ſuch a Trade may be worth looking after, when it ſhall pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> to put thoſe that ſettle your <hi>Colony,</hi> in a condition to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it; which, I do aſſure you, in due time may be done, to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Advantage.</p>

               <hi>Sir,</hi> Having before ſpoken of the Agreeableneſs of the <hi>Air</hi>; I ſhall only ſay in general, that the <hi>Weſt-Part</hi> of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> is by Nature ſliced into a bundance of <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Riv'leis,</hi> which every way glide in Deep and Navigable <hi>Channels,</hi> either for Shipping or Boats, betwixt the Breaſt of this Your plentiful Country; which highly contributes to its Conveniency, Beauty, and Fertility.

            <p>THrough the Mercy of <hi>God,</hi> we are ſafely Arrived at <hi>New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey.</hi> My Wife, and all Mine are very well; and we have our Healths rather better <hi>Here,</hi> than we had in <hi>England</hi>: Indeed, the <hi>Country</hi> is ſo likely, that I do not ſee, how it can reaſonably be found fault with. As far as I perceive, all of the Things we heard of it in <hi>England,</hi> are very true; and I wiſh, that many People (that are in Straits) in <hi>England,</hi> were <hi>Here: Here</hi> is Good Land enough lyes void, would ſerve many <hi>Thouſands</hi> of Families; and we think, if they cannot Live <hi>Here,</hi> they can hardly Live in any Place in the World. But we do not deſire to perſwade any to come, but ſuch as are well ſatisfied in their own Minds. A Town-Lot is laid out for us in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi> which is a Convenient Place for a Trade: It is about <hi>One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> and <hi>Fifty</hi> Miles up the <hi>River of Delaware.</hi> The <hi>Country,</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> ſeems <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Indians</hi> are very Loving to Us, except here and there one, when they have gotten Strong Liquors in their Heads, which they now greatly love.

            <p>I Have received both your Letters, wherein I underſtand your Faith concerning this <hi>Country</hi> is much ſhaken through ſeveral falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports given thereof; which may be proved falſe under the <hi>hands</hi> of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral good <hi>Friends,</hi> I hope as worthy to be believed as that Reporter; and ſuch as have had more Experience of this Place, than he had or could have in ſo ſhort a time. Beſides, he came amongſt us ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after our coming hither, when things were not ſettl'd in that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der amongſt us as now they are. Neither indeed did he find ſuch Entertainment from ſome, as he expected; which <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe makes him ſpeak the worſt he can deviſe of this Place. But <hi>I</hi> queſtion not, but his Reports will in a ſhort time be wip'd away: Some of which, in my Knowledge, are groſs Lyes, as well as Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his own VVords. For <hi>I</hi> remember, when <hi>I</hi> Travelled with him through Part of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> he confeſſed, That much of this Land was as good or better, than the Land in <hi>Road-Iſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it's really my judgment that thoſe people that cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with ſuch a Country, and ſuch Land as this is, they are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to come here. And this I can truly tell you if I were now in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with you my Friends, (and which I ſhould be very glad to ſee) yet if all <hi>I</hi> had in the World would but bring me hither, <hi>I</hi> ſhould freely leave You, and my Native-Country, and come to <hi>New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> again; which <hi>I</hi> have ſaid many a time heretofore; but now <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51753:9"/>
write it under my Hand; and it's really the Truth, whether you will believe it or not. And farther, <hi>I</hi> can truly tell you, That <hi>I</hi> deſire not, nor dare not to write the leaſt Untruth to draw you, or any others to this Place: But an reſolved, if <hi>I</hi> never ſee your Face more, to leave you to your own Freedom in the <hi>Lord.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> hope, you are not inſenſible of my Love, and Deſires for You; though <hi>I</hi> am (<hi>I</hi> ſay) conſtrain'd to Forbear perſwading. You, or any one elſe, againſt their own Freedoms: yet <hi>I</hi> think it my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to let You, and all Men know the Truth of things as near as <hi>I</hi> can.</p>
            <p>Your Letter ſaith, it's reported, <hi>the water is not ſo good as in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I do not remember, that ever I taſted better water in any part of <hi>England,</hi> than the ſprings of this Place do yeild; of which is made very good <hi>bear,</hi> and <hi>Ale</hi>; And here is alſo <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Sider.</hi> And whereas your Letter to me ſaith, <hi>ſeveral have come back from this Country to England</hi>; Two or Three, I ſuppoſe, there are Lazy idle perſons, that have done ſo. But on the other hand here are ſeveral perſons, Men of Eſtates, that have been <hi>here,</hi> and have gone back to <hi>England,</hi> and ſold their Eſtates, and return'd with their whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies hither again; which methinks, ſhould take many of theſe Scruples out of the way, if nothing elſe were ſaid or done in praiſe of this <hi>Country.</hi> But, I ſuppoſe, there are many in <hi>England,</hi> that deſire to hear ill of this Place, becauſe they would keep their <hi>Friends</hi> there with them, and they think, we never write enough of the bad Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>Vermin</hi> in it. Now, this I may ſay in ſhort, That here are <hi>Bears, Wolves, Foxes Rattle-ſnakes,</hi> and ſeveral other Creatures, (I do believe) becauſe I ſee the <hi>Indians</hi> have ſuch Skins to ſell. But I have Travelled ſeveral <hi>hundreds</hi> of Miles to and fro, and I never (to my knowledge) ſaw one of thoſe Creatures, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept two <hi>Rattle-ſnakes,</hi> and I kill'd them both. I ſuppoſe, the Fear of thoſe Creatures in <hi>England,</hi> is far worſe to ſome <hi>there,</hi> than the Hurt of them is <hi>here.</hi> And as for the <hi>Musketto-Fly,</hi> we are not troubled with them in this Place; our Land for the moſt part Lying high and healthy, and they for the moſt part are in Law Boggy ground. <hi>Thomas Budd,</hi> and his Family are arrived, the ſhip Lieth before this Town that brought them: I wiſh, you have not cauſe to repent, that you came not along with them. They had a very good Paſſage, and ſo had the <hi>London Ship</hi>; they are both in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at this time. I underſtand by <hi>Thomas Budd,</hi> that he did ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you as near as he could, of the Truth of things <hi>here</hi>; and you had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51753:9"/>
as much reaſon to believe him, as that other perſon, and more too; for <hi>Thomas</hi> had far more Experience of this Place, than he (I ſay) could have in the ſhort time he was among us. So of theſe things, I ſhall forbear to write any farther at preſent; and with my true love to you all, my <hi>Friends,</hi> with my hearts Deſire for your Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare every way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I reſt</p>

            <p>I Received thine by <hi>Henry Salter,</hi> but it came too late to my hand; ſo that I could not write any thing in anſwer untill this time. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thou would'ſt know ſomething from me concerning <hi>New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> which indeed I had given thee a large account of, without thy deſiring only <hi>Joſeph Hempſley</hi> ſatisfied me, that he had done it. Let every Man write according to his Judgment; and this is Mine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this <hi>Country:</hi> I do really believe it to be as good a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> as any Man need to dwell in; and it is much better than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected every way. For Land I will aſſure thee, here is as good by the Judgment of Men, as any is in <hi>England.</hi> And for my part, I like the <hi>Country</hi> ſo well, and it is ſo Pleaſant to me, that if I had a good Eſtate in Land in <hi>England,</hi> I ſhould not come to live upon it: For through Induſtry, here will be all Things produced, that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a Family, as is in <hi>England</hi>; and far more eaſier, I am ſatisfyed. When I am walking alone, and the <hi>Lord</hi> is with me, and the Senſe of His good Dealings is brought before me, I cannot but admire Him for His Mercies; and often in ſecret bleſs His Name,

that ever He turn'd my Face hitherward; and gave me Confidence in Himſelf, and Boldneſs by Faith to oppoſe all Gain-ſayers, though never <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hough then I could not ſay, <hi>I</hi> had a Call or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to leave the Land of my Nativity: Yet now of a Truth <hi>I</hi> can ſay, the <hi>Lord</hi> removed me there-from; and in what I did, <hi>I</hi> had Peace in Him. And in all my Exerciſes by <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> I never felt the leaſt Matter in me, as to deſire I had not come forward; but rather rejoyced in the <hi>Lord,</hi> in the midſt of all.

            <p>And now, my Dear Friends, and Antient Acquaintance (<hi>William,</hi> and <hi>Sarah Biddle</hi>) My Love you may feel beyond Expreſſion. And if you have Clearneſs to come to <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> let nothing hinder; but if you have a Stop upon your Spirits, let not any thing farther you, until the <hi>Lord</hi> clears your Way. In this my Writing, I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, I deny my ſelf; for, if <hi>I</hi> might, <hi>I</hi> ſhould write to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you; but <hi>I</hi> dare not. Though you may underſtand by my Letters, how it is with Me and Mine, and many Others; <hi>I</hi> know, if a Man cannot Live here, <hi>I</hi> do believe he can hardly live in any Place in the World.

            <p>BUt now a word, or two of thoſe ſtrange Reports you have of Us, and our <hi>Country</hi>; I affirm, they are Lyes in the very Ground of them, and ſpoken from a Spirit of Envy: It is a <hi>Country,</hi> that produceth all things for the Support, and Suſtenance of Man, in a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51753:12"/>
plentiful manner. If it were not ſo, <hi>I</hi> ſhould be aſhamed of what <hi>I</hi> have before written: But <hi>I</hi> can ſtand, having Truth on my Side, againſt and before the Face of all Gain-ſayers, and evil Spies. <hi>I</hi> have Travelled through moſt of the Places that are ſettled, and ſome that are not; and in every Place, <hi>I</hi> find the <hi>Country</hi> very apt to anſwer the Expectation of the Diligent. <hi>I</hi> have ſeen <hi>Orchards</hi> ſo loaden with <hi>Fruit, I</hi> have wondered to ſee it, their very Limbs torn in pieces with the weight of their <hi>Fruit</hi>; and moſt Delicious to the Taſte, and Lovely to behold. <hi>I</hi> have ſeen an <hi>Apple-Tree</hi> from a <hi>Pippin-Kernel,</hi> yield a Barrel of curious <hi>Syder</hi>; and <hi>Peaches</hi> in ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that ſome People took their Carts a <hi>Peach</hi>-gathering: <hi>I</hi> could not but ſmile at the Conceit of it. They are a very delicate <hi>Fruit,</hi> and hang almoſt like our <hi>Onions</hi> that are tyed on Ropes. <hi>I</hi> have ſeen and known this <hi>Summer Forty</hi> Buſhels of good <hi>Bold-Wheat,</hi> of <hi>One</hi> Buſhel ſown: And many more ſuch Inſtances <hi>I</hi> could bring, which would be too tedious here to mention. We have from the Times call'd <hi>May</hi> until <hi>Michaelmals,</hi> great ſtore of very good <hi>Wild-Fruit</hi>; as <hi>Strawberries, Cramberries,</hi> &amp; <hi>Huckle-berries,</hi> which are like our <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; but far ſweeter: They are very wholſome <hi>Fruits</hi>; the <hi>Cramberries</hi> much like <hi>Cherries</hi> for Colour and Bigneſs, which may be kept till <hi>Fruit</hi> come in again; an Excellent Sauce is made of them for <hi>Veniſon, Turkies,</hi> and other great <hi>Fowles</hi>; and they are better to make Tarts, than either <hi>Gooſeberries,</hi> or <hi>Cherries:</hi> We have them brought to our Houſes, by the <hi>Indians,</hi> in great plenty. My Brother <hi>Robert</hi> had as many <hi>Cherries</hi> this Year, as would have loaded ſeveral Carts. It is my Judgment, by what <hi>I</hi> have obſerved, That <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> in this <hi>Country</hi> deſtroy themſelves, by the very Weight of their <hi>Fruit.</hi> As for <hi>Veniſon,</hi> and <hi>Fowles,</hi> here are great plenty: We have brought Home to our Houſes by the <hi>Indians, Seven</hi> or <hi>Eight</hi> Fat <hi>Bucks</hi> of a day; and ſometimes put by as many, having no Occaſion for them. And <hi>Fiſh</hi> in their Seaſon very plenteous: My Couſin <hi>Revill,</hi> and <hi>I,</hi> with ſome of my Men, went laſt <hi>Third</hi> Moneth called <hi>May,</hi> into the <hi>River</hi> to catch <hi>Herrings</hi>; for at that time they come in great Shoals into the Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's; we had neither Rod, nor Net; but after the <hi>Indian</hi> Faſhion, made a round Pinfold about <hi>Two Yards</hi> over, and a Foot high; but left a Gap for the <hi>Fiſh</hi> to go in at, and made a Buſh to lay in the Gap to keep the <hi>Fiſh</hi> in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when that was done, we took <hi>Two</hi> long Birches &amp; tyed their Tops together; &amp; went about a Stones-caſt above our ſaid Pinfold: Then hauling theſe Birche's Boughs down
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51753:12"/>
the Stream, where we drove <hi>Thouſands</hi> before us: But ſo many got into our Trap as it would hold; and then we began to haul them to Shoar, as faſt as <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> of us could, by <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> at a time: And after this manner, in half an Hour, we could have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Three-Buſhel</hi> Sack of as good and large <hi>Herrings,</hi> as over <hi>I</hi> ſaw. And as to <hi>Beef</hi> and <hi>Pork,</hi> here is great plenty of it, and good cheap; and alſo, good <hi>Sheep:</hi> The common Graſs of this <hi>Country</hi> feeds <hi>Beef</hi> very Fat; <hi>I</hi> have Kill'd <hi>Two</hi> this Year; and therefore, <hi>I</hi> have reaſon to know: Beſides, <hi>I</hi> have ſeen this <hi>Fall,</hi> in <hi>Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Kill'd <hi>Eight</hi> or <hi>Nine</hi> Fat <hi>Oxen</hi> and <hi>Cowes</hi> on a Market-Day, and all very fat. And though <hi>I</hi> ſpeak of <hi>Herrings</hi> only, and leſt any ſhould think we have little other ſorts, we have great plenty of moſt ſorts of <hi>Fiſh,</hi> that ever <hi>I</hi> ſaw in <hi>England</hi>; beſides ſeveral other ſorts that are not known <hi>There</hi>; as <hi>Rocks, Cat-Fiſh, Shoads, Sheep-Heads, Sturgeons:</hi> And <hi>Fowles</hi> plenty; as <hi>Ducks, Geeſe, Turkies, Swans, Pheaſants, Partridges</hi>; and many other ſorts that <hi>I</hi> cannot remember, and would be too tedious to mention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indeed the <hi>Country,</hi> take it as a <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> is a brave <hi>Country</hi>; Though no Place will pleaſe all; but ſome will be ready to ſay, <hi>He writes of Conveniences, but not of Inconveniences:</hi> In anſwer to thoſe, <hi>I</hi> honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, Here is alſo ſome Barren Land; as (<hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe) there is in moſt Places of the World; and more Wood, than ſome would have upon their Lands. Neither will the <hi>Country</hi> produce Corn without Labour, nor Cattle be got without ſomething to buy them, nor Bread with Idleneſs; elſe it would be a brave Country indeed: And <hi>I</hi> queſtion not, but that all then would give it a good Word.

            <p>THis may give you an Account of Mine, and my Families ſafe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> with all the Reſt that came forth with us: I might ſay ſomething concerning our Paſſage at <hi>Sea</hi>; but I wave it for want of Time: and, in fine, can ſay all was well; for which, I bleſs <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> keep us all ſenſible of it, with the reſt of His Mercies for ever.</p>

            </p>
            <p>About <hi>Six</hi> Weeks ſince, we arrived in <hi>Delaware-River</hi>; where I expected to have met with a Combat in the Denyal of <hi>Cuſtoms.</hi> In our Paſſage at <hi>Sea,</hi> I had communicated to all, that had any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable <hi>Cargoe</hi> on Board, the Opinion of <hi>Council</hi> concerning the illegal Demand thereof, with what elſe I thought might be for their Information; which thus far prevailed, that moſt, if not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, ſeemed reſolved to deny the Paying of <hi>Cuſtom</hi> here, having paid all the <hi>King</hi>'s Duties in <hi>England.</hi> In good time we came to Anchor in <hi>Delaware</hi>; where one <hi>Peter Alrick</hi> came Aboard to us, and brought a <hi>Handſome Preſent</hi> to our <hi>Commander,</hi> and ſent for me into the <hi>Round-Houſe,</hi> where They both were; and <hi>Peter</hi> told me, He had nothing to ſay to Us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <note n="†" rend="inter">

            <p>NOw, that illegal Impoſition of <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> is taken off, the <hi>Port</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> made free, and the <hi>Government</hi> thereof ſettled on Your Self; I may honeſtly affirm.

And yet it is not theſe Springs and Rivers, Creeks and Ports alone, that makes <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> exceed moſt of her Neighbours for Situation, and Healthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Air; but the general Boldneſs of her Shoars, with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Aſcent, or Gradual Riſing of the <hi>Land</hi> from the <hi>South Sea</hi> to the utmoſt, or extream Points of its moſt <hi>Northerly</hi> Extent; which from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North,</hi> (that is to ſay, from the Mouth to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51753:14"/>
Head of that never-too-often to be mentioned goodly <hi>River</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware</hi>) is about <hi>Two Hundred</hi> and <hi>Fifty</hi> Miles; at whoſe large expanded Mouth, begins the Separation betwixt <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> and <hi>Mary-Land</hi>; and about <hi>Eighty</hi> Miles farther up, in a more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted manner gently divide betwixt <hi>You,</hi> &amp; a very good Tract of Land; the which, if ſettled with good Neighbours, and under a right Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, would be vaſtly Advantageous to Yours both in Commerce and Defence: For that there being already a pretty conſiderable quantity of <hi>Swedes, Finlanders,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſeated on that Tract of <hi>Land</hi> along by the <hi>River</hi>-ſide; and who, through a good <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> over them, in time may become very good Neighbours; at leaſt, much better than at preſent they are.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> I think it was highly your Advantage, that you found few or no Inhabitants ſettled in <hi>New-Jerſey</hi>; ſo that you had none to new-mold, diſplace, or remove, contend or quarrel with: None being ſeated, or to ſettle there, but by mutual Conceſſions, and a Grant for their <hi>Land,</hi> firſt had and obtained under Hand and Seal. And likewiſe, before you ſat down in any Part of the <hi>Country,</hi> your giving Order to buy the <hi>Lands</hi> of the <hi>Natives,</hi> and give them real Satisfaction for the ſame, was a moſt Chriſtian and Prudent Act; and by which means you are aſſured of their Love, and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for ever: And the <hi>Poor Creatures</hi> are never the Worſe, but much the Better, as Themſelves do confeſs; being now ſupplyed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the way of Truck and Trade, with whatſoever they want or ſtand need of. And they Hunt and Fiſh, as here-to-fore, except in Encloſed or Planted Ground.</p>
            <p>But it may be demanded, Why theſe <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that came lately, ſhould ſeat on the Other Side of the <hi>River,</hi> rather than in <hi>New-Jerſey?</hi> The only Reaſon, as a Reaſon, that I can give, was becauſe of the Cuſtome impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> heretofore, and the Government not being ſettled, as now it is.</p>
            <p>And moreover, the Land on the other ſide next the <hi>River</hi> (upon which theſe People are ſet down) for the moſt part is a deeper Soyl, and leſs Wood upon it, than upon ſome of the Land on your ſide over againſt it; for that much of the richeſt Soil and beſt Land in <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> lyeth not upon the very Brink of the <hi>River,</hi> but ſomewhat back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the <hi>Country</hi>; which is a conveniency of no ſmall value to ſuch Planters, who truly underſtand the erecting, and ſettling of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony</hi>'s next the Water-ſide in theſe Parts. For it is the heighth of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51753:15"/>
the Land and Shoar's, and not the miry depth of the Soil, that makes <hi>Burlington,</hi> and the many Miles above and below it (where are many good Settlements beſides) ſo wholſome an Air, and free from the <hi>Muſuetto</hi>'s, <hi>Agnes, Feavors,</hi> &amp;c. And although I ſay the Soyl be not ſo deep on <hi>Jerſey</hi> ſide next the <hi>River,</hi> yet I am ſure there are as good <hi>Corns,</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of all ſorts, as ever I ſaw, or heard of in any of theſe parts of <hi>America.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſuppoſe you want not to know, by information, that the <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Riv'lets</hi> I mentioned are abundantly pleniſh't with all the Kinds of the <hi>Fiſh</hi> and <hi>Fowl</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeveral that you have not, and much better. Alſo the Land breeds good <hi>Horſes,</hi> good <hi>Sheep,</hi> and good <hi>Deer,</hi> and <hi>Swine</hi> in abundance, and as large <hi>Oxen,</hi> and <hi>Cowes</hi> as in any parts of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh</hi> eats much better, eſpecially the <hi>Pork</hi> and <hi>Veniſon.</hi> Sir, I make no queſtion, but you have heard as much as all this, and a great deal more concerning the Situation, growth, and product of New <hi>Jerſey</hi> (and which may truly be ſaid.) But it is poſſible I may inform you of one particular, that you may not have minded, which is that this <hi>Country,</hi> being bounded on the <hi>Weſt</hi> with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware,</hi> on the <hi>South</hi> with the main <hi>Ocean,</hi> and on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> with <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's</hi> River; ſome of whoſe <hi>North-Weſt</hi> Branches do almoſt ſhake hands with the moſt <hi>North-Eaſterly</hi> branches of <hi>Delaware,</hi> and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner claſp the whole Province about, until they reduce it ſomewhat into the form of a blunt wedge, ſo that with a ſmall charge (conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the advantage,) New <hi>Jerſey</hi> from a <hi>Peninſula</hi> may be made an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>Iſland.</hi> But however as it is, with the Methods you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the ſetting thereof: for inſtance; that incomparable way of dividing the whole <hi>Country</hi> into a hundred propriety's (whereby eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual Purchaſer hath a ſhare of the good, and the bad) is away ſo juſt and equal, that not any plantation in theſe parts at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent doth, or for the future in that point, can ever come near it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their promiſcuous or confuſed ſettling at their firſt fitting down. And then as to Your Government (a free holder being An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to be choſen out of each of theſe hundred proprieties, and as the Repreſentatives thereof to fit, and freely Act in the Parliament, or general Aſſembly, where all grievances are to be heard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, and where all Laws (agreeable to thoſe immutable funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals agreed on in your general conceſſions) for the inviolable preſervation of liberty and property are to be made. All which, are ſuch priſtine and certain methods for maintaining the juſt right and equal utility of the whole Community, that I do not ſee the

moſt Capricious can aſſign, wherein it is either faulty in exceeding, or deficient in falling ſhort of the moſt Ancient true Engliſh, and beſt Chriſtian Government in the World. Wherefore I am ſatisfied it will not now be long before <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> be peopled.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſince the Government thereof is ſettled in ſo Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Worthy a Hand as your own, at which I can aſſure you, very many Honeſt and Sober People in theſe Parts, as well as thoſe more direct of your Own Way, greatly rejoyce, and fervently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee you in <hi>America</hi>; but for ought I know, none more than doth,</p>
