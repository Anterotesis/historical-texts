            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing deſired by the <hi>Author</hi> to make Theſe of his againſt <hi>Incloſure</hi> common; I ſhall as publikely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Reaſon of my undertaking the ſame.</p>
            <p>I have known the <hi>Author</hi> from my childhood, and have obſerved him (ever ſince I obſerved any thing) to be a <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>zealous</hi> Witneſs againſt <hi>Depopulation;</hi> and no Encroachment of New Times, Places, or things, could ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this <hi>Land-mark</hi> from off his ſpirit. Yea, now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his old-age, his Courage and Hope againſt this is as <hi>freſh</hi> and <hi>green</hi> as ever. So that this is no new nor ſudden Conception of his Fancie, but a ſetled and well-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted <hi>Principle</hi> in his Heart through a long tract of time &amp; <hi>obſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can any Particular intereſt of his own (by thoſe that know him) be ſuſpected to ſet him on work; he living the beſt of his time in a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-town, where he was a Magiſtrate, and exerciſed his Calling in the <hi>houſe,</hi> as a Shop-keeper; not in the <hi>field,</hi> as a Husbandman: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil <hi>Providence</hi> ſnatching him thence, made him Governour of the onely <hi>Iſland</hi> called by her name; where he continued, until the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> being about to be born again into a new and <hi>free ſtate,</hi> might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly be Chriſtned <hi>The Iſle of Providence;</hi> whither he might be brought back, as we may ſoberly judge, for this end, partly, if not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to give in his witneſs and teſtimony againſt Depopulation. And no ſooner were his other <hi>travels</hi> ended, but the pangs of this <hi>travel</hi> came freſh upon him (though he had never been diſchared of them;) and the office of <hi>delivering</hi> theſe his Meditations, and bringing them forth to light, he laid upon me, for the long acquaintance he had with me; charging me, under a very great and ſolemn adjuration, not to neglect the ſame. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this <hi>ſcore</hi> do I put my hand to this work; otherwiſe, I confeſs, it is a Queſtion remote from my <hi>Cognizance,</hi> which I ſhould not therefore undertake to determine. I skill onely the <hi>Equity</hi> of it; and certainly that is obvious to <hi>All</hi> men. Depopulation is odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable both to God and men: Therefore, <hi>that</hi> Incloſure which is guilty of Depopulation, muſt needs be unlawful: Otherwiſe, I ſuppoſe, the Author himſelf is not againſt ſuch Incloſure as is for the <hi>neceſſary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation</hi> of houſe-keeping.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:117770:3"/>The truth is, the juſt Bounds and Limits cannot be ſet by me, nor, I think, by any man; yet all men may ſee <hi>there is a fault among us.</hi> And when God comes to judge, (which how near that may be to us, is not perhaps conſidered) he will finde means in every mans Conſcience to convince and reprove them, wherein they have ſerved their <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in pretence of neceſſary Accommodation.</p>
            <p>Did men believe they were <hi>Stewards,</hi> and have for others ſakes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have more then <hi>food and raiment,</hi> I am perſwaded the heat of their covetous Ambition would ſoon be over.</p>
            <p>We are taught by our Saviour, to pray onely for our <hi>daily bread;</hi> and that to be given us <hi>this day,</hi> (or from day, to day.) It will not be a good Plea to ſay, I incloſed my ground, becauſe, though I could <hi>maintain</hi> my charge on my revenue, yet I could not <hi>raiſe</hi> my family.</p>
            <p>But were the Incloſure or Cloſe-fiſtedneſs of mens <hi>Mindes</hi> thrown open into the largeneſs and bounty of a <hi>divine</hi> ſpirit, we ſhould not need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Incloſure of <hi>Land.</hi> For I would not have any think it is the <hi>Form</hi> we ſtrictly aim at but the <hi>Equity:</hi> whether in the form of <hi>Incloſure,</hi> or of <hi>Common field,</hi> let men anſwer the End, which is Charity.</p>
            <p>The Law was not made for a righteous man, but for the ungodly and ſinners. Thoſe whom the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus hath made free, need no Law to preſcribe them: but to ſuch as are not under that Law of the Spirit, are theſe things intended, and are profitable, yet not for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as that they ſhould think, when they have anſwered this Letter, they may reſt therein; but it is for a witneſs and teſtimony unto them of that inward ſpirit and power which they are humbly to wait for to come upon them, in the exerciſe of this outward Rule; that ſo what they do, may be done in truth. And thoſe that are above the coercion of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rule of this kinde, yet will ſtoop to the obſervation of it for others ſakes, as hath been the practice of Chriſts free-men formerly. For, to him that is reſolved of the End, and principled to it, whereto there are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ways and Methods tending and ſerving equally, though he be not ſimply in bondage to one more then another, yet it is (and muſt needs be) to him indifferent any of them; and that which through any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage may be moſt conducing, muſt needs be moſt acceptable.</p>
            <p>They to whom this Counſel is the <hi>ſavour of death unto death,</hi> let them remember, the time is coming that their gold ſhall <hi>ruſt,</hi> and their ſilver <hi>canker;</hi> and that ruſt and that canker ſhall eat into their hearts: for they are the <hi>laſt</hi> days.</p>

Times; I thought it my duty to hold forth my Obſervation, that ſo, in this time of Reformation, there might be ſome lawful Remedy found out, for the amendment of the provoking Evils, before Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation come upon us, as it came upon the old world. <hi>The end of all fleſh is come before me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6.13.</note> ſaith the Lord: <hi>for the earth is filled with Violence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of the world, Almighty God, after the reſt of the Creatures, made Man, appointing him Lord over them all, and giving him Dominion, that he ſhould ſubdue the earth, and rule over the Creatures. Yet ſo it is come to paſs, through the Luſt of Man, even the Covetouſneſs and Self-ſeeking of many, regarding their own profit more then the glory of God, that the courſe of things is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from their firſt Order; where through, the Brute creatures are now, in ſome ſence, become Subduers of Mankinde; to the great diſhonour of God and his Inſtitution, as well as to the hurt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Mankinde in general, and of Societies and Commonwealths in particular; yea, to the utter ſubverſion of the ſame, without ſome ſpeedy courſe be taken for redreſs thereof: which, how it ſhould be done, is almoſt beyond the apprehenſion of man to conceive; thoſe which ſhould be the Reformers of ſuch Diſorders and horrible Abuſes in a State, being, for the moſt part, the greateſt Offenders, or their fathers being ſo before them: which cauſeth much ſighing and crying out by the poor, in the bitterneſs of their ſpirits, to that God who will no doubt hear their cries. <hi>Now for the oppreſſion ef the poor, and the ſighing of the needy, will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it were my purpoſe to reckon up all thoſe ſins, that, according to the declaration that God hath made of himſelf in his Word, might juſtly be ſuſpected to procure the wrath of God againſt this Nation, I might not forget, nay I ſhould remember in the firſt place, that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and Cruelty that was practiſed againſt the Saints and Servants of God; not onely in the <hi>Marian</hi> days, but in our days, by the Biſhops, for Non-conformity; ſilencing and ejecting many faithful and able Miniſters, to the utter undoing of them, their wives and children, for things that the Perſecutors themſelves then called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> and are now caſt out as Superſtitions. Yea, which addes to the Cruelty, not onely were they caſt out of the Miniſtery, but means uſed to deprive them of Life and Livelihood; a Proclamation being ſent forth, That ſuch deprived Miniſters ſhould not be ſuffered
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117770:4"/>
either to keep Lecture or School, or be of any Trade; nor ſhould it be lawful for any man to entertaine them in his Houſe, or allow them any Maintenance. O horrible and bloody cruelty! And yet exerciſed againſt Perſons that their very Perſecutors durſt not but at other times ſay, were Honeſt Godly men. Indeed, they were painful and zealous Witneſſes of the Truth in their time, content with meane things, not ſeeking Augmentations, or power to Lord it over their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as ſome of late dayes have done, that have come in their places. Theſe did good, and received evil; being termed Factious, Troublers of the Land, Enemies of the State: when as, like ſheepe, they ſuffered loſs and ſpoile patiently; Some being impriſoned, and dying there, others conſtrained to flee out of the Land. They were ſcoffed, reproached, ſcorned of the World; ſlighted, and inſulted over by thoſe Miniſters that came in their places. Thus they did of old, they mocked the Meſſengers of the Lord, miſuſed his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, until the wrath of the Lord brake forth againſt them, and there was no remedy. And for this hath the Lord taken vengeance on the Prelacie; and let thoſe Miniſters look to it, that were content to ſee this cruelty exerciſed againſt their Brethren, and to come into their places.</p>
            <p>And let it be of warning to us all, to take heed of the like Spirit and Practices againſt the people of God, under a new Name and Pretence. If the <hi>Edomites,</hi> for their violence againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> were deſtroyed for ever; What will become of theſe now-a-dayes, that ſeek to root out and deſtroy any of the people of God, under the Notion of Sectaries, and Diſturbers of the State; though they have many of them adventured their lives to do them good!</p>
            <p>But my intent is not to be large in this: Onely I could not but hint the wrong that was done to the ſilenced Miniſters. The maine Evill which I am to decry, and which remaines yet unremedied, after all that hath been done towards Reformation, is, DEPOPULA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION; which, it cannot be denied, is a moſt cruel and bloody ſin. O that men would conſider of it, and lay it to heart! Many are the Woes, in Scripture, that are denounced againſt it. All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets cry out of it, as a ſin that brings Deſolation. Our own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſeals to it. How many great Families are come to nought! Although they have had (many times) much more then their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had, yet ſome ſecret hand of God hath followed them, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117770:5"/>
they have been brought even to miſery and want: whereof no man could give any other Reaſon. Yet notwithſtanding, men will not be warned, but are as eager upon that cruel bloudy ſin as ever. Wherefore, I am induced to declare my experience: Yea, I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced (by the manifold cryes I hear daily, and the diſtreſſes of thouſands deſtitute of Livelihood through this, and ſeeing unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able miſery coming upon this Nation thereby) to put Pen to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this kinde; hoping in God, that ſome or other, of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned, that are better ſeen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not onely into the Scriptures, but into the Laws of the Land againſt <hi>Depopulation,</hi> (for we are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Proviſions) and that are of more large and copious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Experience, may be ſtirred up to ſet themſelves to lay open the Evil and Abominableneſs of this ſin, and the miſcheivous Conſequences thereof.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as in a Publike Danger, (for example, if a Towne were on fire) no man will blame the pooreſt and meaneſt creature, that, ſpying the fire breake out, ſhall cry, <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> becauſe every mans intereſt is concerned in ſuch a publike danger; Upon the ſame account, I beſeech you, whoſoever ſhall peruſe theſe, blame not me (the unworthieſt of all) that I cry out of <hi>Depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> having ſeen and felt the danger of it. And truly, in my apprehenſion, and by all that I am able to diſcerne, it is a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating ſin.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid in the Text, <hi>They had no Comforter;</hi> Here is the ſad Condition, and Complaint of the People of this Land, that, notwithſtanding the Preſſures and Burthens they have a long time groaned under, by <hi>Depopulation,</hi> Wracking of Rents, Cruel Uſury, and other the like Courſes; yet hath there no way or meanes appeared to them, from whence they could yet have, or indeed hope for redreſs. Complaine to the Judges, they could not help them: Complaine to Parliaments; O that it might not be ſaid, that they, or their Fathers, have been deep in this tranſgreſſion! and that they, aſwell as others, have incloſed Common-fields, or do keep them incloſed, that were once for the Common uſe; and Wrack up their Rents, whereby poore people are conſtrained to work in the very fire, for the maintenance of them that do live Deliciouſly, if not very Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, as too many of the Gentry have done.</p>
            <p>But ſince it hath pleaſed God, by his mighty hand and outſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117770:5"/>
arme, to create for us an opportunity for Reformation, (which hath not been gained without much bloud, and very many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) and to turne the faces at leaſt (we hope, the hearts) of the whole Nation towards the ſame; I beſeech you all, our Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives in Parliament, as you tender the glory of God, and the flouriſhing of this Common-wealth, that you deny your own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, wherein it tends to the Ruine of a Country or Nation; and that ye all joyne Heart and Hand together, for the recovering of this almoſt-ruined Land out of this weake eſtate whereinto it is fallen, by <hi>Depopulation:</hi> that ſo ye repairing the old waſte places, and raiſing up the Foundations of many Generations, may juſtly be called, <hi>The Repairers of the Breach, Restorers of paths to dwell in.</hi> Oh! how would this engage the hearts of the people unto you!</p>
            <p>I know ſome will ſay, they did not Depopulate or incloſe but they bought it ſo, or it was ſo left them by their Fathers, and the Poore were provided for when it was firſt incloſed and turned to paſture. I, but where are they and their breed? Are they not conſtrained to flee into other Towns, to the great annoyance and charge of the places whither they were driven? Where, I ſay, are thoſe good Houſe-keepers that brought ſtore of Corne to the Market? and where are the Horſe, Beaſts, and Sheep that were bred there, beſides Men, Women, and Children that dwelt there?</p>
            <p>Theſe things would be enlarged, by the experiences of ancient men, that know more of this then I can utter.</p>
            <p>And this may be one Reaſon why Free-Quarter of Souldiers is ſo exceeding burthenſome, becauſe many houſes of Husbandry are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and the Lands layd down to Sheep-paſture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby it comes to paſs that the charge lies but upon a few. But of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Arguments againſt <hi>Depopulation,</hi> in their place.</p>
            <p>And to reduce what I have to ſay to ſome Method, I ſhall,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Endeavour to convict this ſin, by the Lawes of God, and of the Land where we live, to be a forbidden, an accurſed thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall endeavour to lay open the Myſtery, and the way of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall offer ſuch Arguments as I have ready againſt it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ſhall anſwer what Objections I have met withall in the behalfe of it.</p>
            <p>The firſt Scripture-evidence I ſhall produce againſt it, is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.8.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117770:6"/>
               <hi>Woe unto them that joyne houſe to houſe, and that lay field to field, till there be no place left, that they may dwell alone in the midſt of the Earth. In mine eares ſaid the Lord of hoſts, Of a truth many houſes ſhall be deſolate, even great and faire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inhabitant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The place is plaine and pregnant; I ſhall forbear to gloſs upon it: Onely at the Event, we may give glory to God, and be his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that what he hath ſpoken with his mouth, he hath fulfilled with his hand. As, might I call all the Ancient men to witneſs, they were able to ſay, Where ever they knew any that did throw down Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and houſes of Husbandrie, to ſet up faire houſes for themſelves and theirs, and either They, or their Children, came not to poverty and want?</p>
            <p>See, in the next place, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.1. A <hi>Woe</hi> denounced againſt <hi>them that deviſe iniquity, and worke evil upon their beds, and when the morning is light they practiſe it, becauſe it is in the power of their hands.</hi> And what is the evil? Why, <hi>(verſ.</hi> 2.) <hi>They covet fields, and take them by violence; and houſes, and take them away: ſo they oppreſs a man and his houſe, even a man and his heritage.</hi> Therefore behold, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, the Lord comes in with his device: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold, againſt this Family do I deviſe an evil, from which you ſhall not remove your neckes, neither ſhall you goe haughtily; for this time is evil. In that day, they ſhall take up a parable againſt you, and lament with a doleful lamentation,</hi> (and truely ſo they do now-a-dayes) <hi>and ſay, We are utterly ſpoiled: for they have taken our fields.</hi> Now follows their judgement: <hi>Therefore thou ſhalt have none that ſhall caſt a cord by lot in the Congregation of the Lord.</hi> For the meaning whereof, whether it be, that for their Cruelty and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion they were to be cut off from the Aſſemblies of the godly in that time, or that in time of dividing their Inheritances they were to have no lot among their Brethren, or both theſe, I commend you to the godly learned to examine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Habakkuk</hi> likewiſe denounceth againſt this wickedneſs, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.9 10, 11. <hi>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetouſneſs to his houſe, that he may ſet his neſt on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil. Thou haſt coſulted ſhame to thy ſelf by cutting off many people, and haſt ſinned againſt thy ſoule. For

the ſtone ſhall cry out of the wall, and the beame out of the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhall anſwer it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many of theſe houſes have there been of late years, that were built by blood and cruelty, by Wracking of Rents, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing whole Townſhips and houſes of Husbandry!</p>
            <p>Thus we may ſee, by ſome few inſtances, the Lawes of God are againſt this ſin of <hi>Depopulation.</hi> Neither are the Lawes of the Land for it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in the fourth yeer of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, Chap. 19.</p>
            <p>Item, <hi>The King our Soveraign Lord having a ſingular Pleaſure, above all things, to avoid ſuch Enormities and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs as be hurtful and prejudicial to the Common-weal of this His Land, and His Subjects of the ſame, Remembreth, that, amongſt all other things, great Inconveniences daily do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, by Deſolation, and pulling down and wilful waſte of Houſes and Towns within this Realm, and laying to Paſture Lands which Cuſtomably have béen uſed in Tilth; whereby Idleneſs, which is the ground and beginning of all Miſchiefs, daily doth increaſe. For, where in ſome Towns two hundred perſons were occupied, and lived in their lawful Labours, now bin there occupied two or thrée Herds-men, and the reſidue fall into Idleneſs. Thereby, Husbandry, which is one of the greateſt Commodities of this Realm, is greatly decayed, Churches deſtroyed, the Service of God withdrawn, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and Curates wronged, the defence of this Land againſt our Enemies much féebled and impaired; to the great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, to the ſubverſion of the Policie and good Rules of this Land, if Remedy be not provided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore the King our Soveraign Lord, by the Advice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in the ſaid Parliament aſſembled, and by the Authority of the ſame, Have Ordained, Enacted, and Eſtabliſhed, that no perſon, of what Eſtate, Degrée, or Condition ſoever he be, that hath any Houſe or Houſes, that at any time within thrée yéers paſt, hath béen, or now is, or hereafter ſhall be letten to Farm, with twenty Acres at leaſt, or more, lying in Tillage and Husbandry, That the Owner or Owners of every ſuch Houſe, or Houſes and Land, to kéep, ſuſtain, and maintain Houſes and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117770:7"/>
upon the ſaid Ground or Land, convenient and neceſſary, for maintaining and upholding of the ſaid Tillage and Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So alſo in the Statute made <hi>anno</hi> 39 of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>An Act for the maintenance of Husbandry and Tillage,</hi> is the like proviſion made againſt Depopulation by Incloſure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo is to be found a Recital of ſeveral Laws (always ſome or other in force) from the 27 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8, until the 35 of Her Majeſties Reign, ordaining and requiring the Converſion and Continuance of a certain quantity and proportion of land for Tillage unalterably.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding this good and wholeſome proviſion of the Laws againſt this Evil, it hath by notable ſleights inſinuated and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it ſelf. And it may not be uſeleſs, but afford ſome content and ſatisfaction, to lay open the manner how Theſe kinde of Oppreſſors do work this their unnatural work, to diſplant Men, and place Sheep in their rooms; that ſo it may appear in its odiouſneſs to all that ſhall conſider the ſame; and that men may be aware of the beginnings of their Plots, and wicked Devices upon their beds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They will claim to be chief Lords of the Town which they mean to depopulate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They will alter the cuſtoms of the ſides of the fields, and hain that that was not wont to be hained, and alter ancient known Ways in the field.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They will go about to make new Field-Orders, overthrowing the old Field-Orders or Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They labour by fair means, with the common people, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their conſent for Incloſure; telling them, that for ſome little charge, their Living will be made three times as good as they are, for profit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They will ſay, Incloſure is a goodly thing; it ſtops many Strifes and Contentions, when men may have things by themſelves; it nouriſheth Wood in hedges, whereof there is great need; and keeps Sheep from rotting.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If by fair means and perſwaſions they cannot prevail, then they will commence a Suit in Law, and make the poor people dance attendance in ſome of the Courts, for many yeers together, as I have known, of my own knowledge. And then they will offer them large money, to buy them out: and if that take not, then on goes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117770:7"/>
the Suit; and a Decree is got out of Chancery, pretending ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs, and that men will not be ruled by any good Order.</p>
            <p>Some alſo have ſoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to pick a quarrel againſt men in the Law of their God, as for going from their Pariſh-Church, when they have no Sermon at home, or as good as none; and ſo vex them in the Chancellors-Court. But they are now down, and gone, bleſſed be God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They will ditch in their own Demeaſns, and ſo make the poor Commoners go about to their lands, to their great toil, and againſt their old Cuſtoms: and all this, to weary and tyre them out of their Poſſeſſions. They will alſo alleadge that their Demeaſns is too little for their Families, and that they would enlarge it: But, in truth, their mindes are too great for their means; and ſo at laſt they ſet up a fair Houſe, and overthrow many a Family.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Some have alſo laboured to entitle the King to their land, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cauſe.</p>
            <p>They will alſo make Coney-grees in ſome places, and let them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, that they may eat up the labours of poor men, to their great hinderance and diſcouragement at length.</p>
            <p>And thus, by theſe means, they ſeek to obtain their Ends.</p>
            <p>Now, in the next place, I ſhall give you my reaſons againſt this courſe of depopulating Incloſure; and endeavour to ſatisfie the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and Arguments that are made in behalf of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt, it appears to be highly diſhonourable to Almighty God; altering that Courſe and Order he appointed in Nature; who ſaid unto man, <hi>Grow, increaſe and multiply, repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it:</hi> which by theſe practices is prevented and obſtructed; Cattel being increaſed in ſtead of Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Likewiſe, hereby are overthrown many Churches and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of men, who, by holding up their hands to God, might pull down Bleſſings on a Nation, and divert Judgements therefrom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And where are the Souldiers in thoſe decayed Towns, the men that ſhould do their Country ſervice, and ſtand in the face of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my coming to invade? Where are the Horſes that many Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bred for the Service?</p>
            <p>But the evils that come to the Commonwealth, are more then can ſoon be reckoned, or eaſily expreſſed: for, in ſuch Towns that are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117770:8"/>
depopulated, the inhabitants are conſtrained to flee to other Towns, to their impoveriſhment. Neither do the Incloſers keep a houſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their eſtates; but many a Farmer ſpends as much as they. When theſe places were all Champion-Countries, many a ſhiver of Bread was given: but now, all ſuch Liberality is laid by, and a fair houſe is ſet up, with goodly Demeaſns; but no Hoſpitality at all.</p>
            <p>And, that I may not let it paſs, another Burden lieth upon the Commonwealth, and that is, That the High-ways, about ſuch places, are moſt intolerable, and, for the moſt part, unpaſſable; eſpecially in the Winter-time: for which, many a bitter oath is caſt out againſt them. And if the people ſo depopulated, ſhould be ſtrictly tied to mend the Ways, and repair the Church, it would be more then their poor means will afford, their Rents are ſo exceedingly inhanſed. And what reaſon can be rendered, that that Soil ſhould not pay as much to the State as ever before, as much to the Church as before, as much to the Poor, and keep as many people as ever it did? yet if they ſhould be compelled thereunto, they would get nothing by their Incloſure: for I dare boldly affirm, that never did any man get by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populating Incloſure, but he ſaved it out of the bodies of men, or by not keeping of Cattel according to the old proportions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a great increaſer of Idleneſs: for, when the Plow goes forward, the Old Saying is, <hi>The Plow-man's work is never at an end.</hi> But, in ſuch decayed Towns, they have very little to do: then they fall to a habit of Idleneſs, and ſo they turn to haunt Ale-houſes, to Adultery, and other Felonies, and deſtroying and waſting their Bodies, Eſtates, and Wits.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It increaſeth Uſurers, the Vipers of the Common-wealth, to eat out the bowels of it; ſo that free lending is for the moſt part taken away. And it hardens mens hearts one againſt another: for, they make their little Land into a Stock, and ſo they get to ſome Market-Town, and either turn Uſurers, Ale-houſe-keepers, or Maultſters, to the no-ſmall hurt of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It fills Market-townes with Husbandmens Children; who, becauſe they cannot take any Livings for reaſonable Fines, as before-time, do thruſt themſelves into ſuch Market-towns, and there uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Trades, ſuch as this Common-wealth hath no need of; to the great hurt of thoſe that be borne in that ſoile. And becauſe there
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117770:8"/>
is no Law to forbid men to remove, to dwell in Market-towns, they and their poſterity, being thruſt out from ſuch decayed places, and conſtrained to go where they can, reſort thither; to the great burthen of ſuch places.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And unhappy Experience ſhews, that Market-towns and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being ſo peſtered with people which are driven thither on heaps, onely that they might live, are thereby mainly expoſed to dangerous Infection, as of the Plague, and other Diſeaſes, and alſo to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Poverty. And if any Service be to be done for the State's Wars, then they have recourſe to thoſe places where men are; which places do not only finde Men, but alſo Furniture for ſuch men, to their great burden; the Soil wherein thoſe men were bred, in the mean time, finding neither Men nor Money.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is alſo the utter decay of Trading: For the Yeomen and Husbandmen, they lack all the Commodities the Tradeſmen have to ſell; Hats, Bands, Jurkins, Dublets, Points, Breeches, Stockings, Garters, Shooes, and all other neceſſaries: Iron-work for Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheels, and for Harrowes, and Plowes, and all other neceſſaries that they know full well. All which things ſet men on work, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tradeſmen, who maintaine Londoners, and ſo Merchants, and ſo to the Higheſt and Beſt of men. But the Depopulating-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſer overthrows all at once, and lives either in <hi>London,</hi> or in ſome City, or Town Corporate, and gets heapes of money, though all in vaine; they, or the moſt part of them having it with a witneſs, to their utter overthrow and ruine; for, I never ſaw any of them, but ſome remarkable hand of God followed them. Oh that it might feare men from ſuch cruel courſes!</p>
            <p n="7">7. Depopulating Incloſure doth not onely drive out men from ſuch places, but it makes them poor that live there: The houſes, for want of ſtraw, do drop down; ſo that there is no comfortable dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Poore: the richer ſort are gone away, the poorer ſort are cruelly handled: For, there is ſome Bailiff ſet over them, that is like to the Fuller that dreſſeth Northern Cloth; they do ſo wrack them, and ſtraine them, that at length they break their hearts. Theſe Bailiffs are ſomething like to the Task-maſters of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexed the poor <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> And the Landlord (being abſent from them) dwelling at <hi>London,</hi> or elſewhere, little condoles their miſery; ſo that theſe poor Tennants know not to whom to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117770:9"/>
Beſides, they do raiſe things to ſo great a rate, that men know not whither to go in this Land to eaſe their grief unleſs, with their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſighs and teares, to Almighty God, who no doubt will heare their complaints. <hi>Now for the oppreſſion of the poore, and ſighing of the needy, I will up, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It doth mightily impoveriſh and oppreſs other Towns that are not Depopulate: For, they that are driven out elſewhere, do preſs into ſuch towns, and erect Cottages. This, if you ask, you ſhall finde, that every Town is mightily increaſed with poor people, ſo as there are not houſes to be taken for reaſonable money, that have any Land belonging unto them. But the breed of man-kind increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the great ones thruſting them thus on heapes, men are driven to live wonderful hardly; ſo that if the State ſhould want Souldiers, ſtrong and able men, there are very few to be had in ſuch decayed Townes.</p>
            <p>Now it followes that I ſhould anſwer ſome of their Objections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their maine Objection is, That the benefit of Incloſure is great, and doth countervaile all that can be ſaid againſt it. Where before it is ſaid it nouriſheth Idleneſs; They ſay, that many ſheep are kept on ſuch grounds ſo incloſed, the wool whereof doth ſerve to ſet many poor on work; and ſo it doth much good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, they are ſet on work; but what have they for their work? and how is their work able to maintaine them and theirs? and what can they lay up for their Poſterity? and how many ſtrong and able Souldiers doth ſuch labour maintain for the States ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? how hardly do they fare? how bare do they go? and much a-do to live in plentiful yeares. But if a dear yeer come, how are they pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtarved! Or if the Clothier have not ſale for his Cloth, and be conſtrained to ſell at lowe Rates, then come they upon the Poor with Abatement, which utterly overthrows them: ſo that, at ſuch a time, the Labours of the Poor will not neer maintain them. And herein, by the way, the gatherers of the Labours of the Poor are like the Task-maſters, that exact more and more upon them. And when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did you ſee any, out of their mean and meer Labour, marry their Children, and provide for their Poſterity, in a comfortable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Object.</hi> It nouriſheth Wood, which the Country hath great need of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:117770:9"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the which I anſwer, That firſt of all, for the moſt part, they deſtroy all the great Elms and Oaks about ſuch Towns. It is true, they plant Hedge-wood, which, in the age of a Man comes to have ſome bigneſs to be ſold; but by that time their Mounds be ſerved, and Hedges fenced, there comes little to a Common uſe, but moſt goes for Repairs: and before they come to defend themſelves, they take up much wood to preſerve them; ſo that the Commonwealth hath no benefit hereby.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Object.</hi> It keeps Sheep from rotting: and they are better kept in Paſture-grounds, then they were wont to be in Common-fields, and yeeld more profit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt, I anſwer, They may as well, by digging and trenching, be preſerved in Common-fields, as in Paſture-grounds, if men would be orderly; which they ſhould be tied unto by Law, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by their Janglings deſtroy Houſes and Towns, and ſubvert a Kingdom and Nation.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of the third Objection, is, <hi>They are better kept, and yeeld more profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs that is true, they are better kept; for they keep fewer then in Common-fields they do: But if they kept as many Cattel as were kept before ſuch Depopulations, the Grounds would not bear it. It is obſerved by many, (which I confeſs I cannot ſhew the reaſon of) that a Lordſhip incloſed will keep nothing neer ſo many, no, not by the half, (being, I ſay, incloſed and depopulated) either Horſe, Beaſts, and Sheep, or Men, Women, and Children, as it was wont to do, before ſuch Incloſure and Depopulation; beſides all the Corn they brought to the Markets. So that it is to me manifeſt, that there is ſome ſecret hand of God in it, whereby he ſhews his diſlike of ſuch Depopulation. Many a father hath lived comfortably and well with the tenth part of what the ſon hath had; yet the ſon could not live of it. If you mark it, they keep no Houſes, many of them; but run in debt, and, many times, are not able to pay. Yet there is no man that taketh warning by theſe Examples, neither will they ſee the high hand of God upon them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Object.</hi> But you ſee Corn as cheap, many times, ſince ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populating Incloſure, as it hath been before-time; and what need is there then of ſo many Open fields?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer: God hath ſometimes bleſſed the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117770:10"/>
earth with abundance, to ſhew, that he can make a little, by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to be an abundant ſtore, and ſo to be cheap: but no thank to ſuch Depopulators.</p>
            <p>But will you know a further Reaſon? It is, becauſe much Land is laid down from a Common uſe, and Men are much diminiſhed in ſuch depopulated places, and Cattel are much abated, and become fewer then have been in former times. For, if there were Men to ſpend it, and Cattel, Swine, and Pullen proportionable to former times, much Corn would be ſpent that way, which is now ſaved. Much Corn would be for Seed, which now is not uſed. Horſes might be better kept, which ſhould be for Service: and Store would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, againſt a time of Dearth. Mankinde, the beſt of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, would be nouriſhed and bred up ſtronger, and able to do more ſervice to God and their Country, and have in their hand to lay up for their Poſterity. But, if you do but take notice of it, you ſhall ſee thoſe Houſe-keepers that of old uſed to buy a Strike of Corn, do now buy a Loaf or two of Bread. People are not kept in heart; they are famiſhed in many places, and are ſo pinched with Poverty, that it would grive the heart of man to ſee: neither have they any thing about them, but live poor and meanly. And as for works of Mercy, and for the maintenance of the Worſhip of God, they have not any thing to contribute; no, not to pay for the education of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. So then, the laying down of Land, is the diminiſhing of Men and Cattel; and that is the cauſe of cheapneſs of Corn in plentiful times.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Object.</hi> I, but ſuch Incloſers will plow up their Paſture-grounds when Corn is dear, and ſo bring in Plenty. When the Land hath gotten ſtrength, they will take out that ſtrength; and ſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſer doth good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Anſwer to which, is: There lieth a great Myſtery; but I will tell you mine opinion, That the Corn ſo increaſed, turneth to no good to the Common-wealth. Firſt, when the Land is laid down, it is a good ſpace of time before it turn to be a good Sward; which is a hurt to the Common-wealth. Then they will break it up: But obſerve, they will keep no conſtant houſes of Husbandry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; but take the heart out of the Land, and lay it down again: So that the time before it gather heart, and the time after it is laid down, it is no way ſo profitable for a Common good. But the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117770:10"/>
or Husbandman that keepeth a conſtant Family upon his Land, doth till it; and when it groweth out of heart, doth fetch it in again: and it never lieth ſtill, but one yeer in four, for the better husbandry of it; which fourth yeer will (by Gods bleſſing) bring a double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Then again, the Gentleman ſells his Corn at dear rates, dearer then the Husbandman: for he can give ſome time with his Corn; and ſo wrap in the poor Husbandman, that in haſte he cannot get out. The poor man ſelleth for his need, to buy neceſſaries; and, moſt commonly, ſelleth ſix pence in a Strike cheaper then the Gentleman doth. So that when the Yeoman ſhould make his profit at Seed-time, he cannot ſell his Corn; the Country is ſupplied with one that keeps no conſtant Husbandry.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Object.</hi> The ſixth Objection is, That Ditches do preſerve Corn from ſpoiling by paſſengers that travel upon the way: and therefore it is good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then might they ditch from the Way onely, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into ſmaller parcels; and ditch alſo in ſuch places where there are ſtones to make good ſuch High-ways, and not in deep Clay-Countries, where to incloſe, is to bring High-ways to ſuch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous paſſage, that no man can paſſe, without danger both of horſe and man (at leaſt, to the great annoyance of both) many having periſhed of late yeers thereby. And beſides all this, the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing of Lands before ſhewed, ſhews mens intent. Thus have I endeavoured to anſwer the moſt of their Objections, as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I, but it will be demanded, Will you ſay that Incloſures in all places are unlawful? We ſee, that ſuch Countries where there are ſuch Incloſures, are the richeſt of all.</p>
            <p>Let me not be miſtaken: I ſay, and ſhall prove, that all Incloſures wherein is Depopulation, and thruſting out of poor men from their dwellings, or making their dwellings uncomfortable to them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one fair Houſe is ſet up, by the throwing down of many Houſholds, is utterly unlawful, both by the Law of God, and this Land; and is one of the Crying ſins of our Time. And if in any Country this be practiſed, it is the overthrow of that Country, as hereafter will more appear.</p>
            <p>Now therefore I beſeech you all, that are the ancient Yeomen and Husbandmen of every County, declare your experiences of the evil
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117770:11"/>
of Depopulation, and overthrowing of houſes of Husbandry; and what you have ſeen, and what hath befallen thoſe that have been actors in it, and the evils that have come of it, and the preſſure and burden that hath come upon thoſe Towns that have not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, by the means of thoſe that have been incloſed, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Common uſe. Oh that in all the Counties of this Kingdom, there might be a View of all the Villages, and Towns, and Houſes of Husbandry, that have been decayed within theſe fifty yeers, and the Deſolation that hath come by that means, by laying of Lands accuſtomed to Tillage, and now turned into Paſture-grounds; whereby Idleneſs, one of the ſins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> is much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, Men women, and children, and their Progenies be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Husbandry, the greateſt Commodity of the Land (for the ſuſtenance of Man) is decayed, Churches be deſtroyed, the ſervice of God is withdrawn, Cities and Market-towns be brought to great ruine and decay, Neceſſaries for mans uſe and ſuſtenance be made ſcarce and dear, the people of this Common-wealth be ſore miniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the power and defence thereof is enfeebled and decayed; to the high diſpleaſure of God, and againſt his Laws; and to the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Common-wealth, and deſolation of the ſame. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and for the redreſs thereof, there have been good Laws made in Parliament, in former times, for the repreſſing of theſe Diſorders, but never put in execution in my time; whereby this Oppreſſion and Deſolation is very uſual and common. Yea, ſo bold are they grown, that now in Parliament-time, which we thought ſhould have been a time of Eaſing of Burdens, this Monſter none dares to attempt. Oh that our preſent Parliament might be of the number of them that <hi>build the old waſte places,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 58.12.</note> and <hi>raiſe up the foundations of many generations;</hi> that they might <hi>be called, The Repairers of the breach, and the Reſtorers of places to dwell in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, you the Yeomen and Husbandmen of all Counties, ſhould humbly petition to the honourable Houſe of Parliament, (now that they intend the Reformation of things amiſs) that they, amongſt their great affairs of this diſtracted Nation, would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to look upon this Horrible, Oppreſſing, Deſolating, Crying ſin, which (no doubt) amongſt and above moſt other is one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt nature, and worſt conſequence, which God himſelf hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>deviſe an evil againſt;</hi> as more at large ſhall appear, God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117770:11"/>
willing. And to the end it may appear in its colours, I pray you take ſome paines to let the State know, how many men, women, and children; horſe, beaſt, and ſheep, ſwine, and pullen, have been uſually maintained upon ſuch Villages, and Towns, and Houſes of Husbandry now decayed: which, by proportion you may know, counting how many Plow-land there where, and how many do uſually go with a Plow: That ſo, the number being gueſſed at the Parliament may ſee the mighty decay there hath been and is in this Land; that their hearts may be wrought upon. And you may, and ought to complain; for there is none that can better tell where the ſhooe pincheth, then thoſe that weare it. And they are your mouthes in Parliament, the higheſt Court of Juſtice in the Land; who ought to ſeek your good, and keep you from Tyranny, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. And if by this lawful meanes you can finde no redreſs, do not Murmure, nor Muteny againſt God or them: But ſilently ſit down, and waite upon God; who hath promiſed, <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poor, and the ſighing of the needy, he will ariſe, and ſet at liberty thoſe whom the wicked have ſnared.</hi> For,<note place="margin">Pſal. 12.5.</note> be you well aſſured, that if help come not by theſe lawful meanes and wayes, God will ſend help and deliverance another way. And then, let thoſe Oppreſſours, with their houſes and poſterity, look to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poor, and violent pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of jugdment and juſtice in a Province,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccle. 5.8.</note> 
               <hi>marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher then the higheſt, regardeth; and there be higher then they. Moreover,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> 
               <hi>the profit of the earth is for all: the King himſelf is ſerved by the field</hi> that is tilled.</p>
            <p>Yet through the extream wickedneſs of man, who hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the courſe of Almighty God; the inferiour creature comes to be preferred above man; who is made after the Image of God: Which is a ſin of a very high nature; all the Prophets crying out of it, and denouncing fearful woes againſt it. For God tenders the good of his people now, as well as ever he did before-time. He calls <hi>the houſe of Iſrael his Vineyard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 5.7.</note> 
               <hi>and the men of Judah his pleaſant plant: he looked for judgment, but behold oppreſſion; for righteouſneſs, but behold a cry.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 59.14, 15.</note> And is it not ſo in our dayes? And as then the Lord did (by his Prophet)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117770:12"/>
denounce woes againſt the oppreſſion of thoſe times, even ſo doth he now againſt all the oppreſſions of theſe times: for the righteous Lord hates and abhorres all manner of Violence, Cruelty, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as much now, as ever he did.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, God would have men <hi>grow, increaſe and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it:</hi> But the Oppreſſors of our times do what in them lieth to diminiſh men, women, and children, by whom God is honoured, and the Common-wealth ſuſtained.<note place="margin">Iſa. 3.13, 14, 15.</note> And therfore, <hi>The Lord is riſen up, and ſtandeth to plead for his people, and to judge their cauſe. He will enter into judgment with the ancients of the people, and the Princes thereof: for they have eaten up the Vineyard; and the ſpoile of the poor is in their houſes.</hi> And the Lord will know what they mean, in dealing ſo with his people. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15, <hi>What mean ye, that ye beat my people to peeces, and grinde the faces of the poor, ſaith the Lord of hoſts?</hi> Much like to the times wherein we live.<note place="margin">Ier. 2.34.</note> 
               <hi>Alſo, in her skirts is found the blood of the ſoules of the poore Innocents:</hi> Looke to the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Lament. 4.12, 13.</note>
               <hi>The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adverſary and the enemy ſhould have entered into the gates of Jeruſalem.</hi> Yet, <hi>For the ſinnes of the Prophets, and the iniquities of the Prieſts, that have ſhed the blood of the juſt in the midſt of her,</hi> it was done.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let none of us make to our ſelves any vain confidences, or put our truſt in any arme of fleſh, or the ſtrongeſt Fortifications that can be made by any of the ſonnes of men: For <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a famous City, and very ſtrongly fortified; ſo that it would hardly have been believed, that that ſhould have befallen it, that did. But we ſee (as aforeſaid) that, <hi>for the ſinnes of the Prophets, and for the iniquities of the Prieſts,</hi> the Lord laid it waſte.
