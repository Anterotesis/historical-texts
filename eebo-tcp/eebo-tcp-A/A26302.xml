            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith as many faces, and as much pain as ever tooth was drawn, I made ſhift a while ago to wade through a moſt vile and dirty <hi>pamphlet</hi> of yours with this Title: <hi>A Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Dr.</hi> Robert Wild <hi>upon occaſion of his Majesties Declaration for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, together with his</hi> Poetica Licentia,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50949:3"/>
&amp;c. Which <hi>pamphlet</hi> I found all the way pretending to moſt extraordinary joy and thanks; but of ſuch a witleſs and ſlovenly kind, that could his <hi>Majeſty</hi> have poſſibly imagined that his Clemency could have been ſo ſaucily abuſed, and his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo naſtily and <hi>Sirreverentially</hi> received, moſt certainly <hi>Robert</hi> had been as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly excepted from the benefit of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> as <hi>Hugh</hi> and ſome others were, from the <hi>Act of Oblivion.</hi> And my buſineſs, Dr. at preſent is only to acquaint you, that though <hi>Poetica Licentia</hi> jingles very prettily with <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> yet that <hi>Poetiea</hi> is never Latin for <hi>Conſcience,</hi> nor <hi>Licentia</hi> for any ſuch <hi>ill manners</hi> as you at large ſhew, both in your <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Poem.</hi> And that I may in your own ſtile convey my meaning the eaſier into your belly, I am to tell you, that when you went about to confound the one with the other, you were as abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken, as he that took a <hi>gliſter pipe</hi> for a <hi>flageolet,</hi> or the <hi>inteſtinum rectum</hi> for the <hi>great artery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the firſt place I obſerve, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50949:3"/>
before you ſignifie your receiving the news of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> you would fain delude the <hi>friend</hi> you write to, into a fit of laughter; by the mere dull jeſt of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that <hi>you are a merry fellow.</hi> For when you go about to tickle him up to a belief of it, with ſuch deadly old and ſmall provocations as of <hi>hanging your harp upon the Willows and ſinging</hi> lachrymae, <hi>in ſtead of the ſongs of</hi> Sion; <hi>of laughing at a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially,</hi> O eſpecially <hi>if it be upon a fools cap; of being as merry as the old ſect of Crickets, though after a baking,</hi> yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily though after a baking; <hi>or as the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney men themſelves, who are a new ſect of Crickets,</hi> at ſome certain times of the year; nay, though for the better diſguiſe you ſplit an ancient abuſe, and call the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Briſtol, Cock</hi> in one line, and <hi>comb</hi> in another; yet I durſt boldly ſay that if your <hi>friend</hi> has but the leaſt ſhare of wit, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſenſe of conſcience, he can no more laugh at ſuch overworn and tatter'd ſtuff, than if he ſhould find his houſe all in flames, and his Wife and Children hung up in ſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50949:4"/>
And as thou ſetteſt forth with ſuch a nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlineſs of wit, that it is great impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in thee to preſume, that the moſt eaſy of thy <hi>Non-conforming friends</hi> ſhould ſmile at it: ſo thou as ſaucily proceedeſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the grave and ſolemn <hi>Muſick</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> to a <hi>whiſtle, bagpipe</hi> and <hi>jewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trump.</hi> Which, if thou hadſt done with wit anſwerable to its inſolence, much time and long repentance might perhaps have brought thee off: but to ſay that <hi>the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtling of a bodies-maker is every whit as good and elevating as a</hi> Salisbury <hi>Anthem,</hi> and that <hi>a bag-pipe does far excel the Organ at</hi> Hackney, and to give no better reaſon but only that thy <hi>ſowſes</hi> are not made of <hi>ſilk,</hi> is ſo very rude and unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that ſeeing thou wert not <hi>excepted,</hi> thou doſt now deſerve to be <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated</hi> out of the <hi>Toleration</hi> it ſelf. For let us a little conſider, Doctor; is there not an <hi>Organ</hi> in the <hi>Kings</hi> Chappel, as well as at <hi>Hackney?</hi> and are not <hi>Anthems</hi> ſung there, as well as at <hi>Salisbury?</hi> and has not his <hi>Majeſty</hi> told thee in his <hi>Declaration,</hi> that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50949:4"/>
'tis his expreſs reſolution and intention that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> be preſerv'd in its <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Government:</hi> and whoever preaches <hi>ſeditiouſly</hi> or to the <hi>dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> thereof, muſt expect ſeverely to be puniſhed? Suppoſe ſuch a thing as this ſhould be objected to thee: I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thou haſt nothing in the world to ſay, but only what thou would'ſt have impoſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d upon thy <hi>friend</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Robin</hi> is a <hi>merry fellow,</hi> an abſolute <hi>Cricket,</hi> a meer <hi>wagg,</hi> a <hi>droole</hi> and a moſt accurate ſplitter of a <hi>prelatical Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb.</hi> But, thou that pretendeſt to daunce on the <hi>high rope,</hi> to ſoar aloft, and clip Clouds, thou muſt not cheat thy ſelf and think that ſuch <hi>crawling bumours</hi> as theſe will excuſe thy rudeneſs. For although his <hi>Majeſty</hi> of tenderneſs and compaſſion to ſuch <hi>weakly ſubjects</hi> as thy ſelf, has grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly condeſcended, that anſwerably to your ſtile and matter, you ſhould be indulged either the liberty of a pair of <hi>tongs,</hi> to play you to perch upon a <hi>Plum-tree,</hi> and from thence to diſtribute; or to be ſqueak'd up
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50949:5"/>
the Hay-loſt with a <hi>comb</hi> and <hi>paper,</hi> and there to float and ſpread it over a <hi>beame;</hi> yet I ſuppoſe he never did deſign to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Muſicians</hi> of his <hi>Chappel,</hi> either to <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Devil,</hi> in compliance with thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant advice from the two D's, nor to ſend for thy <hi>blind Piper, jews-trumper</hi> or <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring bodies-maker,</hi> to whiſtle up his <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Chaplains</hi> when they preach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: upon my word, Dr. Robert Wild, if one of you three will but read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Declaration,</hi> you will find you are all moſt vilely miſtaken.</p>
            <p>The ſmall feather'd and cricket-like <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> being thus finiſhed, and the <hi>Doctor</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made therewith no creature in the world merry, beſides himſelf: it is high time for him now to leave the <hi>frying pan,</hi> and the <hi>four herrings,</hi> and to attend the <hi>Poſt-boy,</hi> who blew his <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>Toleration.</hi> But why in ſuch haſt, good <hi>Doctor?</hi> what, liſten to a <hi>Horn</hi> before the orthodox exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of eating and drinking? eſpecially at an hour when the <hi>maw ſtretches and yawns,</hi> and makes humble requeſt for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals?
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50949:5"/>
how, ſo cruel as to forſake four penſive diſconſolate herrings; when your own conſcience flew on your face, and told you that they had lately been in very great diſtreſs, and in as ſad a <hi>pickle</hi> as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet the week before? How ſo careleſs of your <hi>family,</hi> as to give over your <hi>wife</hi> and <hi>maid</hi> to the cruelty of four hiſſing ſputter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outragious <hi>Herrings?</hi> Suppoſe one of the ſtouteſt and diſcontented of them had made a <hi>violent digreſſion</hi> out of the <hi>frying pan,</hi> and ſtruck up you <hi>maids</hi> heels, and in your abſence had ſwallowed your <hi>wife,</hi> head, ſhoulders and all. (As the great <hi>Pike</hi> at <hi>Boſco,</hi> that on a ſudden ran away from the <hi>Pound</hi> and his <hi>Keepers,</hi> and in a trice devoured a whole flock of <hi>Sheep.)</hi> Suppoſe, I ſay, any ſuch calamity had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the <hi>family</hi> by your neglect: would it not have prick'd you ſorely to have left the houſe in ſuch tumult and diſorder? I, I, you, you are the men that have got the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of the whole <hi>Nation:</hi> that pretend to ſuch curioſity and neatneſs of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and yet make nothing to leave
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50949:6"/>
a poor helpleſs wife and but one maid to the fury and inſolence of four diſſatisfied and devouring <hi>Herrings:</hi> and only upon that quibling pretence, forſooth, that <hi>you had other fiſh to fry.</hi> Come come, <hi>Doctor,</hi> deceive not your ſelf with ſuch looſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. You may pretend to as much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of <hi>Conſcience</hi> as you will; but I am afraid that if you had had four <hi>Cormorants,</hi> or four <hi>Eagles</hi> for dinner, the caſe would have been the ſame; for you would either have had other <hi>Birds</hi> to look after, or other <hi>Fiſh to fry,</hi> or ſome ſuch <hi>Conſcience-palliating excuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall leave you to conſider of this unanſwerable neglect at your Leiſure: and we'll go on, if you pleaſe, to the very <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> it ſelf. But before we read it, that our joy may be gradual and ſolemn; and that not the leaſt expreſſion of thanks and mirth may be wanting to ſo great an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, let us <hi>droll, flaſh,</hi> and be a little <hi>phanſiful</hi> upon the very <hi>paper</hi> it ſelf: which being <hi>clipt</hi> for the better lying in the <hi>Letter,</hi> affords four abſolute new merry conceits.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50949:6"/>
Firſt, the <hi>Declaration</hi> thus ſhorn is like a <hi>Round-head:</hi> the reaſon of that is plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>Aquarius.</hi> Secondly, 'tis like an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam Divine:</hi> that alſo is as plain becauſe of <hi>Sagittarius.</hi> Thirdly, 'tis like an <hi>officiating Friar;</hi> upon the accompt of the <hi>Bulls right Eye.</hi> Fourthly, 'tis unlike <hi>clipping of money;</hi> upon ſome other accompt.</p>
            <p>Having thus bedabbld the outſide of the <hi>Declaration</hi> with four ſuch dewy delicate <hi>phanſies:</hi> now, Dr, we'll ſet on, and fall to reading. But not rudely and unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyedly, but with that ſhort <hi>ejaculation of</hi> S. Paul, <hi>S.</hi> George <hi>for</hi> England. Or as one of the <hi>Latins</hi> renders it, <hi>Cynthius aurem vellit, Epheſians</hi> the 5th and the 4th And the <hi>Grace</hi> being ended, we venture now upon the <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Book. His Majeſties De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to all his Loving Subjects, March</hi> 15. 1671/2. <q>What, to all his Loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? this is joy indeed! However I am ſure his Majeſty means me in a moſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner: for I have a ſoul as white and ſpotleſs towards the <hi>King,</hi> as any Lawn in <hi>England;</hi> and I do and will love the <hi>King</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50949:7"/>

            <p>The <hi>date</hi> of the <hi>Declaration</hi> being thus ſufficiently wondered at: in the next place we proceed to the great benefits and advantages of this <hi>Liberty of Conſcience:</hi> which are of ſuch a kind, that neither <hi>King</hi> nor <hi>Council</hi> could poſſibly ever gheſs at, or hope for. For whereas his <hi>Majesty</hi> expects nothing elſe, but that ſilly ſtubborn people may hereby perceive their folly and error, and in time be reduced to a ſober mind, and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> holds forth, and declares that this ſame <hi>Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (if rightly underſtood) notwithſtanding it came out in the bluſtering Month of <hi>March,</hi> will have ſuch a vaſt influence and power over <hi>Holland,</hi> that all the <hi>fiſh</hi> now at <hi>Amſterdam (excepting the ſmall fry)</hi> will forth with skip out of the water, and run all away to <hi>London:</hi> and that now, upon <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> 'twill be as common a thing to meet with <hi>Carp, Pike, Tench,</hi> and <hi>Eel</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And now we are talking of <hi>Ponds</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> of <hi>Prelates, Presbyterians, Opinion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi> and <hi>Fiſh:</hi> and there being a certain <hi>River</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> call'd <hi>Trent,</hi> affording on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſmall quibble (as ſmall as the remaining <hi>fry at Amſterdam)</hi> it may be not amiſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that of all waters the <hi>Papiſts</hi> delight moſt in <hi>Trent.</hi> For take a <hi>Papiſt</hi> and tye him head and heels together, and fling him with a good luſty ſtone about his neck into the <hi>Thames</hi> or any other <hi>River,</hi> beſides <hi>Trent;</hi> and he preſently ſinks to the bottom, lies ſullenly there, and will not feed nor fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten himſelf at all.

            </p>
            <p>Thus far, Dr, you are very aery, ſmooth and delightful; but, in my opinion, towards the latter end of this Section, you are a little too deep and ſomewhat reſerv'd. Where you leave <hi>frying</hi> of <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and fall to telling the <hi>Pope,</hi> what a great loſs he had (upon the <hi>Reformation)</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Shambles, of the Engliſh Muttons</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Veals:</hi> and of the <hi>luſty chines of noble Fornicators,</hi> which he us'd to torture, as ſeverely, as when they fell into the <hi>cruel clutches of King Lues or Morbus Gallicus.</hi> Now, Dr, that which I am horribly puzl'd at, is this ſame <hi>King Lues.</hi> For ſearching very carefully my <hi>French Hiſtory,</hi> I can hear no more news of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50949:10"/>
any <hi>King Lues,</hi> than <hi>of King Scorbutus,</hi> or <hi>King Catarrhus.</hi> If you had committed theſe ſame <hi>Fornicationers</hi> into the <hi>clutches</hi> of <hi>King Pharamond, King Dagobert,</hi> or <hi>King Pippin;</hi> I had almoſt underſtood you: for, I know, that any of thoſe would have <hi>claw'd</hi> the rogues away: eſpecially <hi>King Pippin,</hi> for a certain reaſon that I know: which I ſhall not now ſtand to tell you, but inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of tell you a ſhort ſtory out of one of your own <hi>Claſſical Authors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a man in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> who being to be tryed for his life, was asked by the <hi>Recorder</hi> his name; who anſwered <hi>Spillman.</hi> Say you ſo, quoth the <hi>Recorder, Spillman?</hi> 'twill go hard with you, upon my word, friend: for take away <hi>S.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50949:10"/>
no witneſſes in the caſe: he's a born <hi>Rogue,</hi> for his name has hang'd him.</p>
            <p>'Tis good thus far; but what follows is much better and as <hi>Claſſical.</hi> A while after there came one to be tryed before the <hi>Maior,</hi> who having learn'd of the <hi>Recorder,</hi> how to hang in his abſence, asked the <hi>fellow</hi> his name; who anſwered <hi>Wilſon.</hi> How now, <hi>Sirrah!

            <p>And let thus much ſerve for <hi>King Lues.</hi> Now we go to the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s <hi>Pariſh:</hi> upon whom he has two admirable remarks.

               <hi>Scholar</hi> that put that handſom abuſe upon Mr. <hi>Eaton,</hi> had got a <hi>fluſh</hi> from ſome ſuch <hi>inſpiring Soupe:</hi> for he being at Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi>'s houſe, where there was a <hi>Gooſe</hi> for <hi>dinner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi> asked him if he would not <hi>eat</hi> ſome gooſe.

            <p>And now Dr, I have very little more to ſay to your <hi>Letter;</hi> only <hi>I</hi> cannot but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le delight my ſelf to ſee what great pains you take to excuſe your ſelf to your grave friend for being ſo <hi>merry</hi> and <hi>witty.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I'll undertake to fetch an ordinary <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terman,</hi> and the <hi>Rogue</hi> ſhall not be aſſiſted at all with any extraordinary <hi>fluſh;</hi> who (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide your <hi>Lachrymae, aduſum Sarum,</hi> and two or three ſuch <hi>Latin</hi> ſmallneſſes) ſhall void as many paſſing and luſty jeſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Temple-ſtairs</hi> and <hi>Westminster</hi> as are to be found in your whole <hi>Letter:</hi> and I'll

Truly, Dr, although <hi>all the world</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>is ſo very big with jeſt,</hi> yet this won't at all ſerve your turn, neither muſt you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect to ſee your intolerable dullneſs excus'd, by ſaying that <hi>we Nonconformists</hi>

               <p>This Muſe of mine is both the moſt waggiſh, and moſt argumentative Stit, that I ever met withall in my whole life. Six ſuch keen and compacted lines as theſe, ſhall moſt effectually keep out the <hi>Pope;</hi> when he ſhall make nothing to lean over a thouſand dull

pages of your learned <hi>Chillingſworths, grave Stilling fleets,</hi> and <hi>Tillotſons.</hi> For moſt plain it is, and moſt demonſtrative, that ſo long as the <hi>Pope</hi> continues to be a <hi>Camel,</hi> he can never with his <hi>Supremacy-bunch</hi> get into the low and narrow gate of <hi>Reformation.</hi> In like manner ſo long as we keep to our <hi>Bibles,</hi> and neglect not to paint <hi>Popes faces;</hi> plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and largely upon our <hi>bearded juggs;</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> will be hang'd a thouſand times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, before ever he'll come hither, to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo apparently vilified and affronted.

I ſay once again, (and I wiſh it would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the hearts of all cowardly and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Church-men)</hi> that if his <hi>Majesty</hi> will be pleaſed not to confine me to <hi>ſet forms</hi> and <hi>faſhions,</hi> but ſtill to allow me the free me of my whole <hi>Bible;</hi> and that <hi>Coſtive Saturn</hi> does not ſeiſe upon my <hi>fundament,</hi> and bung up thoſe <hi>hindmoſt faculties,</hi> if ever <hi>Popery</hi> get one inch further into <hi>England,</hi> let not <hi>Officious Robin</hi> ever go to <hi>ſtool</hi> again.</p>

Beſides, this Biſhop Gout makes your body his Dioceſs; and there he keeps Courts,</hi> and there he has a <hi>viſitation</hi> for every <hi>Limb;</hi> and urges every <hi>Joint</hi> to <hi>conform,</hi> &amp; thoſe that will not, he <hi>articles</hi> againſt And when the <hi>Gout</hi> is in the <hi>hand,</hi> then my <hi>Lord Gout</hi> has you in <hi>hand,</hi> and when 'tis in your <hi>toes,</hi> he has you by the <hi>toes.</hi> And now, can you and your friends think this <hi>Wit?</hi> don't you fear every day that you riſe, that his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> ſhould call in again his <hi>Mandate,</hi> and ſend for that ſame <hi>Doctorſhip</hi> he gave thee, and beſtow it upon ſome honeſt merry <hi>Porter?</hi> And laſtly, as for thy famous <hi>Iter Boreale</hi> it ſelf: I know it was much bought up, and read by many. But don't gull your ſelf, Dr; for it was not becauſe there was any good <hi>humour, wit</hi> or <hi>Poetry</hi> in it; but becauſe any thing upon that Subject would have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, after ſuch ſad and diſmal times. Nay, ſo it was that the very word <hi>King</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50949:22"/>
us ſo great a <hi>rarity,</hi> that he that could but get into a <hi>verſe, God ſave the King,</hi> or the like, ſhould be as much flock'd about, as if he were the Author of that famous diſtichupon the louvre.</p>
               <p>And I muſt tell you beſides, Dr, that though our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was wonderfully glad to hear of his <hi>Majeſty</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtor'd; yet ſuch as could receive ſuch <hi>wellcome news,</hi> without loſing their <hi>ſenſes,</hi> did at that very time, look upon all that <hi>poem</hi> to be very ſad, and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So that the whole of the matter, Dr, is come to this: if you do ſtubbornly perſiſt in the opinion of your having now, or ever having any <hi>wit</hi> at all; and that you do reſolve to continue this vile trade of <hi>rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming;</hi> then do it <hi>decently</hi> and <hi>becomingly:</hi> and lay aſide your <hi>Doctorſhip,</hi> your <hi>Gown,</hi> your <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>your looking gravely,</hi> and do you and your <hi>Bodies-maker</hi> ſet up under St. <hi>Andrews</hi> wall, and there <hi>practiſe</hi> upon your own <hi>works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould now, Dr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſay a word or two to your <hi>friends</hi> of the <hi>Toleration:</hi> but I ſuppoſe it would be needleſs, becauſe by what I have already ſaid to your ſelf, they'l fully comprehend your worth, and perceive howmuch they undervalue and diſparage <hi>themſelves,</hi> by continuing any further acquaintancewith <hi>you.</hi> And I hope they'l nowſee 'tis high time, not only to baniſh from their <hi>houſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>company,</hi> ſuch a <hi>baudy, profane, naſty</hi> and <hi>witleſs ſcribler,</hi> but not ſuffer thee ever to ſay ſo much again, as <hi>We Nonconformiſts.</hi> And, if any of them have a longing deſire to ſee the <hi>little gridiron of England,</hi> and the <hi>huge frying pan of Rome</hi> utterly thrown down, I hope alſo that they'l think it their <hi>concern</hi> and <hi>intereſt,</hi> not to truſt to ſuch a Ballad-maker as thy ſelf, to take the Beaſt by the Horns. <hi>Faremell.</hi>
