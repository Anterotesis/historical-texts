         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sirs,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have cauſe to think that your unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Confidence of the Truth and
Goodneſs of your own Way, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the beſt men that differ from
you, and the ſcornful entertainment the beſt
Endeavours of men have met with, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you of Error, and Miſtake; have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
many of thoſe from attempting it,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95744:3"/>
who are beſt able herein to ſerve you. But my
Love to your Souls, and Deſires of recovering
you to a ſound mind, being ſtronger than my
hopes of effecting it, by any Endeavours of
mine, have prevailed with me to offer a few
things to you however, whether you will
hear, or whether you will forbear; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without all hope, but that it may
have ſuch effect upon ſome among you, or
inclining to you, as may be worth my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>§. 1. You know, it was ſaid by our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Saviour, That <hi>ſtraight is the Gate, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is the way that leadeth unto Life, and few
there be that find it.</hi> And I little doubt, but
that an <hi>Appearance</hi> at the firſt of a greater
<hi>Strictneſs</hi> and <hi>Narrowneſs</hi> in your way, than in
theirs that differ from you, was a Temptation
to ſome injudicious perſons I have known;
and probably to many other ſuch, to ſtrike
into it, as ſuppoſing it muſt be the beſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
becauſe the narroweſt and feweſt of it.</p>
            <p>Which Snare, I preſume, they would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have eſcaped, had they been but wiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to have conſidered theſe two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That that Narrowneſs and Strictneſs
conſiſting in outward <hi>Auſterities</hi> and <hi>Incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
wherein you differed from other Sober
Chriſtians, was no Narrowneſs or ſtrictneſs
of <hi>God's appointing,</hi> but a piece of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95744:3"/>
of your <hi>own deviſing,</hi> when you placed
Religion in it. And you are not the firſt that
have been deceived with ſuch Appearances;
ſeveral Orders among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have been
built upon the ſame Bottom, long before your
way was heard of in the world. And we
read of others long before them alſo, who
ſubjected themſelves to like Ordinances of
men; ſuch as <hi>touch not, taſte not, handle not:</hi>
Such things having <hi>a ſhew of wiſdom</hi> in Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip,
and Humility, and <hi>neglecting of the
Body,</hi> not in any honour, to the ſatisfying of
the Fleſh; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 20, 23.
In reſpect of which, and other like little things
that had no real worth or goodneſs in them;
the falſe Apoſtles pretended to more ſtrictneſs
than was in the Apoſtles of Chriſt themſelves;
whom they repreſented but as men <hi>walking
according to the Fleſh,</hi> in compariſon of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. And the <hi>Phariſees</hi> before
them, by reaſon of ſome Auſterities they uſed
about Faſtings, external Purifications, and
ſhunning the company of <hi>Publicans,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to greater ſtrictneſs in Religion, than was
in Chriſt's Diſciples; yea, than in Chriſt
himſelf; whom they accounted to be but a
Gluttonous perſon, and a Wine-bibber, a
friend of Publicans and Sinners, in compare
with themſelves. By ſuch appearance of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Zeal and Strictneſs, though alas,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95744:4"/>
it be but in things that do not tend at all to the
bettering or perfecting men in their Nature.
<hi>Deceivers</hi> are wont to procure to themſelves a
Reputation among people of weak minds; by
advantage whereof, as of a Bait that covers
the Hook, they obtain a ready reception for
their more dangerous Doctrines.</p>
            <p>Again, They would not ſo eaſily have been
overcome with the aforeſaid Appearances of
Narrowneſs and Strictneſs; if they had but
well conſidered, that in reference to thoſe
things wherein the Narrowneſs and Strictneſs
of Chriſt's way to Life doth moſt conſiſt; and
wherein he hath tied up his followers to ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
indeed; ye have taken liberty to walk
looſly, and to caſt off his Yoke; and that is, in
not governing your Spirits, Paſſions, and
Tongues, according to the Laws of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Government. He hath ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
his Followers to be humble and lowly
in heart, to eſteem others better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to ſpeak evil of no man, but to ſhew
all meekneſs to all men; yea, and in meekneſs
to inſtruct even thoſe that oppoſe themſelves;
to bleſs thoſe that curſe them, to overcome
others evil with their good; not to judge, and
the like. But quite contrary hereunto, your
very Leaders, and ſuch as have been eſteemed
moſt eminent among you, have by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
taught you to rail on, and revile, if not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95744:4"/>
bitterly to curſe ſuch as wiſhed you no harm,
but ſought your good; and proudly to exalt
and juſtifie your ſelves, and to deſpiſe and ſet
at naught, yea, to judge, condemn, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to eternal deſtruction, ſuch whom ye
ought to have honoured, as probably much
better than your ſelves. What leſs ſignifies
ſuch Language as this? <hi>Thou accurſed, thou
Beaſt, to whom the Plagues of God are due, a
Reprobate, a Child of Darkneſs thou art; thou
diſobedient one, upon whom God will render ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
in flaming fire; thou dark, blind Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite;
thee man that is</hi> Cain; <hi>with the Light
of Chriſt thou art ſeen, and with the Life judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and condemned; thou Sorcerer, thou dead
Beaſt, and ſo art not juſtified before God, nor
never ſhall be;—But ſuch polluted filthy
Beaſts as thou: Thou polluted Beaſt—who
art a Reprobate; and thou ſhalt find him to be
thine eternal Condemnation; thou dark Beaſt
and Conjurer; thou dark, ſottiſh Beaſt.</hi> Works
of <hi>Edw. Burroughs,</hi> p. 29, 32, 33, 34. With
abundance more in other of your Writings.
This truly is Language more like to proceed
(one would think) from ſuch <hi>preſumptuous,</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
arrogant men, <hi>whoſe mouth ſpeaketh
great ſwelling words;</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe;
than from men inſpired with any of
that Spirit of Meekneſs and Gentleneſs which
was in Jeſus Chriſt. If Humility, Charity,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95744:5"/>
and Modeſty, were the prevailing Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe mens Spirits, as it is of thoſe who
have been taught of Chriſt, as the Truth is
in Jeſus, and are made one Spirit with him; I
ſhould think they would by no means ſpeak at
this rate.</p>
            <p>And yet this, and ſuch like, is not the
Language only of ſome bold, raſh, heady
women, or of men leſs conſiderable among
you, tranſported with furious Zeal; but even
of <hi>Ed. Burrough</hi> himſelf, one of the Chieftains
among you in- his time: And that, not upon
any ſudden ſurprize of Paſſion, but upon ſo
much deliberation as men uſe in writing of
Books; and upon no other provocation, than
a bare propounding certain Queries touching
ſome points of Doctrine, about which you
and others differ. And truly in vain do you
boaſt of the Light within you, if you have
not ſo much left as to diſcern this behaviour
altogether unbecoming, not only a man of
Note among Chriſtians, nor only of any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the Name of a Chriſtian, how weak ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
but even of any that is worthy but of
the Name of a man, and not a—. And
yet how are thoſe Works in which theſe
things are found, applauded as the Works of
a <hi>Prophet of the Lord,</hi> by ſeveral men of great
Note among you; ſuch as <hi>George Fox, George
Whitehead, Francis Howgil,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah Co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95744:5"/>
who adjoin their ſeveral Teſtimonials to them.
And wherfore do I lay theſe things before you,
but to give you occaſion to reflect upon your
ſelves and your way with a jealous eye; and
to convince you that ye know not of what
Spirit ye are of; but that while ye have thought
ye have been walking in the Light, ye have
been walking in Darkneſs; and that whilſt ye
have fancied your ſelves the moſt ſpiritual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Chriſtians, ye have diſcovered your
ſelves to be but carnal. If any man among
you ſeemeth to be Religious; and <hi>bridleth not
his Tongue,</hi> but deceiveth his own heart, <hi>that
man's Religion is vain,</hi> Jam. 1. 26. If there
be bitter Zeal, glory not, and lie not againſt
the Truth; for that wiſdom is not from above
as you are apt to boaſt it to be, but from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath;
and is Earthly, Senſual and Deviliſh,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>But it is not ſtrange if men be left firſt or
laſt to fall into unchriſtian practices, who out
of affectation of Novelty, and Singularity in
Doctrine, and a deſire to appear more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
in their Notions, than all that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, have left the old beaten path of
Chriſtian Doctrine, in which the ſeveral Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
of holy men have lived and walked,
from the Apoſtles time downwards. For when
men wax ſpiritually proud and wanton, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
the plain way and method, which God
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95744:6"/>
hath choſen to bring men to ſaving Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and a holy Life, and to continue
them in it; and invent and chuſe another in
its ſtead, and call it by the name of his, and
preach to, and preſs it upon the people in his
Name; he takes no pleaſure in their ſo doing,
nor doth he delight to vouchſafe his concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Grace and bleſſing therewith, which he
doth with his own way and method, by which
it becomes effectual to make men good, and
to keep them ſo. And therefore, as I ſaid,
'tis no marvel if men by degrees loſe in the
goodneſs of their Frame and Temper, which
ſometimes they had attained, while they kept
cloſe to God's way and method, in which he
beſtows it; and degenerate into men of quite
another Spirit and Temper, when they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
that, and run into another of their own
invention and choice. The diſobedient <hi>Jews,</hi>
who had declined from the better way of their
Anceſtors, and grew into a worſe ſpirit and
temper; they had a zeal of God ſtill, but not
according to knowledge. They did will and
run for Juſtification and Life; they followed
after Righteouſneſs, and yet attained not to
the Law of Righteouſneſs; and wherefore?
but becauſe they ſought it not by Faith; which
was the method of God's chuſing; but as it
were by the works of the Law, which was a
method of their own chuſing, in oppoſition
to God's, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31, 32.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95744:6"/>
§. 2. And whether you are not guilty of
rejecting God's way and method of converting
men to, and keeping them in the way of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Faith, Repentance and Evangelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and of inventing and chuſing one of
your own, different from that, comes now to
to be conſidered. I ſhall ſtate your way in
this, by what you have publiſhed to the world
in your own Books; and for Brevity ſake,
ſhall inſtance but in two Authors, <hi>Ed. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
formerly, and Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> of late, who ſpeak
for you, that which is otherwiſe well enough
known to be your common Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Works of</hi> Ed. Burrough <hi>(whom you
are pleaſed to ſtile</hi> that true Prophet, <hi>in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-Page)
which are publiſhed by you, there
are theſe Sayings: In</hi> Page 252, <hi>thus.</hi> His
pure Spirit is put into the inward parts, to be
the Rule and Guide of Life in all things. <hi>And
again,</hi> [Only] by the teaching of the Eternal
Spirit, is the Living God known in the Creature.
<hi>Again,</hi> p. 408, It is promiſed <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that the
Spirit ſhall lead into all Truth; and ſuch do
own the Scriptures, but not as their Teacher;
for the Anointing dwells in them, and they need
no man to teach them, but as that Anointing
teacheth all things; and they have no need of the
Scripture to teach them; for all the Children of
God are taught of God, and need not any other
Teacher; nor need not to ſay one to another, Know
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95744:7"/>
the Lord. And yet all ſuch do own the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to be the Teſtimony of that which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and have received. <hi>And again, in</hi> p. 834,
The only perfect Rule of Conſcience in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
to God, is the Spirit of Chriſt, and not any
other thing. And becauſe ſomething beſides the
Spirit of God exerciſes the Conſcience, therefore
it is that here are ſo many Ways and Sects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and kinds of Worſhip in Chriſtendom, and
among Chriſtians, while the Spirit of Chriſt
[only] is not the Rule of Judgment, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of Conſcience to God and man. <hi>Again,</hi> pag.
861. The judgment in that matter (Hereſie)
muſt be juſt, equal, Holy, and [only] by the
Spirit of Chriſt, which is infallible, and gives
infallibility of judgment and diſcerning into all
Caſes and Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Pen <hi>ſpends the Fourth Chapter of his
late Book, Entituled,</hi> Reaſon againſt Railing;
<hi>to prove that the Light within, and not the
Scriptures, is the Rule of Faith and Practice.
In</hi> p. 47. <hi>he ſaith,</hi> We dare boldly affirm in the
Name of the Lord, that the great reaſon of our
Belief concerning them (the Scriptures) is [not
any outward thing] but that inward Teſtimony,
Record, and heavenly Amen, that we have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
received from the Holy Light within us,
to the Truth and Faithfulneſs of thoſe Sayings.
<hi>Again,</hi> p. 48. Wherefore the Scriptures are ſo
far from being the great Rule of Faith and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95744:7"/>
Practice, that the Light of Chriſt within us, is
both our Warrant and Rule for Faith in, and
Obedience to them. <hi>Again,</hi> p. 114. Let it be
remembred <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that Chriſt promiſed to
ſend the Spirit of Truth to lead into all Truth;
as much as to ſay, none are led into the Truth,
nor in the Truth, but by the Holy Spirit of Truth;
or that their practice is a Lie, or they are led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Lie, who are not led by the Spirit of Truth;
[that alone] leads into all the ways of Truth.
Where, by Truth is not meant the meer Letter of
the Scripture; which notwithſtanding is true, but
the living, powerful Truth, Chriſt, the Way, the
Truth, and the Life; of which the Scripture is
but a Record, or Declaration. <hi>And,</hi> p. 115.
Many may run into the practice of ſeveral out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things mentioned in the Scriptures to have
been the practice of Saints in former Ages, and
yet not be led into the Truth; for [all that] is
but Will-Worſhip, Imitation, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Your Notion concerning your Way, then,
thus repreſented, is this, or to this effect.</p>
            <p>That God, Chriſt, the holy Spirit, do by
immediate Illumination of your minds, and
without external teaching by the Scriptures,
or by men, ſhew you, or reveal to you what
you ought to believe and do; and by their
immediate motion or operation, draw or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
you to believe and practiſe according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95744:8"/>
Which Illumination or Operation, you
call <hi>The Light within,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Anointing,</hi>
which teacheth all things. This I take to be
your ſence, when you ſay, you own Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but not as your Teacher; and that ſuch
have no need of the Scripture to teach them,
and that all the Children of God are taught of
God, and need not any other Teacher. And
again, that God's pure Spirit is put into the
inward parts to be the Rule and Guide of Life
in all things; and that the only perfect Rule
of Conſcience in the exerciſe to God, is the
Spirit of Chriſt, and not any other thing.
That the Scriptures are ſo far from being the
Rule of Faith and Practice, as that the Light
within is both your Warrant and Rule. That
the Spirit of Truth [alone] leads into all
Truth. And that the infallible Spirit of Chriſt
gives Infallibility of judgment and diſcerning
into all Caſes and Things.</p>
            <p>This then is your Method and Way.</p>
            <p>Now I will ſhew you what is God's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and Way; which is quite different from
yours. The Goſpel plainly declares, That
there ſhall be a Reſurrection of all men after
Death, and a State of everlaſting weal or wo
in another world; and that as many as believe
Chriſt to be the Son of God, and Saviour of
the world, and repent them of the evil they
have done, and ſincerely obey his Laws,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95744:8"/>
ſhall, by his Death which he ſuffered for ſin,
receive Remiſſion of ſin, and Eternal Life;
but that thoſe that do not, ſhall be puniſhed
with everlaſting Deſtruction. This Goſpel,
this Doctrine, being not knowable by men,
by any Natural Light in them, without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation from God; Jeſus Chriſt, who
came from the Boſom of the Father, he reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it himſelf to his Apoſtles and others, by
his Doctrine, and after his Aſcenſion into
Heaven, he by ſending them the Holy Spirit,
immediately inſpired them with a clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and underſtanding of it, and ſo by the
gift of ſpeaking divers Languages, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with boldneſs and utterance, enabled
them to reveal and publiſh it to the world, and
to procure Credit to it by many Signs and
Wonders which were done by them. And
ever ſince that, God's way and method of
bringing men to Salvation, that live where
the Goſpel comes, hath been by making known
this Goſpel to them, by word or writing; and
ſo by the mighty Motives contained in it, ſuch
as the Manifeſtation of God's Love in the
Gift of Chriſt, the Hopes of Eternal Life, and
the Fears of Eternal Death, in concurrence
with the Operation of his Grace and good
Spirit, together with the rational Evidence
of the Truth of it, to perſwade men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and embrace it, and to live according to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95744:9"/>
So that according to this Repreſentation,
compared with that made of your Way, God's
Way and Method, and yours greatly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
            <p>You<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holding that the Holy Spirit directs
and perſwades men what to believe, and do,
by his own immediate working, without out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
teaching; whereas (as we ſay) he doth
it by outward teaching.</p>
            <p>It is God, Chriſt, the Holy Spirit, that
works the ſaving change in men; but he doth
it ſtill by the Word of the Goſpel, as commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to mens minds by the Scriptures, or
by mens teaching the ſame Doctrine which is
contained in the Scriptures; and it is this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that is the Rule of Faith and Practice.
And this I doubt not to make very plain to
you (in oppoſition to your way) if you will
not ſhut your eyes. And this I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
gradually, ſtep by ſtep, in certain Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
            <p>§. 3. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the Apoſtles days, in which
there was the greateſt effuſion of the Holy
Spirit on them and other Chriſtians, that ever
hath been yet; even then God's way of
bringing men to believe the Goſpel, and to
live according to it, was by publiſhing it to
men by men, either by Word or Writing, and
evidencing it to be from God. The Apoſtles
indeed had the Goſpel from Chriſt himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95744:9"/>
as he himſelf had it from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who gave him Commandment what he
ſhould ſay and what he ſhould ſpeak: It at
the firſt began to be <hi>ſpoken by the Lord himſelf,</hi>
and was confirmed unto us by them that <hi>heard</hi>
him; as 'tis ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4. But after Chriſt's
Aſcenſion, others at the firſt received the
Knowledge and Faith of the Goſpel, by the
Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, who were his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
to the world, by them he made
known his Salvation to the Ends of the Earth.
When our Saviour prayed for all other good
Chriſtians that ſhould be in the World, beſides
his Apoſtles, he deſcribes them thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
Such as ſhould believe through <hi>their Word,
John</hi> 17. 20. Neither pray I for theſe alone,
but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me
<hi>through their Word.</hi> And it pleaſed God by
the fooliſhneſs of <hi>Preaching,</hi> to ſave them that
believe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. And ſo Faith cometh
by <hi>Hearing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. By hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what, and of whom? Why, by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Goſpel preached by ſuch whom God
ſent to preach it; of which mention is made in
the precedent Verſes. The Doctrine which
the Apoſtles preached, which is the Goſpel, is
ſaid to be the <hi>Power of God to Salvation,</hi> Rom.
1. 16. And the Reaſon is given in <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18.
Becauſe thereby the Righteouſneſs of God is
revealed from Faith to Faith. That is God's
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95744:10"/>
method of juſtifying men, upon condition of
their believing, and obeying of it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thereby the eternal Wrath of God from
Heaven, is revealed againſt all Ungodlineſs and
Unrighteouſneſs of men. This Revelation
being from God, and the things, the Motives
revealed being powerful Arguments to prevail
with men, to receive and obey the Goſpel;
upon their doing of which, they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
thence it is that 'tis called <hi>The Power of
God to Salvation,</hi> not excluding the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Operation of God's Spirit upon the heart
by it.</p>
            <p>This being ſo, your Leaders manifeſt a
ſtrange degree of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearnedneſs</hi> in the things
of the Goſpel, when they deny ſaving Grace
to be wrought by the outward Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Word, or Teaching by man (as they
do when they attribute it to God alone, as his
immediate Work) and all becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
attributes it to God, to Chriſt, to the
Holy Spirit: Whereas nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
than to attribute the ſame Effect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to one Cauſe, ſometimes to another;
when there is the Concurrence and Co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſeveral Cauſes to the producing of the
ſame Effect, as there uſually is in God's
working ſavingly upon men. As men are ſaid
in Scripture to be <hi>born of God, to be born of the
Spirit;</hi> ſo they are ſaid to be born of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95744:10"/>
Seed of the Word,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 23. Becauſe
that is God's Inſtrument. <hi>Of his own Will
begat he us by the Word of Truth,</hi> Jam. 1. 18.
And the Goſpel is the <hi>Miniſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> as it is called;
becauſe it is the great Inſtrument or Means by
which the Spirit doth its Work upon men.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Work of Grace in men, is moſt
properly attributed to God, to Chriſt, though
other Cauſes concur to the producing of that
Effect; becauſe he is the principal Cauſe of it,
and all other but ſubordinate; and yet the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
is ſometimes attributed to ſubordinate and
ſecond Cauſes alſo, though leſs properly. Thus
Chriſt, the principal Cauſe of it, is ſaid to be
<hi>The Light of the World, the Light of men,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he by his Goſpel, as the Author of it,
diſcovers and reveals to them a future everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Happineſs attainable in another World,
and the way to it; and yet the Goſpel it ſelf,
yea the Apoſtles, and Paſtors, and Chriſtian
Profeſſors, are alſo ſaid to be the <hi>Light of the
world,</hi> as ſubordinate Cauſes, under Chriſt, of
the Illumination of men in the knowledge
hereof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15, 16.
All which had you well conſidered, you would
never have oppoſed mens being enlightened
and taught by Chriſt, as ye do, to their being
taught by the Scriptures, or by men; and all
becauſe, forſooth, the Illumination of men
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95744:11"/>
is attributed to Chriſt. This very thing here
ſuggeſted to you, would in great part reduce
you, and ſet you to rights, if you could be
but willing to receive and own that for truth,
which cannot without great abſurdity and
contradiction to the Scriptures be denied. But
for want of diſtinguiſhing between things and
things, which in ſome reſpect, ſeem to be the
ſame, but in other reſpects greatly differ, you
run your ſelves into Error and great Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>I will upon this occaſion, inſtance in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing not much unlike to that but now
mentioned, wherein you greatly miſtake, for
want of diſtinguiſhing; and that is, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Preſence of Chriſt in men: For becauſe
the Scriptures ſpeak of Chriſt's being [in]
men; and becauſe Chriſt is God, and God
euery where preſent, and ſo in all men; from
theſe thus jumbled together, you infer, that
therefore Chriſt <hi>is in all men;</hi> and that being
ſo, you farther infer that all men are taught
by him himſelf immediately without external
Teaching. In doing of which, you confound
things together which are diſtinct, to the
darkning of them in your underſtandings, and
the miſguiding you in Judgment: You do
not diſtinguiſh as you ought to do between the
<hi>Eſſential</hi> Preſence of Chriſt, as <hi>God,</hi> and his
<hi>Virtual</hi> Preſence, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> God-man. For
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95744:11"/>
although Chriſt, as God, is preſent to every
man, in the exerciſe of common Providence,
in the world; (<hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and
I work;</hi> ſaith he, <hi>John</hi> 5. 17.) yet in reſpect
of his <hi>Virtual</hi> Preſence, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> as when
he rules and operates in mens hearts by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and by the Evangelical Law, in this
ſence (which yet is, doubtleſs, the ſence in
which Chriſt is ſaid in Scripture to be <hi>in</hi> men,
and to <hi>dwell in</hi> them) I ſay, in this ſence he is
not in all men. For men are ſaid to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Chriſt, until they are converted to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. And it is by Faith (which
only ſome, and not all men have) that Chriſt
dwells in any mans heart, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. It is by
that Faith that his Authority in his Doctrine
and Law is owned, and where that's ſincerely
owned, there Chriſt is ſaid to dwell. Not
that Chriſt as Mediator <hi>God-man,</hi> dwells <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally</hi>
in men; for in that ſence and reſpect
he dwells in Heaven, and is at the right hand
of the Majeſty on high. And therefore as
Teacher of his Church, he doth not teach men
now immediately in perſon, but by his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
which he ſends to them, by which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens
them in the way of Salvation. Ye
do therefore err, not knowing or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures, while you attribute thoſe
effects to the <hi>Eſſential</hi> Preſence, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
operation of Chriſt in men, which are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95744:12"/>
wrought by him indeed, but it is by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality
and Agency of ſecond Cauſes,</hi> the
Goſpel and the Miniſtration thereof by men.</p>
            <p>I wiſh that by theſe Inſtances, you could
be made ſenſible of your great weakneſs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
<hi>Diſtinctions,</hi> as if they were but effects
of Carnal Reaſon and Fleſhly Wiſdom; for
ſith Words that are the ſame in ſound, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
uſed to ſignifie things of a different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and words different in ſound, to ſignifie
things of the ſame Nature; inſtances of which
the Scripture abounds with, they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
be perpetually liable to Error and groſs
Miſtakes, that throw away diſtinctions as
uſeleſs, which is your own caſe in many other
things beſides theſe now inſtanced in.</p>
            <p>Since then it was God's Method in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
dayes to bring men to ſalvation, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
and obeying the Doctrine preached by
them, as I have ſhewed; It is marvellous that
any that pretend to know any thing in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
ſhould deny this Doctrine to be the
Rule of Faith and Chriſtian Practice, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
that's the very end and Reaſon of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation
of it, to direct men what to believe
and do, that they might be ſaved; and to
excite them to believe and do accordingly.
When St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Whereto we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
let us walk by the ſame <hi>Rule;</hi> doth
he not by <hi>Rule</hi> mean the Apoſtles Doctrine,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95744:12"/>
whenas in the next words, he propoſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that lived according to what he taught, as
an example for them to follow, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 16, 17.
It was the great commendation of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Chriſtians, that they continued ſtedfaſtly
in the <hi>Apoſtles Doctrine,</hi> Acts 2. 42. And
St <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God:</hi>
And to tranſgreſs, ſure is to ſwerve from
the Rule, 2 <hi>John</hi> 9. This Doctrine of Chriſt
is called the <hi>Goſpel of the Kingdom,</hi> Mat. 4. 23.
and 9. 35. and 24. 14. For it is that Rule
by which Chriſt our King doth rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
his Subjects both in Heart and Life; as
the Laws of the Land are the Rule according
to which Earthly Kings do govern theirs.</p>
            <p>The Sum and Subſtance of the Doctrine
which the Apoſtles preached, one as well as
another, and in one place as well as another,
is called <hi>The Form of Sound Words,</hi> 2 Tim. 1,
13. <hi>The Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi>
Heb. 6. And this Form of Doctrine was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to the Chriſtians, to rule and govern
themſelves by, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>But now have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
from the heart that Form of Doctrine which
was delivered to you:</hi> And it was ſo much a
Rule to them, that they were commanded to
<hi>mark</hi> and <hi>avoid</hi> ſuch as cauſed Diviſions and
Offences <hi>contrary to the Doctrine which they had
learned,</hi> Rom. 16. 17. And forbid to receive
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95744:13"/>
into their Houſes ſuch <hi>as brought not this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
2 John 10. And if any man teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>conſents not</hi> to
wholeſom words, even the words of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>the Doctrine which is
according to Godlineſs,</hi> he is proud, knowing
nothing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being all ſo plain, as what
can be plainer; it cannot but be highly ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
for ſuch as are ignorant in the very
A, B, C, of Chriſtianity (as by your diſſent
in this plain Truth, you appear to be) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to ſuch Sublimity and Spirituality, as to
eſteem all other Chriſtians in the world, of
what denomination ſoever, that are not of
your way, in compariſon of your ſelves, to
be all in Darkneſs and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>§ 4. The <hi>Second Propoſition</hi> is this; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the firſt Promulgators of the Goſpel
were enabled by immediate Revelation from
Chriſt to teach it unto others; yet afterward
God's ordinary way and method of tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Knowledge and Faith of the Goſpel
downwards to others ſucceſſively, was by ſuch
mens teaching it to others, as had themſelves
learned it of the Apoſtles, or others that taught
the ſame Doctrine as they did. Thus <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus,</hi> though Evangeliſts, were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by <hi>Paul</hi> in the Chriſtian Faith; and how
they ſhould behave themſelves in their publick
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95744:13"/>
capacities as Evangeliſts or Biſhops; and this
was done, partly by Speech, and partly by
his Epiſtles to them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. Hold faſt
the Form of ſound words which thou <hi>haſt
heard of me,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 14, 15. Continue in
the things which thou haſt learned, and haſt
been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt
learned them, and that from a Child thou haſt
known the Holy Scriptures. <hi>Titus</hi> learned
the Chriſtian Faith by <hi>Paul;</hi> for which cauſe
he ſtiles him his <hi>Son in the Common Faith,</hi> Tit.
1. 4. And by his Epiſtle inſtructs him in the
Election of Biſhops, which he was to place
in the Cities of <hi>Crete:</hi> And one of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
about this Affair was, that he ſhould
ordain ſuch as <hi>held faſt the faithful word as
they had been taught,</hi> Tit. 1. 9. And the ſame
things which <hi>Timothy</hi> had learned of <hi>Paul,</hi> he
was to commit to faithful men, and ſuch as
ſhould be able to teach others, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.
The things which thou haſt <hi>heard of me</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many Witneſſes, <hi>commit thou to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 5. 3. The ſame Doctrine, and many of
the ſame Miracles were committed to writing
by the Apoſtles, which were firſt preached and
done by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and for the
ſame end; to wit, to bring men to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Belief and Life, <hi>John</hi> 20. 31. But theſe
are <hi>written that ye might believe that Jeſus is
the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that believing,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95744:14"/>
ye might have life through his Name,</hi> 1 John 5.
13. Theſe things have I <hi>written</hi> unto you
that believe on the Name of the Son of God,
that ye may <hi>know</hi> that ye have Eternal Life;
and that ye may <hi>believe</hi> on the Name of the
Son of God: That is, that they might believe
more groundedly and firmly, and ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and perſeveringly againſt all oppoſition and
temptations to the contrary, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 3, 4. It
ſeemed good to me alſo, having had perfect
underſtanding of things, from the very firſt,
to <hi>write</hi> unto thee, moſt excellent <hi>Theophilus,</hi>
that thou mighteſt <hi>know the Certainty</hi> of thoſe
things wherein thou haſt been inſtructed.
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16. <hi>The Scriptures given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration</hi>
of God, are profitable for reproof,
correction, and inſtruction in righteouſneſs;
and able to make men wiſe unto ſalvation,
through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Rom.</hi>
16. 26. And by the <hi>Scriptures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
according to the Commandment of the
everlaſting God, <hi>made known</hi> to all Nations
for the obedience of Faith. God of old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Law written, to be read to all
the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they might
learn to fear him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>§ 6. 4. The Apoſtle required the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to be given to what he taught by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles,
as to what he taught by ſpeech, face
to face, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 15. Therefore ſtand faſt,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95744:14"/>
and hold the Traditions which ye have been
taught, <hi>whether by word or our Epiſtle,</hi> 1 Cor.
14. 37. If any man think himſelf to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
or ſpiritual, let him acknowledge that
the things which <hi>I write unto you, are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of the Lord.</hi> And the Epiſtles
written to particular Churches, were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the benefit of all, in thoſe things which
in their nature were of common concern unto
all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. Unto the Church of God at
<hi>Corinth—With all that in every place</hi> call
upon the Name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord both
theirs and ours. The two Epiſtles of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> the Epiſtle of
<hi>Jude,</hi> and that of <hi>James,</hi> are all General E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles,
not directed to any particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as ſuch; but to the Chriſtians ſcattered
abroad in the world. And the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were
to read the Epiſtle ſent to <hi>Laodicea;</hi> and the
<hi>Laodiceans</hi> to read that ſent to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> as
well as thoſe that were ſent to both themſelves
reſpectively, <hi>Col.</hi> 4, 16. And St. <hi>John</hi> was
commanded to ſend all the ſeven Epiſtles to
each of the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and not
only one Epiſtle to one Church, and another
to another. And in <hi>Rev.</hi> Chap. 2, &amp; 3. It is
ſeven times ſaid, He that hath an Ear, let him
hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches;
as every man in the world hath, that is not
deaf. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. 18. I teſtifie to <hi>every
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95744:15"/>
man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) that heareth the words of
the Propheſie of this Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there
is great reaſon why the ſame regard ſhould be
given to what the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts
wrote, as to what they ſpake; as long as they
either wrote the ſame Doctrine, or Hiſtory,
upon the ſame evidence. For the Doctrine is
the ſame after it is written, as it was before;
for its Being written, doth not alter the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it. And therefore men muſt needs
be as much concerned in their Belief or Disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
Obedience or Diſobedience to it, when
it is communicated to them by writing, as
when it is ſo by Preaching; yea, I had almoſt
ſaid, or by immediate Revelation: For 'tis
not the way and manner of communicating
the will of God to us, that makes it ſaving;
but our belief and ſerious conſideration of it,
and yielding obedience to it, how, or by what
means ſoever we come to know it. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
'tis poſſible men may have Revelations
from God, as <hi>Balaam</hi> had; and as <hi>Judas</hi> and
other workers of Iniquity, that propheſied
and caſt out Devils in Chriſt's Name, had, or
might have had, and yet not be profited by
them. And if there be any leſs degree of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Divine Truth when it is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to us by writing, than when it was
communicated to others by the Apoſtles preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or to the Apoſtles themſelves by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95744:15"/>
Revelation; yet belief of it, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to it upon that leſs degree of Evidence,
is not the leſs, but rather much more reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
than is obedience to it upon greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<hi>John</hi> 20. 29. Jeſus ſaith unto him,
<hi>Thomas,</hi> becauſe thou haſt ſeen, thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
bleſſed are they which have <hi>not ſeen,</hi>
and yet have believed.</p>
            <p>It is not to be imagined but that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Evangeliſts have expreſſed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Doctrine, and the Reaſons why it
ſhould be believed, in as plain terms when they
wrote it, as when they preached it.</p>
            <p>They could hardly ſpeak thoſe great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
touching the Eſſentials of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
plainer than they are communicated to
us by their Writings, yet how plain ſoever
they ſpake them, the very ſame things (preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
worldly intereſt, and the love of T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſt)
which now detain men from obeying their
Doctrine, as communicated and tranſmitted
down to us by their Writings, did in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
keep back Multitudes from yielding Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to their Doctrine, then when they
themſelves preach'd it to them, and wrought
many Miracles to convince them that it was
from God. And as men then that had no
mind to obey the Doctrine which Chriſt and
the Apoſtles preach'd, raiſed Cavils and pickt
Quarrels againſt it: <hi>Why do you not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95744:16"/>
my ſpeech? even becauſe ye cannot hear
my Word;</hi> ſaid our Saviour to ſuch, <hi>John</hi>
8. 43.) Even ſo at this day; thoſe Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and looſe men, that have no mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Hearts and Lives to the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Chriſt in the Scriptures, raiſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and pick Quarrels againſt the Scriptures,
which are a ſtanding Reproof to their bad
Tempers, and evil Lives; which becauſe they
are ſo, they ſeek by all means to invalidate
them, that they might the more ſecurely, and
without diſturbance from them, hold on their
ungodly courſe, ſecretly, or openly.</p>
            <p>How far any that have led you the way,
may be concerned in ſuch a thing as this, I
ſhall not ſay; but ſure I am, it concerns both
you and them to think on't: and ſo much the
rather, becauſe 'tis ſeldom, if ever ſeen among
other men, but that thoſe that are cold in
their affection to the Scriptures, are as cold to
the power of Godlineſs, or rather zealouſly
hot againſt it.</p>
            <p>And indeed I muſt needs ſay, you bewray
your cold affection to, and your little and
ſlight eſteem of the holy Scriptures, while you
think you have ground pleaſedly to call them
the Dead Letter, from that Saying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Who hath made us able
Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but of the Spirit:</hi> And to call thoſe that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95744:16"/>
preach from the Scriptures, <hi>Miniſters of the
Letter.</hi> Whereas that Expreſſion is ſo far
from ſerving your purpoſe herein, as that if
you underſtood it (which alas, you do not)
you would find it to caſt a Glory and Honour
upon the Scriptures of the New Teſtament,
and no diſparagement at all upon thoſe of the
old, upon any account of the matters therein
contained, as being written. For the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Old Teſtament it ſelf is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Letter becauſe it is in Writing; nor
that of the New, the Spirit, becauſe not in
Writing; but becauſe the Subject-Matter of
which the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Covenant did much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
and many of the things therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were but figurative, and outward Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
of thoſe excellent Spiritual things,
which in the Goſpel, are plainly and nakedly
expreſſed, without any ſuch Vail or Cover:
For ſo the Apoſtle, in the proceſs of this his
Diſcourſe, doth more plainly expreſs it, <hi>ver.</hi> 12,
13, 14. <hi>We uſe great plainneſs of Speech, and
not as Moſes,</hi> which put a Vail over his Face,
ſo that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not look or
ſee to the end of that which is aboliſhed—
<hi>Which Vail is done away in Chriſt;</hi> that is, in
the Doctrine of Chriſt, in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
in which Doctrine, Divine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Truth is ſtripp'd out of its Cloathing
and Covering, and repreſented as it is in its
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95744:17"/>
own nature, and not in dark figures. And
that this, and not the Writing, or not Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
is meant by Letter and Spirit, will far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appear by comparing other Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
with this. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29. Circumciſion
is that of the heart, in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not in
the <hi>Letter.</hi> By <hi>Letter</hi> here is plainly meant
Circumciſion in the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> and by <hi>Spirit,</hi>
that which was couched under it, or ſignified
by it; and that is the Circumciſion of the
<hi>Heart;</hi> which in the New Teſtament is called
<hi>Mortification,</hi> or Purifying of the Heart, or
crucifying Affections and Luſts.</p>
            <p>So again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. But now we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the Law, that being dead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we were held, that we ſhould ſerve in
<hi>Newneſs of Spirit, and not in the Oldneſs of
the Letter:</hi> That is, according to thoſe plain
Precepts of the Goſpel which anſwer the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Scope of the Law; and not in the
outward Ceremony, which were but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of them; as in offering our Bodies a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Sacrifice, inſtead of ſlain Beaſts; in
cleanſing our ſelves from the filthineſs of the
fleſh, inſtead of Legal Purifications by waſhing
the Body, in <hi>putting off the Body of the Sins
of the Fleſh,</hi> and all evil Concupiſcence, and
not in cutting off the Foreskin of the Fleſh.
And thoſe Miniſters that preach this, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like Spiritual Doctriue, out of, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95744:17"/>
to the Scriptures of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they
are Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of
the Letter, but of the Spirit. Which had
you underſtood, you would never have pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your ſpiteful contempt on them as you
have, by calling them <hi>Letter-Preachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude what I have ſaid in this
Propoſition, to ſhew that the ſame regard is
due to the Doctrine of the Apoſtles when
written, as now it is, as when it was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them; by remembring you of this one
great Truth, That every man ſhall be tried
and judged at the laſt day, by that Law he
hath been under. The Gentiles that are, or
have been without a written Law, ſhall be
judged without any ſuch Law: and the <hi>Jews</hi>
which were under a written Law, they ſhall
be judged by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12. Even ſo, thoſe
that are under the Goſpel written, will be
judged by that; as thoſe that were under the
immediate preaching of it by Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
before it was written, will be judged
by that. <hi>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth
not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the
Word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge
him at the laſt day,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 12.
48. And if that be the Rule by which thoſe
ſhall be judged that have his Word made
known to them, be it by one means or by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95744:18"/>
then it greatly concerns all ſuch to make
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat Word of his the Rule of their Life and
Practice, as ever they hope to come off well
upon their Trial at laſt, whatever you talk of
its not being a Rule as it is a written Word.
And therefore beware leſt then that come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, and be ſaid of you, which is written
in one of the Prophets; <hi>I have</hi> written <hi>to
them the great things of my Law, and they have
counted them as a ſtrange thing,</hi> Hoſ. 8. 12.</p>
            <p>§. 7. 5. The next Propoſition is this; That
the Holy Scriptures extant in the Apoſtles
days, in conjunction with the Doctrine of
the Chriſtian Faith, however made known, by
Writing, or otherwiſe; were then, through
that Grace of God, which uſually attends a
due uſe of them, able to make men wiſe to
Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>And that from a Child
thou haſt known the</hi> Holy Scriptures, <hi>which are</hi>
able <hi>to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through
Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by <hi>Scriptures</hi> here, you will underſtand
the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament only, yet
you may eaſily collect that if thoſe Scriptures
were in great part able to make men wiſe unto
Salvation, then when the Goſpel was on foot,
then the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, as
containing the Chriſtian Doctrine, are able to
do it much more; and both in conjunction to
be effectual to that end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:95744:18"/>
The Apoſtle acquainted the Chriſtians then
that the Myſtery of the Goſpel by the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the Prophets,</hi> is, and that according
to the Commandment of the everlaſting God,
<hi>made known</hi> to all Nations for the obedience
of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>§ 8. 6. The Holy Scriptures, as the means
which God works by, are able, not only to
make men in a private capacity wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
but alſo to furniſh men for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of the publick Office of Teaching
and Governing in the Church of God. The
Holy. <hi>Scriptures given by inſpiration of God,
are profitable for Doctrine, Reproof, Correction,
and Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, ſo as to make the</hi>
man of God, to wit, a publick Preacher, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
throughly furniſhed to all good works;</hi> even
to enable him to diſcharge his whole Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Souls of others, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. And
St. <hi>Paul</hi> by his <hi>Writings,</hi> inſtructed even <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
himſelf, how to behave himſelf in his
Office and publick Capacity, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14.
<hi>Theſe things</hi> write <hi>I unto thee, that thou maiſt</hi>
know how to behave <hi>thy ſelf in the Houſe of
God, which is the Church of the Living God.</hi>
And for the better diſcharge of his Miniſterial
Office, directs and enjoins him to give attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to <hi>Reading,</hi> and to <hi>Meditation,</hi> or Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13, 15. Which ſure would have
been needleſs, if he had been ſufficiently able
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95744:19"/>
to have done all by the immediate Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and operation of God's Spirit; as you
fancy your Teachers are able to do.</p>
            <p>§ 9. 7. The ſame promiſe is made to the
<hi>reading</hi> of the Word <hi>written,</hi> and to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, as is to the hearing and keeping of
it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Bleſſed is he that</hi> readeth, <hi>and
they that</hi> hear <hi>the words of this Propheſie, and
keep thoſe things which are written therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 10. 8. The Scripture is ſaid to ſay this
or that, which yet God ſaid himſelf, or by
his Servants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>The</hi> Scripture <hi>ſaith
unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>even for this ſame purpoſe have
I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my power in
thee,</hi> Rom. 10. 11. <hi>The</hi> Scripture <hi>ſaith, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
believeth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi>
Gal. 3. 22. <hi>The</hi> Scripture <hi>hath concluded all
under ſin. What ſaith the</hi> Scripture? <hi>Caſt
out the Bondwoman and her Son,</hi> Gal. 4. 30.
Which yet was the Saying of God himſelf.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 16. <hi>Another</hi> Scripture <hi>ſaith, They ſhall
look on him whom they have pierced,</hi> John 19.
17. <hi>No Propheſie of the</hi> Scriptures <hi>is of private
Interpretation,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 20. So that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this, look what God ſaith in and by the
Scriptures, touching ſuch things as concern
us, is in effect the ſame, as if he had ſpoken
them to us himſelf immediately, <hi>If any man
think himſelf to be a Prophet, or Spiritual, let
him acknowledge that the things I</hi> write <hi>unto
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95744:19"/>
you, are the Commandments of the Lord,</hi> ſaid
St <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 37.</p>
            <p>You are wont to inſinuate indeed, as if the
Scriptures were not of that uſe to us now, as
they were to them, to whom they were firſt
written. But however they might more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
them than us in ſome particular caſes
<hi>proper to them,</hi> yet in things of <hi>common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,</hi>
they are as much for our uſe as they were
for theirs. <hi>For whatſoever things were</hi> written
<hi>aforetime, were</hi> written <hi>for our Learning,</hi> Rom.
15. 4. What God ſaid to <hi>Joſhua, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave thee nor forſake thee;</hi> the Apoſtle
would have all faithful Chriſtians relie on; as
if it had been ſpoken to themſelves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5.
That which was firſt ſpoken to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Lev.
26. The Apoſtle applies to the Believing <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
as much as if it had been ſpoken to them
only, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>For ye are the Temple of
the Living God; as God hath ſaid; I will
dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will
be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 11. 9. We that have the Doctrine of
Chriſt and his Apoſtles brought down to us in
the Scriptures, may, according to Scripture-Dialect,
be ſaid to <hi>have</hi> Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
as truly as it was ſaid of the <hi>Jews</hi> in
our Saviour's days on Earth, that they had
<hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; for it was by having
in the Scriptures, what they ſaid and did; that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95744:20"/>
were ſaid to have them. And by hearing and
believing the Scriptures of the New Teſtament,
we may as well be ſaid to hear and believe
Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as they to hear and
believe <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; which yet
they were ſaid to do, when they did believe
their <hi>Writings,</hi> Luke 16. 29. <hi>They</hi> have <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and the Prophets, let them</hi> hear them. Ver. 31.
<hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither
will they be perſwaded though one roſe from the
dead.</hi> John 5. 46, 47. <hi>Had ye</hi> believed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<hi>ye would have believed me; for he wrote of
me: But if ye believe not his</hi> Writings, <hi>how
ſhould ye believe my Words?</hi> Chriſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Apoſtles, upon his giving them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to teach all Nations, that he would be
with them to the end of the world; and
he is ſo in one ſenſe, when he accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
their Miniſtration by their Doctrine
and Writings, with the preſence of his
Grace and power in their continuation to
the end of the world. And as it is ſaid of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> Acts 15. 21. That he had thoſe <hi>in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
City that</hi> preached <hi>him, being</hi> read <hi>in the
Synagogues every Sabbath day;</hi> inaſmuch as
his Books of the Law were read; ſo for the
ſame, or like reaſon, it may be as truly ſaid,
that Chriſt hath thoſe that preach him now,
when the Books of the New Teſtament writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by inſpiration of his Spirit, are read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95744:20"/>
us and opened unto us every Lord's Day.
You may then ſafely conclude, that thoſe that
have the Doctrine of Chriſt in his Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, have Chriſt among them; and
all that receive and hold faſt that, do receive
and hold faſt him: So ſaith St. <hi>John</hi> in his
ſecond Epiſt. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>He that abideth in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Chriſt, he hath both the Father and the
Son.</hi> And again, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 24. <hi>If that which
ye have</hi> heard <hi>from the beginning, ſhall</hi> remain
in you, <hi>ye alſo ſhall</hi> continue in the Son and
in the Father.</p>
            <p>§ 12. 10. That in Chriſt Jeſus neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
availeth any thing, nor Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;
but a new Creature; is a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Doctrine, declared in <hi>writing</hi> by St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 6. 15.</p>
            <p>And when he ſaith in the next Verſe, <hi>As
many as walk according to this</hi> [Rule] <hi>peace be
on them;</hi> it is moſt evident he was not of your
mind and way, who hold that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or Doctrine contained in them, which
is the ſame, are not a Rule of Chriſtian Faith
and Practice.</p>
            <p>This written Doctrine of the Goſpel, we
ſee, is a Rule for Chriſtians to walk by; as
the written Law and Teſtimony was to the
<hi>Jews;</hi> and as it was ſaid of thoſe that walked
not according to that Word or Rule, that it was
becauſe there was no Light in them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95744:21"/>
Even ſo, and for the ſame reaſon, it may now
be ſaid of you, that if you walk not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Rule, it is becauſe in truth there is
no Light in you, how much ſoever you vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
boaſt of it, and cenſure others for want of
it; that yet make it their daily care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to walk according to the Light and
Guidance of that Rule, that hath its ſeat in
their Conſcience.</p>
            <p>And now, Sirs, by this time, methinks you
ſhould not but perceive, that I have given you
proof in good meaſure heaped up, ſhaken
together, preſſed down; and running over;
That Gods way and method of directing men,
what to believe and do as neceſſary to their
Salvation, and of perſwading them to believe
and do accordingly, is, and hath been by that
teaching which comes from God into the
Soul by outward means, ſuch as is his Word
written, or by mens teaching the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which is contained in the Scriptures;
and if ſo, then not by his immediate teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and operation, without ſuch outward
teaching, which yet is that which you hold
and teach, in oppoſition to God's Method.
The Proof of this is ſo evident and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
that if you will but give your minds
and Conſciences Liberty ſeriouſly to conſider
it; I cannot imagine how you ſhould poſſibly
perſiſt in your way, without offering ſome
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95744:21"/>
violence to the reaſon of your Minds.</p>
            <p>§. 13. But ſince you have ſtrengthened your
ſelves in this your perſwaſion, out of an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
you have that ſome Scriptures are on your
ſide in it, I ſhall yet add ſomething farther to
convince you of Error and Miſtake therein.</p>
            <p>You ſeem to ground your ſelves much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>John</hi> 1. 9. Where it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>This
is the true Light which lightneth every man that
cometh into the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Chriſt doth one way or other lighten
every man that comes into the world, is a
great truth here declared: But that which you
are wont to alledge it for, and which you are
to prove hence, if you would have it do your
buſineſs, is, That Chriſt lighteneth every man
that comes into the world, with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of what he ought to believe and do in
order to his ſalvation, without learning it
from or by any <hi>Outward Means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That no ſuch thing, as that Chriſt ſo ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
all men without <hi>Outward Teaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> can
be proved; either from this or any other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
I ſhall eaſily ſhew you.</p>
            <p>Chriſt doth enlighten all whom he doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
in one or more of theſe three ways;
either, 1. By Natural Light. Or, 2. By
Supernatural Revelation. Or, 3. By outward
Teaching by Speech, or Writing, or Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in conjunction with the inward aſſiſtance
of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:95744:22"/>
1. Chriſt indeed, as God Creator (as he is
deſcribed in the beginning of that Chapter)
doth enlighten every man that comes into the
world, with the faculty of Reaſon and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
by which he may know that there
is a God, and that he is to be worſhipped, and
that he is placable; and the difference between
moral good and evil in many things. But
however this may poſſibly be a Light ſufficient
to direct the Heathen to as much as God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
from them (if they live up to it) to
whom he affords no other Light; yet this
Natural Light is <hi>not ſufficient</hi> to direct thoſe
that live under the Goſpel, to believe and do
what they are bound to believe and do, upon
pain of Damnation. They that live under the
Goſpel, are bound to believe Jeſus to be Chriſt,
the Son of God, and Saviour of the world,
and that upon pain of damnation. <hi>If ye believe
not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſins;</hi> ſaid our
Saviour to them to whom the Goſpel came, <hi>Jo.</hi>
8. 24. <hi>Every Spirit that confeſſeth not that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God, but
is the Spirit of Antichriſt,</hi> 1 John 4. 3. <hi>He that
believeth not the Son of God, ſhall not ſee Life;
but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Joh. 3. 36.</p>
            <p>Now that no man can know Chriſt, know
him to be the Son of God, and Saviour of
the world, by his Natural Light, without
Supernatural Revelation from God, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95744:22"/>
from without, derived from them
that had ſuch Revelation, is moſt evident.
When <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the
Son of the Living God;</hi> our Saviour told him,
<hi>Fleſh and Bloud had not revealed that unto him,
but his Father,</hi> Mat. 16. 16, 17. And <hi>the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
of God, neither can he know them, becauſe they
are ſpiritually diſcerned;</hi> that is, they are
knowable only by means that are purely ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and ſupernatural; as the revelation of
the Goſpel at firſt was. And it may well be,
that in this reſpect 'tis ſaid, that <hi>no man can
ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. For no man could know that he
was ſo, but by that Revelation and diſcovery
which the Holy Ghoſt ſeveral ways at the firſt
made concerning him. <hi>He ſhall glorifie me;
for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it
unto you,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to his Apoſtles, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Holy Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 16. 14. And Chriſt
is ſaid to be <hi>juſtified</hi> in or by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to be
what he himſelf ſaid he was, and his Apoſtles
witneſſed him to be, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p>All this ſhews that though Chriſt do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
all men with Natural Light, yet this is
not ſufficient without ſomewhat elſe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
all men; particularly thoſe that are
under the Goſpel, with the knowledge of
what is neceſſary for all ſuch to know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95744:23"/>
in order to their Salvation: For <hi>to
whom much is given, of him much ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi>
Luke 12. 48.</p>
            <p>Then ſecondly, Another way by which
Chriſt enlightens men with the knowledge of
himſelf, and of what is neceſſary for mens
Salvation, is by immediate and ſupernatural
Revelation; and thus he enlightened the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
that they might be able infallibly to
teach the way of Salvation by Chriſt, through
Faith in him, and Obedience to him; <hi>For God,</hi>
ſaith one of them, <hi>who commanded the Light
to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined into our
hearts,</hi> to <hi>give</hi> the light of the knowledge of
the Glory of God, in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt:
to give, that is, to give it forth to others,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. And again, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12, 13.
<hi>Now we have received, not the Spirit of the
World, but the Spirit which is of God; that we
might know the things that are freely given to us
of God:</hi> Which things alſo we ſpeak, not
with the words which mans wiſdom teacheth,
but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this of internal and <hi>immediate</hi> Revelation,
there is no way imaginable for men to come
to the knowledge of Chriſt as Mediator, but
by external and <hi>mediate</hi> Revelation.</p>
            <p>So that by the proceſs of this Diſcourſe,
you are brought to this; either to ſay that all
men to whom the Goſpel comes, are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95744:23"/>
by Chriſt with the knowledge of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Son of God, the Chriſt of God, and
Saviour of the world, by immediate and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Revelation, as the Apoſtles were;
or elſe to grant that ſome men in the world
are not enlightened by Chriſt without being
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aught by outward means, to know what
they are bound to believe, upon pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
For I have ſhewed before, that all
men and women to whom the Goſpel is
preached, are bound to believe Jeſus to be the
Chriſt, the Son of God, upon pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and that there is but theſe two ways
imaginable, by which they can come to know
it, that they might believe it, <hi>immediate</hi> and
<hi>mediate</hi> Revelation or Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>If being reduced to this ſtraight, you ſhall
be ſo abſurd as to chuſe to ſay that all thoſe
under the ſound and outward teaching of the
Goſpel, that ſhall be damned for not believing
on Chriſt as the Son of God, and for not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
him, had that knowledge of him by
immediate and ſupernatural Revelation, as
the Apoſtles had; for the ſinning againſt which,
they ſhall be damned, as knowing their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Will, and not doing it; yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as well as all Experience, will detect
your Folly in ſo ſaying: For I have proved in
my Propoſitiions, to which I refer you; that
God's way &amp; method of proceeding with men,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95744:24"/>
in juſtifying or condemning them, will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Obedience to, or Diſobedience
againſt that Doctrine of the Goſpel which
they had heard preached by men to them. Go,
<hi>preach</hi> the Goſpel to every Creature (ſaid our
Saviour) <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned;</hi>
that believeth not that Goſpel ſo preached and
made known to them by preaching, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.
16. And the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth it impoſſible
for the generality of men to believe, that have
not <hi>heard</hi> of Chriſt in the way of preaching
the Goſpel to them, and concludes that thoſe
that do believe, are brought to it by <hi>hearing</hi>
it preached; and that is not by way of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
inward teaching of God's Spirit without
the teaching by man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15, 16, 17.
<hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have
not</hi> heard? <hi>And how ſhall they hear without
a</hi> Preacher? ſaith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> Yes, might it
have been ſaid, by immediate Revelation and
inward teaching of God's Spirit, or the Light
within, if that had been the common way
of bringing men to believe the Goſpel. But
you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> knew of no ſuch way to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Faith, after it was once ſet on foot in
an extraordinary way: If he had, he would
not have put ſuch Queſtions, nor have made
ſuch a Concluſion as he doth in <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>So then
Faith cometh by</hi> hearing, <hi>and hearing by the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95744:24"/>
Word of God.</hi> And do you know more and
better than he did?</p>
            <p>And for your ſelves, it is not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that ever you could have known that ever
there was ſuch a one as Chriſt in the World,
any more than the poor <hi>Indians</hi> or Pagans
that never heard of him, had you not been
beholding to the Scriptures, or Oral Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for it, as God's means, for all your great
talk of your Light within you.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt Jeſus then doth not ſavingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
all thoſe who yet are ſavingly illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
neither by Natural Light, nor by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Revelation in an <hi>immediate</hi> way;
then it follows, that ſuch are enlightened by
Supernatural Revelation <hi>mediately</hi> or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
by the Scriptures, and Miniſtration
of men, unleſs there can be another way of
ſaving Illumination aſſigned, different from
the three before mentioned, which none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to do, ſo far as I have heard.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are ſo plain and full of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and ſo eaſie to be underſtood, and in
their Nature ſo apt to prevail with all ſuch as
do not deny but that the Scriptures are true,
that after you have conſidered them, I cannot
but think you will be convinced by them, if
there be that love to Truth in you, which you
pretend to, that you have unawares all this
while abuſed that firſt Chapter of <hi>John, v.</hi> 9.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95744:25"/>
and abuſed your ſelves and the world, by a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation
of it; whereas Chriſt is the
Light of the world divers ways, and in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reſpects; as, by his Spirit, by his Word,
and by his Works, both Miraculous, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary;
it cannot but be very great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or waywardneſs in you, to limit his being
ſo to one of theſe only.</p>
            <p>§ 14. <hi>Another Scripture which you alledge
as favouring your foreſaid Opinion, is that
Propheſie of</hi> Joel 2. 28, 29. <hi>Cited by St.</hi> Peter,
<hi>in</hi> Acts 2. 17. Behold the days come, <hi>ſaith the
Lord,</hi> that I will poure out my Spirit upon all
Fleſh, and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall
propheſie, and your young men ſhall ſee Viſions,
and your old men ſhall dream Dreams; and on
my Servants, and on my Handmaids I will poure
out of my Spirit in thoſe days, and they ſhall
propheſie.</p>
            <p>But that this Scripture alſo is impertinently
alledged, to prove that in the days of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
every one is <hi>immediately</hi> directed and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Spirit of God without outward
teaching, in what they are to believe and do,
will appear by two things. The one from the
Nature of the thing here predicted: The
other by the Application of this Prediction to
the event.</p>
            <p>1. From the Nature of the Subject-Matter
of this Propheſie. It is not that the Spirit
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95744:25"/>
ſhould be poured out upon all fleſh, ſo as to
direct every one what to believe and do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
outward teaching; but to qualifie perſons
extraordinarily for outward teaching: it is to
enable them to <hi>propheſie;</hi> for that is twice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Propheſie fore-cited, as the end
for which the Spirit ſhould be poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all fleſh. And propheſying is for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of others; it is a means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
knowledge of the Divine Will from one
man to another: <hi>He that propheſieth edifieth
the Church,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 4. This
of Prophets, was a Second Order in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Miniſtry: <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the
Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And although ſeeing Viſions, and
dreaming Dreams be alſo mentioned as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the pouring out of the Spirit; yet that
refers but to the ſame thing, the qualifying of
perſons to propheſie: For the Prophets of old
did uſually receive the matter of Propheſie by
Dreams or Viſions, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>If there be a
Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my
ſelf known unto him in a Viſion, and will ſpeak
unto him in a Dream,</hi> Hoſ. 12. 10. And it
was not unuſual for Prophets then to fore-tell
Evangelical Events in an Old-Teſtament Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.
And when 'tis ſaid the Spirit ſhould be
poured out upon <hi>all fleſh,</hi> it is not meant of
all perſons in the world without exception;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95744:26"/>
for it was never given unto all perſons to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
taking <hi>all</hi> in ſo large a ſence, but to
perſons of <hi>all ſorts</hi> both for Sex and Age, Sons
and Daughters, old men and young, yea Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Handmaids alſo, as they are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
expreſt in the Text: and theſe not of
the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but on the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, as
the Event ſhews; which was new to the
world.</p>
            <p>2. The Application of this Propheſie to
the Event, plainly ſhews that the End for
which a Promiſe of this pouring out of the
Spirit was made, was to enable ſome to teach
others. For the event of this Propheſie, in
which it received its completion, was the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the Spirit in extraordinary and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
gifts upon the Apoſtles and Diſciples
on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and for ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This appears by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s application
of that Propheſie to this very Event, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 16.
<hi>This is that,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which was ſpoken by the
Prophet Joel,</hi> &amp;c. And that thoſe miraculous
Gifts were poured out on ſome to enable them
to teach others, will appear in theſe two things,
not to inſtance in more. Firſt, the Gift of
ſpeaking divers Tongues, which was one of
them, was to enable them to declare the things
of the Goſpel to people of all Nations,
Tongues and Languages, in their own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Tongue
wherein they were born. Upon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95744:26"/>
the uſe of this gift thoſe of every Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heaven then reſident at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaid,
<hi>We do hear them ſpeak in</hi> our <hi>Tongues the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
works of God,</hi> Acts 2. 11. By this Gift
the Apoſtles were prepared to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
to all Nations, to every Creature, as Chriſt
afterwards commiſſioned them to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As by this Gift of Tongues they
could and did propagate the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the
Goſpel to them that never heard of it before;
ſo by this, as by other miraculous Gifts of
the Spirit, was <hi>Belief</hi> of the Goſpel procured
from them to whom it was made known. For
hereby they knew, or had reaſon to believe,
that perſons thus qualified were ſent of God,
and the Doctrine they brought was from God,
<hi>John</hi> 3. 2. <hi>We know that thou art a Teacher come
from God; for no man can do theſe Miracles that
thou doſt, except God be with him.</hi> In which
reſpect, this and other miraculous Gifts were
called ſigns, and ſigns of what? but that the
perſons ſo qualified, and their Doctrine were
of God. Tongues, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are for a
ſign to thoſe that believe not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 22.
They were teaching Signs, they taught thoſe
to believe the Goſpel, who did not believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Signs and Wonders done by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and others, were thoſe things by which
God gave teſtimony to the Word of his Grace,
as it is <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 3. <hi>Theſe ſigns,</hi> ſaid our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95744:27"/>
               <hi>ſhall follow thoſe that believe in my name;
in my name they ſhall caſt out Devils, they ſhall
ſpeak with new Tongues,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 17.
And in <hi>v,</hi> 20. They, the Apoſtles, <hi>went forth,
and preached every where; the Lord working
with them, and</hi> confirming <hi>the Word with Signs
following.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>God alſo</hi> bearing
them witneſs <hi>with Signs and Wonders, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own will.</hi> Truly, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the
<hi>Signs of an Apoſtle</hi> were wrought among you,
in <hi>Signs and Wonders, and mighty Deeds,</hi>
2 Cor. 12. 12. Theſe were teaching Signs by
which the Apoſtles were known to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
Meſſengers ſent by God, and their Word
and Doctrine to be the Meſſage which God
ſent by them. Theſe miraculous powers of
the Spirit of God viſible in the Apoſtles, and
thoſe that received their Doctrine, were that
which procured ſuch wonderful ſucceſs to the
preaching of the Goſpel, notwithſtanding the
fierceſt oppoſition of Adverſaries. The very firſt
day in which the Goſpel ſet out armed, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with theſe powers, it brought in of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
no leſs than 3000 Souls: and ſo went forth
conquering and to conquer from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and
throughout all <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> and to
the uttermoſt parts of the Earth. I will not dare,
ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſpeak of any of thoſe things
which Chriſt hath not wrought by me to make
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95744:27"/>
the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed (by
the word preached, and the mighty deeds that
did accompany it) through mighty Signs
and Wonders by the power of the Spirit of
God; ſo that from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to <hi>Illyricum,</hi> I have fully preached
the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>That which made the Goſpel the more <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,</hi>
as coming from God; and the more
<hi>ſucceſsful</hi> in bringing in multitudes of new
Converts, and in <hi>confirming</hi> and eſtabliſhing
thoſe who were already converted, was in
that the holy Spirit was ſhed abroad in thoſe
Miraculous Gifts, not only upon the Apoſtles
that preached that Doctrine; but alſo upon
thoſe that received it, and believed it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as well as on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> And
that the more credit might be thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to the Apoſtles in their Meſſage from
God to men, the holy Ghoſt in extraordinary
gifts was given to the Diſciples after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
by the laying on of the Apoſtles hands.
Thus at <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Believers converted by
<hi>Philip,</hi> received the holy Ghoſt, not by the
laying on of his hands, but of the hands of
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Acts 8. 17. And that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the holy Ghoſt in ſome viſible effects, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
in that it is ſaid that when <hi>Simon ſaw</hi>
that through the laying on of the Apoſtles
hands, the Holy Ghoſt was given, he offered
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95744:28"/>
them Money for the like power. What, to
confer inward ſpiritual Grace? No; that was
not the thing which he ſaw or could ſee the
Apoſtles do; nor is it probable that he deſired
it. Likewiſe thoſe Believers at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when
<hi>Paul</hi> had laid his hands on them, the Holy
Ghoſt came on them, and they ſpake with
tongues, and propheſied, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 6. Thus it
is ſaid of them, that <hi>after</hi> they believed, they
were <hi>ſealed with the Holy Spirit of Promiſe,</hi>
as the earneſt of the future Inheritance, and
purchaſed poſſeſſion, they continuing in the
belief and practice of that Goſpel that came
thus confirmed to them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14. At
the very firſt indeed it ſhould ſeem the Holy
Ghoſt fell on the Believers thus without laying
on of the Apoſtles hands; as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. &amp; 10.
44. But afterwards we have ſeen how it was.
The Spirit in ſome extraordinary gifts was
poured on ſome of the Prophets of old; but
we never read that it was in ſuch ſort
poured out on them that believed their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
likewiſe, as now it was upon thoſe that
received the Apoſtles Doctrine. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch a thing as this was foretold by the
Prophets, as peculiar to the coming of the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> and as that by which he might be
known to be come when the event of ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
took place, even as it came to paſs
here. The Prediction, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28. was, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95744:28"/>
in the <hi>laſt days</hi> the Spirit ſhould be poured out
upon all fleſh; in the <hi>laſt days,</hi> that is, in the
laſt days of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
(as may be evinced by the Context)
i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which Chriſt came, as was foretold by his
Prophets; in which time alſo the Spirit was
poured out in miraculous gifts and operations,
as a teſtimony that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was come. The
Holy Spirit in the effects of it in theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
gifts and operations, is called the
<hi>teſtifying</hi> of Chriſt, or the <hi>witneſs</hi> which he
bore touching his being the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and
Saviour of the world, <hi>John</hi> 15. 26, 27. But
when he, the Comforter, is come <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> even the
Spirit of Truth—he ſhall <hi>teſtifie</hi> of me,
and ye alſo (Apoſtles) ſhall bear witneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

And again, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 6. This is he that
came by water and blood—and it is the
Spirit that beareth <hi>witneſs,</hi> becauſe the Spirit
is truth. <hi>John</hi> 16. 8. <hi>And when he</hi> (the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter)
<hi>is come, he will convince the world of
ſin, becauſe they believe not on me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt;
<hi>of Righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to my Father,</hi>
(was taken up into heaven) <hi>and of Judgment,
becauſe the Prince of this world is judged:</hi> the
Devil dethroned and caſt down, as he was
when the Mouths of his Oracles were ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and the Idol-Temples ſhut up, and his
Kingdom and Rule demoliſhed by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95744:29"/>
of the Goſpel among the Heathen, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with theſe Miraculous Effects of the
Spirit, which bore down all before it, as it
were; and therefore this is called the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the Spirit and Power; as oppoſed
to Humane Oratory among Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and the way of Humane Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. This wonderful effuſion of
the Spirit in miraculous Gifts, was that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
of the Spirit we read of, which you with
ſome others, have in theſe days, vainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to under another Notion, of being
baptized with the Spirit. But if you will but
compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. and <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 5. with <hi>Act.</hi>
2. 3, 4. and 11. 15, 16. you may eaſily diſcern
your Error in applying it to any thing but to
that extraordinary and miraculous effuſion of
the Spirit.</p>
            <p>By all this you may ſee how one Scripture
falls in with, and explains another, if you
will but take hold of a right Notion of the
end for which the plentiful effuſion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was foretold and promiſed. Which was
not to guide all Chriſtians by its inward moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without outward teaching, but to enable
ſome to teach the right Faith and Life to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
even to thoſe of other Tongues, in
their own Language; and to confirm their
Doctrine thereby, and by other operations of
the Spirit to be from God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:95744:29"/>
And theſe extraordidary effects of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
were greatly neceſſary to accompany the
firſt promulgation and planting of the Goſpel
in the world, to procure credit to it, belief of
it from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who otherwiſe would not
have been taken off from their old way of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical
&amp; Ceremonial worſhip, which they had
received from God: and from the Gentile-Nations,
who otherwiſe would not have been
taken off from their Idolatrous and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
way of Worſhip in which they had been
deeply rooted by long and ancient Tradition,
received from their Forefathers. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, as was obſerved before,
that Tongues, that is, the gift of ſpeaking
divers Tongues on a ſudden, are <hi>a ſign, not to
them that believe, but to them that believe not;</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 22. As the giving of the Law by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> was accompanied with Signs and
Wonders which were wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> both
before and after the firſt promulgation of it,
to procure belief from the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he was
ſent of God, and that the Law given by him,
was from God: So it was as neceſſary that
the firſt promulgation of the Goſpel by the
Son of God himſelf, and by thoſe that were
immediately ſent by him, ſhould be, for the
ſame reaſon, accompanied with more and
greater Miracles and Wonders, than thoſe
wrought by <hi>Moſes</hi> were; as Chriſt himſelf
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95744:30"/>
was greater than <hi>Moſes;</hi> and as the abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Old, and the giving of the New
Law, was more than the giving of the Law
only, when there was no promulgate Law
before in being. And therefore our Saviour
ſaid of the <hi>Jews</hi> that would not receive his
Doctrine, but ſtill ſtuck to the Letter of the
Law of <hi>Moſes; If I had not done among them
the works which none other man hath done, they
had not had ſin,</hi> John 15. 24. And as it was
not neceſſary to continue thoſe or the like Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
and Wonders in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Law had been well eſtabliſhed by them;
but that the Law being once committed to
writing, might be, as it was, their ſtanding
Rule of Worſhip and Converſation: Even ſo
after the Goſpel had received a ſufficient atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
to be from God, by the continuance of
thoſe miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt in
the Church for ſome time, till the Doctrine
and Hiſtory of the Goſpel were committed to
writing, and thoſe Writings owned as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Records every where by the Church,
in all known parts of the world; it was then
no more neceſſary, as the event ſhews, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate
Miracles in the Chriſtian Church, for
the confirmation of the Goſpel, than it was
to perpetuate them in the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> for the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the Law; but that the Doctrine
and Hiſtory of the Goſpel in Books of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95744:30"/>
New Teſtament, ſhould be of like uſe to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
as the Law and Prophets in Books was
to the <hi>Jews</hi> of old.</p>
            <p>The Prophets of old, who though they
were extraordinarily inſpired, did all along,
in their time, call the <hi>Jews</hi> to obedience to the
written Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to Repentance for
tranſgreſſing that. And when propheſying in
this ſence, was to ceaſe from among them,
for ſeveral Ages, God by <hi>Malachy,</hi> the laſt of
thoſe Prophets, gave it in charge to that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to remember the written Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
as that by which they were to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<hi>Remember,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
my Servant, which I commanded him in</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb
<hi>for all Iſrael, with the Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
Mal. 4. 4.</p>
            <p>And it was foretold by <hi>Moſes,</hi> concerning
Chriſt, that a Prophet ſhould be raiſed up by
God, <hi>like</hi> unto him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15, 18. And
although Chriſt that Prophet was <hi>unlike</hi> unto
<hi>Moſes</hi> in many other things wherein our Lord
excelled him, yet he was truly <hi>like</hi> unto him
in this, <hi>viz.</hi> in that he as Mediator, gave forth
the Evangelical Law at his Appearance in the
world, as that which was to be the ſtanding
Rule unto Chriſtians throughout the whole
duration of the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> as
<hi>Moſes,</hi> who alſo was a Mediator in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
had delivered a ſtanding Law to the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95744:31"/>
               <hi>Jews,</hi> by which they were to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
throughout their Generations, and the
Adminiſtration of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Covenant.</p>
            <p>By what hath been ſaid touching the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
effuſion of the Spirit upon the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of the Goſpel into the world, you
may ſee (if Prejudice do not blindfold you)
that what was done in that kind, is ſo far
from giving any countenance to your Opinion
of the Spirit's being given to teach men imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by internal Illmination and Operation,
without outward Miniſtry and Teaching, that
it is an evident proof of the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For the Spirit was thus given to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
and others, that they might propagate
the Chriſtian Faith in the world, being ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
thereby to make it known to them of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Languages, in their own Tongues, and
to embolden them to run all hazards in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(for they being filled with the Holy Ghoſt,
ſpake the Word of God with all boldneſs,
<hi>Acts</hi> 4. 31.) And likewiſe to convince the
World that Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and their
Doctrine, were all from God. All which
was done by Vocal Teaching, and Viſible
Signs, not excluding the Inward Aſſiſtance of
divine Grace: All which would have been need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
if God had choſen to teach men by the
Light of Chriſt within only, as you ſpeak. So
that either your Enthuſiaſtical Notion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95744:31"/>
God's Method of proceeding to teach
men the Chriſtian Religion, or elſe his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
overthrows your Notion; for doubtleſs
they are contrary one to another; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be better to follow God or man, judge
you!</p>
            <p>§ 15. Another place miſunderſtood and
miſapplied by you, is, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. <hi>When the
Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into
all Truth.</hi> Which is not a Promiſe of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Spirit to guide <hi>all Chriſtians</hi> by its <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi>
motions; but a Promiſe to his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;</hi>
for they only were then preſent with
Chriſt at the Paſſeover, juſt before his Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
and Suffering.</p>
            <p>And this, and other like Promiſes of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Spirit, were made to them, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them the better to bear his departure
from them; giving them to know thereby,
how they ſhould be enabled when he ſhould be
taken from them, to carry on the great work
of Apoſtleſhip, to which he had choſen them.
And this he did, firſt by giving them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that this Spirit ſhould bring all things
to their remembrance which he had ſpoken
unto them while he was yet with them.
2. That this Spirit of his ſhould teach
them all things in which Chriſt himſelf had
not inſtructed them while he was with them,
inaſmuch as they were not then able to bear
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95744:32"/>
them. 3. That this Spirit (to wit, in his
miraculous Gifts) ſhould concur with them
in teſtifying of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. <hi>But the
Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the
Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall bring all
things to your remembrance whatſoever I have
ſaid unto you.</hi> John 16. 12, 13. <hi>I have yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear
them now: Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of
Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth,
and he will ſhew you things to come.</hi> Chap. 14.
26. <hi>He ſhall teach you all things.</hi> Chap. 15. 26,
27. <hi>But when the Comforter is come, whom I
will ſend unto you from the Father, he ſhall
teſtifie of me; and ye alſo ſhall bear witneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ye have been with me from the beginning.</hi>
This agrees exactly with what he ſaid again to
them after he was riſen, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 8. Ye <hi>ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, and ye ſhall be Witneſſes unto me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And that theſe Predictions and Promiſes of
ſending the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, the
better to qualifie them for their great Work,
and Office, began to be made good to them in
thoſe extraordinary Gifts which were poured
out on them on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and that
Chriſt's Prediction of the coming of the Holy
Ghoſt did refer to that, appears by what Sr.
<hi>Peter</hi> ſaid in his Sermon upon that occaſion,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 33, <hi>Therefore being by the right hand of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95744:32"/>
God exalted, and having received of the Father
the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth
this which ye now ſee and hear,</hi> the Spirit in
its ſenſible effects. Compare herewith <hi>Acts</hi>
1. 4, 5. <hi>Wait for the Promiſe of the Father, which,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>(Jeſus) which ye have</hi> [heard of me]—<hi>ye
ſhall he baptized with the Holy Ghoſt not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
days hence.</hi> The giving of the Spirit <hi>thus,</hi> was
purpoſely reſerved for the honour and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Chriſt's Exaltation in Glory; but the
Spirit to ſanctifie, was given before: <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe Jeſus was not
yet glorified,</hi> John 7. 39.</p>
            <p>But the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt to theſe
ends, is greatly remote from the end you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
thereof, as hath alſo been ſhewn before;
and which you may eaſily ſee by what hath
been here repreſented to you, if the Light
which was once in you, be not become Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Your applying Promiſes, as if made
to all Chriſtians as Chriſtians, and to common
and ordinary caſes, which were made to the
Apoſtles only, or to them and ſome others in
extraordinary caſes, peculiar to perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
qualified, and extraordinarily
ſent, hath led you and ſome others into very
dangerous errors, that have made very bad
work in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>§ 16. <hi>Another Scripture which you are
wont frequently to produce in defence of this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95744:33"/>
Opinion of yours, touching the Spirits inward
Teaching without outward Teaching by man,
is,</hi> 1 John 2. 20. But ye have an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from
the Holy One, and ye know all things. <hi>And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
ver. 27. But the Anointing which ye have
received of him, abideth in you, and ye need
not that any man teach you; but as the ſame
Anointing teacheth you of all things, and is
Truth, and is no Lie; and even as it hath taught
you, ye ſhall abide in him.</p>
            <p>Whatever the right ſence of this Scripture
is, 'tis certain your Notion of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's
teaching men (that live under the Goſpel,
as thoſe did to whom theſe words were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
whatever they ought to believe and do
without any outward Teaching by Speech or
Writing, cannot be the ſence of it; becauſe
ſuch a ſence of the place is inconſiſtent with
what is manifeſtly proved in my Propoſitions
before laid down; and becauſe it would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the deſign of St. <hi>John</hi> in this Epiſtle and
other Writings of his, needleſs, in which he
labours to ſettle and firmly eſtabliſh the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in the Belief and Practice of what they
had heard, and by hearing had been taught
from the beginning, againſt all Temptations
to Apoſtacy from, or Looſneſs in the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſtianity. But if we conſider upon
what occaſion theſe words are here brought
in, and compare them alſo with what we find
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95744:33"/>
in ſome other Scriptures, it will be no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to underſtand the Apoſtles ſcope in them.</p>
            <p>He had obſerved to them in the 18. v. that
even then <hi>there were many Antichriſts.</hi> And in
<hi>ver.</hi> 19. that they, thoſe many Antichriſts,
<hi>went out from them:</hi> And his ſcope in the reſt
of the <hi>Chap.</hi> is to fortify and antidote them
againſt the poyſonous pretenſions of thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts,
who as he deſcribes them in <hi>ver.</hi>
22, <hi>did deny that Jeſus was the Chriſt.</hi> That
this was here his ſcope and deſign, appears by
<hi>ver.</hi> 26. where he ſaith, <hi>theſe things have I
written unto you concerning thoſe that ſeduce you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the means he makes uſe of to preſerve
them under this danger; and to eſtabliſh them,
is by putting them in remembrance by what
means they at the firſt came to be perſwaded of
the truth of that Doctrine, by which they were
taught that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Chriſt, and that was
by pouring out the Holy-Ghoſt in viſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
upon the Apoſtles that taught it, and upon
thoſe that believed it, and conſequently upon
themſelves, by which the truth of it was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
confirmed to them as coming from God.</p>
            <p>For that doubtleſs is meant by the <hi>anointing</hi>
here ſpoken of. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf in reſpect
of the Spirit of glory that appeared in him by
his Doctrine and Miracles, was ſaid to be <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Holy Ghoſt and with power,</hi> Act, 10.
38. As it was foretold by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95744:34"/>
ſaying, <hi>the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe
he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the
Poor,</hi> Iſa. 61. 1. Luke 4. 18. and ſo in like
manner the pouring out of the Holy Ghoſt in
miraculous gifts, both upon the Apoſtles and
believers for the confirmation of the Doctrine
the one preached, and the other believed, is
elſewhere called, their being anointed by God,
as here alſo it is called the Unction of the holy
one, which is the ſame thing 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21, 22.
<hi>Now he that eſtabliſheth us with you into Chriſt,
and hath anointed us, is God; who hath alſo ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us, and given the earneſt of the Spirit in our
hearts.</hi> By this it appears that both Apoſtles
and other believers were eſtabliſhed into Chriſt
by the anointing of God upon them, which
anointing was his pouring out of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<hi>Ye have an unction from the Holy one, and
ye know all things.</hi> Not that by this Unction
the common Chriſtians were immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
with the knowledge of all truths, but
that by it they were aſſured of the truth of all
things which the Apoſtles had taught them;
and conſequently muſt needs know thereby
that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe that was one
of the principal Doctrines which they taught,
and taught all they did teach in the name of
him as ſuch. As they were induced at the firſt
to believe the Doctrine to be from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they perceived the anointing of God to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95744:34"/>
be upon them that preached it; ſo they were
afterwards confirmed in the truth of it, becauſe
upon their receiving of it, they themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
received of the ſame anointing. It is not
ſaid that this anointing did teach them all
things, but that it did teach them [of] all
things, that is, of, or concerning the truth of all
things to which it was a witneſs or evidence as I
have ſhewed it was to the Apoſtles Doctrine
from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4. 5. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 20. and other places.</p>
            <p>When then this Apoſtle ſays ye have an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from the holy one, and ye know all
things; he did not intend thereby to tell them
that all things they were to beleive and do,
were <hi>revealed</hi> to them by it, but that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
by which they were taught all things
neceſſary to their ſalvation, was thereby <hi>atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi>
to be from God, appears evidently by that
which he perſwades them to by it in <hi>v.</hi> 24. and
that was that the Doctrine which they had
heard from the beginning, might therefore be
retained and held faſt by them that had been ſo
ratified and confirmed to them by the Unction
they had from the Holy one. <hi>Let that therefore
abide in you which you have heard from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:
if that which ye have heard from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
ſhall remain in you, ye alſo ſhall continue
in the Son and in the Father.</hi> Agreeable to
what he ſays alſo in his ſecond <hi>Epiſtle verſe</hi> 9.
<hi>He that abideth in the Doctrine of Chriſt, he
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95744:35"/>
hath both the Father and the Son.</hi> And therefore
when he ſays again, <hi>ye need not that any man
teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you
of all things and is truth, and is no lie,</hi> he
doth not thereby mean that they needed no
farther teaching by man for their eſtabliſhment
and building up in the Faith: for if he had, he
had contradicted himſelf in what he was now
doing in this <hi>Chap.</hi> and all along in this <hi>Epiſtle.</hi>
And therefore his meaning muſt be, that they
needed not from him or any other man, any
teaching that could, or could reaſonably pretend
to give them greater aſſurance of any thing,
than that anointing gave them of <hi>Jeſus</hi> his
being the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of the truth of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which they had heard from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
for that anointing ſaith he, is truth and
is no lie, but ſuch as could not deceive them,
it being God's witneſs from Heaven. And
from thence concludes, ſaying, that as it hath
taught you, ye ſhall abide in him. As if he
ſhould have ſaid: as this anointing did at the
firſt prevail with you to receive <hi>Jeſus</hi> as the
true <hi>Meſſias;</hi> ſo for the ſame cauſe I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>you
will (as you have the greateſt reaſon) ſtill
abide in him, notwithſtanding all pretences of
Seducers to take you off.</p>
            <p>This then being the ſcope and drift of the
Apoſtle in this place, to which the ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
here uſed are accommodated, and by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95744:35"/>
which they are to be interpreted and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
how I pray you will you find your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
here, of the Spirits inward teaching of all
things without any outward teaching? You
are wont to ſay that the Scriptures are not to
be underſtood but by the ſame Spirit that gave
them forth. And the Spirit doubtleſs is not
wanting to aſſiſt the ſincere endeavours of men
in ſearching after the ſence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in order to practice. But truly if we
ſhould judge of mens having the Spirit by their
underſtanding the Scriptures, I think there
would be as little reaſon to think you have the
Spirit, as any ſort of men that have read the
Scriptures, for doubtleſs there are ſcarce any
ſort of men if any at all, that do more groſly
miſunderſtand and miſapply, and ſo abuſe the
Scriptures, than you do, and that under the
greateſt confidence too of being guided in your
ſence and notions of them by the Spirit of
God. You take the ſound of words in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which, as you fancy, comport with your
notions and opinions:, and then apply them to
your purpoſe, and then are confident the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit hath guided you therein. When-as
alas you do not underſtand the intent or deſign
of the Writer in the places where ſuch expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions
are, no nor, as is to be feared, do you
make it your buſineſs to underſtand it, but think
your buſineſs is rather to ſit ſtill and to expect
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95744:36"/>
the immediate teachings of the Spirit, and then
conclude your conceptions which firſt offer
themſelves to you, to be his teachings. And
on the other hand conclude all rational oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is made againſt you by ſuch as have
taken pains to conſider the ſcope and coherence
of Scripture, to be the iſſues of fleſhly wiſdom
and carnal reaſon. So that I know not which
is more to be pitied, your ignorance or your
confidence: but certain it is that you are to
be pittied for both.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable that when <hi>Solomon</hi> (a man
wiſer in his generation than any of you are in
yours) had a promiſe from God of being made
wiſe above all that were before him, did not
therefore think himſelf unconcerned in labour
and diligent ſearch to attain it, but ſaid, <hi>I gave
my heart to ſeek and ſearch out by wiſdome concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all things that are done under heaven: this
ſore travel,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath God given to the Sons
of men to be exerciſed therewith,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 13.
And as he ſaith the bleſſing of the Lord maketh
rich, in one place; ſo he ſaith the diligent hand
maketh rich, in another, from which may fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be collected, that the bleſſing of God in the
diligent uſe of due means, is the way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
in the world. And it is as true in the
courſe of attaining to ſpiritual riches in
underſtanding and grace, as it is in temporals.
And therefore he ſaith again in reference to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95744:36"/>
that: <hi>if thou cryeſt after knowledge and lifteſt up
thy voice for underſtanding: if thou ſeekeſt her as
ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid Treaſures:
then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord and
find the knowledge of God, for the Lord giueth
wiſdome: out of his mouth proceedeth knowledge
and underſtanding:</hi> that is he gives ſuch wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
unto men uſually upon thoſe terms fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
Prov. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>But your rare notions, like <hi>Jacobs</hi> Veniſon, are
uſually too ſoon &amp; too eaſily come by to be right.</p>
            <p>§. 17. But becauſe I would not be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
I ſhall, I think in reference to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in hand, conſider but one or two places
of Scripture more, at which you ſtumble, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
others fall in upon occaſion of diſcuſſing
thoſe. And one of them is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>As
many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
Sons of God.</hi> And you ſuppoſe this comports
with your wild notion of mens being guided by
the internal teachings of the Spirit, without
outward teaching. But why I pray you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
outward teaching? Do you not know that
the whole Goſpel preached by Chriſt and his
Apoſtles, and afterwards written, is the Iſſue
or product of the Spirit? Is not all the Holy
<hi>Scripture</hi> given by <hi>inſpiration of God?</hi> Did not
the holy men of old (the Prophets) ſpeak and
write as they were <hi>moved by the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> and
do not you your ſelves ſay that the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:95744:37"/>
cannot be underſtood but by the <hi>ſame Spirit that
gave them forth?</hi> by which you ſuppoſe and
grant that they were given forth by the Spirit.
And for what end did the Holy Spirit inſpire the
Apoſtles firſt to preach, and after that to write
the Holy Doctrine of the Goſpel, but to teach
men thereby what to beleive and how to live
that they might be ſaved? And if ſo, are not
all thoſe who are led and guided by this Goſpel
which is the Doctrine of the Holy Spirit, led
by the Spirit of God?</p>
            <p>There's no doubt but that the Spirit by its
inward operations upon the minds of men doth
concur with that teaching of his which is from
without by the Scriptures, and by men from
the Scriptures. But methinks it's wonderful!
I mean wonderfully abſurd that you ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Spirits teaching and leading, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his inward to his outward teaching.
Whereas the Lord hath declared expreſly that
his word outwardly, and Spirit ſhall be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
in carrying on his deſign of grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the world under the Goſpel, as that they
ſhall never be ſeparated, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 59. 21. <hi>As for me
this is my Covenant with them ſaith the Lord; my
Spirit that is upon thee and my words</hi> which I
have put in <hi>thy mouth,</hi> ſhall not depart out of
thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy Seed,
nor out of the of mouth thy Seeds Seed, ſaith the
Lord, from hence forth and for ever, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 123.)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95744:37"/>
By which and by other Scriptures, I know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
that whatever inward teaching by the
Spirit you pretend to, yet the Holy Spirit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
taught you to believe or to ſay that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
inward teaching only, without any outward
teaching by the Scriptures or by men, is the
rule of Faith and Practice, whatever other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
it is that taught it you, the which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
you more than me to examine. For the
Spirit having ſaid thus much by this holy man
of God in this Place (for he as all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſpake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghoſt) I am ſure he hath ſaid nothing to the
contrary in any other; for the word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the Spirit of truth, <hi>is not yea and
nay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>if ye are
led by the Spirit ye are not under the Law;</hi> he
did not mean, if they were led by the inward
guidance of the Spirit without the outward
conduct of the Goſpel, but under the word
Spirit here, he oppoſeth the Goſpel to the Law.
And his meaning was, that if they gave up
themſelves to the conduct of the Spirit by the
Goſpel, they ſhould not need to make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſtill of the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes's</hi> Law, as
Circumciſion or the like, as ſome among them
did, from which he had been dehorting them
in the begining of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:95744:38"/>
This Goſpel is called the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of
Life in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> which frees thoſe that walk
after it, and not after the Fleſh, <hi>from the Law
of Sin and Death,</hi> Rom. 8. 1, 2. And where
this Goſpel is received into the heart ſo as that
it is predominant there, there Chriſt dwells
and the Spirit dwells by that word of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
And thus <hi>Chriſt is in men the hope of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>
and thus <hi>Chriſt dwells in the heart by Faith,</hi>
by Faith in his word: and thoſe live and <hi>walk
in the Light,</hi> that live and walk according to
this word: and thus they <hi>abide in Chriſt, that
have his word abiding in them:</hi> and thoſe that
<hi>abide in the Doctrine of Chriſt, have both the
Father and the Son:</hi> and <hi>they are ſpiritually mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
whoſe minds are powerfully influenced by
the Goſpel: and they <hi>reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
who reſiſt that word which hath been declared
by motion and inſpiration from him: So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable
are the Word and Spirit in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Chriſtians to happineſs.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to <hi>be filled
with the Spirit.</hi> in order to their ſpeaking to
themſelves in Pſalms, and Hymnes and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Songs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18, 19. and the <hi>Coloſſians</hi>
that they would <hi>let the word of Chriſt dwell in
them richly,</hi> in order to the ſame end, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.
16. From both which paſſages compared it
appears, that the Word of Chriſt which is the
Goſpel, and the Spirit, do concur and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95744:38"/>
in producing the ſame Spiritual effects in
men: Yea, it ſeems they are ſo unanimous in
their operation in reference hereto, that when
but one is named, the other is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
or elſe that the variation of expreſſion,
is but another word for the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſo plain throughout the
current of the Scriptures; your bold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
aſſertion to the contrary, diſcovers your
very great unskilfulneſs in the nature of the
Evangelical Diſpenſation, and your utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency
and unfitneſs to take upon you to
teach others, and that you need rather your
ſelves to be taught the firſt principles of the
Doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>§. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11. is another place
which you would conſtrain to ſerve your turn,
and to make it evident that under the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
God himſelf doth ſo inwardly teach
men and write his Laws in their hearts, that
they need no outward teaching what to believe
or do, by any other means: becauſe it is there
ſaid, <hi>I will put or give my Laws into their minds
and write them in their hearts: and they ſhall
not teach every man his Neighbour, and every man
his Brother; ſaying, know the Lord; for all
ſhall know me from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> But
when you can but obtain of your ſelves ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
and impartially to conſider for what end
God hath ſet in his Church firſt Apoſtles, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95744:39"/>
then Paſtors and <hi>Teachers,</hi> if not to teach men
what to know, believe and do that they may
be ſaved; I doubt not but you will then find
it neceſſary to underſtand this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſo as that it may not run counter to, and
contradict the whole current of Scripture, elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
as it will if your ſence of it take place,
as I have already ſhewed at large. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeeing your ſence of it cannot ſtand unleſs
the general teſtimony of the Scriptures fall; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſence of it muſt of neceſſity be accepted
of.</p>
            <p>Theſe words then as noting the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the ſecond Covenant from the firſt,
are a form of ſpeech to ſet forth after a
rhetorical way, how plainly and eaſily to
be underſtood, the mind of God touching
the Salvation of men, ſhall be revealed and
made known under the Goſpel, in compariſon
of what it was before. Before and under the
old Covenant it was but obſcurely made
known by dark Propheſies, (which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaid to be <hi>a light ſhining in a dark place,</hi>
2. Pet. 1. 19.) and under types and figures
and literal repreſentations, ſo that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not <hi>ſee to the end</hi> of thoſe
things which are now aboliſhed: they could
rarely and not without much difficulty and
uncertainty, if at all, underſtand the end or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of them, or what was ſignified by them,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95744:39"/>
till the Goſpel came and revealed them. And
therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, before Faith came, we
were kept under the Law, <hi>ſhut up</hi> unto the
Faith, which ſhould <hi>afterwards be revealed,</hi> Gal.
3. 23. So that by all the teaching they had
though there were Precept upon Precept, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
upon Precept, Line upon Line, Line up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Line, here a little and there a little, as the
Prophet ſpeaks, yet they had and could have
but a dim and very imperfect ſight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of what is now revealed in the Goſpel.
And therefore its ſaid of the Prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who having their predictions by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
revelation from God, were like to
know more in this kind than any other in
thoſe times, yet its ſaid of them that when they
Propheſied of the Grace that ſhould come to
them that are under the Goſpel, though they
<hi>enquired diligently what</hi> as well as <hi>what manner
of time the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them
did ſignifie, when it teſtified before hand the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of Chriſt and the glory that ſhould follow,</hi>
yet I ſay 'tis ſaid of them, <hi>that not unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
but unto us they did Miniſter the things
which are reported by them that have preached the
Goſpel, with the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
1. Pet. 1. 10, 11, 12. In this reſpect it
was ſaid, though none of the Prophets were
greater than <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> yet the leaſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95744:40"/>
in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.
This was their Caſe then.</p>
            <p>But now by the Goſpel the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Chriſt, and the terms and conditions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which it is promiſed, are ſo nakedly, plainly
and clearly revealed, and fitted to mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
and capacities, that ſo much as is
neceſſary to Salvation, may very eaſily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by perſons of very ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
capacities, and without much teaching; as
appears by thoſe that were converted and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
(as the Jaylor and his Houſhold, and the
three thouſand in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.) with little teaching.
Upon account of which clear revelation, its
ſaid, we all with <hi>open face</hi> behold as in a Glaſs
the Glory of the Lord: the Glory of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Goodneſs, Grace and Mercy, in the way
of Salvation now exhibited in the Goſpel, 2.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Upon account of this difference it
is I conceive that St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>the darkneſs is
paſt, and the true Light now ſhineth,</hi> 1 Joh.
2. 8.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Laws and terms of the New
Covenant, are not only fitted to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
and capacities of all ſorts of perſons
by the plainneſs of the Revelation of them;
but are ſuch alſo in the very nature of them as
that they commend themſelves to every mans
acceptation and choice, and are every whit as
worthy to be embraced by their wills, as they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95744:40"/>
are eaſie to be underſtood by the reaſon of their
minds.</p>
            <p>A great part of the Laws of the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which were but figurative of the terms of
the New, had little or nothing in them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
themſelves to mens acceptation and
choice, ſo long as their Symbolical nature was
not underſtood, ſave what the authority of
God in commanding them gave them. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
Sacrificing, legal waſhings, and
Purifications and the like, were in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
but beggarly Elements when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God for the obſervation of them, was
taken off: And not only ſo, but they were a
Yoke, which as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, neither we nor
our Fathers were able to bear; a Yoke of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them. Whereas moſt of
the Precepts of the Goſpel, the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
there, are deſirable in themſelves, if
they had not been commanded by a promulgate
Law: To love and worſhip God; to repent of
that which hath been ill done, to be ſober, chaſt,
and temperate: to do to others as we would be
done to our ſelves in point of equity, fidelity
and charity: to be humble and meek, patient
and contented, and the like, are things that
tend to the peace and ſatisfaction of the minde,
to the health of the body and long life, to a
mans Credit, Reputation, and thriving in the
World, and to the good of humane Society;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95744:41"/>
Beſides their certain relation to a future happy
State. And there is no man that acts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the beſt reaſon of his minde, but would
chuſe theſe things though you ſhould ſuppoſe
him under no expreſs command to do it, and
though there were no Heaven promiſed or Hell
threatened. But when you conſider the great
reward in another World that is promiſed to a
faithful obſervance of the Laws of Chriſt and
to a belief in him; and the dreadful threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
againſt ſuch as deſpiſe and neglect them,
it makes them yet far more deſirable and eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
becauſe as it is natural for every man to
deſire the happineſs and perfection of his own
being, ſo it is agreeable to the higheſt reaſon in
man to chuſe the means that tend thereto, and
ſuch is our obedience to the Goſpel. And theſe
rewards which are ſuch mighty motives to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
are far more clearly revealed and
brought into open Light by the Goſpel, than
they were before; which makes the Goſpel
far more effectual to perſwade to Holy Living,
than the Law could be. <hi>The Law made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope
did, by which we draw nigh unto God, Heb.</hi> 7. 19.</p>
            <p>Theſe two things forementioned then, the
<hi>eaſineſs of underſtanding</hi> God's way and method
of Salvation from the plainneſs and fulneſs of
the revelation of it under the New Covenant,
by which it is fitted to every capacity, and the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95744:41"/>
               <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nnate goodneſs of the Laws thereof,</hi> in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with the promiſe of eternal Life made to
the obſervance of them, by which they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
compleatly fitted to attract and draw mens
wills to accept, embrace and chuſe them; theſe
I ſay are the things I conceive foretold in that
Propheſie, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. here cited in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thoſe expreſſions of God's putting, giving or
conveying his Laws into the mind and writing
them in the heart, ſo that they ſhall not teach
every man his Neighbour, and every man his
Brother, &amp;c. And when it is ſo ſaid, it is not
then ſaid that they ſhall not be taught neither
by Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, or Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;
but they ſhall not teach every man his
Neighbour and every man his Brother. And
though the Phraſe here uſed ſeem abſolute in
ſound, yet it may well be underſtood in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
ſence, as other expeſſions in Scripture
of like nature ſometimes muſt be. As when
its ſaid <hi>labour not for the meat that periſheth, but
for that meat which endureth to everlaſting Life,</hi>
Joh. 6. 26. The meaning here of labour not,
is labour not ſo much. And ſo again; <hi>I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Mercy and not. Sacrifice,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 6. the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, I deſired Mercy more than Sacrifice, or
Sacrifice not ſo much as Mercy. So again <hi>Eph.</hi>
6. 12. <hi>we wreſtle not with fleſh and blood,</hi> that
is, not only or not ſo much, but againſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo here, when it is ſaid
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95744:42"/>
they ſhall not <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>each every man his Neighbour,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The meaning may be that they ſhall not
ſo much need to do it under the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
as under the firſt. But indeed the words
and phraſe here uſed, ſeem to be a ſtrain of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
oft uſed in Scriptures, when to ſet forth
the greatneſs or great abundance and plenty of
things, expreſſions are uſed improperly and
hyperbolically in reference thereto, and ſo are
not to be underſtood properly, but figuratively.
As when it is ſaid in reference to the ſame
thing under the Goſpel with that I have been
now ſpeaking of, That <hi>the Earth ſhall be filled
with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Sea,</hi> Iſa. 11. 9. I ſuppoſe you will not
underſtand this in ſuch a ſtrict ſence as if it
foretold in Goſpel-times, that there ſhould be
no more knowledge of God wanting on the
Earth, than there is bare ground in the Sea:
or that <hi>David</hi> would have the World believe
that he did weep a River, yea Rivers full of
Tears, when he ſaid, <hi>mine eyes run down with
Rivers of Tears, becauſe men keep not thy Laws,</hi>
Pſalm 119. or that St. <hi>John</hi> did think in a ſtrict
ſence that the world could not contain the
books, if all the ſigns which <hi>Jeſus</hi> did, ſhould
be written, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. And if not, why ſhould
you ſo much as once imagine that theſe words
of the Prophet ſhould foretel, that under the
New Covenant there ſhould be no need of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95744:42"/>
teaching by mans Miniſtry, when the whole
current of the Scriptures of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both in precept and example, ſhew the
contrary? The words of the Prophet here, are
only a prediction of the rich and plentiful
means of Knowledge and Grace that was
to be vouchſafed under the New Covenant
more than under the Old.</p>
            <p>§. 19. One would think you have an aking
Tooth againſt outward teaching, when you
build ſuch Caſtles in the Air as ye do rather
than none, to batter it down. But how comes
it to paſs that you uſe it ſo much your ſelves,
if there be no more need of it than you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend?
I know that which you alledge to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
your ſelves in this ſeeming contradiction,
is this, or to this effect. You ſay though men
need not be taught by men what it is which
they ought to know, believe and do, the light
within teaching them this, and being a Rule
to them in theſe things: yet in as much as men
may and do rebel againſt this light, its neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to call upon and perſwade them to obey
it.</p>
            <p>But in this Plea you ſuppoſe for truth that
which is a manifeſt, groſs, and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and pernicious error, which is this: That
it is not as well neceſſary to teach men by the
Scriptures and by the Miniſtry of men, to know
&amp; believe what is neceſſary to their ſalvation, as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95744:43"/>
it is to perſwade them to do what is neceſſary
thereto. For contrary hereunto I have already
proved, that for men that live under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
its neceſſary to their Salvation that they
know and believe that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Chriſt the
Son of God, and Saviour of the World, and
that remiſſion of ſin is promiſed in his name to
ſuch as repent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have proved likewiſe that
theſe things cannot be known, but either by
immediate revelation from God, or by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from them that have had ſuch Revelation,
or by them whoſe knowledge thereof hath been
derived down ſucceſſively by outward teaching
from the firſt preachers of ſuch Doctrine. To
which I will now add as followes.</p>
            <p>In the Apoſtles days the Converts that were
then made ſuch, were brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and belief of thoſe great Articles of the
Chriſtian Faith, fundamentally neceſſary to
Salvation, by hearing the Word taught and
the Scriptures opened. This appears all along
the Acts of the Apoſtles: In <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. when
<hi>Peter</hi> had ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 36. <hi>Let all the Houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
know aſſuredly, that God hath made that
ſame</hi> Jeſus <hi>whom ye crucified, both Lord and
Chriſt:</hi> and had further ſaid unto them <hi>ver.</hi> 38.
<hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the
Name of Jeſus Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſins:</hi>
then its ſaid ver. 41. <hi>then they that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his Word were baptized.</hi> And Chap. 8. 12.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95744:43"/>
               <hi>But when they believed</hi> Philip, <hi>Preaching the
things concerning the Kingdom of God and the
Name of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>they were baptized.</hi> And
Chap. 11, 13, 14. <hi>Send men to</hi> Joppa, <hi>and call
for</hi> Simon <hi>whoſe ſirname is</hi> Peter; <hi>who ſhall tell
thee</hi> words, whereby thou and all thy houſe
ſhall be ſaved. Again <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 31, 3<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, 34.
They ſaid, believe on the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and
thou ſhalt be ſaved and thy houſe: And they
<hi>ſpake</hi> unto him the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord, and to
all that were in his houſe: and he rejoyced <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in God with all his Houſe.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.
2, 3, 4. And <hi>Paul,</hi> as his manner was, went in
unto them, and three Sabbath days reaſoned
with them out of the <hi>Scriptures, opening</hi> and
alledging that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered
and riſen from the dead: and that this <hi>Jeſus</hi>
whom I preach unto you is Chriſt. <hi>And ſome
of them believed,</hi> ver. 11, 12. They received
the Word with all readineſs of mind and
ſearched the <hi>Scriptures</hi> daily whether thoſe
things were ſo, <hi>therefore</hi> many believed. Again
<hi>Chap.</hi> 18. 8. And many of the <hi>Corinthians, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
believed</hi> and were baptized, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. and
he mightily convinced the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
ſhewing by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
was <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. 17, 18. To whom
now I ſend <hi>thee to open their eyes,</hi> and to turn
them from darkneſs to light. Alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.
23, 24. To whom he <hi>expounded</hi> and teſtified
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95744:44"/>
the Kingdom of God, perſwading them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> both <hi>out of the Law of</hi> Moſes
<hi>and out of the Prophets,</hi> from morning till
evening: <hi>and ſome believed the things which
were ſpoken.</hi> By all theſe inſtances you ſee or
may ſee in what way and by what means God
brought men to know Chriſt, and to believe
in him in the Apoſtles days under the higheſt
Diſpenſation of Goſpel-light as ever ſhined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the World. The Apoſtles Commiſſion was
to go and teach all Nations, baptizing them
in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghoſt: teaching them to obſerve
all things whatſoever he had commanded
them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. They in purſuance of this,
firſt taught the People to know and believe that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that remiſſion of ſins
was granted in his Name to ſuch as believed,
repented, and were baptized: and then they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
inſtructed them in the particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Holy living.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be plainer than that this was
the way and method which God pitcht upon,
and uſed in the Apoſtles days, to bring men to
the knowledge and belief of what was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to their Salvation. And how you will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the World or your ſelves either, that God
a few years ago not heard of till then, hath
altered his method, and that now he reveals
theſe things to men without any ſuch teaching
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95744:44"/>
by the Scriptures and Miniſtry of men, as in
thoſe times he conſtantly uſed to do, I know
not, nor as I believe you neither.</p>
            <p>But I pray you give an honeſt account to
ſuch as are unſatisfied, for what reaſon it is
that you are ſo zealous againſt teaching by
men, when you have but ſuch thin pretences
to ſupport your ſelves in ſo doing. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
your error were the truth, and that God
did by a light created in every man, ſufficiently
teach them what they ought to believe and do:
pray you what hurt would accrue to men by
having the ſame things imparted to them by
men from without, which they know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
already by a light within. When St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had occaſion to write to thoſe that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
enlightened within (though not in your
pretended way) he ſaid unto them, I will not
be negligent to put you always in remembrance
of theſe things, though ye know them and be
eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 12.
And St. <hi>John</hi> in his 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. 21. I have
not written unto you, becauſe ye know not the
truth, but becauſe you know it, and that no lie
is of the truth. And do not you your ſelves
grant that the Light within you witneſſeth to
that which is in the Scriptures, and that the
Scriptures are as a Coppie of it? Why then
are you ſo angry with them that teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from the Scriptures, thoſe truths which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95744:45"/>
you ſay the light within you witneſſeth to?</p>
            <p>I would ye did not give too much occaſion
hereby to ſuſpect your integrity, when you
make ſuch ſad out-cryes againſt the publick
Miniſtry, one as well as another without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
as you are wont to do; when-as
you cannot but know, if you know at all what
they preach, that they teach the ſame Doctrine
in the main to the people, which the Apoſtles
taught, and which is declared in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and ſo the ſame which you ſay the Light
within you witneſſeth to: And alſo that they
teach the Peopel, that it is not the hearing of
this Doctrine preached to them, no nor yet
the knowledge of it neither, will avail them
to their Salvation, without receiving it into
their hearts, or without ſuch a belief of it as
iſſues it ſelf in a frame of Spirit and tenour of
Life and converſation, as is ſuitable to it.
And if you know not this, and yet ſpeak evil
of them for their preaching, as ſurmiſing
worſe; you then make your ſelves of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thoſe ill men which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
<hi>who ſpake evil of the things they know not,</hi>
2. Pet. 2. 12. Jude 10.</p>
            <p>Beſides you apparently diſcover a very ill
mind while you ſeek to make them odious to
the people by that which doth not at all make
them ſo, ſave only in the opinion of thoſe
whoſe minds are corrupted with prejudice
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95744:45"/>
againſt all teachers of Holy things as ſuch, or
with Covetouſneſs, or Intereſt of a party; and
that is their taking mony of the people where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to ſupport themſelves and Families in
ſerving them in the dear concernments of their
ſouls: And therefore you ſtile them hirelings,
ſuch as preach for hire, and make a trade of
it, and ſo make merchandize of mens ſouls.
Not conſidering that in doing thus you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the wiſdome of our Lord who hath
<hi>ordained that thoſe that preach the Goſpel, ſhould
live</hi> of the Goſpel, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. and hath ſaid
in reference hereto, that the <hi>Labourer is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his hire,</hi> Luke 10. 7. and that ſuch as
labour in the Word and Doctrine are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of double honour, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. that
thoſe that are taught in the Word, ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to him that teacheth in all good
things, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that he robbed other Churches taking <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
that he might ſerve the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
without charge; which he did only to take
occaſion from the falſe Apoſtles, who ſonght
occaſion to blaſt the reputation of his Miniſtry
upon occaſion of his taking mony; juſt as you
do now by the Miniſters of the Goſpel, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
11. 8, 12, 13. And if you do as they did, you
will too much deſerve the ſame name they had.</p>
            <p>You think, it ſeems, you may compare them
(as frequently you do) with the falſe Prophets
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95744:46"/>
and bad Prieſts of old; of whom it is ſaid that
the Prieſts did teach for hire, and the Prophets
divine for mony. But are you indeed ſo far
forſaken of underſtanding as to think it was a
crime in the Prieſts under the Law to take mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or moneys-worth, whereby to live to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their Office? You cannot but know
what ample proviſion God made for them,
and accounted himſelf rob'd when their Tithes
were detained and kept back from them; and
therefore that could not be their crime: But
when the people were wicked and did not
make conſcience of obſerving God's Laws, but
broke them in keeping back the Tithes as well
as in other things, the crime of the Prieſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of then, doubtleſs was that they taught
the people corrupt Doctrine, ſuch as would
pleaſe them, that they might thereby incline
them to pay them their Tithes. God in <hi>Malachi's</hi>
Propheſie complains of the people that they had
robbed him in Tithes and Offerings, even the
whole Nation. And then he complaines of
the Prieſts alſo, ſaying, but ye are departed out
of the way, ye have cauſed many to <hi>ſtumble
at the Law,</hi> ye have <hi>corrupted the Covenant of
Levi,</hi> ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. Therefore have
I alſo made you contemptible and baſe before
all the people, according as ye have not kept
my ways, but have been <hi>Partial in the Law.</hi>
Mal. 2. 8. 9. And ſo the falſe Prophets that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95744:46"/>
ſaw vanity and divined lies, <hi>ſaying thus ſaith
the Lord God, when the Lord had not ſpoken.</hi> And
why did they ſo, but to get the peoples mony
by pleaſing them in Propheſying peace to them,
when the true Prophets propheſied of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and were praſecuted for it? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.
25, 28.</p>
            <p>And are you ſure that all thoſe Miniſters that
receive mony of the people as a reward of their
Labours, whom you brand with preaching
for hire and divining for mony, are ſuch aud
do as thoſe Prieſts and Prophets did, for which
they are ſo ſtigmatized? And if you are not
ſure of it, as I am ſure you are not nor can
be: Then I pray you conſider how or which
way you will quit your ſelves from being of the
number of thoſe <hi>falſe accuſers</hi> of whom St.
<hi>Paul</hi> Propheſied, as perſons that ſhould have
a form of Godlineſs, and yet deny the power
of it, by whom the <hi>times</hi> ſhould be mad <hi>peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi>
2 Tim. 3. 3.</p>
            <p>'Tis poſſible and too probable that there may
be ſome who for worldly and fleſhly reſpects,
may greatly fall ſhort of a faithful diſcharge
of their duty towards the ſouls under their
charge: and if there be any that by dawbing
with untempered Mortar, do betray them, I
am no advocate for ſuch; they ſhall bear their
burden whoſoever they be. But if there be
ſome ſuch, how unreaſonable and unchriſtian
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95744:47"/>
is it, to condemn the Righteous with the
Wicked, and to cenſure all for ſomes ſake! It
looks as if the work and office it ſelf, were the
eye-ſore to you, as much, if not more, than
their miſcarriage in it. And that which adds
ground of ſuſpition herein, is that your great
out-cry againſt them is for taking mony for
preaching, which is none of their crime they
doing their duty. But thoſe which I fear ſtand
behind you and inſenſibly influence you herein,
know well enough, that if the people could be
but prevailed with to withold maintenance
from the Miniſtry, the Miniſterial work would
ceaſe, and a Door would be opened for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
elſe. And therefore thoſe Romiſh Factors
that can turn themſelves into any ſhape, have
cunningly made uſe of all ſorts of Sects among
us, however otherwiſe differing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
yet in this to agree, to cry down the
publick Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>There were in the Apoſtles time ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to Chriſtianity, and Teachers too, as
<hi>ſought their own things and not the things of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, that ſerved their own bellies inſtead</hi>
of ſerving Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>that through covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with feigned words made merchandize of the
people;</hi> in order to all which they did <hi>corrupt
the Word; by reaſon of whoſe pernicious ways,
the way of truth was evil ſpoken of:</hi> But by
whom? doubtleſs by none but by malignant
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95744:47"/>
adverſaries to the truth it ſelf. But we have
not the leaſt whiſper of any good Chriſtians
ſpeaking evil of the faithful Miniſtry becauſe
of ſome miſcarriages of the Scandalous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful.
And yet I believe you would take
it ill, if upon account of your doing now not
as the good, but as ill men then did, you
ſhould be rank'd and numbred not with the
good but with the bad; which if you be not,
it is becauſe ſome have more charity for you,
than you have for others that better deſerve
it.</p>
            <p>What I was beginning to anſwer to your
Plea for the incongruity of your opinion and
practice, hath led me to ſomewhat a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
and yet I have ſomething more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſay to it. Your opinion is that men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taught of God himſelf by his Light and
Spirit within now under the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
need not to be taught by men, nor
to have the Scripture for their Teacher.
And yet for all that you take upon you to
teach the Peopel your ſelves, whil'ſt you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
it in others; and ſay in your defence, that
in as much as men may diſobey the Light in
them, therefore your teaching is neceſſary to
perſwade them to obey it. But I pray you, is
God's ſhewing men their duty all the inward
teaching you pretend to? Do you not pretend
to be led and moved by the Spirit to do as well
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95744:48"/>
as to know your duty? Do you not ſay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
that the Spirit of God moveth and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into all the works of righteouſneſs, and
that the Spirit of Chriſt only exerciſes the
Conſcience to God and Man, and leads into
the practice of all Truth? Nay do you not
make the acceptation of what is acceptably
done to depend upon the motion and work of
the Spirit in the doing of it, and do you not
count all that is not ſo done, to be done in
man's own will? And therefore why do you
thus diſſemble the matter, and heap one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
upon another? But ſuppoſe that
which you pretend were the only reaſon of
your teaching: is there not then the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that others ſhould Preach as well as you?
Or are none in danger of rebelling againſt the
Light but only ſuch as hear you? But the plain
Truth is for all your talk, that you do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to teach men what their Duty is, as well
as perſwade them to do it; as appears abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
in your Books, particularly in thoſe of
<hi>Edward Burroughs.</hi> So that by this tergiverſation
and ſhuffling, it plainly appears to intelligent
men, that the buſineſs at the bottom is not that
you are againſt the needfulneſs of mans teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
notwithſtanding all the teaching by the
Light within; but only againſt all other mens
teaching but your own. So that if you knew
your own hearts in this buſineſs, you would
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95744:48"/>
find that the meaning of your crying down all
other Teachers, is that yours alone might be
exalted. But if your Teachers or any among
you do ſee and know the inconſiſtency of theſe
your Pretences and Practices, and yet uſe the
Pretences for a blinde, to hide the deſigne
from the people, it is then a perfect piece
of—</p>
            <p>There is another thing like unto this: you
ſay thoſe that are taught of God, need not that
the Scripture ſhould teach them, and that all
men are taught of God by his Light within
them; and yet it ſeems you think that men
have need to be taught by your Books, though
they have no need to be taught by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
elſe why is the World troubled with ſo
many of them? The Phariſees made void the
Commandments of God that they might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
their own Traditions: and it looks but
untowardly, that while you repreſent the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture as ſuch a needleſs thing, that you
at the ſame time have ſent out ſuch a croud of
your own Books as you have done. And if
you would have the people believe that they
proceed from the ſame teaching of the Spirit as
the Books of the Holy Scriptures do, what
ſhall the people then do when they find them
to contradict one another, as they may eaſily
do, if they will but do as the noble <hi>Bereans</hi>
did, who ſearched the Scriptures daily whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95744:49"/>
thoſe things were ſo which were preached
to them in the Name of the Lord. As in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
caſe before us: the Scripture plainly teacheth
one method of bringing men to Salvation, and
your books another. <hi>Ed. Burrough</hi> in his book
teacheth that that is not the body of Chriſt
which was not with the Father before the
World began <hi>p.</hi> 465. But the Scripture teacheth
that in the fulneſs of time God ſent forth hi Son,
made of a Woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. Which of theſe
two now muſt the people believe, or which of
theſe muſt be the rule to try the other by? your
Books or the Holy Scriptures? I pray you
ſpeak out, and tell the people plainly; For if the
Scriptures be true, as you dare not deny but
they are, than your Books in ſuch things as
contradict them, muſt be falſe; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not the Iſſue of the infallible Spirit, as
you would have the world believe they are.
But though we, or an Angel from Heaven,
Preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that
which we have Preached unto you, let him be
accurſed, ſaid St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer upon the Point of
your Enthuſiaſm, by which you have ſet up a
new method of your own in oppoſition to
God's method of bringing men to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
belief and Life, becauſe I deem it a Mother
and a Maſter-Error to many others which you
hold. And therefore have good hopes that if
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95744:49"/>
you could but be cured of this, you would
be in a hopeful way of being cured of the reſt,
which depend on it, with leſs difficulty. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
therefore been ſo long upon this beyond
what I firſt intended, I ſhall draw towards a
concluſion of this addreſs to you, not engageing
in particular with the reſt of your miſtakes. But
before I make an end, I would caution you
touching two or three things which among
others may probably have had a large ſhare in
introducing you into this ſtrange miſtake.</p>
            <p>§. 20. The one is an opinion or conceit that
the Goſpel is a more myſterious thing than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is. It is true, there are things in the
Goſpel called a Myſtery, the Myſterie of God's
will, the Myſtery of Chriſt, the Myſtery of
Faith, the Myſtery of Godlineſs: and to you,
ſaith Chriſt to the Diſciples, 'tis given to know
the Myeries of the Kingdom of God, and
the like. Upon occaſion of all which, and
the like expreſſions in Scripture; Some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have fancied that there is ſomething elſe
neceſſary to make a man a true Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
than what is obvious to vulgar appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
and eaſie to be underſtood as other
matters are. And therefore they have been wont
to eſteem a plain and familiar way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Doctrine of repentance, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of obedience to the Law of God, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a belief that Chriſt dyed for our ſins
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95744:50"/>
and roſe again according to the Scriptures, to
be but a dry and legal way of Preaching. And
thoſe that have vented high Speculations and
almoſt or altogether unintelligible notions and
new coined Phraſes and expreſſions, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the work of God in the Soul, and of Union
with Chriſt, and Communion with God, of
living by faith, and walking in the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe
they have accounted Evangelical Preachers,
and ſuch preaching and diſcourſes in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
to be truly Spiritual, and thoſe to be
Spiritual Chriſtians that are of this make. And
becauſe this way obtained a great reputation
among a great many of Chriſtian Profeſſors,
many perſons have been tempted hereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
ſo far from one thing to another in this
way, both allegorizing Scriptures of plain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and turning plain points of Doctrine and
of great concern into Myſtical ſpeculations,
until they have made another thing of the
plain Doctrine of the Goſpel than Chriſt made
it. And this ſeems to be directly your Caſe,
who in this way are come at laſt to turn the
plain and intelligible method of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
with men to bring them to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
belief and Life, and ſo to ſalvation, into
Enthuſiaſtical Fancies, Airy Notions and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations.
Such is your conceited Miſtery of
of the <hi>inward Fleſh</hi> of Chriſt in contradiſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Fleſh of the Veil, as you phraſe it: as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95744:50"/>
if Chriſt had two kinds of Fleſh, one hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
another; by which you trouble yea, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
confound the true Notion of Chriſt's hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature: and the great effects which the
Scripture attributes to the Fleſh or humane
Nature of Chriſt, thoſe you attribute to a meer
fiction which you call the <hi>inward Fleſh;</hi> a thing
altogether forraign to the Scripture; an error
doubtleſs of a very high nature. Such alſo is
your ſpiritualizing Baptiſm and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
to the excluſion of their literal uſe, and
to the diſparagement of his wiſdome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that ordained them, as well as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of his Authority which hath enjoined
the uſe of them for the ends for which they
were firſt inſtituted. Such likewiſe is your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
Miſtery of the Redemption of the <hi>Seed</hi>
in men: for the Scripture ſpeaks of no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch
thing, but of the Redemption of men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>This miſtake about the Myſteriouſneſs of the
Chriſtian Religion, hath I fear had a bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon, and produced ill effects in ſome
others as well as your ſelves, who perhaps have
not been yet carried ſo far out of the way by it,
as you have been.</p>
            <p>Whereas thoſe things that are abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for men of all capacities to know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and do, in order to their Salvation, are
delivered in the Goſpel with great plainneſs and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95744:51"/>
eaſineſs to be underſtood, even of thoſe,
of meaneſt capacities that have but a <hi>mind</hi>
to underſtand them, and will <hi>attend</hi> to
them and <hi>conſider them.</hi> Who is ſo weak as
not to underſtand it when it is declared to him,
that there was ſuch a one as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and
that he was declared to be one come from God,
and his Doctrine touching his being the Son of
God, and concerning all other things to be
true, by the wonderfulneſs of his Birth of a
Virgin, and the many and mighty miracles
which he wrought, and which were wrought
by others in his Name, and by his Reſurrection
from the dead? Who is ſo weak as not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
when it is declared to him upon good
grounds, that this <hi>Jeſus</hi> was put to death not
for his own, but for our Sins; and that he roſe
again from the dead the third day? Who is ſo
weak as not to underſtand when he hears it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the Goſpel, that forgiveneſs of Sins,
a glorious Reſurrection, and eternal Happineſs
in another World, are promiſed to thoſe that
believe in him as ſuch, and that believe his
Doctrine and ſincerely obey it, touching the
neceſſity of Repentance conſiſting in amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life, proceeding from ſorrow for
Sin, and in a ſincere obſerving all his Precepts.
Theſe are things that may be underſtood by
every body that hears and conſiders them: And
yet theſe are the things revealed by the Goſpel
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95744:51"/>
as neceſſary to be believed and done in order to
ſalvation. The reaſon why ſo many of thoſe
that hear the Goſpel, do not believe, and
obey it to the ſaving of their Souls, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they cannot underſtand it, but becauſe
they are not willing to obey it, and ſo not
willing to believe it, or to conſider it, that
they might believe it, but chuſe rather to
pleaſe themſelves in their evil ways for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and ſo run the hazard for the future, of
the Goſpels being true or not true; or elſe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelves with hopes that they do repent
and obey the Goſpel, under vain and deluſive
notions of the nature of ſaving Repentance and
Obedience.</p>
            <p>And it is not congruous to the goodneſs of
God's nature, to think that when he hath been
pleaſed out of his great compaſſion to loſt
men, to make a New Covenant of Salvation
upon terms ſuitable to that love and goodneſs
of his, to think I ſay, that he ſhould lay the
ſtreſs of their Salvation upon terms not eaſie to
be underſtood by all, one as well as another
that are concerned therein.</p>
            <p>And therefore the greateſt reaſon I conceive
why ſome things in the Goſpel are ſtiled a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
is becauſe they were ſo till they were
plainly revealed by Chriſt; a great part of the
things therein contained, being ſuch as no
man by the higheſt improvement of, reaſon,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95744:52"/>
could diſcover or apprehend, till God in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
way was pleaſed to reveal them.
Such was God's ſending his Son to aſſume our
Nature, and to die for our Sins, and the
granting Remiſſion of Sins, and eternal Life
for his ſake, to thoſe that believe and obey the
Goſpel. But when they are once revealed,
and by revelation made plain and eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by men of all capacities, they are
ſure then no longer Myſteries to them, unleſs
they remain ſo through their own wilful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to underſtand them. Agreeable to this is
that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. 1. 26. Speaking of the
Goſpel, even, ſaith he, the Myſtery which <hi>hath
been hid</hi> from Ages, and from Generations,
<hi>but now is made manifeſt</hi> to his Saints. Eph. 1.
9. Having <hi>made known to us</hi> the Myſtery of his
will, according to his good pleaſure which he
hath purpoſed in himſelf. So the calling of the
Gentiles is called a Myſtery, not becauſe it was
hard to be underſtood when the thing was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by Chriſt's Commiſſion to preach the
Goſpel to them, and by preaching the Goſpel
had given them the Holy Spirit as he had to
the believing Jews at the firſt, but becauſe
this calling of them was little known or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
in the World till then.</p>
            <p>God ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> by revelation made
known to me the Myſtery, which in other ages
was not made known unto the Sons of men, as
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95744:52"/>
it is now revealed unto his Holy Apoſtles and
Prophets by the Spirit; that the Gentiles
ſhould be fellow-Heirs, and of the ſame Body,
and partakers of his promiſe in Chriſt by the
Goſpel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 2, 6. And ſo again <hi>Ver.</hi> 9.
and to make all men ſee, what is the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Myſtery, which from the beginning of
the World hath been hid in God. So that as
the Goſpel is called a Myſtery as containing
things in it which had been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Myſtery till they were revealed,
ſo it is called a Revelation of the Myſtery,
by reaſon of its diſcovering that which was a
Secret before. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25, 26.—The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Jeſus Chriſt according to the <hi>Revelation
of the Myſtery,</hi> which was kept ſecret ſince the
world began, <hi>but now is made manifeſt,</hi> and by
the Scriptures of the Prophets according to the
commandment of the everlaſting God, <hi>made
known</hi> to all Nations for the obedience of
Faith.</p>
            <p>In all this I do not deny but that there are
in the Goſpel things very Myſterious and hard
to be conceived, as touching the manner of
their exiſtence, as the Union of Chriſts two
Natures, and the Doctrine of the Trinity of
Perſons and Unity of Eſſence, and ſome other
things: But it is not hard to underſtand that
thoſe things really are, when God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95744:53"/>
and declared that they are, though it is very
hard, or rather beyond our apprehenſion to
know how and after what manner they are:
and to know and believe more than he hath
plainly revealed, is not doubtleſs neceſſary to
mens Salvation: and therefore men ſhould be
cautious of laying too great a ſtreſs upon their
different apprehenſions about them.</p>
            <p>If you ſhall ſay, if Evangelical Truths be
made ſo perceptible by the plainneſs and fulneſs
of the Revelation of them; how comes it to
paſs then that there is ſuch difference in mens
opinions, and ſo many controverſies about
them as there is? I anſwer, if the differences
and controverſies be about thoſe things that are
neceſſary to Salvation, I have told you the reaſon
already: it is becauſe men will not be ſatisfied
nor acquieſce in that plainneſs in which ſuch
things are delivered in the Scriptures, but ſtill
fancy there is ſome farther Myſtery in them
than indeed there is. And when men take that
liberty, and think they do excellent well in it,
then one fancies he ſees this hidden Myſtery
couched under truths plainly expreſt, and
another that; when both are wide of the mark.
And then men weary themſelves in defending
their notions on both ſides, and can never be
reconciled until both lay down their bye-opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſubmit their judgments to the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſimplicity of the truth, labouring to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95744:53"/>
improve it to practice, which is the true and
proper uſe of it, which will bring more ſolid
ſatisfaction to the mind, than all mens Airy noti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons,
how taking ſoever they may be with ſome.</p>
            <p>But though the things neceſſary to ſalvation,
are in the Revelation of them, accommodated to
the capacities of the weak and ſimple, whoſe Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is deſigned by them as well and as much
as theirs of ſtronger and quicker apprehenſions,
yet there are things under the New Teſtament
that are <hi>hard to be uttered</hi> (as the phraſe is <hi>Heb.</hi>
5. 11.) and therefore <hi>hard to be underſtood,</hi> as
the phraſe is again 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. As there is
milk for Babes who are unskilful in the Word
of righteouſneſs, ſo there is meat for ſtrong
Men who by reaſon of uſe have their Senſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
to diſcern both good and evil, as 'tis
ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13, 14. And mens differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
theſe points proceed at the beſt from their
different meaſures of Light and underſtanding,
and ſometimes are perſiſted in from that which
is worſe. So it was in the Apoſtles time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the believing <hi>Jews</hi> and the blieving Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. Which by the way, would not
have been, if all good Chriſtians then had been
guided by an infallible Light within, as you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they are now. If they had, they would not
have needed to have been taught and re-taught
which are the firſt principles of the Oracles of
God, as ſome of them were, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:95744:54"/>
But when men which are but poor in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and yet rich in confidence, undertake to
manage and maſter theſe more difficult points
and paſſages of Scripture, they too often wreſt
them to their own deſtruction, as St. <hi>Peter</hi>
ſpeaks, 2. <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. 16. And this they either do
or are in great danger of doing, when they
faſten upon ſome wrong ſence and notion of
hard and difficult places of Scripture, and then
pervert plain and eaſie places by interpreting
them to their wrong ſence of thoſe that are
more obſcure and difficult; eſpecially when
their interpretations are not mere ſpeculations,
but ſuch as influence men in their practice, as
becoming a rule to them therein. Whereas the
more wiſe and judicious, never interpret hard
places in oppoſition to the common ſence of
thoſe that are plain and eaſie, but explain thoſe
that are hard and difficult, by thoſe that are
plain.</p>
            <p>The uſe I would adviſe you to make of all
this, is to review the grounds you have gone on,
and to ceaſe from your new notions and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of your being taught only by the Light
within; which you have taken up from ſome
expreſſions in Scripture miſunderſtood by you,
and wholly diſagreeing to the Scope of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where they are found, and contrary to the
general current of the Scriptures in their
plain and obvious ſence. Seek not a Knot in a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95744:54"/>
bulruſh; ſeek not for Myſteries there where
the Lord hath declared his mind plainly and in
no parable. But form your notions of God's
method of proceeding with men to bring
them to Salvation, according to the plain and
expreſs Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles in
the Scriptures, and receive from and regulate
by that Doctrine, all your apprehenſions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,
affections and operations of your
Souls, together with all your words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
So did the good Chriſtians of Old: they
<hi>obeyed</hi> from the heart that <hi>form</hi> of Doctrine
which was delivered to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17.
<hi>They purifyed their ſouls in obeying that Truth
through the Spirit,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 22. Yea, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
themſelves were firſt taught by Chriſt's
preaching unto them, what to think and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
concerning Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17. 8. I have
given unto them the <hi>words</hi> which thou gaveſt
me; and they have received <hi>them,</hi> and have
known ſurely that I came out from thee, and
they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.
And juſt as the Apoſtles preached, ſo the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
believed: they made their Doctrine the
Adequate Rule of their notions of things; the
Rule of their Faith, the Rule of their Life:
<hi>So we Preach, and ſo ye believed,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 11.</p>
            <p>And thoſe great, plain, known and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
received Truths, neceſſary to Salvation,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95744:55"/>
called the <hi>common Faith,</hi> Tit. 1. 4. the <hi>Faith
once</hi> delivered to the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. theſe I
ſay were the Rule and Standard by which they
were to try the Doctrine of ſuch as only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to Inſpirations from the Spirit. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
believe not every Spirit, but try the
Spirits whether they be of God, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
falſe Prophets are gone out into the World,
1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1. And then St. <hi>John.</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3.
commends to them one known fundamental
Doctrine pertinent to his Caſe then in hand,
by which they might know the Teachers he
cautioned them againſt, were not inſpired by
God nor authorized by him. Hereby know
ye the Spirit of God: every Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is come in the Fleſh, is
of God. And every Spirit that confeſſeth not
that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is come in the Fleſh, is not of
God. And again <hi>verſe</hi> 6. We are of God:
he that knoweth God, heareth us (adhered to
and governed themſelves by the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine)
he that is not of God heareth not us:
<hi>hereby know we</hi> the Spirit of Truth, and the
Spirit of Error.</p>
            <p>And truly if you will not make the plain and
expreſs Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles in
the Scriptures touching Faith and a good Life,
your Rule by which to try and to judge of the
Truth and erroneouſneſs of your conceptions,
perſwaſions, motions and inclinations, under
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95744:55"/>
the notion of the Light within, and of all your
words and actions conſequent thereupon, you
are and will be in great danger to be like the
wandring Stars and the clouds carried with a
Tempeſt, of which St <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeak;
unfixed and unſtable in your judgment, Faith
and Ways. For it is certain and evident, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you pretend to the contrary, that the
Light within you, is not in your own account
always a certain, conſtant and infallible Rule
to you; for if it were, you would not act ſo
contrary to your ſelves as you have done under
pretence of being taught of God, and guided
by the Light within: One while crying up
your former practice of ſhaking as the effect of
God's work in and upon you, and another
while confeſſing it to be a deluſion, as <hi>Samuel
Fiſher</hi> one of note with you, did to me, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it was ſo judged. One while crying down
all Eccleſiſtical forms of Government as ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical,
another while erecting one among
your ſelves, pretending to as much Infallibility
in <hi>your Body</hi> repreſentative in managing it, as
the Papiſts do in reference to the Pope, One
while owning the witneſſing of a perſon to be
from God, and another while condemning the
ſame for an error or deluſion. How often have
thoſe of your number thought they have been
ſent by God on meſſages, who after have found
themſelves deluded?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:95744:56"/>
By theſe and other like inſtances you may be
convinced, that if you do not make the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Chriſt in the Scriptures the Adequate
Rule of the motions and inclinations of your
minds and the actions of your lives, whereby
to know when they are of God and when not,
you have then no certain Rule to go by but are
continually liable to moſt horrible miſtakes, and
to think that to be a teaching or command
from God, which is indeed a deluſion from
the Devil. Nor without this Rule in Scripture
which lies open to all, have you any way to
ſatisfy others, that what you ſay or do is from
God. You have no miracles amongſt you, by
which God was wont to bear witneſs to his
ſervants, when he ſent them on meſſages new
to the World. And have you indeed ſuch an
opinion of your ſelves as to think men ought
to believe only becauſe you ſay it? Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſaid, if I bear witneſs of my ſelf my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is not true, <hi>John</hi> 5. 31. and is your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
better than his? And I pray you what have
you to bear witneſs for you in what you ſay,
if the Scriptures cannot; To the Law then
and to the Teſtimony of Chriſt in the Doctrine
of the Scriptures, if you ſpeak not according
to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in
you.</p>
            <p>§. 21. There is one thing more which I
would admoniſh you to beware of, and that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95744:56"/>
               <hi>is a high</hi> opinion of your ſelves, and a <hi>low and
deſpicable</hi> opinion of all others that differ
from you: a thing which I fear hath betrayed
you into that deſperate error which I have
been detecting, together with many others.</p>
            <p>For when men by reaſon of their New My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
notions of plain Scriptures and familiar
points of Doctrine, and of their new-minted
phraſes anſwerable thereto, do fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be ſpiritual, and all the reſt that ſtill
ſtick to the plainneſs and ſimplicity of the
Goſpel, to be but carnal and formal profeſſors
(though in their tempers and lives better than
themſelves) they then begin to think, that they
are nearer and dearer to God than they, and
conſequently that God will reveal himſelf after
a more intimate way and manner to themſelves
than he doth to ſuch. And when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated
and grown giddy with ſuch conceits,
then they are drawn by degrees to imagine
themſelves to be brought into ſome kind of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
with the Apoſtles themſelves, &amp; that now
they do not need to be taught by ſuch whom
they eſteem ſo much below themſelves, but that
they ſhall be now taught of God immediately.
And when they are thus tranſported and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with theſe dreams, fancies, and high
conceits, then they conclude that all thoſe
Scriptures which ſpeak of mens being taught
of God, led by the Spirit, and anointed with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95744:57"/>
the Unction of the Holy One that teacheth all
things, and the like, do ſpeak directly to their
caſe, and repreſent the happy ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into which they are now brought. And
now they look down upon all others with a
kind of compaſſionating contempt, as men
in the dark, ſticking in the form and imitation,
and the Letter; and guided by carnal reaſon
and fleſhly Wiſdome, to whom the things of the
Kingdome of God are altogether a Myſtery. And
by this time they fancy themſelves to be in the
Reſurrection, &amp; to have attained to the perfect
ſtate, and are came ſo for as to be in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to ſit in judgment upon the World.
And thus through the abundance of revelations,
not which they have had, but which they fancy
to have had, they are exalted above meaſure.
And doth not your Conſcience witneſs that this
comes home to you, and repreſents your Caſe
or the Caſe of many of you?</p>
            <p>I confeſs Pride, eſpecially Pride of this kind,
is not ſo eaſily diſcerned by them that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with it, as it is by by-ſtanders; as a
Feaver when come to its height, ſometimes is
not by them that are in it. And no doubt but
you rather fancy your ſelves to be the humbleſt
and moſt ſelf-denying people, of all others;
nay to be the only humble people; for you have
thrown off and cryed down the bravery and
Pride of the World which others retain. But
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95744:57"/>
do you not know that a <hi>voluntary</hi> humility and
a being vainly <hi>puft up</hi> with a fleſhly mind, do
often keep company? If you do not, then
read <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. And do you not remember
that falſe Prophets are wont to come in ſheeps
clothing, and to <hi>wear a rough Garment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
who yet inwardly are ravening Wolves,
not ſparing the Flock, but preying upon
them. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 4.</p>
            <p>Be perſwaded them to enter into a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and impartial examination of your
ſelves, and of your own hearts, and feel
the Pulſe of your Spirits, and try whether
things have not been ſo, and ſo with you,
as I have ſaid. And remember what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſaid to thoſe Diſciples, who were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
of being greateſt in the Kingdom of
Heaven, and of ſitting the one at his right
hand and the other at his left: except ye be
converted (ſaid he to them) and become as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Children, ye ſhall not enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. Remember who
hath ſaid, if any man think that he knoweth
any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he
ought to know, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2. Remember
again, that if he which is but a <hi>Novice</hi> come to
be <hi>lifted up</hi> with Pride, its many to one that
he <hi>falls</hi> into the condemnation of the Devil,
1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>for God reſiſteth the proud, and
knoweth them afar off:</hi> He is far enough from
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95744:58"/>
being familiar with them or communicating
his mind and Counſels to them in any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
way; it is the humble he will teach,
and the meek he will guide in judgment, <hi>Pſalm</hi>
25. Therefore take the Apoſtles Counſel who
ſaid, ſee that no man among you think of
himſelf more highly than he ought to think but
to think ſoberly, according as God hath dealt
to every man the meaſure of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.
3. Learn rather to eſteem others better than
your ſelves, as knowing your own weakneſs
better than you do theirs, and not to lift up
your ſelves in your own conceits above all
others that are not of your way, how worthy
ſoever they are, as your manner hath been:
remembering who hath ſaid, he that exalteth
himſelf ſhall be brought low. Do not flatter
your ſelves with an opinion that you are nearer
and dearer to God, than all others, or that he
hath anointed you with the oyl of gladneſs
above your fellows; or that he will teach you
more immediately himſelf, than he hath taught
others before you.</p>
            <p>Think it not below you to be taught by the
Scripture or by the miniſtry of man, no though
you were indeed ſo highly in God's favour as
you ſuppoſe your ſelves to be. The Churches
of <hi>Smirna</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia</hi> were much favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and highly commended and applauded by
Chriſt, when the reſt of the Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:95744:58"/>
were rebuked: and yet wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> he would make
his mind known to them and the reſt of the
ſeven Churches, he doth not do it immediately
by himſelf, but firſt acquaints an Angel with
it, and by that Angel makes it known to
<hi>John,</hi> and by <hi>John</hi> to the Churches, and yet
not by him in perſon neither, but by his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 1. Chriſt could have taught <hi>Paul</hi>
himſelf when he appeared to him, as well as
to have ſent him to <hi>Ananias</hi> to be told what he
ſhould do: He could have told <hi>Cornelius</hi> by
himſelf or by the Angel that he ſent to him
thoſe words by which he and his houſe ſhould
be ſaved, as well as to direct him to <hi>Peter</hi> to
learn them of him. God could have revealed
the ſame things to the World by immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
of his Spirit, which he made known
to it by Prophets, by Chriſt himſelf; by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Teachers;
but he choſe rather at ſundry times and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
manners to ſpeak unto the Fathers by the
Prophets, and at laſt by his own Son which
he ſent into the World in our nature to teach
the way of Salvation. And when he left the
World again and aſcended up on high, he gave
ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets; and ſome
Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers;
for the perfecting of the Saints for the work
of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body
of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:95744:59"/>
Theſe things are ſo plain, that it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of great aſtoniſhment that ever Chriſtians
that have read theſe things, and that have not
a deſign to undermine the Goſpel and to Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
the World again (as I hope you have not)
ſhould be ever tempted to think, much more
that ever you ſhould be brought to believe it
your ſelves and teach it others, That the Light
within, without being taught by man or by
the Scripture, is the Rule of Faith and Practice.
But doubtleſs the inward Pride, the over-valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your ſelves, which I have been admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
you of, hath had a great hand in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you to it. And if ever you be recovered
from this ſnare of the Devil, it muſt be by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought to a ſight and ſence of your own
injudiciouſneſs and ignorance, and altogether
groundleſs confidence. And if you were but
well awakened out of that Spirit of Slumber,
into which your intoxication hath caſt you,
and out of that pleaſant Dream in it, which
hath ſo tickled your fancy, you would be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and confounded before God and Men, that
ever you ſhould be ſo ſtrangely deluded, and
prevailed upon as you have been, to trouble
the World with your whimſies and fancies,
and thereby to bring a ſcandal upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, and make ſport for them that
have no mind ſeriouſly to conſider the things
of the Goſpel, and to encourage Romiſh
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95744:59"/>
Agents in their deſign againſt the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Be perſwaded then by the Reaſon of the
matter it ſelf, to become modeſt and humble
and ſober-minded: and be not only content
to receive your teaching from God by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Holy Scriptures, as all good
Chriſtians do, and ever ſince the Primitive
times have done, but count it alſo as a high
favour from him that he hath given us the
Scriptures and ſent the Goſpel among us,
when ſo great a part of the World are at this
day without it. Remember, how the Pſalmiſt,
when he was therein aſſiſted by the Spirit of
God, was affected with a leſs favour than that
which you make little of, when he ſaid; he
ſheweth his Word unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> his Statutes and
his Judgments unto <hi>Iſrael:</hi> he hath not dealt
ſo with any Nation: and as for his judgments,
they have not known them. Praiſe ye the
Lord, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 147. 19, 20. And if it be ſo
great a favour to us that have the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
what is vouchſafed to the Infidel and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
World which have them not; then you
cannot but be guilty of high ingratitude to
God, whileſt you give the Precedency to that
Light within, which you ſay every man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the World hath, and ſo the Pagans
themſelves; and ſpeak of the Scriptures as if
they were but a Declaration of that which was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95744:60"/>
in you and which you knew without them, and
which you might have known if you had never
heard of them. By all which you teach them
that have ſo little Wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Grace as to believe
you, to have a low eſteem of the Scriptures,
and to think that men may as well be ſaved
without them as with them. And how then
can you poſſibly free your ſelves from that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
guilt which God charged upon the <hi>Jews</hi> of
old, ſaying, I have written to him (<hi>Ephraim</hi>)
the great things of my Law, and they were
eſteemed as a ſtrange thing; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
            <p>You have no doubt, thought your ſelves
more ſublime and ſpiritual than others, upon
account of your new Notions and new affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Modes and Phraſes: And not only ſo, but
there is great reaſon to think that an affectation
of being eſteemed ſo, did inſenſibly lead you,
or at leaſt the Leaders among you, from one
novel conceit to another; until you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
all bounds of Sobriety of mind, and
become perfectly Drunk, though not with Wine
as the Prophet ſpeaks. Whereas alas? the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality
of Chriſtians, doth not lye in high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown
Notions and Speculations, nor in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
Phraſes and expreſſions different from
what are common among Men, but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
frame and temper of their Spirits and
converſations, when theſe are conformable to
the Doctrine of the Goſpel which is of and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95744:60"/>
from the Holy Spirit, and thereby become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the ſpiritual and Divine nature or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> in purity, in lowlineſs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roility,
and meekneſs, and in love to God and
Charity to Men, in patience and gentleneſs, in
contempt of the World, in contentation, and
ſelf-reſignation to God, in Zeal to honour God
and to do all the good we can in the World. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
account of which Spiritual qualifications,
Chriſtians are ſaid to be <hi>one Spirit</hi> with Chriſt,
and by this Spirit and temper when given us,
<hi>we know that we dwell in him and he in us: and if
any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> in ſome
meaſure, <hi>he is none of his.</hi> Such as in whom
are found the fruits of the Spirit, they are the
ſpiritual Chriſtians, ſuch as is, Love, Joy, Peace,
Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith,
Meekneſs, Temperance, as they are enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22, 23. And as theſe
do more or leſs abound in Chriſtians in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and meaſure of them, ſo they are more
or leſs Spiritual. And who-ever they be that
do eſtimate themſelves to be Spiritual Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
upon account of any ſublime Notions, or
Speculations, or affected Phraſes, or by their
being for or againſt any form, way, or party,
or (which is more) by their being in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
uſe and exerciſe of God's own Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
farther than they are bettered in the frame
and temper of their Spirits thereby and made
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95744:61"/>
more like <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> they take wrong mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of their Spirituality.</p>
            <p>And if there were nothing elſe to make us
ſuſpect your new-taken-up way to be not Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
but carnal, this would do it, in that it
hath according to common obſervation, made
you ſince you came into it or were looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, moreſelf-conceited, proud, and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
ſlighting and ſetting at naught all others
that differ from you, and more deſperately cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious,
and more bold and confident in revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
than you were before; which are no
ſignes of Spirituality I am ſure. But if there
were more of that Spiritual qualification in
you, forementioned, by which Chriſtians are
denominated Spiritual indeed, it would take
down your high conceits of your high attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and rather make you ſay inwardly to
your ſelves, and to your own Souls, I am leſs
than the leaſt of all Saints, and make you
afraid to think or ſpeak ill of others, leſt in
doing ſo, you ſhould judge your ſelves, being
perhaps not comparable to them in true
worth.</p>
            <p>But if you would become ſpiritual Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
indeed, and not in fancy and conceit only:
Then let it be your care to obſerve and do
theſe things. Firſt converſe conſtantly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
in your thoughts with the Laws of
Chriſt in their Spirituality, as reaching to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95744:61"/>
Government of the thoughts and motions
of the mind and affections of the Soul, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to their various objects, as God his
Word, Worſhip and Works: Man as diverſly
related to us; the things of this World and
pertaining to this preſent life; and the things
of the World which is to come. And in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this compare the bent diſpoſition and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of your Souls in reference to theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
with thoſe Laws of Chriſt, thereby to
diſcover not ſo much how far you have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as to know and diſcern what is wanting,
and how far you fall ſhort of coming up cloſe
to your Rule, Chriſts precepts and imitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
And if this were well done, it would
make you little in your own eyes, and to ſay
with <hi>Paul, not as though I had attained or were
already perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then next in the ſence of your defects, be
diligent and conſtant in the uſe of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
means for Spiritual growth, ſuch as is
the hearing and reading of Chriſt's Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in the Scriptures touching the great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
as well as directions to obedience, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with frequent meditation and ſerious
conſideration of it and of your own concern
therein. And then ſtill have in your eye, the
end for which theſe and other means are or
ought to be uſed by you, and that is for the
bettering the frame and temper of your Spirits,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95744:62"/>
the moral habit and conſtitution of
your Souls; and never divide the means from
the end in your intention, nor ſatisfie your
ſelves in the uſe of the means, but in reference
to the end: and in all the means be ſtill ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavouring to mend that which is amiſs,
and to fill up and ſupply what is lacking in the
degrees of Grace, and all divine Vertue.</p>
            <p>And then in and together with all this, do
you in a due ſence of your own weakneſs and
inſufficiency, and of the great need you have
of the conſtant aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit
in all, make inſtant and importunate ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to God for it. And then without all
doubt you ſhall be aſſiſted and enabled by that
Spirit of his in the uſe of the foreſaid means, by
degrees to become Spiritual Chriſtians indeed.
For our faithful Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath aſſured us, that
our Heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit to
thoſe that out of a ſence of its value and worth
and of their own want of it, do importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ask it of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13.</p>
            <p>§. 22. I might yet farther ſhew you that in
all probability, your great uncharitableneſs
towards other good men againſt whom you
had taken up undue prejudices, had alſo a
great hand in bringing you into this Wilderneſs
of odd conceits wherein you have ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
loſt your ſelves. For prejudice againſt,
and uncharitableneſs towards men, is a great
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95744:62"/>
temptation upon them in whom it is, to differ
and depart from them in opinion as well as in
affection, and to ſtudy oppoſition againſt things
they hold in an uncharitable oppoſition
to thoſe that hold them. And ſo truth no
doubt hath many times ſuffered for the ſake of
thoſe that have held it.</p>
            <p>After you had entertained undue prejudices
againſt the Miniſters of the Goſpel upon one
account or other, whom in deriſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
you are wont to call <hi>the Prieſts;</hi> you
were then ſoon induced to think it meet to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from them in your Notions about Religion,
leſt otherwiſe you ſhould not ſeem more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
than thoſe whom you thus deſpiſed. And
by this doubtleſs among other things, were
you led into your groſs errors, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of higher attainments and more Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
in the Chriſtian profeſſion. For ſuch and
ſo great was your prejudice againſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and thoſe that adhered to them, that you
diſliked almoſt every thing they did, and the
Notions they had of Evangelical Truths and
points of Doctrine. And therefore leſt you
ſhould be thought too like them, you fell to
differencing your ſelves from them in <hi>Habit,</hi>
in <hi>modes of Speech,</hi> and in your <hi>Notions</hi> of the
parts of <hi>revealed</hi> and <hi>inſtituted</hi> Religion. And
thereupon applyed your ſelves to ſpiritualizing
your Notions of Goſpel-Truths in your way
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95744:63"/>
of Spiritualizing, till you had made them or
many of them, quite other things than in
Truth and reality they are or were ever made
by the Author of them. And if ever you
recover your ſelves, it muſt be by coming to
have better thoughts of others, and meaner of
your ſelves; a thing greatly neceſſary to mens
keeping in the way of Truth. For <hi>he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
his Brother, abideth in the Light, and there
is no occaſion of ſtumbling in him: But he that
doth not, is in darkneſs and walketh in darkneſs,
and knows not whither he goes, becauſe darkneſs
hath blinded his eyes,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Beſides uncharitableneſs being a ſin ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to God's dealing with us in the New-Covenant,
and ſo contrary to the great and
affecting example of Chriſt's Love to us, and
ſo contrary to the ſcope and deſign of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
(for the end of the Commandment is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)
that it is a great and ſore provocation to
God to give up uncharitable men to an injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mind and ridiculous conceits, and ſuch
as ſhall render them ridiculous among all ſober
and wiſe men. Which is matter of good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to men to take heed how they take up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
prejudices againſt good men, upon
account of their holding or doing ſuch things
which they diſlike, but not underſtanding, or
not fairly weighing the grounds on which
they hold and do them. But I have already ſo
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95744:63"/>
far exceeded the intended bounds of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
that I ſhall not farther enlarge upon this,
but ſhall draw towards a concluſion, with a
word of advice to ſuch as have already ſeen
their error, and are come off from you,
and to others that ſhall follow them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>§. 23. I know 'tis a very hard thing for
ſuch to get quite rid of all their confuſed,
and Enthuſiaſtical Thoughts, Notions and
Phraſes, but that ſome reliques of their old
Diſeaſe will ſtill hang on them and cleave
to them, and ſo encumber them, that they
can very hardly come quickly to any clear
and diſtinct apprehenſions of Evangelical Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.
To ſuch I would give this ſhort ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
that laying aſide all thoughts and
conceits of high attainments in the things
of God, they would repent and do their
firſt works, and begin as it were again
at the firſt Principles of the Doctrine of
Chriſt, and ſo lay their Foundation a new
in the beginning work of Chriſtians. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that they would frame their Notions and
apprehenſions of things abſolutely neceſſary
to Salvation, according to that plainneſs
in which they are expreſſed in Scripture,
not affecting, nor entertaining Myſtical No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:95744:64"/>
More particularly, that they would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
their minds with right apprehenſions
of the perſon of Chriſt, as Son of God and
Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> and of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his Mediatory Office.</p>
            <p>That as Prieſt he offered himſelf in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to expiate Sin by his Death, and in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
thereof makes continual Interceſſion for
us. That as Prophet, he revealed and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the New Covenant of Salvation.</p>
            <p>That as King he hath given Laws to
the World, and that he doth Rule and
Govern his Church through his Spirit
by thoſe Laws; and that at laſt he will
try and judg all men by them that have
lived under them, and that he will reward
all with eternal happineſs or endleſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
according as they have been obedient
or diſobedient to them.</p>
            <p>That they be careful alſo that their Notions
of the New Covenant be according to the plain
Doctrine of the Goſpel in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Particularly;</p>
            <p>That it conſiſts of two parts; of Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and of conditions of thoſe Promiſes. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that the Promiſes of it are made upon
account and for the ſake of Chriſt his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
as Mediator.</p>
            <p>That the great and ſpecial Promiſes of it, are
pardon of ſin or juſtification: the aſſiſtance
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95744:64"/>
of God's Spirit in our endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the condition; and eternal Life.</p>
            <p>That the condition on which theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are made, are Faith in Chriſt, Repentance;
ſincere Obedience, and the craving of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of God's Spirit in the uſe of appointed
means, and our endeavours to perform the
condition.</p>
            <p>That they be careful alſo to form right No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the nature of the condition on our
part on which the Promiſes of the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
are made. As that no Faith ſhort of ſuch
a belief in Chriſt and of his Doctrine, as work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unfeigned Repentance and ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is juſtifying and ſaving.</p>
            <p>That no Repentance ſhort of a deſire, reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and endeavour to forſake all known ſin, is
ſaving Repentance.</p>
            <p>That no Obedience ſhort of a deſire, reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a continued endeavour to obſerve
all the Laws of Chriſt, without baulking any
one of them when known to be ſuch, is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
            <p>That no Faith, no Repentance, no Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſhort of theſe as thus deſcribed, is a
fulfilling of the condition of the Promiſes of
Salvation in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>As theſe great things of the Goſpel are in
Scripture expreſſed in great plainneſs, ſo great
care muſt be had to keep cloſe to, and to hold
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95744:65"/>
faſt the form of ſound words according to
which they are ſo declared not affecting any
Notion, Phraſe or Expreſſion, which makes
them more hard to be underſtood by common
capacities, than they are by the very Letter of
the Scriptures; but when other expreſſions are
uſed than what are in the Letter of the Text as
its neceſſary there ſhould ſometimes, eſpecially
in explaining metaphors, and Idioms of Speech
proper to the times and places in which the
Scriptures were written, they ſhould be ſuch
and ſo uſed, as may give a clearer inſight into
the Nature of the things themſelves, than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them can well be had; carefully avoiding to
take words <hi>properly,</hi> which are ſpoken <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically,</hi>
or to be led by the meer ſound of
words, but to take the meaſure of the ſence
of them, by the ſcope and deſign of the Author,
ſince words of the ſame ſound, are not always
of the ſame ſignification.</p>
            <p>§. 24. And now after I have laid things
before you which are very apt in their own
Nature to rectifie you in one of your grand
and fundamental miſtakes eſpecially, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
prejudice hinder not; I ſhould be
very ſorry to think or ſuſpect that what
is done herein, ſhould turn to no better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
than to be a witneſs againſt you in
that great day in which every mans work
will be tryed of what ſort it is. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95744:65"/>
to prevent that, I cannot for your ſakes,
and for the longing I have after your ſalvation,
but earneſtly perſwade you to give things pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
prepared to ſerve you, a due conſideration
in your minds, and not to paſs over ſuch things
ſlightly, as wherein your eternal Eſtate is
much concern'd.</p>
            <p>Remember that <hi>Hereſie</hi> is one of thoſe works
of the Fleſh, which ſhut Men out of the
Kingdom of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20, 21. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the Nature and bad influence of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of your opinions, and with what pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs
you perſiſt in them, its greatly feared,
not to ſay confidently believed by ſuch as are
jealous over you with a Godly jealouſie, that
many of you at leaſt, lye under no leſs guilt
than that of grand Hereſie. And do you not
then owe all ſeriouſneſs of conſideration to
what is offered to reſcue you from ſo great a
danger? Doubtleſs you do. Let not then the
height of your confidence to the contrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you: For it is not the greatneſs of your
confidence, that will in the leaſt alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things, or make them bend to your
humour. You are not the firſt that have been
as confident as confidence it ſelf could make
them, that they had faſt hold of Truth, when
all the while it hath been but a lye they have
had in their right hand. But the more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
you are in your way, you are like to be
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95744:66"/>
ſo much the more ſurprized with amazement;
when in another World you ſhall find yourſelves
to have been miſtaken in that of which you
are now ſo ſtrongly confident in this, if you
ſhould be ſo unhappy as to carry ſuch miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
confidence with you thither without a
pardon. Which that you may not, is I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you all the hurt that is deſigned you in
this Addreſs.</p>
            <p>And therefore let me tell you again, that it
will be your wiſdom much rather to beſtow
your thoughts and pains in labouring to find
out whether you be not indeed under a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
than in darkning of words without
knowledge, in labouring to obſcure to your
ſelves and others, the evidence of Truth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
which clearly tends to your convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

            <p>THere being ſome vacant Leaves: and
becauſe I have not ſo plainly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the nature of Faith, which is the condition
of the New Covenant, as I have the other
parts of it, in my advice touching a right
Notion of the Nature of the Mediatory Office
and of the Covenant of Grace, I ſhall for theſe
and other Reaſons add a ſhort hint of the help
which the Scripture doth offer us herein.</p>
            <p>When St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever believeth
that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 1.
and again, <hi>Who is he that overcometh the World,
but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God,
v.</hi> 5. We muſt needs take this for a deſcription
of ſaving Faith; becauſe thoſe that are born
of God and overcome the World, are the
Children and ſo the Heirs of God. To the
ſame purpoſe are thoſe words, <hi>John</hi> 2. 31.
<hi>Theſe are written that ye might believe that Jeſus
is the Chriſt the Son of God, and that believing ye
might have life through his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:95744:67"/>
And to this deſcription of Faith, agrees the
ſeveral confeſſions of Faith we read of. Thus
<hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion runs: <hi>Thou art the Chriſt the
Son of the Living God,</hi> Mat. 16. 16. <hi>And
again,</hi> John 6. 69. <hi>We believe and are ſure that
thou art that Chriſt the Son of the Living God.</hi>
Thus runs <hi>Martha's,</hi> John 11. 27. <hi>I believe
that thou art Chriſt the Son of God, which ſhould
come into the World.</hi> And thus runs the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs
alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. <hi>I believe that Chriſt is
the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in as much as we are aſſured by the
ſame authority of Scripture, that thoſe that
repent not ſhall periſh, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 3. and that
<hi>thoſe that obey not the Goſpel ſhall be puniſhed
with everlaſting deſtruction,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 7, 8.
and that <hi>except a Man be born again, he cannot
ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> John 3. 3. nor <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
holineſs ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. it follows
of neceſſity that the Faith afore deſcribed, is
ſuch a belief that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Son of
God, as doth effectually draw Men to believe
his Doctrine and to obey his Laws; in doing
of which they become New Creatures, and
overcome the World.</p>
            <p>For he that believes Chriſt to be the Son of
God, and conſiders what he believes, muſt
needs believe all his ſayings, and the whole
of his Doctrine to be true, for it is impoſſible
for God to lie: And he that believes his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95744:67"/>
to be true, and conſiders what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves;
muſt needs be under the influence of
the moſt powerful Motives imaginable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of a bad, and to lead a good Life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Chriſt hath expreſly declared from God,
that the one ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting
Deſtruction, and the other rewarded with
Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>So that Faith works that change in Men
by which they become New Creatures, are
born of God, and ſanctified, by way of
Motive, as it doth <hi>evidence</hi> to the Soul,
and bind upon the Mind, <hi>the things not
ſeen,</hi> as thoſe wherein a Man is infinitely
more concerned than in any, than in all the
things which are ſeen; and therefore muſt
needs be governed in the courſe of his Life by
them, and not by the other, but in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
unto them.</p>
            <p>For Faith, as it is a powerful Motive, is an
Operative Principle of a good and Holy Life;
And upon this accoont all the brave and Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Acts of thoſe Worthies mentioned in <hi>Heb.</hi>
11. are ſaid to be done by their Faith, as that
was to them the ſubſtance of things hoped for,
and the evidence of things not ſeen, and as
ſuch an <hi>active Principle</hi> of thoſe effects. And
thus <hi>the Life</hi> which St. <hi>Paul lived in the Fleſh,
he lived through the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> as
every good Chriſtian doth, as being thereby
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95744:68"/>
perſwaded thereto, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. And becauſe
Faith is thus Motive-wiſe ſuch an Operative
Principle of a good and Holy Life, therefore
it is that Men of ſuch a Life, are uſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by it in the New Teſtament, and are
ſtiled Believers. And when good Men are
otherwiſe deſcribed by their fear of God, and
Love to him, as many times they are, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the Old Teſtament, it is becauſe Fear
and Love are alſo powerful Principles of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that Govern Men in their way.</p>
            <p>A true <hi>Believer</hi> then, according to the New
Teſtament Dialect, is neither more nor leſs
than a Diſciple of Chriſt, or a faithful follower
of him; one that frames his Belief and Life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Doctrine and Example. And
the Faith of every ſuch one is ſuch in its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Effects, as doth conſtitute and deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
him a good Man.</p>
            <p>By all this it may eaſily be diſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rned that when
Men are ſaid to be juſtified or to be ſaved by
Faith, it is not to be underſtood of the meer
<hi>Act</hi> of believing abſtracted from its effects and
alone, but as it is an Active and Operative
Principle, changing the Heart and reforming
the Life. And accordingly Juſtification, and
Salvation, are in Scripture attributed to the
<hi>Effects</hi> of Faith, as well as to the <hi>Act</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 2. And when ever they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to believing indifinitely, it is not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95744:68"/>
without reference to the effects proper to it
when it is of the right kind.</p>
            <p>Now as Faith is deſcribed in the Scriptures
forecited, by its Object, and by its acting upon its
Object by aſſent; ſo it is in other Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by its effects, which are produced by its
actings upon its Object: And ſo a Believer is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by his <hi>coming</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6. 35. <hi>He
that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that
Believet on me ſhall never Thirſt,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.
For mens <hi>coming</hi> to Chriſt to learn of him what
he hath done and will do for their Souls, and
what they themſelves are to do that they may
be ſaved, is the effect of their believing him
to be the Son of God, and ſent of God to bring
Salvation unto Men, and to declare how and
upon what Terms it is to be had.</p>
            <p>And ſo when Believers are deſcribed by their
receiving of Chriſt, as <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. <hi>As many
as received him, to them he gave power to become
the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his
Name,</hi> they are then deſcribed by the effect of
their Faith alſo. For when they receive him
for what indeed he is, Prieſt, Prophet and King,
it is becauſe they believe that evidence by
which he appears to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, when <hi>Believers</hi> are deſcribed by
their <hi>Truſting</hi> in Chriſt, or <hi>Relying</hi> on him, as
in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 12—<hi>Who firſt truſted in Chriſt.</hi>
Their Faith is deſcribed by its <hi>effect.</hi> For men
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95744:69"/>
will not venture their Souls in truſting in Chriſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
on him for the expiation of their Sins by his Blood,
for direction what to do that they may be ſaved, and for
Pardon and eternal Life upon the condition upon which
thoſe Benefits are promiſed, untill they firſt believe him
to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Son of God and Saviour of the
World, upon ſome evidence they have that he is ſo.</p>
            <p>But although the Holy Penmen of the Scriptures did not
in every deſcription of ſaving Faith, attend unto the
Rules of Art, by taking in all the eſſential parts, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
it ſometimes by its aſſenting Act and Object, and
ſometimes by its Fruits and Effects, as occaſions did occur:
Yet we for our parts ſhall be beſt able to make a right
Judgment of the true Nature of Saving Faith, by that
which reſults out of the ſeveral deſcriptions of it in
Scripture when compared together. And by comparing
thoſe ſeveral deſcriptions together, we may alſo perceive
that when Faith as ſaving is deſcribed by its <hi>Effects,</hi>
yet then the aſſenting Act of Faith upon its <hi>Object</hi> is ſtill
implyed, ſuppoſed, and ought to be underſtood, though it
be not there expreſt: and ſo are the effects too, when but
only the Act and Object are mentioned.</p>
            <p>By all which we may learn, that thoſe are none of the
beſt definitions of ſaving Faith which Men make, when
they define it by the Act and Object <hi>alone,</hi> or by any of
the Effects <hi>alone.</hi>
