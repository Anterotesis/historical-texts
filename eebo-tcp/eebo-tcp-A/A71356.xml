            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We therefore, being ≈øolemnly ≈øummoned and a≈ø≈øemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as is u≈øual, upon this pre≈øent Subject, have re≈øolved and determined, out of the alledged and other weighty re≈øpects and rea≈øons, with a general and unanimous con≈øent to declare;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Prince of Orange, in behalf of this Province, together with the other Confederates of the A≈ø≈øembly of their High and mighty Lord≈øhips the States General, ≈øhall be cho≈øen and nominated Captain and Admiral General of the United Netherlands, with a convenient Commi≈ø≈øion and In≈øtructions to be agreed and concluded upon between the ≈øeveral Provinces, and a yearly revenue of 100000 Gilders for his maintenance, to be levied upon the States account, and to begin from the time the Commi≈ø≈øion is i≈ø≈øued out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To which purpo≈øe, certain Deputies are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by this a≈ø≈øembly, to repair to the a≈ø≈øembly of the Lords States General, to tender to their Lord≈øhips this point of electing a Governor, and with the be≈øt rea≈øons to procure their con≈øent, and a ≈øpeedy effect of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That a tender of the charge of Governor, Captain and Admiral-general of both the Provinces, be pre≈øently made to his Highne≈øs the ≈øaid Prince of Orange, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Commi≈ø≈øion and in≈øtructions to be i≈ø≈øued out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, to which the Lords States of Holland are to be required to give their concurrence, that ≈øo in regard of their
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:97700:493"/>
common intere≈øts, and according to antient practice, this affair may be determined <hi>pari pa≈ø≈øu,</hi> and with joint advice; and that a Commi≈ø≈øion be drawn and ≈øealed, as it was done in the year 1647.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet in ca≈øe this appointment of the Prince for the abovementioned places ≈øhould not take effect with the Lords States General, and the States of Holland, contrary to the expectation, wi≈øh and good intention of this a≈ø≈øembly, that then, upon a full report of their Deputies concerning their negotiation, this A≈ø≈øembly will take care, and order affairs ≈øo, as may mo≈øt tend to the honor, welfare and ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the country.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is the unanimous con≈øent of the ≈øaid Lords States of Zealand, that the beforementioned Prince of Orange ≈øhall not exerci≈øe tho≈øe eminent charges of General and Admiral≈øhip, till his Highne≈øs come to be eighteen years of age; which charges (during his minority) are not to be executed by any under the name of Lieutenant, but remain as now they are, which two conditions are to be expre≈øly in≈øerted in the beforementioned Commi≈øsion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That pre≈øently by an unanimous con≈øent and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Members a≈ø≈øembled, the dignity and place of the Fir≈øt Noble ≈øhall be pre≈øented to the Prince, he being the mo≈øt con≈øpicuous and qualified Nobleman of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; yet upon ≈øuch clau≈øes, re≈øtrictions and precautions, as the ≈øame dignity hath been heretofore conferred upon the Princes of Orange of immortal memory, without diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or prejudice of the priviledges of this Province, and other the ≈øeveral Members of this State.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Upon the conferring of ≈øuch charges, Honors and preheminences on the ≈øaid Prince, all po≈øsible care and order ≈øhall be taken for his Highne≈øs Education and Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as may be≈øt befit his Princely per≈øon and Illu≈øtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
