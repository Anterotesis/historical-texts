         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Then we do in humility and feare, witneſſe againſt the ſetting up or introducing any Perſon whatſoever, as King, or chiefe Magiſtrate, or a Houſe of Lords, or any other thing of like import, under what name or title ſoever, or any power ariſing from the <hi>Nation,</hi> as a Nation upon the old corrupt and almoſt ruinated conſtitution, apprehending that the great work of taking the Kingdome from Man, and giving it to Chriſt, hath had its beginning in the revolutions wee have been under.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Wee do humbly witneſſe againſt the foundation of future Violence, of bringing into, or continuing in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority any who joyned with the late ſingle Perſon, otherwiſe then by firſt manifeſting fruit meete for repentance, for ſuch miſdemeanors, by which our Rights, both as Chriſtians and as men have bin ſo much betrayed, and the name of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, after all his works of wonder with us, ſo much thereby prophaned, to our greateſt griefe even throughout and beyond the bounds of theſe three <hi>Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Wee do hereby humbly witneſſe againſt the imploying in the Armies, or Navy, any Commanders who have been active in the Reſignation of the Government to the deceaſed ſingle Perſon, or in the abuſing any Chriſtians mett to mourne over their back-ſlidings and abominations, or that informed againſt or ſupplanted their diſſenting Brethren, or were princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall in contriving or preſenting any of the blaſphemous or flattering addreſſes, or were Jaolers or Keepers of their Bretheren, in Holds or Priſons, or that received extraordinary rewards or titles of honour from the late ſingle Perſon or his Succeſſor, or any deriving power from them, or that acted by either of their Arbitrary Commands, to the baniſhment of any (without legall Tryall) out of the <hi>Nation,</hi> or that contrived or acted in the unrighteous and ſhamefull proceeding againſt ſuch of the late E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy as lived peaceably, and had no hand in the inſurrection, by decimating of them contrary to Articles and publique faith of the <hi>Nation,</hi> unleſſe ſome good proofe of repentance in truth, be manifeſted for theſe, or ſuch of theſe abominations, as they ſhall be found guilty of.</p>
            <p>And poſitively, we do now deſire witneſſe for, and humbly aſſert, that the <hi>right</hi> of making and giving Lawes unto men, <hi>is originally in God,</hi> who hath given this power, as well as the execution thereof, unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> as hee is the Sonn of man, and <note place="margin">

And we do claim, that only men of courage, fearing God, and hating Covetouſneſſe, might be imployed in the truſt of <hi>Rule,</hi> and in all places of publique Judicature; yea, if it be poſſible, in every place of publique Truſt in theſe three <hi>Nations.</hi> And that all the Lawes reſpecting the right of men, might be ſo truly ordered by the Scriptures to the exaltation of Chriſt, our Lord, King, and Law-giver, as that in point of right no difference might be made betwixt good and bad, nor this or that profeſſion in Religion, but by one right Role the offendor may be puniſhed, and the injured effectually relieved with expedition: the ſaid Lawes being firſt ſo plainely declared, as the pooreſt in the Land may underſtand their Caſe; and that it be diſpenſed ſo nigh their dwellings, as that Judgment might not be turned into Wormwood, as hitherto it hath been, through partiality, intricacy, vexatious delayes, and diſtances.</p>
            <p>That as an intollerable burthen and oppreſſion, inconſiſtent with the Rights aforeſaid, or true liberty of Conſcience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, the Rulers over men forbeare for ever to impoſe any nationall, parochiall Miniſtry, ſo as to inforce any forme of Worſhip ſuited to their intereſt, or compell men of one perſwaſion, to maintaine any man of another, in the Miniſtry.</p>
