         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

King of Great Britain, France and Ireland.</head>
            <p>THIS Pious, tho' Unfortunate Prince <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt,
King of <hi>Great Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> was the
Son of <hi>James</hi> the 6th, King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> his
Wife, Daughter to the King of <hi>Denmark:</hi> He was born at
<hi>Dunfermeling,</hi> one of the Principal Towns of <hi>Fife</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
on <hi>Novem. 19. Anno</hi> 1600. in ſo much Weakneſs, that his
Baptiſm was haſten'd without the uſual Ceremonies; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ſeeming to Conſecrate him to Suffering from the very
Womb. At 2 years of Age he was created Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi>
Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Earl of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and Baron of <hi>Ardmanock.</hi>
When he was 3 years Old, he was committed to the Care
and Governance of Sir <hi>Robert Cary</hi>'s Lady, as a Reward for
being the firſt Meſſenger of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Death. At 11
years of age he was made Knight of the Garter, and the next
Year his elder Brother Prince <hi>Henry</hi> dying, he ſucceeded him
in the Dukedom of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> When he was 16 years of Age
he was created Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Flint,</hi>
the Revenues thereof being aſſigned him for the Maintenance
of his Court. At 22 years of Age, he was ſent by the King
his Father into <hi>Spain,</hi> to contract a Marriage with the <hi>Iafanta,</hi>
but this was liker to turn into a War with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and
a Marriage was ſought with <hi>Henrieta Maria</hi> the youngeſt
Daughter of the <hi>French King.</hi> In the interim of which King
<hi>James</hi> died at <hi>Theobalds, Sunday</hi> March the 27th, 1625. And
Prince <hi>Charles</hi> was immediately proclaim'd King at the Court
Gate, and ſo throughout the three Kingdoms, with infinite
Rejoycings. His firſt Publick Act was celebrating his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Funeral, whereat himſelf was chief Mourner, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Practice of all his Royal Predeceſſors: When he
had paid that Debt, he next provided for Poſterity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
haſtened the coming over of his Royal Conſort, whom
he received at <hi>Dover,</hi> and was Married on <hi>Trinity-Sunday</hi> at
<hi>Canterbury.</hi> Thus having diſpatched the Affairs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
he applyed himſelf to thoſe of the Kingdom, in which
he ſeem'd not ſo much to aſcend a Throne, as to wreſtle
with all the Difficulties of a corrupted State, whoſe long
Peace had ſoften'd the Nobles into Court-Pleaſures, and made
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32824:2"/>
the Commons Inſolent by a great Plenty. His Firſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
began <hi>June</hi> 18. At the Opening of which the King
acquainted them with the neceſſary Supplies for the War with
<hi>Spain,</hi> which they had importunatly thro' his Mediation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
his Father in, which after ſome Petitions and Delays,
they anſwer'd but with two Subſidies, too poor a ſtock to
furniſh an Army, yet was kindly receiv'd: in Expectation of
more at the next Sitting: For the Infection ſeizing upon <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
the Parliament was adjouru'd till <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when they
were to meet at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and at that time he paſs'd ſome Acts
that were preſented to him. At the next Seſſion, he gave a
Complying and Satisfactory Anſwer to all their Petitions, and
expected a Return in larger Subſidies, toward the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War,
but inſtead of theſe, there were high and furious Debates;
Grievances, Conſultations to form and Publiſh Remonſtrances,
Accaſations againſt the <hi>Duke of Buckingham;</hi> which the King
eſteeming Reproaches of his Government, Diſſolves that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
hoping to find one of a leſs Cholerick Complexion
after his Coronation. This drew after it another Miſchief,
the Miſcarriage of the Deſigns upon <hi>Spain</hi> by rendring (for
want of Supplies) the Fleet uncapable of attempting
<hi>Cadiz.</hi> And now <hi>Feb. 2d.</hi> the King perform'd the Ceremony of
his Coronation, after which he began a <hi>2d.</hi> Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Commons Voted him 4 Subſidies, but the Faction then
forming in the Kingdom, tacking it to other matters, as the
Ruine of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and Remonſtrances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Government: the King Diſſolves the Parliament
(<hi>June</hi> 18.) and the Bill for the Subſidies never paſs'd. This
miſunderſtanding at Home, produc'd another War abroad,
for the King of <hi>France</hi> taking advantage of theſe Domeſtick
Broils began open War and Seiz'd upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants
in the River of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> The next Year (1627) the King
quicken'd by the Petitions of the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> who ſued for his
Protection, as well as by the Juſtice of his own Cauſe, ſent
the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to attack the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> which
partly thro' the Duke's Conduct miſcarried. This occaſion'd
the King to call another Parliament, which in the begining
prov'd very ſhamefull, but the Faction labour to form new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
and Jealouſies, and are again hammering out Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances
to Reproach him and his Government which the
King being unable to endure, he Adjourns the Parliament.
<hi>June 26th.</hi> till <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. ſoon after Peace was clapt up with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32824:3"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second Born, all was in Peace and
Quietneſs till 1632 when the King took a journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
to receive the Imperial Crown there, and was accordingly
Crown'd at <hi>Edenburgh June 10th.</hi> and return'd with great
welcome again into <hi>Eungland;</hi> But the Malecontents here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
their Poyſon; they complain'd of Invaſions on their
<hi>Spiritual Liberttes,</hi> becauſe the Biſhops endeavour'd to reduce
the Ceremonies of the Church to their Primitive Obſervance,
for which both his Majeſty and they were defam'd with <hi>Popery:</hi>
And now the Tax of Ship-Money appear'd that was likewiſe
pretended a Breach to their Civil Liberties, and contrary to
Law, becauſe not laid by Parliament: Amidſt all theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and Calumnies the King hitherto had Govern'd ſo,
that ſober Men could not Pray for, nor Heaven grant in mercy
to a People any greater happineſs; but for the Arts and Fury
of ſome Wicked Men, who endeavour'd to overwhelm every
Part of the Kings Dominions with a Deluge of Blood. The
firſt ſtorm aroſe from the <hi>North,</hi> where Diſputes were man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag'd
about Church Government; till at length the King
Marches that way with a Gallant Army, and Oblig'd the <hi>Scots</hi>
to ſue for an Accommodation; but they ſoon broke their Faith
as ſoon as the King had Disbanded his Army; which occaſion'd
the King to prepare for another Army, and in order thereto
calls a Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and another in <hi>England,</hi> which
latter he was fain to Diſſolve without any Effect. The King
however, Vigourouſly Proſecuted his Undertaking, and rais'd
a ſufficient Army, but could not do it with equal ſpeed to his
Enemies, ſo that he gave a Defeat to a Party of it, e're the
Rear could be brought up, Commanded by the Earl of <hi>Strafford:</hi>
He was no ſooner arriv'd at the Army himſelf, but there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him a Petition of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords, Conformable to
the <hi>Scotch Remonſtrance,</hi> which they call'd the <hi>Inventions of the
Army;</hi> ſo that his Majeſty might juſtly fear ſome attempts in
the <hi>South,</hi> while he was thus Defending himſelf in the <hi>North.</hi>
The King anſwer'd theſe Petitioners to their Satisfaction,
which was to Summon all the Peers to Conſult what would be
moſt Conducive to the ſafety and Honour of the Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who accordingly met <hi>S. p.</hi> 24. where it was determin'd that
a Parliament ſhould be call'd to meet <hi>Novem.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. and in the
mean time a Ceſſation ſhould be made with the <hi>Scots Novem 3d.</hi>
began that fatal Parliament that Involved the Nation in a
Sea of blood, ruin'd the King, and betray'd all there own
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32824:3"/>
Privileges, and the Peoples Liberty into the Power of a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick
and Perfidious Army. And tho' his Majeſty could not
hope to find them Moderate, yet he endeavour'd to make
them ſo, Committing himſelf freely to the Direction of his
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, promiſing to ſatisfie all their juſt Grievances,
but the Malignity of ſome few, and the Ignorance of others
Employ'd that Aſſembly to other matters, Firſt in purging
the Houſe of ſuch as they thought would not comply with
their Deſtructive Enterprizes, then they declar'd upon publick
Grievances, every way raiſing up Contumelies againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Power. Then they fell upon all the Chief Miniſters of
State, Impeach'd the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> and others, and after five Months time, for ſo long
they took to take up Evidence: the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> is brought
to his Tryal; Condemn'd and Beheaded, when this was done,
the Parliament began to think of ſending home the <hi>Scots,</hi> and
his Majeſty follows them into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſettle the Kingdom,
while the King was here, broke out the Popiſh Rebellion in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> which help'd yet more to enflame matters. The next
thing after the Kings Return from <hi>Scotland,</hi> was to take away
the Votes of the Biſhops in the Houſe of Lords, and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
in the Church: And Twelve of the Biſhops that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
aganſt this unwarrantable Proceeding were Committed
to the Tower. They ſpread a rumour, that they intended to
Impeach the Queen of High-Treaſon, which neceſitates the
King to ſend Her into <hi>France</hi> for her Security, and beſides the
attempts upon his Honour; they endeavour another upon his
Family, in Seizing upon the Prince, and Duke of York, which
the King hearing, he immediately removes with the two young
Princes to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> in order to his Journey to the <hi>North,</hi> where
he intended to ſettle his Abode till he ſaw what Iſſue this
ſtorm would have, and that the King on his arrival there,
ſhould not make uſe of that Magazine at <hi>Hull,</hi> which at his
own Charges he had provided for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Expedition.
The Parliament ſend down Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> to Seize upon
them, who when his Majeſty approach'd the Place, ſhut the
Gates againſt him, aed deny'd him Entrance: And now began
to kindle the War, which ſoon took Fire on the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Parliament having the Navy in their Hands:
Some vain Propoſals of Peace from the King, haſten'd all they
cou'd to raiſe Horſe and Foot: They ſeiz'd alſo upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of the <hi>King, Queen, Prince,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops:</hi> and plunder'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32824:4"/>
the Houſes of thoſe Lords and Gentlemen, whom they Suſpected to be
Favourites of the Kings Cauſe. His Majeſty in the interim, moved from
<hi>York</hi> to <hi>Nothingham,</hi> and thence to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> gathering an Army greater
than his Enemies imagin'd he could have form'd; with which he begins
his March towards <hi>London,</hi> and in his way thither, met with <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army,
and at <hi>Edgehill</hi> gave them Battle, and Routed them; took <hi>Banbury,</hi>
and enter'd Tryumphantly into <hi>Oxford;</hi> and having ſecur'd that Place, he
Advances toward <hi>London,</hi> and fell upon the remainder of <hi>Eſſe</hi>'s Army,
at <hi>Brentford,</hi> ſunk their Ordnance, and took Five hundred Priſoners
and intended to proceed to <hi>London,</hi> but that he had intelligence that the
City was ſending all their Auxillaries to Re-inforce <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Troops,
wherefore he returned again to <hi>Oxford.</hi> At the opening of the Spring
1643. the Queen comes back into <hi>England,</hi> bringing with her conſiderable
Supplies, and great ſucceſſes follow'd it, for he obtains an Advantage, at
<hi>Edghill</hi> that <hi>Oxford,</hi> and is Marching toward <hi>London,</hi> Succeſſes follow'd it.
This put the Parliament upon a direct Method to encraſe the Nations
Miſeries by calling in the <hi>Scotch</hi> to their aſſiſtance: The Winter was ſpent
on both ſides in preparations, tho' the King wrote for Peace, but they
burnt his Letters by the Hand of the Common Hangman, The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Forces encreaſed by the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Succours, obtain ſeveral Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
over the Kings Party. His Majeſty having once more provided for
the ſafety of the Queen, by ſending her to <hi>Exeter,</hi> there to be brought to
Bed, and from thence ſeek ſhelter in <hi>France,</hi> taking his laſt farewell of
her, left <hi>Oxford</hi> ſtrengthned againſt the Siege, and afterwards falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> at <hi>Cropedy-Bridge,</hi> obtained a Compleat Victory,
which wou'd have been of more Conſequence, but for his Majeſties
tenderneſs in ſhedding his Subjects Blood. But all theſe little Advantages
weighed little to what ſoon followed in the Irrepareable Blow to the King's
Intereſt, receiv'd at <hi>Marſton-Moor</hi> under Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> which was ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Surrender of <hi>York,</hi> and all the whole <hi>North</hi> was reduc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to the
Obedience of the Parliament: The King had ſome ſmall ſucceſs in the
<hi>Weſt</hi> againſt <hi>Fſſex,</hi> yet in general the tyde run againſt him, and his Forces
grew Weaker every day; <hi>Jan. 10th.</hi> the Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was Beheaded
on <hi>Tower-Hill:</hi> The fatal Battle of <hi>Naſeby</hi> follow'd ſoon after, upon which
the Kings Garriſons Surrender'd by heaps, and his Affairs quite ruined in
<hi>England,</hi> all his hopes were now on <hi>Scotland,</hi> which <hi>Montroſs</hi> had Conqur'd
almoſt from one end to the other; but at laſt he was quite Vanquiſh'd:
under theſe Diſtreſſes His Majeſty finding no Security for his Perſon, for
the Parliament would not let him come to <hi>London:</hi> wherefore having no
other hopes, he put himſelf into the Power of the <hi>Scots;</hi> then Beſieging
<hi>Newark;</hi> who inſtead of Protecting him, make a Bargain and Sale of him
to the Parliament, for <hi>200000l.</hi> and <hi>200000l.</hi> more when they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
up <hi>Berwick</hi> and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſons they were Poſſeſs'd of; ſo
the <hi>Scots</hi> return home, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having bought the King, confine
him to <hi>Holmby-Houſe;</hi> a Seat of his own in <hi>Northamtonſhire.</hi> And now
the buſineſs, as they thought being done, there was like to be more Diſputes,
for the next Difference is between the Parliament and the Army; the
latter Seize the King, and oppoſe and give Laws to their Maſters: So
that now both the Army and the Parliament Court his Majeſty: The
latter ſend him Conditions of Peace, and the former offer to Settle him on
his Throne, he rejected thoſe Propoſitions. Nor did they agree much
better about his Perſon: The Parliament ſend Inſtructions for his being
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32824:4"/>
reſident at <hi>Richmond,</hi> but the Army cannot ſubmit to his being ſo near the
Parliament; they Convey him firſt to <hi>Royſton,</hi> thence to <hi>Hatfield,</hi> and not
long after to <hi>Cauſam,</hi> and at length to <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi> And now the
Miſtery of Iniquity begins to work; <hi>Cromwell</hi> being affraid that the King
ſhou'd aggree with the Parliament, offer'd to ſtand by him with the Army,
and conſidering likewiſe that he cou'd not accompliſh his Deſigns while
the King remain'd ſo near the Parliament; ſent privately to the King,
that he was in no Safety their, and that he wou'd be more ſecure in the
<hi>Iſle of White:</hi> upon which the poor King ſo deluded makes his Eſcape
thither by Night: and there ſent Propoſitions to the Parliament; which
they reject with Indignation: Becauſe the King would include the <hi>Scots</hi>
Intereſt: Upon this the <hi>Scots</hi> Enter <hi>England, Demanding that the King
might be brought to</hi> London, <hi>the Army Disbanded, and a laſting Peace ſettled
between the two Kingdoms,</hi> and joyning with Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> for
the King, they rout <hi>Lambert</hi> at <hi>Appleby,</hi> and afterwards March into <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi>
intending for <hi>London,</hi> but <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> joyning Armies,
gave them an Entire Overthrow: After which <hi>Cromwell</hi> Marched into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and was Victorious there; and now the Army out Plotting the
Parliament call'd loudly to have the King brought to Juſtice: In the mean
time His Majeſty was Convey'd out of the <hi>Iſle of White,</hi> and carried Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
to <hi>Hurſt-Caſtle:</hi> and the Houſe being New-Moulded by the Army;
proceeded <hi>to reſtore the Vote of Non-Addreſs: That no Meſſage be received
from the King on pain of Treaſon, and that the Council of State ſhou'd draw up a
Charge of Treaſon againſt him:</hi> Decemb: <hi>10th.</hi> the King was brought from
<hi>Hurſt-Caſtle</hi> to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and from thence to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and all things were
preparing for his Diſmal Tragedy, in which the <hi>Juncto</hi> proceeded, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Diſſent of the Lords and the Remonſtrance of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt it; ſo that they appointed a New Tribunal,
called the <hi>High-Court of Juſtice,</hi> who were impower'd to Hear, Try, Judge
and Execute <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> King of <hi>England:</hi> They Annull'd his Title, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> to be Broken, and a New one to be made.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday Jan. 20th.</hi> This Wicked High-Court of Juſtice ſat in
<hi>Weſtminſter-Hall; John Bradſhaw</hi> was Preſident of this Pretended Court;
the Counſellors to draw up the Charge, were <hi>Dorislaus,</hi> Dr. of Civil Laws,
<hi>John Cooke</hi> Solliciter, <hi>Danby</hi> Serjeant at Arms: With Clerks, Meſſengers
and Doorkeepers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court being thus ſat, and call'd over, the King was brought to
the Bar by Collonel <hi>Hacker,</hi> Conducting him to a Chair within the Bar,
And then <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſaid to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Charles Stuart:</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> being
ſenſible of the Calamity brought upon this Nation, and of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Blood ſhed, which are Imputed to you as the Author: according
to that Duty which they ow to God and the Nation, and themſelves;
and according to that Power and Fundamental Truſt repoſed in them by
the People; have Conſtituted this <hi>High-Court of Juſtice,</hi> before which
you are now brought, and are to hear your Charge, upon which the
Court will proceed.</q> Then the Solliciter accus'd him of High-Treaſon,
and the Charge was ordered to be read, tho' the King deſired firſt to be
heard.</p>
            <p>The King often ſmil'd whilſt the Charge was reading, eſpecially at thoſe
words: <hi>Tyrant, Traytor, Murderer,</hi> &amp;c. Then Spoke <hi>Bradſhaw:</hi> Sir you
have heard your Charge, and you find in the cloſe of it, that the Court
is Prayed in behalf of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> that you anſwer to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32824:5"/>
Charge, which the Court now expects. Then the King demanded by
what Authority they had brought him thither? To which <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> told
him, That he was not to diſpute that, but to anſwer his Charge; and the
King ſtill denying the Juriſdiction of the Court, it was adjourn'd till <hi>Monday</hi>
following; ſo the King was conducted back; ſeveral factious Fellows and
lewd Soldiers ſhouting out for Juſtice, thinking the reſt of the People would
have hallow'd to the ſame Tune; but inſtead thereof, they almoſt all cryed
out, <hi>God bleſs the King.</hi> On <hi>Monday, Jan.</hi> 22d, the King was brought again
to his Tryal, at what time the King with abundance of Eloquence argued
againſt their pretended <hi>High Court,</hi> and not being able to out-reaſon him
that Day neither, they adjourn'd their Court again till the next; which was
<hi>Tueſday, Jan.</hi> 23. the Court ſate again, and ſeventy three Commiſſioners
were preſent.</p>
            <p>The King being brought into Court, Sollicitor <hi>Cook</hi> ſumm'd up what had
been already done in it, and complaining of the great delay of Juſtice, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for a ſpeedy Judgment againſt the King.</p>

               <p>Sir, you have heard what is mov'd by the Council on behalf

Obligation that was laid upon me by God to maintain the Liberties of my
People; the ſame Obligation you ſpeak of calls upon me to defend, as

Privileges of the People your Actions have ſpoken; but, truly, Sir, Men's

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is well known to all here preſent, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
at the Bar hath been ſeveral times convented, and brought before this
Court, to make Anſwer to a Charge of High-Treaſon, and other Crimes
exhibited againſt him, in the Name of the people of <hi>England,</hi> to which
Charge being required to Anſwer, he hath been ſo far from Obeying the
Commands of the Court, by ſubmitting to their Juſtice, as he began to take
upon him reaſoning, and debating unto the Authority of the Court, and to
the Higheſt Court that appointed them to Try and Judge him; but being
Over-rul'd in that, and required to make his Anſwer, he ſtill continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious,
and refus'd to ſubmit to an anſwer; hereupon the Court, that
they may not be wanting to themſelves, nor the Truſt repos'd in them, nor
that any Man's Wilfulneſs prevent Juſtice they have conſider'd of the Charge,
and of the Contumacy, and of that confeſſion which, in Law, doth ariſe on
that Contumacy; they have alſo conſider'd the Notoriety of the Fact charg'd
upon this Priſoner, and upon the whole matter, they are reſolved, and have
agreed upon a Sentence to be pronounced againſt him; but in reſpect he
doth deſire to be heard before the Sentence be pronounced againſt him, the
Court doth reſolve to hear him; yet, Sir, this I muſt tell you before-hand,
which you have been minded of at our Courts, if that which you have to
ſay be to offer any Debate concerning the Juriſdiction, you are not to be
heard in it. You have offer'd it formerly, and you have <hi>ſtruck as the root,</hi>
that is, the Power and Supreme Authority of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi>
which this Court will not admit a Debate of, and which indeed is an irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
thing in them to do, being a Court that Acts upon Authority derived
from them: But, Sir, if you have any thing to ſay in defence of your ſelf,
concerning the matter charged, the Court has given me in command to hear
you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>King.</speaker>
               <p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32824:6"/>
that which, I confeſs, I thought moſt material for the Peace of the
Kingdom, and for the Liberty of the Subject, I ſhall wave it; but only I
muſt tell you, that this many a day all things have been taken away from
me, but that that I call dearer to me than my Life, which is my <hi>Conſcience
and my Honour,</hi> and if I had reſpect to my Life, more than the Peace of
the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject, certainly I ſhould have made
a particular defence for my Life, for by that at leaſt wiſe, I might have
delay'd an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gly Sentence,</hi> which I believe will paſs upon me, therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
Sir, as a Man that hath ſome underſtanding, ſome knowledge of the
World, if that true Zeal to my Country had not over born the Care that
I have for my own preſervation, I ſhould have gone another way to work
than that I have done. Now, Sir, I conceive that a haſty Sentence once
paſs'd, may ſooner be repented of, than recall'd, and truly the ſelf ſame
deſire that I have for the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the
Subject, more than my own particular Ends, makes me now at laſt deſire
that I may ſay ſomething that concerns both. I deſire that before Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be given, that I may be heard in the Printed Chamber, before the
Lords and Commons. This delay cannot be prejudicial to you, whatſoever
I ſay, if that I ſay be no Reaſon, thoſe that hear muſt be Judges. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Judge of that which I have to ſay, if it be reaſon, and really for
the welfare of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject, I am ſure it
is very well worth the hearing; therefore I do conjure you, as you love
that which you pretend, I hope it is real, the Liberty of the Subject and
Peace of the Kingdom, that you will grant me this hearing before any
Sentence paſſeth; but if I cannot get this Liberty, I do proteſt that your
fair ſhews of Liberty and Peace, are pure ſhews, and that you will not hear
your King.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſaid this was declining the Juriſdiction of the Court, and delay,

            <p>
               <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſaid to the King, that the Court had conſidered what he had
moved, and alſo their own Authority; the return from the Court, ſaid he,
is this, That they have been too much delayed by you already, and are
Judges appointed by the higheſt Authority, and Judges are no more delay
than to deny Juſtice, and notwithſtanding what you have Offer'd, they are
reſolved to proceed to Sentence and to Judgment, that is their Unanimous
Reſolution.</p>
            <p>The King preſs'd again, and again, that he might be heard by the Lords and
Commons in the Painted Chamber with great Earneſtneſs, <hi>and was often denied
by</hi> Bradſhaw, <hi>at laſt the King deſired that this motion of his might be
entred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> began in a long Speech to declare the Grounds of the Sentence,
highly aggravating the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s pretended Offences, and miſapplying both
Law and Hiſtory to his preſent purpoſe; and when <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> had done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Broughten</hi> the Clerk, Read the Sentence drawn up in Parchment to
this Effect.</p>
            <p>That whereas the Commons of <hi>England</hi> had appointed them an High-Court
of Juſtice, for the Trial of <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> before
whom he had been three times Convened, and at the firſt time a Charge of
High Treaſon and other High Crimes and Miſdemeanors, was read in the
behalf of Kingdom of the <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> which Charge being read unto him as
aforeſaid, he the ſaid <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> was required to give his Anſwer, but
he refuſed ſo to do, and ſo expreſs'd the ſeveral paſſages at the Trial, in

refuſing to Anſwer, for all which Treaſons and Crimes, this Court doth
Adjudge, that he the ſaid <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> as a Tyrant, Traytor, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,

his Body.</p>
            <p>After the Sentence was Read, <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſaid, This Sentence now Read and

            <p>The King being not allowed to Reply, was taken by his Guards to Sir
<hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Houſe, and as he paſs'd down Stairs, the <hi>Rude Soldiers</hi> Scoff'd
at him, blew the Smoak of their Tobacco in his Face (a thing always very

inſolent than the reſt, <hi>Spit in his Face,</hi> which his Majeſty patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiped off, taking no farther notice of it: And as he paſs'd farther, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome of them by the inſtigation of their Officers, cry out, <hi>Juſtice, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and Execution,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Alas poor Souls, for a Piece of Money, they would
do as much for their Commanders.</hi> Afterward the King hearing that his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
was determined to be the next day, before the Palace at <hi>White-hall,</hi>
he ſent an Officer in the Army to deſire them, that he might ſee his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
before his Death, and that Doctor <hi>Juxon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> might be
permitted to aſſiſt him in his private Devotions, and receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both which were granted to him upon a Motion to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The ſame day that the Warrant was Signed for his Execution, the Duke
of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were brought to him, whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with great Joy and Satisfaction, and giving his Bleſſing to the Princeſs,
<hi>He bid her remember to tell her Brother</hi> James, <hi>that he ſhould no more look vpon</hi>
Charles <hi>as his Elder Brother only, but as his Sovereign, and that they ſhould
Love one another, and forgive their Fathers Enemies.</hi> Then taking the Duke
of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> upon his Knee, ſaid, <hi>Sweet-Heart, now they will cut off thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Head</hi> (at which Words the Child looked very wiſhfully upon him) <hi>Mark
Child what I ſay, they will cut off my Head, and perhaps make thee a King; but
mark what I ſay, you muſt not be a King ſo long as your Brothers.</hi> Charles <hi>and</hi>
James <hi>are alive; for they will cut off your Brothers Heads, as ſoon as they can catch
them, and cut thy Head off too at laſt, and therefore I charge you, do not be made
a King by them.</hi> At which the Child ſighing ſaid, <hi>I will be torn in pieces firſt</hi>
—which falling ſo unexpectedly from a Child ſo young, it made the
King rejoyce exceedingly.</p>
            <p>On the fatal day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> read
Divine Service in his preſence, and the 27 of <hi>Matthew,</hi> the Hiſtory of our
Saviour's Paſſion being appointed by the Church for that Day; he gave the
Biſhop thanks for his ſeaſonable choice of the Leſſon; but the Biſhop acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him that it was the Service of the Day, it comforted him exceedingly,
and then he proceeded to receive the Holy Sacrament. His Devotions being
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32824:7"/>
ended, he was brought from St. <hi>James</hi>'s to <hi>White-hall,</hi> by a Regiment of Foot,
part before and part behind, with a Private Guard of <hi>Partiſans</hi> about him,
the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> on the on the one Hand, and Colonel <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> who
had the Charge of him on the other Bareheaded. The Guards marching
but a ſlow pace, the King bid them go faſter, ſaying; That he now went
before them to ſtrive for an Heavenly Crown, with leſs ſollicitude than he
had often encouraged his Soldiers to Fight for an Earthly Diadem. Being
come to the end of the Park, he went up the Stairs leading to the Long Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
in <hi>White-hall,</hi> where formerly he uſed to Lodge, and there finding an
expected delay, the Scaffold being not ready, he paſt moſt of that time in
Prayer. About twelve a Clock, Colonel <hi>Hacker,</hi> with other Officers and
Soldiers, brought the King with the Biſhop and Colonel <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> through
the Banquetting-Houſe, to the Scaffold, a Paſſage being made through a
Window. A ſtrong Guard of ſeveral Regiments of Horſe and Foot, were
planted on all ſides, which hindred the near approach of his Mourning Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
(who for diſcovering their Sorrow were barbarouſly uſed) and the
King from ſpeaking to be heard, and therefore being upon the Scaffold, he
chiefly directed his Speech to the Biſhop, and Colonel <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> to this
purpoſe.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I ſhall be very little heard of any body elſe, I ſhall therefore ſpeak a
Word to you here; indeed I could have held my Peace very well, if I did
not think that holding my Peace would make ſome Men think that I did
ſubmit to the Guilt, as well as the Puniſhment; but I think it is my Duty
to God firſt, and then to my Country, to clear my ſelf, both as an Honeſt
Man, a Good King, and a Good Chriſtian. I ſhall firſt begin with my
Innocency, and in Troth I think it not very needful to inſiſt long upon
this, for all the World knows, that I did never begin a War with the two
Houſes of Parliaments, and I call God to Witneſs, unto whom I muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make an account, that I did never intend to Encroach upon their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
they began upon me, it is the Militia they began upon, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
the Militia was mine, but they thought fit to have it from me, and to
be ſhort, if any body will look to the <hi>Dates of Commiſſions,</hi> of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
and mine, and likewiſe to the <hi>Declaration,</hi> he will ſee clearly
that they began theſe Troubles, and not I. So as for the Guilt of theſe
Enormous Crimes that are laid againſt me, I hope that God will clear me.
I will not, for I am in Charity, and God forbid I ſhould lay it upon the
two Houſes of Parliament, there is no neceſſity of either, I hope they are
free of this Guilt; but I believe that ill Inſtruments between them and
me, have been the cauſe of all this Bloodſhed, ſo that as I find my ſelf
clear of this, I hope, and pray God, that they may too: yet for all this,
God forbid I ſhould be ſo ill a Chriſtian, as not to ſay God's Judgments
are juſt upon me, many times he doth pay Juſtice by an unjuſt Sentence,
that is ordinary, I will ſay this, that an unjuſt Sentence, that is ordinary,
I will ſay this, that an unjuſt Sentence that I ſuffer'd to take effect, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
by an unjuſt Sentence upon me; ſo far I have ſaid, to ſhew you that
I am an Innocent Man. Now to ſhew you that I am a good Chriſtian,
I hope there is a good Man [<hi>Pointing to the Biſhop</hi>] that will bear me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that I have forgiven all the World, and even thoſe in particular that
have been the cauſe of Death; who they are God knows, I do not deſire
to know, I pray God forgive them; but this not all, my Charity muſt
go farther, I wiſh that they may Repent, indeed they have committed a
great ſin in that particular. I pray God with St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> that be not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32824:7"/>
laid to their charge; and withal, that they may take the way to the
peace of the Kingdom, for my Charity commands me not only to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
particular men, but endeavour to the laſt gaſp, the peace of the
Kingdom. So, Sirs, I do with all my Soul, (<hi>I ſee there are ſome here
that will carry it farther</hi>) the peace of the Kingdom. Sirs, I muſt ſhew
you how you are out of the way, and put you in the way; firſt you are
out of the way, for certaily all the ways you ever had yet, as far as ever
I could find by any thing: If in the way of Conqueſt, certainly this is
an ill way, for Conqueſt in my Opinion, is never juſt, except there be a
good and juſt Cauſe, either for matter of Wrong, or a juſt Title, and
then if you go beyond the firſt Quarrel, that makes that Unjuſt at the
end that was Juſt at firſt; for if there be only matter of Conqueſt
then it is a Robbery, as a Pirate ſaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was a great
Robber, himſelf was but a petty Robber; and ſo, Sirs, I think for the
way that you are in, you are much out of the way. Now, Sirs, to put
put you in the way, believe it, you ſhall never go right, nor God will
never proſper you, until you give God his Due, the King his Due, (that
is my Succeſſor) and the People their Due: I am as much for them as
any of you. You muſt give God his Due, by regulating the Church
(according to the Scripture) which is now out of order; and to ſet you
in a way particularly now I cannot, but only this, <hi>A National Synod free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call'd, freely debating among themſelves muſt ſettle this:</hi> When every O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is freely heard: For the King indeed I will not, the Laws of
the Land will clearly inſtruct you for that, therefore becauſe it concerns
my own particular, I only give you a touch of it. For the people truly
I deſire their Liberty and Freedom as much as any body whoſoever;
but I muſt tell you that their Liberty and Freedom conſiſts in having
Government under thoſe Laws, by which their Lives and theirs may be
moſt their own. It is not in having a ſhare in the Government, that
is nothing appertaining to them; a Subject and a Sovereign, are clear
differing things, and therefore until you do that, I mean, that you put
the People into that Liberty as I ſay, they will never enjoy themſelves.</p>
               <p>Sir, It was for this that now I am come hither, for if I would
have given way to an Arbitrary Courſe, to have all Laws chang'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Power of the Sword, I need not to have come here;
and therefore I tell you (and I pray to God it be not laid to your
charge) that I am the Martyr of the People. In troth, Sirs, I ſhall not
hold you any longer, I will only ſay this to you, that I could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
ſome little time longer, becauſe I would have a little better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
this I have ſaid, and therefore I hope you will excuſe me; I have
delivered my Conſcience, I pray God you take take Courſes, that are
the beſt for the good of the Kingdom, and your own Salvation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p> Tho' your Majeſties affections may be very well known as to
Religion, yet it may be expected that you ſhould ſay ſomething thereof
for the World's Satisfaction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>King.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you heartily my Lord, for that I had almoſt forgotten it; in
Troth, Sirs, my Conſcience in Religion I think is very well known to all the World,
and therefore I declare before you all, That I dye a Chriſtian, according to the
Profeſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as I found it left me by my Father; and
this honeſt Man I think will witneſs it. <hi>Then ſpeaking to the Executioner,
he ſaid,</hi> I ſhall ſay but very ſhort Prayers, and when I thruſt out my hands,—
let that be your Sign.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:32824:8"/>
Then he called to the Biſhop for his Night Cap, and having
put it on, he ſaid to the Executioner, <hi>Does my Hair trouble
you;</hi> who deſired him to put it all under his Cap, which the
King did accordingly, with the help of the Executioner and
the Biſhop: Then turning to the Executioner, he ſaid, <hi>I have
a good Cauſe, and a righteous God on my ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p> There is but one Stage more, this Stage is turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and full of trouble, it is a ſhort one; but you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
it will ſoon carry you a very great way. It will carry
you from Earth to Heaven; and there you will find a great
deal of Cordial Joy and Happineſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>King.</speaker>
               <p>I go from a Corruptible, to an Incorruptible Crown,
where no diſturbance can be, no diſturbance in the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p> You are Exchanged from a Temporary, to an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Crown, a good Exchange.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the King ſaid, <hi>is my Hair well?</hi> and took off his Cloak
and his <hi>George,</hi> giving his <hi>George</hi> to the Biſhop, ſaying <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</hi>
Then he put off his Dublet, and being in his Waſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat,
he put on his Cloak again, then looking upon the Block,
he ſaid to the Executioner, <hi>You muſt ſet it faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Executioner.</speaker>
               <p> It is faſt Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>King. </speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>When I put out my Hands this way,</hi> ſtretching them
out—<hi>Then do your Work;</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p> after having ſaid two or three
Words to himſelf as he ſtood with Hands lift up to Heaven,
immediately ſtooping down, he laid his Neck upon the Block:
And then the Executioner again putting his Hair under his
Cap, the King thinking he had been going to ſtrike, ſaid, <hi>Stay
for the Sign.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Executioner.</speaker>
               <p> Yes, I will, and't pleaſure your Majeſty.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then after a little pauſe, the King ſtretching forth his Hands,
the Executioner at one blow ſevered his Head from his Body;
which, with his Body, was put into a Coffin cover'd with
black Velvet, and carried into his Lodgings at <hi>White-hall:</hi>
From thence it was carried to his Houſe at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, where
his Body was Embalm'd, and put into a Coffin of Lead, and
there lay a Fortnight to be ſeen of the People. On <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi>
ſeven-night after, his Corps embalm'd and coffin'd in
Lead, was deliver'd to the care of four of his Servants, <hi>viz.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> Captain <hi>Anthony Mildmay,</hi> Captain <hi>Preſton</hi> and
Mr. <hi>John Joyner,</hi> who, with others in Mourning, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the Herſe that night to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and placed it in the
Room which was formerly the King's Bed-chamber: Whence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32824:8"/>
it was next day removed into the Dean's Hall, and from
thence, by the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the Marquiſs of <hi>Hertford,</hi>
the Marquiſs of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> convey'd
to St. <hi>George</hi>'s Chapel, and there Interred in the Vault, as is
ſuppoſed, of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth and Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> with
this Inſcription upon the Coffin.</p>
            <q>CHARLES, King of England, MDCXLVIII.</q>
            <p>This Unfortunate Prince was of a Majeſtick, Comply Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
of a ſweet, grave, but melancholy aſpect; His Face was
regular, handſom, and well complexioned; his Body ſtrong,
healthy, and well made, and tho' of a low Stature, was able
to endure the greateſt Fatigues. In his temper he was Brave,
Magnificent, Liberal and Conſtant, a great Lover, and as
great a Maſter of Manly Exerciſes, and yet no leſs accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Graces, and Entertainments of a Court: Nor did
he fall ſhort of the braveſt Hero's in Perſonal Valour, having
expoſed his Perſon in every Battel he Fought, and oftentimes
Charging in the Head of his Squadrons. He had a good taſt
of Learning, and a more than ordinary skill in the Liberal
Arts, eſpecially Pai<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing, Sculpture, Architecture and Medals;
and being a generous Benefactor to the moſt celebrated Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
in thoſe Arts, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> acquired the Nobleſt Collection of any
Prince in his time, and more than all the Kings of <hi>England</hi>
had done before him. In his Devotions he was Conſtant,
Regular, and Intent, a great Patron of the Clergy of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo Zealous for the Doctrine and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of that Church, that he ſeal'd it with his Blood; and
when he could no longer ſupport it with his Arms, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it by his Pen, beyond all contraction. He was well
read in all the eſſential Points of Divinity, and was as great
a Maſter in it as his Father, but without the allay of Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
Of this, among ether things, the Papers that paſs'd
betwixt him, and <hi>Henderſon</hi> at <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> will be a laſting
Monument. He was a lover of Epiſcopacy, becauſe he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
its Antiquity and Excellency in Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in oppoſition to all other new invented Models
whatſoever. His great Preſence of Mind was Conſpicuous,
both in the Field and on the Scaffold, and was not miſtaken
in himſelf, when he ſaid before the High Court of Juſtice,
<hi>That he underſtood as much Law as any Private Gentleman in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
He was a Paſſionate Lover of the Queen, who was a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32824:9"/>
Beautiful Lady, and in all things very accompliſh'd: In ſhort
he was the Beſt of Husbands, the Beſt of Fathers, the Beſt of
Maſters, and peradventure the Beſt of Men. He ſpake ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Languages very well, and with a ſingular good Grace;
tho now and then, when he was warm in Diſcourſe he was
inclinable to ſtammer. He wrote a tolerable good Hand for
a King, but his Sence was ſtrong, and his Stile <hi>Laconick,</hi> and
yet he ſeldom writ in any Language but <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of his Manifeſto's, Declarations, and other Publick Papers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
drew himſelf, and moſt of them he Corrected. In comparing thoſe, of
the Kings with the Parliaments, he muſt have loſt his Underſtanding,
that does not give the Preference to the Kings, for ſtrength of reaſoning,
and Force of expreſſion. There are ſeveral pieces of his own Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
yet to be ſeen, which for Matter and Form, ſurpaſs thoſe of his
ableſt Miniſters, and come nothing ſhort of <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Falkland,</hi> two moſt
Celebrated Pens of that Time. What his Opinion was about Subjects De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
their Religion and Liberties by Force of Arms, appeared in the
Buſineſs of <hi>Rochel.</hi> For though ſome would have perſwaded us of late,
that Defenſive Arms were inconſiſtent with the Principles of the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> I hope they will not deny, but this King underſtood the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Principles of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, as well as any other Perſon
can pretend to know them; and yet it is certain that in his Practice and
Declarations, he approv'd of the <hi>Rochellerr</hi> Vindicating their Religion and
Liberties from the Encroachments made by their Sovereign, and that by
Force of Arms; and aſſiſted them in ſo doing. No Prince was better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the Principles of Government than he was, and his only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
was, that he ſometimes truſted to other Men's Counſels, rather
than to his own, and put ſo much Power into his Enemies hands in hopes
of gaining them, that he was no longer in Power to defend himſelf. In
effect, he was too good a Man to be a happy Prince, and rather was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
by his own tenderneſs than by the Force of his Enemies, as appears
by the ill uſe which was made of it in ſeveral Treaties, Councils and
Battels. To conclude, the War it ſelf was unjuſtifiable, Rebellious and
Barbarous; but the Formalities of proceeding againſt him by Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Tryal, Sentence and Execution, fill'd all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> with Horror
and Indignation; and 'tis to be fear'd that his Blood ſtill cries aloud for
Vengeance, againſt the Contrivers and Inſtruments of that Execrable
Murder, which no ſin can equal but the Juſtifying it; and tho' Indemnity
has pardon'd it, no Oblivion can deface it.</p>
