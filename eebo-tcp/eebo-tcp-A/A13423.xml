            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SIR, as Childhood brings us to manhood, manhood to old age, and old age to death, so (by consequence) a good life begets fame, which though Time doe seeme to devoure, yet when time is ended, an honest fame shall be invested with Eternitie. For as all the valiant men cannot boast of high birth and great houses, so all dejected and cowardly spirited mungrils are not borne in meane Tenements and poore Cottages: for my part (being a meere stranger unto you) I dare not to delineate your pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, having no skill in honourable <hi>Heraldry;</hi> yet hearing of the worthy forwardnesse, and fortunate endevours of yours, I could not refraine to set my pen to paper to the publishing of your late imminent dangers and most happy deliverance; which
<pb facs="tcp:11728:4"/>
by the Almighties blessings, and your valorous fight, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and the worthy and remarkable courage of your few men, for the glory of God and the honour of our Country, you have accomplished. Sir, I did not write this onely for your sake, but for the example of others, that they in the reading of it may in the first place magnifie his great name, who is the giver of all victorie; and secondly to be truly constant in all extremities, by your worthy imitation: for as charitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to forget mens faults, so it is shame and pittie that vertue and extraordinarie good Actions should be buried in the gulph of oblivion.</p>
            <p>I have made bold to make relation of what you know to be true in action; you doe know best if I have erred, which I hope I have not: I know that you are the sonne of a most worthy, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and serviceable Sea-man, whose old and good improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you doe most filially follow. To close up my dedication, I doe recommend my selfe and my labours to your love, you to your fathers, and both of you to the Almightie, craving par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for my boldnesse, and remaining yours.</p>

like the ghosts or Anatomics of dead carkasses than of living men or women.

            <p>Our Wheat being sold, wee could have no fraight at the <hi>Canaries,</hi> the season was so farre past, and therefore with such gold and silver as we had (which was the Merchants) we weighed from the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and (by the favour of God) wee after all these dangers arrived safely at <hi>London</hi> in April last, 1636.</p>
            <p>To close up all, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Ellison</hi> had one of his men, named <hi>VVilliam Ling,</hi> who was a quarter Master. This <hi>Ling</hi> (with two men more) had the charge to ply two peeces of Ordnance in the <hi>Steerage. Ling</hi> having a Cabbin on the Decke over his head, had in his Cabbin some <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> gold and other good stuffe, which he had cramm'd into an old Boot. In the Steerage where <hi>Ling</hi> was, he did open a small Loope-hole, through which hee espyed a Turke that had broke open his Cabbin, and had made a booty of his Boot; which <hi>Ling</hi> perceiving, not well
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11728:11"/>
pleased with, put to a charged Musket, presenting it through the aforesaid Loop-hole he shot the Turk tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, who strait fell downe; and after the fight <hi>Ling</hi> found him dead with the golden lynde Boot in his hand, a good <hi>Semiter</hi> by him, a great silver sealed Ring on his finger, which finger was so swelled that hee was faine to cut it off to have the Ring; which having done, and pillaged the pillager naked, <hi>Ling</hi> gave him a cast of his office overboord, to feed Cods, Haddocks and Sharks.</p>
            <p>I have named Captaine <hi>Iohn VVeddell,</hi> and Master <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Nichols,</hi> and <hi>Master Malam,</hi> in this former relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which although two of them are dead, and the third onely remaining alive (I meane Captaine <hi>John VVeddell</hi>) and though their persons and worth were knowne to many, yet there are more that knew them not; for whose satisfaction I will give a memorable touch of their three severall noble and valiant Sea-fights, although some of them haue bin more at large related by mee many yeares agoe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Nichols</hi> was Master of the good ship cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Dolphin</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> of the Burthen of 240 tuns (or thereabouts) mann'd with 36 men and 2 boyes, 19 pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ordnance, and 9 murtherers, being laden at <hi>Zant,</hi> and bound homeward for <hi>England,</hi> was set upon by six great Turkish men of warre, with 1500 men in them at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11728:11"/>
least, and 140 odde Guns, and after a cruell and bloody fight (which continued the space of five houres) with three most terrible assaults, with the losse of eleven men and boyes who were killed, and five maymed and hurt, the ship was set on fire in the fight, which made the Pyrats forsake her (having their ships sorely torne and rent with the Dolphins Ordnance) three of their Captaines being fugitive or Renegade <hi>Englishmen;</hi> namely, Captaine <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> Captaine <hi>VValsingham,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Sampson;</hi> but lastly, it pleased God that by the mens industry the fire was quenched: This fight was fought the 12. of January, 1616. And when the ship was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, at a place called <hi>Callarie,</hi> she set saile home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and after all these dangers, arrived safe at <hi>London.</hi> The fame of which danger and deliverance came to the hearing of our Royall Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> who is now our gracious Soveraigne; hee to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and give applause to so worthy a designe, did come aboord of her, and viewed her hurts and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous breaches, where to the encouragement of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to imitate Master <hi>Nichols</hi> in resolution and noble valour, his Highnesse grac'd him to make him his servant, with the title of a Captaine.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Iohn VVeddell</hi> on the first of February being Sunday, 1624. was homewards bound for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11728:12"/>
               <hi>England</hi> from the East-Indies: and in the Gulph of <hi>Persia,</hi> hee being generall Commander of the Fleet, which consisted of foure good ships; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Royall <hi>Iames,</hi> Admirall; the <hi>Ionas,</hi> Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admirall; the <hi>Starre,</hi> Rere-admirall, and the <hi>Eagle;</hi> There was also (to associate the English) foure good Dutch ships, whose names were, The <hi>South Holland,</hi> Admirall; the <hi>Bantam,</hi> Vice-admirall; the <hi>Mawd</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> Rere-admirall, and the <hi>VVeasop,</hi> under the Command of an experienc'd brave Sea-man named <hi>Albert Becker.</hi> These two Commanders were set upon by eight great ships or Galliows of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugales,</hi> and 32 Friggots, which were under the Command of <hi>Rufrero</hi> (an inexorable and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemie to Captaine <hi>VVeddell.</hi>) These two Fleets met and fought on the day aforesaid with furious opposition, fighting three dayes without intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, at which time the Dutch Admirall <hi>Albert Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> was slaine, with 28 more that were killed in his ships, and the English lost much about the same number; but (as it was related by a <hi>French-man</hi> that was with the <hi>Portugals</hi> in the fight) the enemie had of his men slaine 481, besides many maymed and hurt; they having 232 peeces of Ordnance, and 2100 men, besides 32 Friggots, against the English and Dutch; yet were some of them sunke, many
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11728:12"/>
of them spoyld, and by the mercy and assistance of God, they were all foyld. So that after many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers past, Captaine <hi>VVeddell</hi> with ships and goods came richly welcome to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning Captaine <hi>Richard Malam,</hi> his fight was inferiour to none of the former, and his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was as remarkable as any: the story of it was never published, therefore I may erre in the time when, but I shall hit right upon the matter how it was; and (as I thinke it was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1621. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,) which if I faile, there are many yet living in <hi>Rederiffe</hi> and elsewhere to confute me.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Richard Malam</hi> being Commander in a small ship of <hi>London</hi> named the <hi>VVilliam</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> or <hi>VVilliam</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> having but eleven pceces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, was (neere the <hi>South Cape</hi>) set upon and fiercely fought withall by eleven Tukish men of Warre; the fight continued from the morning till the darknesse of the night made them come to a parley and truce till the next day-light, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that Captaine <hi>Malam,</hi> and one Master <hi>Hugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinson</hi> of <hi>Dover</hi> (who was Cape Merchant, and then in the fight) should come aboord of the Turkish Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall for pledges that <hi>Malams</hi> ship should not be stolne or slipp'd away in the night: In this hard exigent and condition they both went into a Boat
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11728:13"/>
which the Turke sent for them, for the ships were so torne in the fight, and many men slaine and hurt, that they were all willing to have a little ease till the morning. But as <hi>Malam</hi> and the Merchant went downe out of his ship into the Turkish Boat, he spake softly to his mate and some other of his men, that if they could they should convey the ship away in the night, whilest he was aboord of the enemie, and let him and the Merchant shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as they could.</p>
            <p>The Boat carried <hi>Malam</hi> and <hi>Hughkinson</hi> aboord the Turke where they were well entertained, and their wounds drest (for <hi>Malam</hi> had received a hurt, but I know not whether the other was hurt or not) but the Turke contrary to a Turkish nature did deale very affable with them, applauding their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, though they had done him much spoyle; but in the morning, when they thought to have set them aboord their ship againe to renue the fight, the Turkes perceived the ship was gone, in a rage commanded that <hi>Malam</hi> and the Merchant should be both hanged at the yard Armes of his ship.</p>
            <p>In this extremitie Captaine <hi>Malam</hi> told the Turke that his ship was so torne and rent with their Ordnance, that hee thought shee was sunke to the Seas bottome, and not conveyed away as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:11728:13"/>
hee suspected, all which the Turke would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, but commanded his men to make speed with the execution: Then <hi>Malam</hi> said to him, Sir, I have done you no wrong, but I have sustained a great losse by you; I have lost in the Sea my men, my ship, my goods, with a great deale that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to other men, and shall I now lose my life? If it must be so, I doe intreat you that wee may not dye thus ignominiously by the Halter; but let us be fastened to the mast, and be shot to death with muskets.</p>
            <p>The Turke presently condescended to his request; but as they were making ready for death, there was a small <hi>Scottish</hi> ship came sayling about a point of land in ken of them: The Turkes being greedy for prey, deferr'd the execution, and made towards the <hi>Scottishman,</hi> which being a small Vessell of little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance or defence, was presently at the Pyrats mercie, who did but halfe pillage her, and in a generous way did release both Captaine <hi>Malam</hi> and <hi>Hughkinson,</hi> putting them both into the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Ship, which Ship (being the <hi>Turkes</hi> prize) hee gave to <hi>Malam;</hi> but when shee brought him to <hi>London,</hi> hee gave her freely to the <hi>Scottishman</hi> againe: And thus was this fight and escape; and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11728:14"/>
for a further happinesse, after Captaine <hi>Malam</hi> had beene at home at <hi>Rederiffe</hi> some certaine dayes, his men brought the ship home, where shee arrived safe at <hi>London.</hi>
