            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thoſe Writings do greatly tend to revive the <hi>Life and
Spirit of Chriſtianity,</hi> which is acknowledg'd to
be ſo much decay'd and loſt amongſt all the Parties of

Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and the only way to

               </gap>nted; I ſhall
therefore in all Sincerity, without Reſpect of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or Perſons, write this <hi>Apology:</hi> And I do
earneſtly beg of Almighty God the <hi>Father and
Fountain of all Light and Love,</hi> that he may
be pleas'd ſo to illuminate my Mind with his <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Light,</hi> and warm my Heart with his <hi>Divine
Love,</hi> that I may utter nothing but what flows from
or tends to both; and that ſome Rays of both may
ſtream through this Writing, to touch the Hearts
and Spirits of others.</p>
            <p>III.<note place="margin">III. Writings not to be deſpiſed becauſe they and their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor are evil ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by all.</note> To diſpoſe Perſons to hearken to, and to
make a right uſe of an Apology of this Nature, it is
fit to premiſe two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it needs not prejudice any against <hi>A. B.</hi>
and her Writings, ſo far as not to liſten to an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for both, that they know ſhe is evil ſpoken of,
ſaid to be an <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> an <hi>Enchantreſs,</hi> a <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,</hi>
a <hi>Seducer,</hi> and the <hi>Devil of a Saint,</hi>
that her Writings are ſaid to be full of <hi>Hereſies,
Deluſions,</hi> and <hi>Errors;</hi> and that by Perſons of all
Parties, <hi>Papiſts, Proteſtants, Lutherans, Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
Presbyterians, Epiſcopal Perſons, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
Quakers,</hi> and even by the <hi>Preachers,</hi> and
<hi>Writers,</hi> and <hi>Learned Men</hi> of the reſpective Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
for there is nothing more ordinary than for the
moſt Innocent, and the moſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright, to be thus trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<hi>Woe to you when all Men ſhall ſpeak well
of you.</hi> This was the Treatment that Innocence
and Truth it ſelf met with, our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94808:4"/>
He was made to paſs for a <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> a <hi>Sorcerer,</hi>
a <hi>Perverter of the Law of God.</hi> The moſt Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the moſt Godly in his Age hated him. They
who in other things ſtood at the greateſt Distance,
did agree in this; <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Phariſees</hi>
and <hi>Sadducees,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans.</hi> So
that this may be rather a favourable Prejudice on her
behalf, at leaſt ſo far as to allow her a fair Hearing.</p>
            <p>IV.<note place="margin">IV. Not to read them with an evil Eye.</note> 2. I ſhall entreat you may not come to read
this <hi>Apology</hi> nor the <hi>Writings,</hi> to which it invites
you, with an <hi>evil Eye.</hi> They who come to conſider
Writings or Perſons with this Diſpoſition, are not
capable of underſtanding them aright themſelves, or
of giving a true Repreſentation of them to others.
I know no Perſon tho' never ſo innocent, nor Truth
tho' never ſo clear, nor Book tho writ with never ſo
much Plainneſs, Sincerity, and Conſistency, which
they who conſider with this Spirit may not miſtake,
expoſe, miſrepreſent, and ridicule. Nothing more
true than our Saviour's Words, nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
from daily Experience. <hi>The Light of the
Body is the Eye; if therefore thine Eye be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
thy whole Body ſhall be full of Light; but
if thine Eye be Evil, thy whole Body ſhall be
full of Darkneſs.</hi> It was from thoſe different Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
that our Lord himſelf, and his Doctrine,
met with ſuch different Entertainment in the World.
They who were full of Self-love and Eſteem, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
to love God and the World both, to pleaſe Him
and their App<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tites too, to get and keep that Rank
in the Eſteem of Men, which they thought they meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and hugg'd the Gloſſes and Sences they had put
<pb facs="tcp:94808:5"/>
upon God's Law, by which they had reconcil'd it with
the following of their own corrupt Inclinations; ſuch,
look'd on all that Jeſus ſaid aud did, with an evil
Eye; they never came to hear him but with a Deſign
to <hi>catch him in his Words,</hi> and they found out ways
to put a hard Sence upon every thing. The Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
he wrought, they ſaid, were done by the <hi>Power
of the Devil,</hi> they accus'd him of <hi>breaking the
Sabbath Day,</hi> and of countenancing it in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
of <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> in <hi>calling</hi> himſelf the Son
of God; of Pride, <hi>in</hi> ſpeaking well of himſelf;
of a Deſign to deſtroy the Law, and ſeduce the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by his Doctrine; and they made him an <hi>Enemy
to Caeſar,</hi> in calling himſelf <hi>a King.</hi> But the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and the ſingle-hearted who came with a pure and
upright Deſire and Intention to underſtand and to
follow the Truth, did readily embrace the Doctrine
of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>the entrance of his Words gave
them Light and Underſtanding;</hi> and they were ſo
fully ſatisfied of the great things of God's Law, that
they were not apt to wreſt or miſtake his Sayings or
Actions in things of leſſer moment, or where he
ſpoke more myſteriouſly, as well knowing that he had
the Words of Eternal Life. They who come then to
conſider theſe Writings with a ſingle Eye, with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Deſire to underſtand the Truth, and to do the

               </note> In writing this <hi>Apology</hi> we ſhall give, 1ſt. An
Abſtract of her Sentiments, and Character of her
Writings. 2d. Some of the moſt remarkable Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
raiſed againſt her, and her Anſwers to them.
<pb facs="tcp:94808:5"/>
3d. The Evidences ſhe gives of her being led by the
Spirit of God, with her Anſwers to the Prejudices
oppoſed thereunto: (moſt of the Prejudices of late rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
againſt her, being ſuch as were objected to her
in her own Life-time, I choſe to give her own Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which upon many Accounts I judge will be more
acceptable than what I might offer to ſay for her.)
4th. An Abstract of her Life: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which ſhall be
ſubjoined ſome of her Letters, which will both ſerve
farther to vindicate her from the Calumnies raiſed
againſt her, and may be of great uſe to theſe who do
ſincerely love the Truth, and deſire the Salvation of
their Souls. To all ſuch I hope this will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable,
there being nothing aim'd at but to make
us all lay to Heart this great Truth; <hi>Civitates duas

whoſe Sentiments they are; ſuch you know are ſure to ſet
them always in a falſe Light, ſo as to make them hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, from the Scribes and Phariſees, they
ſhall make him to ſpeak Blaſphemy, and to be in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
with the Devil. Now this is the unjuſt Meaſure
given by many to <hi>A. B.</hi> They take her Sentiments from
thoſe only who deſign to render them hateful and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
who, after the manner that they repreſent them,
may as eaſily expoſe the moſt Sacred Writings. It is juſt
then to hear her ſelf, and not to judge of her Sentiments
by ſome Expreſſions or Paſſages of her Writings, which
ſeparately may ſeem harſh, but to compare ſuch with the
whole Context, and with the main Scope and Subſtance
of all her Writings, and this will lead you to interpret
them aright. I do not deſire that you ſhould take her
Sentiments upon Truſt from me more than from others.
I aim only to ſet them in a True Light, in oppoſition to the
Falſe Repreſentations made of them: And as to my Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity

we are to walk by. Men in forming of their Syſtems are
ready to flatter Corrupt Nature. It is certain in our
practice we all do ſo, and we are well pleas'd with
Doctrines that may favour us in this. If then her Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be the ſame in Subſtance with the Doctrine of Jeſus
Chriſt, and do not at all tend to ſooth and flatter our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Nature, but on the contrary to lead us to mortifie

not in all things agree with the Syſtems of Men.</p>

Chriſt is the laſt Doctrine that is to come into the World,
and contains the neceſſary means of Salvation; and that
there is no other way to Salvation but what he has chalk'd
out to us, by his Life, Precepts, and Counſels. So that
all her Writings and Sentiments aim at nothing, but to
convince Men that they do not follow the Life and

This is a Summary of the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, as

Deduction and Application of theſe Principles to the

Parts of her Writings, ſometimes under fewer Heads, and
ſometimes under more, tho' as to their Subſtance they are
ſtill the ſame. And all her Writings have no other Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
but to awaken in Mens Hearts a Senſe of thoſe
Divine Truths, and to convince them how far they are
from them in their Practice. She aims at nothing but to
perſwade Men, that they cannot be ſaved without the Love
of God; that their corrupt Nature now leads them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to love themſelves and the Creatures, which is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with the Love of God; that they cannot return to
it without denying and mortifying this corrupt Nature,
which Jeſus Chriſt by his Merits and Interceſſion has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Grace for them to do; and this can be done only
by obeying his Goſpel-Law, and following his Example;
which no body truly does. This is the Subſtance of all her
Writings. Theſe Truths ſhe inculcates a hundred and a
hundred times. This is the conſtant Burthen of her Song.
Some other Sentiments which ſhe calls <hi>Acceſſory Truths,</hi>
ſhe mentions perhaps but three or four times in all her
Writings. And becauſe every Palate does not reliſh them,
ſhall therefore thoſe Books be deſpiſed and thrown away,
which do ſo lively repreſent the Eſſential Truths of the
Goſpel? Would we throw away a Box of Pearls, becauſe
ſome conceited Friend ſnatch'd at ſomething amongſt them,
and ſqueezing it hard at our Noſe, made it ſmell as Dung,
and then cry'd out, Fie! all is Filth, throw all away.
Sure, if theſe be the Great and Eſſential Truths of Religion,
they who love the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt more than Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
or Party, will greatly value and eſteem the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of which thoſe Truths are the Marrow, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

who dwell in Love dwell in God, and God in them; that
there is none Good but God; that the Sum of his Law is
to love him with all our Hearts, and our Neighbour as our

every one of us from our Iniquities; that unleſs we

his Steps; that by Nature we are the Children of Wrath;
that we cannot be his Diſciples unleſs we deny our ſelves,
take up our Croſs, and follow him; that if we be riſen with
Chriſt, we will ſet our Affections on thoſe things that are
above, and not on thoſe things that are beneath; that they
who are Chriſt's have crucified the Fleſh with the Affections

in his excellent Treatiſe, <hi>De Doctrina Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiana,
Lib.</hi> 1. makes a Summary, of the ſame Nature, Of
the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity. He conſidered all Beings
under Three diſtinct Ranks and Orders: Some which are
to be enioy'd, others which are to be uſed, and others in
the middle between theſe, and they formed to enjoy and
to uſe thoſe other Beings. The Things to be enjoy'd are
thoſe which make us happy. The Things to be uſed are
thoſe which help us to attain to that which makes us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and to cleave to it. We, who are to enjoy and uſe
thoſe things, being plac'd between both, if we give our
ſelves to Enjoy the things which we ſhould only uſe, we
are ſtopp'd in our Courſe, and come ſhort of our Happineſs,
being entangl'd with the Love of things below. To enjoy,
is by Love to cleave to ſomething for its ſelf. To uſe
a thing, is to employ it as a Mean to attain to that
which we love; as Strangers travelling to their Native
Country, make uſe of Horſes by Land, or Ships by Sea, to
bring them thither. That which is to be enjoy'd is only
God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, the Infinite
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94808:11"/>
and Unchangeable Good. We ought to love nothing
for it ſelf, but God; and all other things, only in and for
God. Other things are to be uſed or avoided, as they are
Helps or Hinderances of the Love of God. All who are
capable of Enjoying God, as we are, that is, all our
Neighbours, we ought to love them as our ſelves, that is,
to deſire or endeavour that they be brought with us to love
and enjoy God. All Sin and Evil conſiſts in the Loving
and Enjoying what we ought only to uſe, the Creatures
and their Perfections; and the Uſing what we ought to
Enjoy. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tendis frui, &amp; Fruendis uti:</hi> This has ſo dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and corrupted our Minds, that we are not capable of
loving and enjoying this infinite Good. In order to this,
they muſt be cleanſed and purified, which is as it were a
Travelling and Voyaging to our Country. This could
not have been, if Wiſdom it ſelf had not ſtoop'd to our
Infirmity, and cloath'd himſelf with our Fleſh, to obtain
Pardon and Grace for Sinners, and to give them an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in their own infirm Nature. And as, to convey our
Thoughts to others, we muſt cloath them with Words,
tho' thereby they are not defil'd nor chang'd; ſo the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and Unchangeable Word became Flesh, and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us; the Truth and the Life became the Way, and
brought us the wholſom Phyſick that is neceſſary to cure
the Maladies of our Souls, Remedies for every Diſeaſe.
The Sum of all is, that the Fulneſs and End of all the
Holy Scriptures is the Love of God and our Neighbours,
the Being that is to be enjoy'd, and thoſe Beings which
are capable of enjoying him with us. And that we might
know and be able to do this, the Providence of God has
order'd the whole Temporal Diſpenſation for our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

of God, and the Means and Graces</hi> which he gives them,
that they may riſe again and deliver themſelves from this
Damnation. Theſe are the <hi>Practice, of the Goſpel-Law,</hi>
which only can ſave them, becauſe of the Frailty of Man's
Nature. They will never ſave themſelves from Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
if they do not embrace the Goſpel-Law, which is
the laſt and moſt perfect of all the Laws that God has
given or ever will give to Men: And I do not pretend to
teach any other, neither do I teach Errors, as theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
of the Truth of God do affirm; for God will
never change, and Jeſus Chriſt brings it to us <hi>in the last
Hour.</hi> We muſt not look for any other, nor for New
Prophets; for he has propheſied all, and taught what
Men ought to do and avoid, even to the End of the

               <p>
                  <q>Tis true indeed, I ſpeak of ſeveral things in my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
which are not in ſo many Words in the Goſpel;
but theſe are not things which every one is obliged to
believe, or the belief of which is neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I write them out of abundance, and to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the Courage of thoſe who underſtand and reliſh
them: But they who do not reliſh or underſtand them,
may let them alone. Their belief or unbelief of theſe
things, neither adds nor takes any things from me. <hi>I
have obtain'd all my Deſign, when I have ſhewn clearly,
that no Body ſhall be ſaved but they who ſhall take up the
Practice of a Goſpel Life;</hi> as God has reveal'd to me,
leaving every one free to do it if he will, ſince God forces
no Body, neither do I. I have ſpoken ſeveral times in
my Writings, of the Creation of the World, of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94808:12"/>
Glorious Eſtate in which <hi>Adam</hi> was created, how Jeſus
Chriſt was born of him in his State of Innocence,
with many Divine Myſteries unheard of by Men. But
this is but a Cluſter of Grapes of the Garden of Eternal
Life, as thoſe ſent from the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> brought
a Cluſter of the Grapes of the Land of Promiſe, to make
them comprehend the Abundance, and the Fruitfulneſs
of it; even ſo I have ſpoken of thoſe high Secret Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which God has reveal'd to me, that I might give a
Sample of that which God has prepared for thoſe who
obſerve his Goſpel Law. But I do not poſitively teach
thoſe unknown Wonders as Articles of Faith. I declare
them only for to ſtrengthen my own Soul, and thoſe
who ſincerely deſire to become True Chriſtians, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them alſo many things which no body has taught
hitherto, becauſe the time was not come to know them,
ſince we read in the ancient Prophets, that God ſays to
<hi>Daniel, Seal up theſe Words until the laſt Times;</hi> and in
the <hi>Revelations</hi> there is ſpoken <hi>of a Book cloſed, ſealed
with Seven Seals, which none could open but the Lamb
ſlain.</hi> All theſe things with many others do ſufficiently
teſtifie that God would conceal from Men many Secret
and Divine Myſteries till the laſt Times; for God has done
nothing for Men, which he does not make known to
them before the World end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And if now I declare unto them things which they
have not as yet heard, they ought ſo much the more to
eſteem them, and enquire narrowly that they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
whether they be true or profitable for the Salvation
of Souls, and not reject or deſpiſe them blindly, as Fools
do, who condemn all that they do not underſtand,
uttering Reproaches againſt thoſe who ſpeak to them
for their Good. And if theſe Preachers did this out of
Ignorance, they would be in ſome manner excuſable,
but it muſt needs be out of pure Malice that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Eſſential Truths of the Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
which I teach ſubſtantially through all my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
bringing only all other things by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
or to make my ſelf be the better underſtood,
that People may by divers means recover the <hi>Love of
God,</hi> which all have loſt, and even alſo his Fear. And
that every one may find in my Writings, divers means
ſutable to their Diſpoſitions, I ſpeak much of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94808:13"/>
of God, of his Rods and Chaſtiſements which
we are to look for, that if ſome are touch'd with Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and diſpoſed to return to God by Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
they may embrace theſe Warnings of the laſt
Judgments: And if others are rather drawn unto God
by Promiſes, and the Glory that God has prepared for
them after Death; ſuch may meditate ſeriouſly upon
them, that by thoſe Conſiderations they may be inflam'd
with the Love of a God ſo bountiful to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
And if others are diſpos'd to return to God
by diſcovering the Falſhoods and Errors which are now
in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> I ſpeak of them abundantly in my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
So that nothing is wanting there for him who
truly deſires to ſearch, he has certainly the Occaſion
to find by the reading of my Writings, ſeeing there are
there means, in abundance, for all ſorts of Diſpoſitions.
But the whole <hi>Butt,</hi> or the White, at which I draw, in
declaring ſo many Marvels of God, is no other but to
ſhew Men that they will not be ſaved but by taking up
anew the Practiſe of a Goſpel Life, as the Chriſtians of
the Primitive Church did; for God is Yeſterday and to
Day the ſame; and Jeſus Chriſt, that Divine Phyſician,
has brought the laſt <hi>Receipt</hi> of his Goſpel-Law, which
we muſt take and ſwallow until the laſt Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if we deſire to be ſaved.</q>

of Jeſus Chriſt, as the only eſſential and neceſſary
means thereunto; and whatſoever elſe is contain'd in them,
is only to bring Men to the practice of thoſe great Duties,
they being differently mov'd according to their different
Diſpoſitions; and theſe things they may either embrace
or let alone, according as they find them helpful or not
to the Practiſe of the great Duties of the Goſpel; and
the Truth of this appears by the conſtant Tenour of all
her Writings.</p>
               <p>But ſome are apt to ſay, This is what is done by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others, by many of the Practical Writers of Chriſtianity,
and what needs ſo much adoe about the Writings of this
Woman? We ought not to deny to others their juſt
Praiſe, and I wiſh that not only many but all the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Writers of Chriſtianity did breath the ſame Spirit. But
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94808:13"/>
becauſe other Writings are good and uſeful, we ought not
therefore to deſpiſe theſe, if they be ſo too. In things
convenient for the Body, the Providence of God affords
not only what is ſimply neceſſary, but Plenty and Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
and what is diſtaſteful to one Palate, will reliſh
with another, and promote their Health. And why
ſhould our Eye be Evil, becauſe God is Good? If he be
pleas'd to afford us Plenty, and Variety of Spiritual Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
tending to mortifie our Corrupt Nature, and to
bring us to the Love of God, and ſome of it does not
pleaſe our Taſte, why ſhould we be ſo peeviſh and ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd,
as not only to throw all away that comes from that
hand, but decry it as rank Poiſon, and forbid any to touch
it as they would eſcape Damnation, when it may be all
the Evil lies in the Malady and Diſtemper within us,
which it comes to remove; and what we will not uſe
nor reliſh, may prove very ſavoury and healthful to the
Souls of others. It is ſtrange to ſee the Diſpoſition of
Men. The Poets and Plays, both Ancient and Modern,
tho' they flow from, and greatly tend to cheriſh the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Humane Nature, yet the Learned do Study
and Eſteem them; but Writings of this Nature, whoſe
only Aim is to perſwade Men to love the Life of Jeſus
Chriſt, in their reſpective Communions, without ſetting
up a New Sect or Party, and to tell them they do it not;
meets with nothing but Reproach and Contempt, upon
a Pretence there are in them ſome Sentiments different
from the ordinary, tho' they are moſt conſiſtent with the
Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and are declared not to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

laſt, tho' ſhe declares that ſhe had particular Diſcoveries
in them, ſeems to me a particular Character of her
Spirit. They who ſet up for a peculiar Knowledge in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things, or to reform the Corruptions of the Church,
or to be Guides and Directors of others, they preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
all their little Opinions and Doctrines into their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
of Faith, make them Articles of their Creed,
<hi>Shibboleths</hi> of their Party; ſo that none can be of their
Communion who do not profeſs to believe them; and
they are more zealous for their particular Forms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
than for the Goſpel and Laws of Jeſus Chriſt, and
are ready to eſteem or deſpiſe others according to their
Zeal or Coldneſs for theſe; and thus, tho' a Man be proud
and covetous and malicious, and his Spirit quite contrary
to that of Jeſus Chriſt, yet if he be zealous for their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Doctrines and Forms of ſuch a Party, he ſhall in
his own, and their Eſteem, paſs for a good Chriſtian;
they imagining that God lays as great a Streſs on
their Doctrines and Forms as they do themſelves, while
they call them the Cauſe of Chriſt, the Jewels of his

Relation to the Whole,</hi> and this is of no ſmall moment to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us aright in our Endeavours after a Chriſtian Life and
Spirit. We may know many of the Parts and Duties of
the Chriſtian Religion, and ſeem much Occupied about
ſome of them, and yet never make any Advances in a
Chriſtian Life; all that is directed by Wiſdom, is done for
a fit and proper <hi>End,</hi> and fit and ſeaſonable <hi>Means</hi> are
employed for attaining of that End. We ſee the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
of infinite Wiſdom even in the Motions of the
brute Creatures. The Birds in the Spring gather proper
Materials and build their Neſts, and lay their Eggs, and
hatch their Young; if they ſhould be taken up only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
gathering Sticks, without putting them to any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Uſe, the Wiſdom of their Maker in the Forming of
them would not thereby appear. Now God has given
Man an Underſtanding, whereby he may diſcern a proper
End for his Actions, and ſuitable Means by which to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
it. We ſee in all Trades and Arts they have
their proper Ends and their peculiar Means to attain to
them; and if the reſpective Maſters or Apprentices ſhould
be ſtill occupied about ſome of the remoter Means of their
Calling, without ever directing them to the Attainment of
the End of it, or ſhould think to attain the End without the
Uſe of the neceſſary and immediate Means, we would
think they had loſt their Wits. If they who pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build
an Houſe buſie themſelves only in providing ſome of
the Materials, and contriving Models, and reading Books of
Architecture and hearing Diſcourſes about it, and lay ſome
Stones of it upon an old runious Foundation, without ever
doing more, or if they think to get the Houſe built with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

abſurd and unreaſonable in other things, yet they are ſo in
Religion. They are taken up with ſome of the remoter
Duties of Religion, without ever aiming at the End of it,
or they think to attain the End without uſing the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Means for the Attainment of it, and become thereby ſo
darkned in their Minds, as not to perceive what Relation
the Parts and Duties of Religion have to one another.
This then is certainly a remarkable Property of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>A. B.</hi> that they give ſo diſtinct a view of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the ſeveral Parts and Duties of Chriſtianity to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94808:15"/>
one another, and to the whole: How ſome hold the Place
of the <hi>end,</hi> and others of the <hi>means;</hi> ſome of which are
ſo <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> in Man's preſent State, that without
them he cannot attain the End. They make appear that
the <hi>great end</hi> of Chriſtianity is to bring us back to the
<hi>Love of God,</hi> and that we can never recover this without
the <hi>mortifying</hi> of our <hi>Corrupt Nature,</hi> and that this cannot
be effected but by <hi>obeying the Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>following the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſo that his Commands are all the
neceſſary Helps of our Frailty, teaching us what way to
overcome our Corrupt Nature, and to return to the Love
of God. For <hi>the End of the Commandment is Charity:</hi> The
Goſpel-Law teaches Man <hi>Poverty of Spirit,</hi> to ſhew Man
that Covetouſneſs has withdrawn him from the Love of
God, and that he cannot recover it without ceaſing to covet
earthly Goods; and it teaches Men to be <hi>humble in Heart,</hi>
and to <hi>chooſe the loweſt Place;</hi> becauſe they have loſt the
Love of God, by loving themſelves, and thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
worthy of Honour and Glory, while they merit
nothing but Contempt and Confuſion. Jeſus Chriſt choſe
a poor and mean State in the World, lived in Hardſhips
and Uneaſe, in Reproach and Contempt, and never did
his own Will, but the Will of him that ſent him; to
ſhow us what are the things that withdraw us from the

Fall did not alter God's <hi>Love,</hi> but he reſolves to recover

taking his Delight with him; that he accepts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt for that End, and
allows Man Grace, and a Time, and Means of Penitence;
that the very Evils that came upon Man, and upon the
Creatures by his Sin, he order'd them all ſo, as that they
might tend to his Good and his Recovery; thruſt him
out of a delightful Paradiſe into an Earth curſed for his
ſake, and bringing forth Throns and Thiſtles; leaſt the
Pleaſures of the firſt ſhould now ſtill bewitch his Heart
the more, and that the Miſeries and Vexations of the laſt
might give him Occaſions for Penitence, and make him
return to his God; that God has not forſaken Man, but
Man has forſaken his God; that God by all his Works, and
by his Operations in Man, gives him all ſort of Occaſions to
love him: That he is not content to ſend us his Servants
and Prophets to enlighten us, but he came himſelf, and
became in all things like to us, (yet without Sin) that he
might redeem and ſave us: That God tempts no Man,
but every Man is drawn away of his own Luſt: That he
damns no Man, for he is the Fountain of all Good and
can do no Evil; and the Damnation of a Soul is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Evil in the World: That he does not permit Sin,
but permits Man to make uſe of his Free-will, which
being the greateſt Treaſure he could receive, it was not
juſt for God to take it back again, and if Man abuſe it,
it is for himſelf, ſo he may do with his Hands and
Tongue, which are given him for excellent uſes: That
as God is not the Author of any Sin, any Moral Evil, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Influence, nor by Decree, nor by Permiſſion; but
it proceeds wholly from Men and Devils by the ill uſe
of the Liberty and Free-will that God gave them; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is he the Author of any Natural Evil or Malignity
that is in the Creatures, he having created all Good and
Perfect; but Sin and the Self will of Man has brought a
Malignity into all things; and therefore it belongs to Man
as being the Works of his Hands: That God lets this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
continue now in this Time of Trial, to withdraw
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94808:16"/>
Man from the Love of the Creatures; that at the Times
of the Reſtitution of all things, he will deliver all his
Creatures from the Malignity contracted by the Sin of
Man; and ſince it is juſt to render to each one what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to him, it is neceſſary that they, who will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to a Dependance upon their God, have for their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this Malignity of all the Creatures to all Eternity,
as being the Work of their own Hands: That in the Love

Eſſence, from whom every thing is what it is, in ſo far
as it is; for in ſo far as it is, what it is, it is good; and
therefore Death is not from God. For God did not make
Death, neither does he take Pleaſure in the Deſtruction
of the Living; for the ſupream Eſſence makes every
thing to be what it is, and therefore it is called the
Eſſence. But Death conſtrains that which dies not to be,
in ſo far as it dies; for if theſe things which die, ſhould
die altogether, undoubtedly they would come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
But by how much leſs they partake of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
by ſo much they die.—Now a Body is leſs
than any Degree of Life; for whatſoever retains any
Form, has ſome Degree of Life. The Body therefore is
ſubject to Death, and ſo approaches nearer to nothing;
wherefore that Life, which delighting it ſelf in the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the Body, neglects God, inclines to nothing;
and this is Wickedneſs.—For it loves that which is
leſs than Life, becauſe it is Body; and becauſe of this
very Sin, that which is lov'd becomes Corruptible, that
it by paſſing away may forſake its Lover; becauſe he by
loving it had forſaken his God.—But that the Body of
Man, which, before Sin, was the moſt excellent in its
kind, is after Sin become ſo frail and ſubject to Death;
tho' it be a juſt Puniſhment of Sin, yet it diſcovers more
of the Clemency, than the Severity of God: For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are perſwaded, that we ought to take off our
Love from the Pleaſures of the Body, and to turn it to
the Eternal Eſſence of Truth: And herein the Beauty
of Righteouſneſs, and the Favour of Good meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

outward Religions, of their Ceremonies and Opinions,
will neither ſave nor damn; that they are not inſeparable
from the Eſſence of Chriſtianity, which conſiſts in the
denying of our ſelves, the mortifying of our corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the following of Jeſus Chriſt; without which we
cannot be ſaved; that thoſe other things are like the Cloaths
and Garments, which do not give Life, but an outward
Decency and Conveniency; That the one is the Sword and
theſe other things are the Sheath; and that the Madneſs and
Folly of the Chriſtian World lies in Contending which of
us has the beſt Sheath, while the Devil robs us of the Sword,
(the true Love of God and our Neighbour) and laughs at
us when we think to overcome him with the Sheath of our

And ſo little Regard had ſhe to the Intereſt of a Party,
that when <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> came to be directed by

Sun, we enjoy his Light and his Heat; he gives us Delight

about theſe; this is but an empty, dead, ſuperficial and
barren Knowledge; the Idea's are true, but they do not
give us Light, and Heat, and Delight, and a View of the
Beauty of all the Creatures as the Sun himſelf did. And
if we had been born blind, and knew nothing of the Light

Things, as well as in Bodily and Material ones. There is
a ſolid, ſubſtantial, living, and fruitful Knowledge of them;
when God communicates himſelf to the Soul, and brings
along with him his Love, and Light, and Joy, and Peace.
Theſe are all felt by it, as we feel the Light when it ſhines

pure and peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be entreated, full

which is only ſuperficial and ſpeculative, and conſiſts in the
forming to our ſelves the Pictures of Divine Things in
the Abſence of the Things themſelves, and employing our
Thoughts and Faculties about theſe. If we do this only
in ſo far as it may be helpful to excite us to the other,
and to labour after thoſe Diſpoſitions that may make us
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94808:20"/>
meet for it; it may be a good Handmaid and Subſervient to
it. But if we make it our Study, and employ our Time and
Faculties about it, we do as fooliſhly as they who being hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
and thirſty, and depriv'd of the Light of the Sun, ſhould
with the dim Light of a Candle go into a Gallery and view
the Pictures of the Light and Sun, and of all ſorts of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Wines and Meats, and ſhould draw a great many of
theſe themſelves, each Club contending that their Pictures
were the trueſt, quarrelling and fighting about them, and
and forcing one another to aſſent and ſwear to their Belief
and Opinion of them, and hating ſuch as differed from
them, and were ſo craz'd in their Imaginations as to fanſie
they did eat, and drink, and enjoy the Light, but when
<hi>they awake their Soul is empty.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſ. 29. 3.</note> This is that Theology
which has overſpread the Chriſtian World; for the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating

The very Catechiſms fill'd with the nice Speculations
of the reſpective Parties, and the People to con their hard

In this, thouſands of Volumes are written, and the
Opinions and Pictures drawn by former Ages enquir'd into
and curious Criticiſms made about every Line, in the Study
of which, Divines employ their Time and Talents. In
this the Preachers multiply Sermons, giving Stones for
Bread, and the People have itching Ears, <hi>Ever learning,

Phyſicians and Patients that ſhould love to talk and hear
reſpectively elaborate Diſcourſes about Receipts of Phyſick
(the Receipts being plain enough of themſelves) without

to hate and malign thoſe that differ from them,
to raiſe Tumults and Rabbles, to animate Princes againſt
their People, and People againſt their Princes, and to fill
the World with Blood and Confuſion. Now all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>A. B.</hi> tend to lead Men to that Theology and Divine
Wiſdom that is to be had only by deep Humilty of Heart,
and Poverty of Spirit, to be learn'd only in the School of
Jeſus Chriſt, by denying of themſelves, and following of
him, and to take them of from that falſe and ſuperficial
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94808:20"/>
Knowledge of Divine Things, which ſtands in a perfect
Oppoſition to the other. It makes the Mind incapable of
being enlightned by the Spirit of God, it keeps it in a
conſtant Amuſement; it is that Knowledge that puffs up,
and makes us think <hi>we know ſomething,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 8. 2, 3. Jam. 3. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>when we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

the ſame is known of him. It is the Wiſdom that deſcends
not above, but is earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh;</hi> working
Envy, Strife and Confuſion, and every evil Work. It is of
this,<note place="margin">Iſ. 29. 14.</note> that God threatned he would <hi>deſtroy the Wiſdom of

of Heaven; to make him underſtand that his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Wiſdom was a Hinderance to it, that he muſt
turn away from it to embrace the Simplicity of a Child.
What he ſays to him, he ſays to all the Learned that ſhall
ever be in the World. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was already turned from
Evil to Good when he offered to be his Diſciple; but
this was not enough. Jeſus Chriſt declares to him, that
notwithſtanding of this, he ſhall not enter there, unleſs
he become as a little Child, learning the Simplicity of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

Extract of one Chapter where Jeſus Chriſt thus ſpeaks to
the Soul; <q>Son, let not the fine and ſubtile Sayings of
Men move thee; for the Kingdom of God is not in
Word, but in Power. Take heed to my Words, which
do enflame the Heart and enlighten the Mind, which
bring Compunction and procure various conſolations.
Never read my Word for this End, That thou may be
eſteem'd the more learned, or the more wiſe; but ſtudy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94808:21"/>
the Mortification of thy Vices, for that will profit thee
more than many hard Queſtions. When thou haſt read
and known much, thou muſt ſtill return to one Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
I am he who teaches Man Knowledge, and gives
to Little Ones a more clear Underſtanding than what he
can be taught by Man. He to whom I ſpeak will ſoon
be Wiſe, and will profit much in Spirit. Wo to them
that enquire many curious things from Men, and care
little how to ſerve me.—I am he who elevates the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mind in a Moment, that it may conceive more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the Eternal Truth, than if one ſtudied for Ten
Years in the Schools. I teach without the Noiſe of
Words, without the Confuſion of Opinions, without
the Vanity of Honour, without the Debate of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
I am he who teaches to deſpiſe earthly things,
to loath preſent things, to ſeek and reliſh eternal things,
to flee Honours, to ſuffer Reproaches, to place all their
Hope in me, to deſire nothing beſides me, and to love
me ardently above all things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>For a certain Perſon, by loving me dearly, did learn
Divine Things, and ſpoke wonderful Things: he profited
more by forſaking all, than by ſtudying difficult things.
But to ſome I utter common things, to ſome ſpecial ones;
to ſome I appear ſweetly in Signs and Figures, but to
others I reveal Myſteries in much Light. There is one
Voice of Books, but it does not equally inſtruct all; for
I am the Teacher of the Truth inwardly, the Searcher
of the Heart, the Underſtander of the Thoughts, the
Furtherer of Actions, diſtributing to every one as I ſhall
judge worthy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Writings whoſe chief Tendency is to lead us to
ſo excellent a Maſter, to learn in Chriſt's School, and teach
us how to labour for the Diſpoſitions which he himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of us, deſerve to meet with ſome Regard by thoſe
who pretend to be his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>XXIII.<note place="margin">XXIII. 8. The Plainneſs and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of them.</note> 8. Another remarkable Quality of thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
is, that they are ſo <hi>clear, and plain, and ſimple.</hi> The
Thoughts of the Studious and of the Learned are out of
the common Road of the People, and ſo are their Words
and Language too; and when they write, they can hardly
avoid the Terms of the Schools; and all affect a certain
Eloquence that darkens the Thoughts which we would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
both becauſe we have not clear Perceptions of thoſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94808:21"/>
Truths, and we ſtill ſeek our ſelves; and many who have
pretended to Divine Inſpiration, have written ſo Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,
and under ſuch dark Figures, that they cannot be
eaſily comprehended. But thoſe Writings are ſo clear, that
we may eaſily and diſtinctly perceive the Intent of them, ſo
plain that Children and the moſt illiterate People may
eaſily underſtand them, and ſo ſimple that there is nothing
of humane Art or Varniſh to be ſeen in them.</p>
                  <p>XXIV.<note place="margin">XXIV. 9. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Force of them.</note> 9. It is no leſs remarkable, that there is <hi>a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Force and Efficacy in thoſe Writings which does ſenſibly
touch the Hearts of thoſe that read them;</hi> their Conſciences
bears them witneſs of the Truth of things as to themſelves,
and they are convinced of all; not that all are ſo who
read any of them,<note place="margin">Recueil des Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> no more than all who heard Jeſus Chriſt
himſelf were affected with his Words, tho' he ſpoke as
one that had Authority, and not as the Scribes, tho' never
Man ſpoke like him, yet the Phariſees ſaid he had a Devil,
but others who heard him, felt that he had the Words of
Eternal Life. So ſome call this Virgin a Devil and Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
a mad, whimſical Woman. Others are ſo convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the Truths of the Goſpel contained in her Writings,
that they are ready to anſwer, ſhe is not mad,—but
ſpeaks the Words of Truth and Soberneſs. Many, I know,
can bear me Witneſs, that upon the reading of her Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
they have felt a deeper Senſe of Divine things, and
their Hearts and Conſciences have been more touched than
by moſt of other Writings which they have ſeen. And
this can be teſtified by Perſons of different Parties and
Perſwaſions, by Learned and Unlearned, and it deſerves
the more Conſideration that they are not written in a
Way to move the Paſſions in Flights of Devotion, as ſome
would have them paſs for, but in a ſimple naked Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Divine Truths. All Writings carry along with
them certain Impreſſions of the Spirit with which they are
written, which we are apt to diſcern, and accordingly to
be affected by them. If Self be the chief Mover, it will
be ſeen thro all the Diſguiſes of the Writer. There's a
certain Drineſs and Deadneſs in moſt of Writings and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
now adays about Divine Things, that they do not at
all touch the Heart; and even the beſt of them ſavour
more of the Head of than the Heart, of the Spirit of Man
than of the Spirit of God, and ſo they cannot riſe higher
than their Original; they may ſtrike and pleaſe our Fancy,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94808:22"/>
but they cannot move the Divine Faculties of the Soul.
I cannot give a better Account of this than <hi>A. B.</hi> does
when ſhe complains that tho' there was never more
Preaching than in this Age, yet never a greater ſpiritual
Famine; that they do not give Nouriſhment to Souls,
which every Day wax leaner and leaner in Vertue, and
colder in Charity.<note place="margin">Nouv. ciel. p. 166.—170.</note> She ſays, <q>The Word of the Preachers
cannot be God's Word, for then certainly it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
its Effects in well-diſpoſed Souls; for the Word of
God is powerful. It would poſſeſs the inſeparable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of God, Righteouſneſs, and Goodneſs, and Truth;
If one of theſe be wanting, it is not the Word of God.
they may uſe the Terms and Expreſſions which Jeſus
Chriſt and his Apoſtles uſed, yet that is not the Word of
God. They are not called by God, but carried to the
Miniſtry by Ambition, or ſome worldly and human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
Their Sermons are nothing elſe but Apiſh
Mummeries. If an Ape ſaw an excellent Painter drawing
a curious Picture, and if in his Abſence it ſhould take
the Pencils and Colours, and ſo ſcratch upon the ſame
Table, it would entirely Daub all, tho' it made Uſe of
the ſame Pencils and Colours, becauſe it wanted the
Painter's Spirit; this Defect marrs all, even what was
beautiful there before the Ape touch'd it. This is the true
Emblem of moſt of the Preachers and Writers now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
in Religion. They have the Scripture as the Pallet,
wherein are diſtinguiſh'd the fine Colours of Vertues
with which Jeſus Chriſt began the excellent Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Holy Church. They have alſo the Pencil
which is the Word with which Jeſus Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
laid on theſe fine Colours of Vertues in Souls;
but they want as (that Ape) the Spirit of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Maſter, which is Jeſus Chriſt. They have on
Paper the ſame Words which the Holy Spirit dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but they have not the ſame Holy Spirit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them in Practice to their own Souls, and far leſs
to the Souls of their Hearers.</q>

Repreſentations of the Truths of Chriſtianity</hi> as tend to take
us off from Self, and from the Creatures, and to make us
turn unto, and depend wholly upon God, ſuch as does not
favour us in the leaſt Sin, and yet encourages the greateſt
Sinner to turn to God; ſuch as leads us to aſcribe nothing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94808:23"/>
to our ſelves but Evil, and nothing to God but Good:
Such as lets us ſee that nothing can excuſe us from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Commands of the Goſpel, and following the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Renouv. de l' Eſpr. Evang. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

It is true of Doctrines as well as Men; By their
Fruits ye ſhall know them: Such Doctrines as tend to
ſooth Mens Corrupt Inclinations, to teach them how to
love God and the World too; to gratifie their Appetites
here, and yet hope to enjoy God hereafter, (I do not
mean in ſo many expreſs Words, but in their natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency)
ſuch certainly are not of God. Now the Doctrines
contained in thoſe Writings have quite another Tendency,
as has been ſaid. There we have ſuch true and lively Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
of God, as ſhews us that he is altogether Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
of his Deſign in creating Man only to be enjoy'd and
lov'd by him, without any decree or purpoſe of damning
the greateſt part of Mankind, as may ſtir us up to comply
with ſo tender a Love, with ſo generous a Deſign; of the
horrid Degeneracy and Corruption of Man now both in Soul
and Body, as may make us abhor our ſelves; of our Sins
their being purely our own deed, without any the leaſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination
or Concurrence of God, but the contrary, as
may keep us from excuſing our ſelves or laying the blame
on God; of the Merits, Satisfaction, and Interceſſion of
Jeſus Chriſt, as may convince us that Pardon and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with God, and Grace and Means to return to God
is to be obtain'd, and that only by him; of the Neceſſity
and Nature of the preventing, concurring, and renewing
Grace of God, as may make us continually ſeek to him
for it, and yield up our ſelves to be guided by it; of the
Nature and Corruption of our Will, as ſhews the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
neceſſity of denying, it and yielding it up to God; of
the Doctrine and Example of Jeſus Chriſt as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us that our Corrupt Nature cannot be overcome,
and we cannot return to the Love of God without obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Precepts, and following his Example. Now Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of ſuch a Tendency ought not to be deſpis'd and
ridicul'd by the Profeſſors and Preachers of the Religion
of Jeſus Chriſt; and that they have this Tendency, I appeal
to any who have read any of them without an Evil Eye.</p>
                  <p>XXVI.<note place="margin">XXVI. 11. The Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of Holy Scripture.</note> 11. Thoſe Writings do contain alſo many
<hi>Divine Explications of the Holy Scripture,</hi> not after the
way of criticizing and reckoning up the ſeveral meanings
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94808:24"/>
and acceptions of a Word, or the various Sences of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
which a Man may be well vers'd in, and yet be
altogether ignorant of the true ſence and meaning of the
Holy Scripture where he pretends to Interpret it.<note place="margin">Renouv. de L'Eſpr. Ev. p. 1.</note> We ſee
all Sciences have a certain Light by which they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
a certain Diſpoſition of Faculties which makes us
capable to underſtand them, certain Principles which lead
to the Knowledge of them, and when theſe are wanting,
we grope in the Dark. Children and Boys may underſtand
all the Words of a Book of Philoſophy, of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in <hi>Euclid,</hi> and yet underſtand nothing of the
Truths contain'd there. To underſtand the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and the things of God, we had need to be endued with
the ſame Spirit, and to be in the ſame Diſpoſition with
thoſe who wrote them. Now if any will be pleas'd to
compare the Expoſitions given in thoſe Writings of ſome
places of Holy Scripture, with the learned Comments of
the Interpreters and Criticks of the Age, I am perſwaded
that if they be not greatly prejudic'd, they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
that her Expoſitions come from a more Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
than than the moſt of the other; that they give a clearer
Light, more worthy of God, and more ſuitable to the
great Ends of Religion; that in this the Truth of our
Saviour's words is manifeſt, that God hides theſe things
from the Wiſe and Prudent, and reveals them unto Babes;
and that with great reaſon ſhe bleſt God who preſerv'd
her from drinking in Humane Learning. Of all theſe,
I ſhall inſtance one which deſerves a particular Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that is her Expoſition of the 24th. Chapter of
St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſet down in the Firſt Part of <hi>La Lumiere
nee on Tenebres.</hi> It is too long to offer to tranſcribe it
here; they who are deſirous to ſee it, need not want
Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>To this I cannot but ſubjoin the juſt <hi>Cautions</hi> ſhe gives,<note place="margin">Her Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Rules, for interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note>
and the excellent <hi>Rules for the Interpreting of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
She makes appear how raſh Men are in gloſſing
the Holy Scriptures, ſince the things which concern our
Salvation are ſo plainly ſet down in them, that they need
no Gloſſes; and the obſcure things cannot be underſtood,
but by the ſame Spirit who endited them,<note place="margin">La Dern. miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de de Dieu avant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop.</note> and not by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Wiſdom, which is directly oppoſite to the Wiſdom
of the Holy Spirit which deſcends only into humble Souls.
That they who will needs interpret the Scriptures by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94808:24"/>
Humane Wiſdom,<note place="margin">n. 135, 136, 139, 140, 146, 147, 148.</note> fall into great Miſtakes; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Terms quite othewiſe than the Spirit of God
intended. Thus it is ſaid, <hi>that God hardened</hi> Pharaoh's
<hi>Heart;</hi> the meaning cannot be, that he hardens Mens
Hearts, by making them obſtinate in Evil; for God can
never co-operate to any Evil, being the Fountain of all
Good. But he ſpeaks thus to make us know that he leaves
a wicked Man to go on in his Wickedneſs when he will
not be reſtrain'd. But on his part, he uſes always Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
towards them, that he may convert them, both by
good Inſpirations, Admonitions, and other proper Means.
But when their Free-wills are willful to perſiſt in Evil, he
leaves them to themſelves. The main Difficulty there is
in underſtanding of the Scriptures ariſes from this, that
we do not know the Qualities of God, and we are ready
to attribute to him ſuch as Men have, imagining that he
has a Love for ſome, and a Hatred for others. And thus
every one is wedded to his own Sence and Opinions, and
will maintain them as the Truths of God. But the beſt
Courſe is ſtill to take the Holy Scriptures in that Sence that
draws us more and more to the Love of God, and to the
Knowledge of our own Nothingneſs, and to leave all theſe
things which ſeem diſputable to the Wiſdom of God,
reckoning our ſelves unworthy to be able to comprehend
what he is, how he does his Works, and by what means
he ſaves Men; relying on the Faith that ſhews us, that he
does all things in Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, and Truth,
without amuſing our ſelves with any other thing but to
put in practice the things which he has openly declar'd to us
by his Goſpel, which are neceſſary for our Salvation; ſuch
as Humility of Heart, Self-denial, the Love of God, and
the Love of our Neighbour. It is better to exerciſe our
ſelves in theſe ſolid Doctrines, than to break our Heads
in diſputing and deſiring to comprehend what is in God;
or how he governs Men:<note place="margin">Eodem certe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda &amp; intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da S. Scriptura quo tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta eſt. <hi>Th. a Kemp.</hi>
                     </note> Better let our ſelves be govern'd
by him as little Children, than to be inform'd how he will
govern us. It is to this, ſays he, that I exhort all the
World, knowing well that all the reſt is nothing but Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Amuſement of Spirit: For all the Learning and
Curioſities of all the Men in the World cannot ſave us; on
the contrary, their Doctrines, Learning, and Sentiments,
do rather withdraw us from God and our Salvation. They
either furniſh us with means of Self-preſumption, or they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94808:25"/>
ſlacken our Care to work out our Salvation. Thoſe words
of Scripture which ſeem to ſay that God reprobates or
damns Men, cannot be underſtood but by the Signification
of them, which cannot be known but by the Light of
Faith; for if we take theſe words according to our Senſe,
we ſhould ſpeak Evil of God, and believe that he is Furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or Evil; which cannot be, for he is all Goodneſs, all
Peace and Tranquility, and therefore he who would not
utter Slanders againſt God, ought not to ſtick to the
Terms of the Scripture, but in ſo far as they lead us to
love and adore God, or to the knowledge of our own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs,
and Charity to our Neighbour;<note place="margin">Micah 6. 8. Matt. 22. 37, 40.</note> for God has
neither ſaid nor taught to us but the things which tend to
theſe Truths. Thus when we believe that all Grace and
Salvation comes immediately from God, (as it is true)
becauſe we are Nothings; then we honour God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his Almighty Power, in making ſo great things
by his Grace of nothing; and we muſt needs love him
alſo by this Conſideration, and beg that he will continue
and encreaſe this Grace; and when we believe that God is
ſo Gracious towards us,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 27, 28.</note> that as ſoon as a ſinner ſhall repent
and turn unto him, he will have Mercy on him; this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforces
our Love to him, in conſideration of the Love he
bears us, ſo mercifully to Pardon us. In theſe two Senſes,
we may hold different Opinions about Grace, and believe
that it comes entirely from God, and believe alſo that Men
may have it when they will, ſince God never rejects a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Sinner. But whether we hold the one or the other of
theſe in terms which do not tend to humble us and to
acknowledge the Greatneſs of God, that we may love and
adore him, it is an evil thing, and it is a great raſhneſs
for Man to interpret and corrupt the Scriptures by Terms
which authorize a Remiſſneſs in Vertue. For they who
will Gloſs on the Scripture Words, might ſay, that God
ſpoke not truly when he ſaid to <hi>Jonas, yet Forty Days and</hi>
Ninevah <hi>ſhall be deſtroyed;</hi> for the thing did not fall out
according to the Terms, which were not conditional, but
abſolute. Yet notwithſtanding we ought not to ſurprize
God in his Words, or in the Scripture Terms; but we
ought to draw profit to our Souls from them, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to his Deſigns, who ſpeaks only for our Profit. He
ſays abſolutely that <hi>Ninevah</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, becauſe
the Inhabitants merited this Sentence; the Juſtice of God
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94808:25"/>
condemn'd their Injuſtice, but how ſoon they repented
and embraced Penitence, his Goodneſs and Mercy did alſo
pardon them. We muſt not therefore ſay that God did
not ſpeak truly, but that he judg'd them juſtly, and that
he afterwards mercifully pardon'd them; without being
nice, or grumbling about the Form of his Words or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
which are deſign'd only to make us groſly
to underſtand the things according to our Capacity and
Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are certainly moſt excellent Cautions as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding

Acceſſories of Religion, ſo plainly deſcribe the firſt, that
all cannot but be convinc'd of them; and they ſhew that
the laſt ought not to be any Subject of Debate and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:
They make appear, that the Doctrine of Jeſus
Chriſt is to be learn'd by Simplicity and humble Prayer,
and not by Controverſie and Debate, and that none are
more capable of underſtanding it than they who are led
by the Spirit; they ſhew that there is nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

Spirit of Controverſie: That they who are led by it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure that others ſhould differ from them in ſome

Eſſentials and Fundamentals of it) but preſently they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute

they can to inſpire the ſame Spite and Averſion againſt

them hateful Names, accuſe them of Crimes they were
never guilty of, Blaſphemy, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they treat
them with Contempt and Scorn, make them paſs for mad

or the <hi>Effects of a warm Imagination;</hi> and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
when they meet with any thing that can expoſe
them or make them hateful; they cannot eaſily believe
any thing that is Good in them, but very readily Evil; they
do not conſider the great Tendency of their Life and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
but cull out ſome Inſtances and Paſſages of both

the hardeſt Sence they are capable of, and from theſe draw
Conſequences and form odious Pictures of them; from
them they can endure no hard Words without Rage and

In a Word, this Spirit is the compleat Reverſe of that

were compoſed is ſomething <hi>ſingular and extraordinary.</hi> It
cannot be denied but that they are writ with much Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Solidity and Force in all the things that may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the Salvation of Man; yet they are not the Effect
of Study and the reading of other Books; for ſhe read
none, and did not derive her Knowledge either from
learned Men or Books; reckoning their Learning a Stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the right Way; and that as the Writing-Maſter
would needs have a Double hire, from thoſe who had
learn'd to write an ill Hand, to wit, one hire for unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them ſo ill a Habit, and another to teach them to
write well, becauſe he muſt be at more Pains with ſuch,
than with thoſe who had learn'd none at all; ſo ſhe was
with the Learned who came to learn from her in
Chriſt's School, ſhe had a double Labour, one to unteach
them the imaginary Wiſdom which they had embraced,
join'd with Preſumption and Raſhneſs; and the other to
make them receive the true Doctrine of the Holy Spirit,
Humility, and the Lowneſs and Simplicity of a Child.
And as her Writings were not the Reſult of Study and
human Learning; ſo neither were they the Effect of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
and human Reaſoning. We muſt think before
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94808:27"/>
we write, and take Time to order our Thoughts and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Words; we muſt blot out, and mend, and add to
our firſt Draughts. But when ſhe put Pen to Paper ſhe
wrote as faſt as her Hand could guide the Pen, and what
was once written, was witten without blotting out or
Change. And when ſhe returned to any Writings that ſhe
had laid by unfiniſh'd, tho' for ſome Months or Years, ſhe
did not apply her ſelf to read them over, but having read
only five or ſix of the laſt Lines to ſee how the Period en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
ſhe immediately wrote on with her former Swiftneſs,
her Sentiments flowing from her as Water does from a
Fountain. She needed not, it ſeems, the Buckets of Study
and Meditation, wherewith to draw out of the broken
Ciſterns of others; but ſhe had within her a Fountain of
living Water, ſtill ſpringing up to everlaſting Life. As this
is atteſted by thoſe who were of her particular Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and all her Manuſcripts are ſtill extant, written
with her own Hand; ſo a particular Account is given
given of this by Mr. <hi>Francken,</hi> Merchant at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in
his Teſtimony concerning her,<note n="*" place="margin">Recueil. des Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moign. p. 84, 85, &amp;c.</note> where, among other
things, he tells, That a learned Man of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> a

believe but it was ſome learned Man who had writ theſe
Letters, and publiſh'd them under the Name of <hi>A. B.</hi> as
not being willing to be known; and Mr. <hi>Francken</hi> aſſur'd
him of the contrary; but however he not having had
long time to converſe with her, he would take care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himſelf more narrowly, ſo as to be able to convince
him, as it fell out; for ſome time ſince, after he had
told him, he had often found her in her little Chamber
with a Piece of Deal Board on her Knees, writing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other Thing but the Paper on which ſhe wrote,
and the Pen and Ink which ſhe made uſe of, and ſhe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
off to write, upon her Diſcovering that he was in the
Room (and becauſe ſhe never wrote but with Attention to
the Voice of God in the inward Silence and Recollection
of her Spirit) he would take up the Paper, with her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
to read it, and found it was writ ſo ſwiftly, that
there would be yet ten or twelve Lines freſh and wet.
Having made this Trial of it, his Friend, he ſays, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
of it as much as if he had ſeen it himſelf, having

Familiarity.</p>

been given of her Life and Spirit by thoſe who were Eye-witneſſes
of all; like Spiders ſucking Poiſon from the
Flowers where the Bees gather Honey, they exaggerate
ſome of their Expreſſions far beyond the Intent of them;
and in Oppoſition to the Teſtimonies of thoſe who were

                     </gap> will
conceive better Thoughts of her than what the New Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
would give of them. They will ſee that ſhe liv'd
conſtantly as one travelling towards Eternity, and therein
ſtudying in all things to conform her Life to that of Jeſus
Chriſt in theſe and ſuch-like Inſtances: She convers'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with God, and no more with Men than her Duty and
Charity requir'd; ſhe led a Life of continual Penitence,
mortifying her corrupt Nature, and never gratifying her
ſenſual Appetites in any thing: Tho' ſhe might have enjoy'd
the Pleaſures of her Senſes, the Delights of her Taſte and
of her other Senſes, yet ſhe voluntarily depriv'd herſelf of
them to pleaſe God: Tho' ſhe had lawfully acquir'd
Riches, yet would never uſe them but for pure Neceſſity:
Tho' ſhe might have been conveniently ſerv'd and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
according to her Condition, yet ſhe deſpis'd theſe
Honours and Services to imitate Jeſus Chriſt, loving rather
to live unknown and ſerve herſelf than to be ſerv'd. There
was nothing obſerv'd in her Actions contrary to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
Goodneſs, and Truth of God, but they appear'd
ſtill to be accompanied with thoſe three Qualities deriv'd
from the Spirit of God. She never recommended to any
the Practice of a Vertue which ſhe did not moſt exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
practice herſelf. She was moſt humble and ſelf-denied,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94808:28"/>
always ready to ſerve others rather than be ſerv'd by them,
and to take to her ſelf the meaneſt and the leaſt of every
thing. She did not affect to be thought humble, by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Words, Geſtures, Habits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor did ſhe diſtinguiſh
her ſelf from the reſt of the World by any ſingular indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Thing; but as to Habit, Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conform'd her
ſelf to the Cuſtoms of the Places where ſhe happen'd
to be. So great was her Charity, that ſhe brought up
ſome hundreds of Girls, (maintaining fifty of them at a
time) for the ſpace of ſeven Years on her own Charges
(what was allow'd by the Founder being only for ten)
employing her Time, Wealth, Strength of Body and
Mind, in Training them up in all Vertuous Exerciſes, and
diſtinguiſhing herſelf in nothing from them, as to Diet,
Bread, Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such was her Love to Men's Souls,
that ſhe ſpared nothing to perſwade them to the Love of
God, and to Imitate Jeſus Chriſt, and employ'd her Time
and Wealth in writing and publiſhing the Truths of God,
for that End. She ſuffer'd patiently all manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and Perſecutions for the Sake of Jeſus Chriſt.
She had an invincible Firmneſs and Conſtancy in what
was Truth: Nothing could ſhake or alter her. She did
nothing to pleaſe Men; She had a conſtant Equality of
Mind in all Conditions; She diſcover'd a wonderful Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on all Occaſions. Let any body but read the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
given of her by thoſe who knew her in her Youth,
in her old Age, and in all States of her Life, as they are
ſet down in <hi>Recucil des Temoignages,</hi> and particularly
that of Mr. <hi>Francken,</hi> Merchant of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and they
will ſee how cloſely ſhe was a Follower of Jeſus Chriſt in
Humility and Poverty of Spirit, in a Contempt of all

in the true Love of God and the Souls of Men.</p>

of the Writer in that place, he does not err damnably,

of God's Love in the Creation of Man, the excellent
State in which he made him, and the Happineſs to which
he deſign'd him. They make appear evidently, that all
our Evil is from our ſelves, and all our Good from God.
They ſhew us the Ground and Reaſon why Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
was ſet about, and not the fallen Angels; why
Jeſus Chriſt took ſuch Intereſt in Man, became Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
and Surety for him; and why his Mediation was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted

eſſay'd, he at laſt cloath'd himſelf with Man's Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
why the following of his Counſels and Example,
is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to Salvation. They repreſent
to us the horrid Corruption that Man is fallen into by
Sin, both as to Soul and Body, and all the Creation by
him; and how mad we are to gratifie our corrupt Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and to love this preſent World. They direct us
to a right uſe of the Rods and Judgments of God, and
awaken us to a ſence of our preſent State, wherein all
the World lies in Wickedneſs. They give us a proſpect of
the World, and of all the Creation worthy of God.
They let us ſee the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God in
bringing about his great Deſigns, tho' thwarted by the
Perverſneſs and Rebellion of Man. They give us ſome
glimpſe of the unſpeakable Glory to which Man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
to partake of the Joys of God, being united to
him in Body and Spirit; and to receive the Delights of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94808:35"/>
all his Works. They ſhew us that Almighty God deſign'd
this World and all the Creation for ſome great End more
worthy of him, than to ſerve Devils and Wicked Men as
a Theatre and Fewel of their Luſts, and Inſtrument of
their diſhonouring him. It is uſual for the Learned to
form Theories and Syſtems of Divinity, whereby to give
a clear Account of the Doctrines of Faith. If Men will
be pleaſed to conſider theſe Sentiments in this View only,
and compare them with the Syſtems given us by the

to ſerve to clear Thouſands of Paſſages there, which
otherwiſe cannot be conceived, as <hi>A. B.</hi> her ſelf makes
appear in ſeveral Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>1.<note place="margin">1. As to the Beauty of all things.</note> That all things were created Good and Beautiful at
firſt without any Deformity, appears both from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, and from his Word. He is Perfect, and
therefore cannot make any thing Imperfect.<note place="margin">Nouv. Ciel. p. 80.</note> He is all
Good, and can make nothing Evil: All things therefore have
been made by him perfectly Good and Beautiful, for the
Workman is known by his Works. A rare Painter or
Writer is known by his Pictures or Writings, tho' we do
not know his Perſon; much more is God known by his
Works, for he can never fail or commit a Fault in them,
which the moſt accompliſh'd Spirits amongſt Men may
do. This is then an Eternal Truth, that God created all
things Beautiful and Good, which the Scripture alſo veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
when it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 1 31.</note> that <hi>God ſaw all that he had made,
and behold it was very Good:</hi> Which could not be, if
there were any Evil in it; as a thing cannot be Beautiful
if it have any Deformity. But we ſee all his Works now
are not Good and Beautiful; in the Air, are Tempeſts,
Whirlwinds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deſtroying Men by Sea or Land: In it
is obſcure Darkneſs, nothing to be ſeen through it, if it
be not favoured with the Rays of the Sun or Stars. The
Earth has a filthy colour, that ſullies all that touches it,
and is of ſuch groſs Obſcurity, that we can ſee nothing
in it; and to make it bring forth Fruit, Men muſt employ
the ſweat of their Body, and after all, it brings forth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94808:36"/>
often nothing but corrupt Fruit; and if it be not cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated,
only Thorns and Thiſtles. The Water often
ſwallows and ſuffocates Men; its greateſt Maſſes are ſalt
or filthy. The Fire has in it a black Smoak ready to
ſtifle Men, if they were not ſuccoured by the Air; it
ſpoils the Eyes of thoſe who ſteadily look on it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
Men, Beaſts, and all other things. Theſe things
cannot be created by God as we ſee and feel them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are neither Good nor Beautiful: By a clear
Conſequence then, we muſt believe that the Air has been
created clear, ſweet and agreeable, without theſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts;
and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>2.<note place="margin">2. As to the Beauty of Man's Body.</note> It is as evident that <hi>our Bodies</hi> have not been created
in the State they are now in, in which there is nothing

they have been form'd <hi>at firſt in a glorious State,</hi> appears
by this, that it being generally acknowledged that Jeſus
Chriſt is to reſtore Man to that primitive Perfection both
of Body and Mind, in which he was created; and the
Scriptures telling us, That we look from Heaven for our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to change our vile Bodies, and to make
them like to his Glorious Body; and we being told that when
at his firſt Transfiguration on the Mount, he was pleaſed
to give his three Diſciples ſome Proſpect of that Glory,
and to let ſome Rays of his Glorious Body ſtream forth
thro' his Mortality; it is ſaid, <hi>his Countenance did ſhine
as Lightning, and his Raiment was white as Snow.</hi> We

before Man, and <hi>Adam</hi>'s giving each of them a Name;
his finding it now <hi>not good that Man ſhould be alone,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 2 18.</note> tho'
before he ſaw all that he had made, and behold it was
very good; his Reſolution therefore to make a <hi>Help meet</hi>
for him, and therefore he cauſed a deep Sleep to fall upon
<hi>Adam,</hi> and took <hi>one Principle</hi> out of him, called in the
Scripture-ſtile <hi>one of his Ribs,</hi> and ſo formed the Woman.
As from all this it ſeems evident that the Formation of
the Woman cannot be ſuppoſed to have been upon the
ſixth Day, without a great Straining of the Hiſtory; ſo it
appears, that <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt created in ſuch a State
of Perfection, as to need no Help for the Production
of his Kind, and that the Formation of the Woman from
him, was upon his beginning to decline from his God,
and to delight himſelf in the Creatures, without referring
all to God. It is therefore ſaid, <hi>It is not good for Man
to be alone;</hi> tho' before, <hi>God ſaw all that he had made,
and behold it was very good.</hi> It ſeems therefore now that
all was not good as he had made it, that Man began
to abuſe the Free Will that God had given him, to be leſs
ardent in his Love and Dependance upon God, and to
lean towards the Creatures; and therefore to prevent his
total Fall, he makes a <hi>Help-meet</hi> for him, gives him a
Companion endu'd with an immortal Soul and the living
Image of God as himſelf, that in Loving this living
Image of the Divinity as himſelf, his Affection might be
raiſed and ſtrengthened in the Love of God.</p>

<hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee his Glory,<note n="e" place="margin">Ib. v. 22, 23.</note> he was covered with
the Lord's Hand while he paſſed by, and permitted only
to ſee his back Parts, becauſe he could not ſee his Face

that all this could not be ſaid of an Angel, that
many of them were in the Opinion, that the Son of God

therein appeared to <hi>Adam</hi> and the Patriarchs; ſo <hi>Juſtin

made appear,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Scot</hi>'s Chriſtian Life. part 2. vol. 2. p 233 to 258.</note> that Jeſus Chriſt immediately after the
Fall of Man became the Mediatior and Surety of a New
Covenant, and ſo, under the moſt high God and Father,
did immediately rule and govern his Church and People;
and that therefore, 1. There was a certain extraordinary
Angel, who frequently appeared and ſpoke to the Jewiſh
Patriarchs, who is ſometimes called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
aſſumed to himſelf Divine Appellations, and to
whom the holy Men rendred Divine Honours, Vows and

being evident, that immediately after the Fall of Man,
Jeſus Chriſt became a Mediatour and Surety for him; that
he took the immediate Care of his People, and often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to them in the Form of a Man; is it not as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with the Analogy of Faith and the Holy Scriptures, to
ſay, he was truly ſo, than to affirm that he took only
the Appearance of a Man, till he cloathed himſelf with
our Frailty and Mortality. Beſides this is a wonderful
Inſtance of the infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God,
that ſo many of the Angels having fallen from their
firſt State, and ſo all Intercourſe between God and them
broken off, to prevent the Fall of Man, or if he ſhould
fall, that there might be a way for his Recovery, and that
there might be one for whoſe Sake and Mediation he
might pardon Man and conferr new Graces on him; that
therefore the Eternal Son of God ſhould unite himſelf to
Man's Nature, and become Man, while Man was yet in his
Integrity and Innocency, ſince afterwards the Divinity
would not have united it ſelf to ſinful Man, and ſo all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe
between God and Man ſhould have been broken
off, as it is between him and the Fallen Angels.</p>

as to their Souls as well as to their Bodies, ſeems to be a
moſt juſt and true Sentiment. We ſee in this viſible World
God has endued all living Creatures with a Power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
their like, from the meaneſt Plant to the moſt perfect
Animal. All kinds of Birds, Beaſts, and Fiſhes produce
their Off-ſpring, of the ſame kind of Body, Life and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
with themſelves, endued with the ſame Power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
their like, which Life and Spirit, even the Learned
as well as the Vulgar, begin again to acknowledge to be
ſomewhat elſe than meer Mechaniſm. This Production all
the Art of the World cannot imitate, but it is derived
down from the firſt of every Kind, to the reſpective Series
of Individuals of that Kind, thro' all Generations. That
all Men do thus derive their Off-ſpring from <hi>Adam</hi> as to
their Bodies, no body will deny; but the general Opinion
of the Learned has been, that our Souls are immediately
created or infus'd by God into our Bodies, and that we do
not derive them from our Parents, and ſo from <hi>Adam.</hi>
But as God has endued Man with a Power of producing
the Bodies of his Off-ſpring, ſo alſo it ſeems evident, that
he has endued Man's Soul united to his Body with a Power
of producing Souls united to Bodies, which receive alſo
from their Conſtituents the ſame Power of producing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Souls united to Bodies, and that altogether like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
There is no Contradiction in the Nature of the
Thing, and the Bleſſing of Multiplying given to Man, is
as unlimited as that to the other Creatures; and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaks of <hi>the Children in the Parents Loins,</hi> and by
this we eaſily conceive how the Corruption of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is communicated to his Poſterity, without any Blemiſh
in the Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of God; for he having
created Man Holy and Righteous with a Power to produce
his like, had he continued ſo, the Souls which proceeded
from him, had been ſo too; but he being corrupted in his
Nature, he could derive no other to his Poſterity. For
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94808:38"/>
Propagation is redoubling of the ſame Being, and of the ſame
State in which it is. But on the other Hand, if Souls are
not derived from the Parent, but immediately created by
God, Children may be leſs ſaid to be the Off-ſpring of their
Parents than the Young of the other living Creatures are
from them; ſo that they all do more perfectly produce
their Kinds than does Man. But above all, this will never
ſatisfie as to the other great Truth, That all Souls are now
impure and corrupt from their Original,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 3.</note> and <hi>Children of
Wrath by Nature,</hi> as the Scripture ſays. It were blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
to ſay, That God creates Souls impure, ignorant and
corrupt, and it is no leſs evil to think that God creating
them pure and holy, does immediately put them into Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
where they no ſooner are, but immediately they are
thereby reputed ſo corrupt and guilty, as to merit an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Separation from God. The devout and profound
S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was ſo ſenſible of the Difficulties in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Aug. de<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib. arb. l. 3. c. 21. Item Epiſt. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. ad de Orig. anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note>
that he was undetermined what Side to take, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
that he had ſeen nothing that cleared them, and
he was for bearing with one another as to a Difference of
Sentiment in theſe Things. It is abſurd to conclude this
Sentiment to be falſe, becauſe we cannot conceive how Souls
ſhould propagate Souls, without communicating of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in whole or in part; if the laſt, they are diviſible
and not ſpiritual; if the firſt, they ſhould ceaſe to animate
their former Bodies: this is to reaſon about Souls from the
Idea's we have of Bodies. Do not we experience ten
thouſand things in the World, tho' we cannot conceive
how they are? We ſee the Soul produces Thoughts, and
one Thought produces another, and this <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Now
it is eaſie for God to make, that in certain Circumſtances
the Divine productive Vertue of the Soul ſhould beget a
Thought which has in it a Principle of Activity as it ſelf
has, and that this Principle after its Production ſhould
not depend any longer on the producing Soul, but ſubſiſt

contrary to it; but they could ſo gloſs and interpret it, as
to reconcile it to their Practice: Even ſo, tho' the Lives of
Chriſtians be in a far greater Contradiction to the Laws
of Jeſus Chriſt, and they retain and honour the Letter of
them ſtill, yet they have learned ſo to gloſs and interpret
them, as to reconcile their Life with the Hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the Favour of God, and their Belief of their
being Good Chriſtians. For if they had not put falſe
Gloſſes on the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, there is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
who deſires to be ſaved that would live as they do
at preſent; for every one would ſee, that he could not be
ſav'd after this manner, and that the Lives of Chriſtians
now are quite contrary to thoſe of the Primitive Church, and
the Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt. His Words are plain and
ſimple, they need no Gloſſes. He tells his Diſciples they
muſt not lay up Treaſures upon Earth; they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all they Poſſeſs; they muſt be poor in Spirit; take
the laſt Place, and deny themſelves. Now if they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all their Life in getting and keeping of worldly
Goods; if they ſeek after Places and Honours; take their
Delights and Eaſe; follow their honeſt Inclinations and
pleaſe themſelves, their Life would ſeem a plain Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; but we have
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94808:40"/>
learned to Gloſs ſo, as to reconcile them. It is but the
Love of all theſe that Jeſus Chriſt forbids, and we are
ready to make our ſelves believe that our Hearts are not
ſet upon them; as if the Bent of a Man's Deſires and
Purſuit could be towards a thing all his Life-time, and his
Heart not ſet upon it. Jeſus Chriſt knows well our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Frailty, that we cannot be immers'd in worldly
things without loving them, more than the Body can lie
in Snow without being chill'd by it, and that we know
not how much our Heart is glew'd to a thing, till we be
ſeparated from it, which is the mean alſo to wean our
Hearts; and therefore that we might not put falſe Gloſſes
on his Doctrine, he has explained it by his own Life, he
himſelf lived in perfect Poverty, Contempt, and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was Poor as to Wealth, Friends, Honour, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Learning, Greatneſs, denied himſelf in every thing
that we Love and Value; and embraced the things that
we abhor and dread. But this, we ſay, was as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
to ſuffer and ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for our
Sins, and to merit for us Mercy and Pardon. It was ſo,
but withal it was to give us an Example, that we ſhould
follow his Steps: His whole Life and Death was a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Sacrifice to God, renouncing all things that ſenſible
Nature takes Pleaſure in, that we might learn from him,
how to make thus a continual Sacrifice of our Will and
Deſires, and Satisfaction to God: Oh! but we think he knows
our Frailty, and that we cannot do this; and we rejoice
that he has ſuffered thus for us, and we hope in his Merits
for Mercy and Salvation: There is no Salvation indeed but
by his Merits, but they are apply'd only to thoſe who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Example; for he tells us, none can come after
him,<note place="margin">Matt. 16. 24.</note> but they <hi>who deny themſelves, and take up their Croſs
and follow him;</hi> and he lived after this manner, that he
might merit Grace for us to follow his Example; ſo that
we have no True Faith in his Merits, when we think this
impracticable. But we have another Gloſs yet, whereby
to indulge and gratifie corrupt Nature. Jeſus Chriſt lived
after this manner, not that we ſhould live a Life actually
ſtrip'd of all worldly things that gratifie Nature and Self,
as his was; but to teach us to be as poor of them in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
If we have them outwardly in Poſſeſſion, not to have
our Hearts ſet on them; and if we be deprived of them,
to be contented and reſigned to the Will of God. Indeed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94808:40"/>
Poverty of Spirit is that in which Jeſus Chriſt would have
us mainly to follow him; and if we be poor in Spirit, in the
midſt of the greateſt Abundance, we are truly his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
But he that is poor in Heart ſeeks not for Wealth,
nor Pleaſures, nor Honours; and if he have them, they are
a charge and burden to him, and he takes no more of them,
for himſelf, than ſimply ſerves the Neceſſities of Nature,
and that of the leaſt and meaneſt, rather than the beſt
and choiceſt. But the reaſon why Jeſus Chriſt has given
us ſuch an Example, and counſelled us to follow it, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of our Weakneſs and Frailty. If we can be poor in
Spirit, in the midſt of the greateſt Abundance, there is
no hazard of Wealth, no need to abandon it; but our
Lord knew how hard it was for a rich Man to enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven. He himſelf could have remained
poor in Spirit in the greateſt Affluence of worldly things,
but he knew it was impoſſible for us to do ſo too; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in Conſideration of our Frailty, and to give us an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
he came into the World ſtrip'd of all that pleaſes
and gratifies corrupt Nature, that he might teach us the
ſafeſt and ſureſt way to mortifie our Love to the World,
and to our ſelves, and to become poor in Spirit. And that
all our Gloſſes and Explications on this Doctrine and Life
of Jeſus Chriſt are falſe, appears by the Fruits of them in
our Hearts and Lives.</p>
                  <p>11.<note place="margin">11. That we are in the Reign of Antichriſt.</note> That the Reign of Antichriſt prevails in the World
at preſent, few Proteſtants do deny: that his Empire is more
Univerſal than is generally believed, appears from this,
that the Devil being properly the Antichriſt by counter-acting
the Deſigns of Jeſus Chriſt, under a Cover of his
Religion, and being for him, and by infuſing his Nature
and Qualities into Men, he has accordingly, inſtead of the
Divine Qualities of Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth,
with which Jeſus Chriſt came to inſpire all his Diſciples;
he has, I ſay, ſhed among the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity
his contrary Evil Qualities of Injuſtice, Malice, and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
under a Cover of Maſſes, Communions, Prayers,
Preachings, and the other outward Forms of Chriſtianity:
This is too evident a Truth to be denied. And under this
Cover keeps Men in a vain Amuſement, and makes them
believe they are good Chriſtians, tho' really in their Hearts
they have not one of the Qualities of the Spirit of Jeſus
Chriſt. For inſtead of loving Poverty, they love the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94808:41"/>
Wealth of this World; inſtead of loving Sufferings, they
love their Pleaſures, their Eaſe, and their Contentments;
and inſtead of being willing to be deſpiſed, they deſire to
be honoured,<note place="margin">Antichr. Decouv. Light of the World p. 1. conf. 5.</note> and ſo of all the reſt. And in <hi>L'Antichriſt
Decouvert, A. B.</hi> has made appear beyond all Exception,
that the Spirit of Antichriſt prevails among all the Parties
of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and that thereby the Devil has with more
Cunning, and more irreclaimably poſſeſt Men with his
Spirit, and eſpecially the Well-meaning, ſo that the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,
and openly Wicked, will enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven ſooner than they, becauſe their Wickedneſs being
manifeſt, they are by the Grace of God more readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
whereas in theſe the Spirit of the Devil being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
with the Mask of Jeſus Chriſt, he ſtill makes them
believe that they are guided by the Spirit of God, when
they are really acted by the Spirit of Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>12. That the Degeneracy of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> proceeds from
the Degeneracy of its Guides and Paſtors,<note place="margin">12. The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Paſtors, the Source of all the Evil.</note> is but too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to be denied, and the Evil is more ſad and irremedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that they cannot endure to have it told them. The
Corruption of the other States of <hi>Christendom</hi> may be
ſpoken of, without exciting ſo much of Mens Indignation;
but if the Corruption of the Paſtors be touch'd, a Man
muſt look for nothing but Rage and Reſentment: This
cannot be ſpoken of, but preſently it is a Combination
againſt the Prieſthood; as our Lord was accuſed, as deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to deſtroy the Law, becauſe he expoſed the Corruption
of the Scribes and Phariſees. All Proteſtants do generally
grant, that the Degeneracy of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
was chiefly owing to the Degeneracy of its
Clergy; and we being as far from True Chriſtianity now,
as formerly, there is Ground to think the Matter is not
much mended. We ſee what a ſtrange Change the Holy
Lives and Doctrine of a few ſimple Men wrought in the
Converſion of many Thouſands to the Faith and Spirit of
Jeſus Chriſt in the Primitive Church, and how little is to
be ſeen of this now. The reaſon of this Difference is not
becauſe of their working Miracles, for theſe ſerve only to
confirm the Truth of a Doctrine, which being once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
there is no more need of them, but they are as
effectual in all After-ages to thoſe who are firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
of them; ſo that to ſuch as think they would be
bettered, if they ſaw ſuch Miracles, is applicable that
of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>If they believe not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94808:41"/>
neither will they be perſwaded tho' one ſhould riſe from the
Dead:</hi> Neither can this Difference be imputed to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Prevalence of Wickedneſs now, the World being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
corrupted alſo at that time, and that to no ſmall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
It is to be attributed then to the Difference of the
Spirit, by which they were animated, from that by which
the Paſtors of the Church are now generally led.</p>
                  <p>The things of God are not known but by the Spirit of God;
and where God finds pure and ſelf-denied Souls, he delights
to communicate himſelf to them, and to make them the
Organs of conveying his Light and Spirit unto others, who
are not capable of receiving it immediately themſelves.
Mens Minds are generally ſo extraverted, and turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſenſible things, that they cannot be affected with
the things of the Spirit of God, unleſs they be conveyed
to them by means that may affect their Senſes; and this
is the reaſon of the great Neceſſity and Uſefulneſs of the
Paſtoral Office. For this Cauſe the Word was made Fleſh
and dwelt among Men, full of Grace and Truth. And
when he aſcended into Heaven, he ſent the Comforter,
who led his Apoſtles into all Truth, and by their means
conveyed the ſame Light and the ſame Spirit into others,
and they were filled with the Holy Ghoſt; ſo that it was
not ſo much they who ſpoke and acted, as the Spirit of
God by them; and there their Doctrine and Lives had a
wonderful effect in the Converting of others, even as one
Flame kindles another; they had a living, not a dead and
barren Knowledge of Divine Things; their fervent Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
did animate all their Words and Actions, and there
was nothing impoſſible to ſuch a Faith, and ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
this made them pray fervently to God for his Divine
Grace to others, and he would not deny the Requeſts of
ſuch ardent Charity: And his holy Spirit encreaſing the
Vertue and Efficacy of their Prayers and Labours, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably
join his powerful Operations to awaken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
and purifie the Hearts of others.<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2. 13. 2 Cor. 3. 3.</note> This made St. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſay, <hi>When ye received the Word of God, ye received it not as
the Word of Men, but (as it is in Truth) as the Word of God,
which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe.</hi> And, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch,
as ye are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of
Chriſt, manifeſted by us, written not with Ink, but with
the Spirit of the living God, not in Tables of Stone, but in
fleſhly Tables of the Heart.</hi> This wrought the Converſion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94808:42"/>
at one time of 3000, and again of 5000 at one Sermon of
St. <hi>Peter.</hi> This made the Officers, who were ſent to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Jeſus Chriſt, ſay, <hi>Never Man ſpoke like this;</hi> and
the Evangeliſts of our Lord's preaching, <hi>That he taught as
one having Authority, and not as the Scribes, and they were
aſtoniſh'd at his Doctrine:</hi> For his Word was with Power,
or to ſpeak with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Evidence and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit, and of the Power of God; that is, they
made the Operations of the Spirit of God to be felt in
the Heart. Moreover, they taught Men by their Deeds as
well as their Words, the Holineſs of their Lives; and their
Abſtraction from all earthly things did procure Belief to all
they ſaid, and let the World ſee, that they bid others do
nothing but what they firmly believed, and heartily ſet
about themſelves. So that the whole Body of the Church
was ſound; when to be a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, it was
required only to embrace an Evangelical Life, and to give
Evidence of the ſincere Love they bear unto Jeſus Chriſt,
and of being led by his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>But wicked and worldly Men crept into the Church,<note place="margin">Light of the World part 1. Conf. 1, 2, 3. 4, 9. Nouv. ciel. let. 5. P. 147.—165. La Sainte Viſiere. ch. 1, 2, 3. Tomb. de la fauſſ. Theol. part 1. let. 1, 9.</note> and
their number increaſing, they got themſelves in to be the
Paſtors of it; then under an outward Cover of Piety and
Religion, Men were turned away from an Evangelical Life,
and led to Damnation: Then the Paſtoral Office was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into a Trade, whereby Men might gain Honour, or
Greatneſs, or Wealth in the World, or at leaſt their Living:
Then Men fitted themſelves for the Paſtoral Office, not by
Humility and Purity of Heart, but by Study and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
then the Paſtors becoming generally void of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, were deprived of the true and living Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the things of God, and retained only the outſide
and the Letter, and varniſhed it over with their Learning
and Human Doctrines; and ſo the Blind led the Blind:
Then inſtead of the Goſpel Simplicity, Schools and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
were multiplied, and there was nothing to be ſeen
but Diſputes and Controverſies: Then the Paſtors being
void of true Charity, and of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt,
their preaching could have no Divine Force, more than
the Motions of Puppets, or the Words of Parrots: Then
they learned to preach the Goſpel by Study and Human
Learning, committing the Idea's of it to their Brain, as
Men learn other Trades, and varniſh over their Sermons
with the ſame Words and Expreſſions that Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94808:42"/>
and his Apoſtles uſed, without comprehending or convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to others the Divine Sence of them, and what came
from the Brain could go no farther than the Brain; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can riſe higher than its Original. Then the great
Buſineſs of Religion is turned upon the Paſtor's ſide into
an Art of Preaching, where on a Theatre he diſplays his
Learning and Eloquence; and on the Peoples ſide into the
work of Hearing, and when they have continued daily in
thoſe pious Exerciſes for 20, 30, 40, or 50 Years, they
are for the moſt part no more truly Vertuous than when
they began; whereas, where the Word of the Lord is,
there is Power: Then the Paſtors being proud and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and envious, and worldly, and ſenſual, and ſelfiſh,
they ſeek their own things under a Cover of ſeeking the
things of Jeſus Chriſt; their Actions belie their Words; and
for their own Credit they ſo gloſs and explain the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Jeſus Chriſt, as to perſwade People they may be
good Chriſtians, and good Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and
yet gratifie their Appetites and Inclinations: Then being
void of true Faith and true Charity, they place Religion
in a Syſtem of Opinions and Rites, and tho' they agree in
the common Principles, yet differing in other things of
leſſer moment, they thereupon divide, diſpute, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
form Parties, draw all they can to their Side, out of
a Pretence to the Glory of God, inſpire them with Hatred
and Fury againſt thoſe that differ from them; ſooth and
flatter the corrupt Inclinations of thoſe of their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or the Great, and thoſe on whom they depend, and ſtir
up Magiſtrates and Princes to War and Bloodſhed, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
thoſe who differ from them: And as they make
War againſt one another by their Diſputes, ſo they make
Princes and ſecular Perſons to do it by their Swords. Thus
inſtead of the Charity, Peace, and Concord, which Jeſus
Chriſt left his Diſciples, they beget Hatred, Strife, and
Envy among them; and ſuch is their Influence upon the
People, that they head their Paſſions; and what they hate
and call Hereſie, ſo do they. Inſtead of the Self-denial
and Mortification to the World, which Jeſus Chriſt and
the firſt Paſtors practiſed and taught, they teach by their
Example how to gratifie Self, and love the World; and
yet ſeem greatly to honour Jeſus Chriſt, and to be Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
for his Religion. And <hi>if the Salt have loſt its ſavour,
wherewith ſhall the</hi> Fleſh <hi>be ſalted?</hi> And if they who ſhould
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94808:43"/>
be the Light of the World, and the Salt of the Earth, are
thus become Darkneſs and without Savour, how great is
that Corruption! And how great is that Darkneſs! Thoſe
of every Party do plainly diſcern this Evil in the Guides
and Leaders of the oppoſite Parties, but our Self-love
blinds and hinders us from conſidering it in our ſelves. This
is not to be underſtood but that there are Paſtors of good

by the Prieſts, Vain-glory and Pride is no where ſo

be Holy: That theſe are the Stars which fall every Day

do not now embrace Penitence, nor deſire Amendment,
that they rather grow every Day worſe, and cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that their Faults ſhould be truly ſhewn them: That
at all times there have been wicked Perſons, but when all
in general do forget him, it is to be believed that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
we are in the laſt Times, and that the Judgment
is given out, becauſe the Meaſure is full: That God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſuffer an univerſal Evil, without an univerſal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement;
and now Men having generally all of them
abandoned their God, have, in doing this, given Sentence
of the general Deſtruction of the World, which ſhall
not be recalled, becauſe the Will of Man is not inclin'd to
return to God, but rather to be the more eſtrang'd from
him, if the Plagues ſhould yet be delayed: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the irrevocable Sentence is given to purge the whole
World by divers Plagues of War, Peſtilence, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
which are framed of the Three Means, which have
cauſed Men to abandon God. Their Want of True Love
to one another; their Love of this preſent Life, and
their being addicted to their ſenſual Appetites; the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the Mouth and Belly. She ſhews, that many
Signs have appeared in the Heavens; fearful Comets, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing

If God ought not to ſend his Plagues, but by
Supernatural things, and to make Chimera's in the Air?

to ſome Friends, and when they had ſhewn them to

take Advantage thereby, to make them deſpiſe the other

would not have offered to give a Summary of thoſe her

All the Works of God are a Myſtery; and the
moſt ordinary things, the Formation of Man now, and
all the other Works, would ſeem to us as ſtrange if we

are not to be enquired into, neither out of vain Curioſity,
nor from a diſputing Humour,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 25.</note> which begets Preſumption
and Pride of Spirit; for the Divine Myſteries are rather

<hi>A. B.</hi> both as to the Eſſentials and Acceſſory Truths of
Chriſtianity, is a juſt and true Repreſentation which may
be more fully and ſatisfyingly had from her own Writings.
And I ſhall leave it to all impartial Readers to conſider
whether the Character which ſome have been pleaſed to
give of her Sentiments, as heretical, blaſphemous, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and extravagant, be juſt and equal; and if it be not the
Reſult rather of their Miſtakes and Prejudices than a plain
and fair Account of her Doctrine and Sentiments. The
excellent Monſieur <hi>Paſchal,</hi> in his <hi>Penſees Chretiennes,</hi> gives it
as the moſt eſſential and diſtinguiſhing Mark and Character
of true Religion, that it makes its chief Precept and the
great and eſſential Duty of Man to be, To love God with all
our Hearts; and this, he ſays, is the peculiar and ſingular
Character of the Chriſtian Religion in Contradiſtinction to
all others. And if we ſhall impartially compare the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Chriſtianity as it repreſented in the Writings of
<hi>A. B.</hi> with the Accounts of it delivered to us in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems
of Divinity of the reſpective Parties in Chriſtendom,
I think it will evidently appear that it is a moſt diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Character of the former, tho' it makes the Love of
God the great End of Religion, and all the other Duties of it
means to bring us to that End; and that the other tho' they
cannot omit, when they give an Account of Chriſtianity,
to mention this as one of its great Precepts; yet they ſo
ſhuffle and confound Doctrines, and give it ſuch a Place
in their Syſtems, as may make People lay greater Streſs on
other things, and give them Ground to hope they may be
ſaved without it, or without conforming our Lives to the
Rules and Life of Jeſus Chriſt which lead to it.</p>

upon light and weak Grounds, to take up
<hi>Prejudices</hi> againſt the Perſons and Sentiments
of others, and <hi>to judge raſhly</hi> and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
of them; and this is a Fault to which People of all
Tempers are ſubject. The Learned, the <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> and
the <hi>Abettors</hi> of Parties cannot endure any thing that ſeems
to leſſen the Credit of their Sentiments or their Party; they
preſently raiſe a Hue-and-Cry, and do all they can to
animate the People. Thus the Scribes and Phariſees were
full of Spite and Prejudice againſt our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
and inſpir'd the People with the ſame Spirit. The <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi>
of Men ſee with other Mens Eyes, and judge with
other Mens Underſtandings; they cannot be at the pains
to weigh and conſider things impartially themſelves, but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94808:47"/>
they truſt to the Skill and Sincerity of thoſe who pretend
to judge for them; and ſuch for the moſt part judging
raſhly, and by their Paſſions lead the Multitude to do ſo
too. Yea, even <hi>Perſons of good Inclinations,</hi> and who have
a true Zeal for God and Divine things, are apt to commit
the ſame Fault. Thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> before he was a Chriſtian,
being a Man full of Zeal, and of great Learning, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there were Perſons riſen up who would deſtroy
the Law and ſeduce the Simple, and that they worſhipped
the firſt of theſe Impoſtors who was hanged on a Tree,
and that theſe new Upſtarts were but a Rabble bigotted
with that new kind of Folly, which was like to hazard the
Law of God; and this being told him by all his Maſters
and Teachers, the Prieſts, the People, his Kinsfolks, and
Friends, inſtead of informing himſelf without Prejudice
of thoſe Men, their Doctrine, their Behaviour, which
would have prevented many falſe Steps, he is carried to
reproach, and hate, and perſecute them, that he may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Truth of God, and cut off Error and Hereſie, and
the Seduction of the People. Now what has fallen out in
former Times, may fall out in this, and the moſt innocent
Perſons and Writings, may meet with the moſt univerſal
Reproaches and Prejudices. It is certainly the Devil's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
that it ſhould be ſo, and we ſee how ſucceſsful his
Attempts have been in former Ages. He ſtill made it his
Buſineſs to get on his ſide thoſe who ſet up to be the Guides
and Leaders of the People, and by this means always to
oppreſs, blacken, and diſcredit <hi>Truth and Innocence.</hi>

               <p>II.<note place="margin">II. The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Perſon of <hi>A. B.</hi> thus treated.</note> Now the <hi>Perſon and Writings</hi> of <hi>A. B.</hi> have been
loaded with as many Reproaches and Prejudices as any
in this Age; and that both in her Life time, and ſince her
Death. Where-ever ſhe went, the Church-men of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Parties breath'd nothing but Fire and Faggot againſt
her in their Pamphlets and Pulpits, made her to paſs for
the worſt of Hereticks, and her Writings for a Sink of all
Hereſies and Blaſphemies; and thus it was eaſie to inſpire
People with Rage and Fury, ſo that if they could have
had her to have ſton'd her to Death, <hi>they would have thought
they had done good Service,</hi> and no ſooner is one of her Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
tranſlated into Engliſh for the ſpiritual Good of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed

whole Iſland from looking into theſe Writings, and to
breed an Averſion againſt thoſe who eſteem and value them,
becauſe of the Truths of God contain'd in them.</p>
               <p>It was a remarkable Providence that ſhe met with ſuch
Oppoſition from all Parties, while ſhe lived, whereby as
ſhe diſcovered impartially the Evils of the reſpective Sects
and Parties into which <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> is divided; ſo alſo ſhe
clearly vindicated her ſelf from being guilty of the Errors
and Hereſies of which they accus'd her, diſcovered the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
of their Calumnies and Slanders, and remov'd
from well-diſpos'd Perſons the Prejudices which had been
given them againſt her. We need only then give a ſhort
Account of what was laid to her Charge, and her own <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
of herſelf; by which, her Sincerity, her Innocency,
her diſtinct and moſt rational Knowledge of the Truths
of Religion, her Orthodoxy, and the Subſervency of her
Writings to the great Ends of Chriſtianity, will I hope
appear to all unbiaſs'd Readers.</p>
               <p>III.<note place="margin">III. The unjuſt Meaſures of her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries:</note> But firſt let us premiſe the Complaint ſhe makes in
general of the unjuſt Meaſures of her Adverſaries; how
void they were of true Charity and Equity. What ever
<hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> was inconteſtably in her Writings, they
conceal'd it, they leſſen'd it; whatever was capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turn'd to an Evil Sence, they perverted it; they pick'd
out half Sentences here and there throughout her Writings,
and on theſe they put a Sence which ſhe never intended,
concealing in the mean time what went before or after, that
might ſerve to clear the true ſence and meaning of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
Any Doctrine of Chriſtianity that was not ſo fully
expreſt in one Place, they were ready to accuſe her of
denying it, tho' ſhe moſt clearly aſſerted it in another.
They were ready to catch at her Words, and to interpret
them according to the Niceneſs of the Schools, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the ſimplicity and plainneſs with which ſhe wrote,
ſhe being intent to make known the Truth to all ſincere
and well-diſpoſed Souls, without regarding that nice and
captious Wits would be ready to carp and quibble upon
this or the other Word, and not allow her to explain her
ſelf. In ſhort, the <hi>great End of Chriſtianity</hi> being to bring
Men to the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and the <hi>Mortification of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Nature and Self-will,</hi> and this being the <hi>Butt</hi> of all
her Writings, as is moſt evident to any who pleaſes to
read them, ſhe makes appear that her Adverſaries cannot
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94808:48"/>
be Lovers of the Truth or of God, that their Aim is not
to maintain the Truth and oppoſe Error; elſe they would
rejoice to ſee this great End of Religion to be the Butt and
Subſtance of ſo many Writings, and that there are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtably
contain'd in them ſo great a number of Divine
Truths, all tending to this End. They would own and
acknowledge this, they would wiſh to meet with the Truth
every where, even in the things which ſeem'd to them
obſcure and diſagreeable to it; they would ſee if theſe were
more clearly explain'd in other Places, and if they might
well bear a Sence that were agreeable to this great End of
Religion; or if even the Errors which they thought were
contain'd there, were no ways deſtructive of the true Love
of God, and ſo for the ſake of them the whole Writings
need not be forbidden and diſcredited.</p>
               <p>IV.<note place="margin">IV. Their Spirit and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per like that of the Scribes and Phariſees.</note> They may be convinced of the Injuſtice of the
Meaſure, by conſidering only how hard they would think
it to have their own Writings ſo treated; how odd it would
ſeem to them if one ſhould deal with the Sacred Scriptures
after that Method; and what wretched Concluſions an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Chriſtianity might thereby draw from them; and
that if it had been their Luck to have been bred up at the
Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> among the Jewiſh Rabbies, or with
<hi>Porphyr,</hi> among the Philoſophers, the Spirit and Meaſures
by which they judge of Perſons, Sentiments, and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
would have animated them as much againſt Jeſus
Chriſt himſelf; and had they come but Sixteen Hundred
Years ſooner into the World, and been leaven'd with the
ſame Spirit, they ſhould have been liſted among the <hi>Philo-Judaeus's</hi>
and the <hi>Porphyrs,</hi> and overlooking the Substance
of the Doctrine and Life of Jeſus Chriſt, would have pick'd
out a half Sentence here, and a Word or two there, and
ſome Paſſages of his Life that prejudiced Minds would be
readieſt to judge hardly of, and wreſt them to ſuch a Sence,
and give all ſuch a Turn, as might make him paſ for a
Blaſphemer, a Seducer, a Subverter of the Law of God, a
Teacher of Doctrines that would turn the World upſide
down; one Self-conceited, who ſpoke well of himſelf, and
ill of others who were more learn'd and pious than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
in a word, give ſuch a Character and Narrative of
him, patch'd up of ſome ſhreds of the Story of his Life and
Doctrine written by his own Diſciples, and dreſs him up
in ſuch a mock-Robe, as might make him and his Doctrine
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94808:48"/>
the Object of the Scorn and Hatred of the People. I
know People flatter themſelves with the Opinion, that it
were impoſſible for them to have treated Jeſus Chriſt at this
rate, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in our Saviour's Days
imagin'd, that had they liv'd in the Days of their Fathers,
they would not have perſecuted and kill'd the Prophets as
their Fathers did; and yet our Lord ſhews them, they have
the ſame Spirit; tho' they ſeem'd to honour the Prophets
* by <hi>building their Tombs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 23. 29, 30.</note> and <hi>garniſhing their Sepulchres,</hi>
and ſaying, <hi>If we had been in the Days of our Fathers, we
would not have been Partakers with them in the Blood of the
Prophets.</hi> Yet they perſecuted thoſe who were then ſent
amongſt them; and that the ſame Temper and Spirit
reigns now in the world, <hi>A. B.</hi> makes appear in her Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and her Enemies did diſcover it in their Practices.</p>

that it is a great Preſumption in Men, who cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

what a Soul is; and yet Men are ſo preſumptous as
that they will needs know what is in God, and what the
Three Perſons of the Trinity are, which are in him; and
that not for to honour or love him the more, but that they
may be able to talk and diſpute well of them, and to draw

may be call'd Perſons: That ſhe does not pretend thereby
to give adiquate Notions of the Myſtery of the Trinity,
which ſhe declares is incomprehenſible; but that inſtead
of the dark, dry, and barren Speculations of the Schools
thereabout, we may conſider thoſe Three Divine Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

Goodneſs, and Truth of God; and if we do not find
them all Three together in our Souls, we ought not to
perſwade our ſelves that we are the Children of God; for
as we approach unto him by Love, accordingly thoſe Three
Qualities encreaſe in the Soul; and as we find our Souls to
be eſtranged from Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth,
accordingly we are eſtranged from God. In uſing Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes

ſhe ſays, <q>Your Preachers ſay, that I reject the Merits of
Jeſus Chriſt, tho' in truth I eſteem them more than any
Body in the World. I believe I cannot be ſav'd but by the
Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, yea, that none was ever ſav'd from
the Beginning of the World but by the Merits of Jeſus
Chriſt;</q> for if Jeſus Chriſt had not merited Pardon for
<q>all Men, with God his Father, after <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinn'd,
all Men had remain'd in a Loſt Eſtate, as the Devils have
done, becauſe they had no Interceſſor with God to obtain
Pardon for their Sins as Men have had; who having
Jeſus Chriſt for their Brother, obtain'd by his Means the
Remiſſion of their Sins.—I mean not, that Jeſus Chriſt
has not alſo ſatisfied for the Sins of Men ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for them expreſly he cloath'd himſelf with our Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and came into the World to Redeem us from
Eternal Death, into which all Men had wilfully precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
themſelves, and ſunk themſelves into a Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God, living according to the Motions of corrupt
Nature, as the Beaſts; which Jeſus Chriſt perceiving, he
came from the Boſom of his Father unto the Earth to
recal them: He comes to ſhew them the State in which
they were, and how they had abandon'd their God to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94808:50"/>
delight in other things than in him, and by what means
they might recover the Grace of God to attain to Salvation:
And he himſelf does before them the Works that they
ought to do after his Example: And becauſe they had
turn'd away from the Love of God, to love the Goods
and Riches of this World, Jeſus Chriſt came in Poverty,
that Men might embrace it after his Example: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Men had forgotten God, through the Eſteem they
had of themſelves, Jeſus Chriſt came in all Humility and
Sufferings to give them an Example: And becauſe Men
had left off their Obedience to God, to follow their
own Wills, Jeſus Chriſt came to ſhew that he is Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
even to the Death of the Croſs, that he might
teach Men how they ought to be ſubject and obedient
even to Death: And Jeſus Chriſt has done all this, with
many other things, for the Love he bear to Men, and that
by ſuch Means he might draw them to his Father; that
he might live with them to all Eternity, giving himſelf
thus in Sacrifice for the Redemption of his Brethren.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But this Sacrifice was not offered for Men who do not
believe in him, and do not the Works that he did; nor
for thoſe who will needs wilfully continue in their Sins
after having known the Law of the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And in <hi>Antichr. decouv. Part 2. p.</hi> 76. <q>They have, <hi>ſays

                     </hi> ſometimes argued againſt me, that I deny the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Jeſus Chriſt: But I believe this is becauſe I do not
hold that Jeſus Chriſt has ſatisfi'd for Men after the Manner
that they hold it; to wit, that Jeſus Chriſt has ſatisfied
for all Men, and that they ſhall be ſaved by his Sufferings;
without being obliged to ſuffer themſelves; which is a
great Error, becauſe the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt will
never be applied to any but thoſe who ſhall follow his
Life and Doctrine.—</q>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe, on the one hand, Men are apt to pervert
the Doctrine of the Merits and Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt
to encourage the Indulging of their corrupt Nature, and
others to deſpiſe it, and think they can ſave themſelves, I
think it will not be unacceptable to ſhew how ſhe diſcovers
the Evil of both, as in many of her Writings, ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in <hi>Antechr. decouvert. Part 3. p. 45, 46, &amp;c.</hi>

periſh thro' Pride, as well as they who ſay that Jeſus

Chriſt has ſatisfied all for them. All of them fall into
the ſame Sin of Pride and Ingratitude, tho' by different
Ways. The one is proud to believe that he ſhall be ſaved
by his own Works; and he is alſo very unthankful that
he will not acknowledge what Jeſus Chriſt has done for
him, requiting his Benefits with Contempt and Irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
And the others commit the ſame Sin of Pride, in
preſuming that they are God's Elect, and his Children, to
whom Salvation appertains, tho they do not labour to
obtain it; and they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ll alſo into the Sin of Ingratitude,
in that they will nor render unto Jeſus Chriſt what he has
paid for them. They now that he was their Pledge and
Surety, yea, that he effectively paid the Penalties due to
their Sins, yet they will not uſe any Endeavours to make
Reſtitution to him. Would it not be a great Ingratitude
for a Perſon to ſay to him who had paid his Debt, as his
Pledge and Surety, That knowing his Debt is paid he
reſolves to live in Idleneſs, without taking Care to return
the ſame Payment to him who had paid it for him? Such
a Perſon would be look'd upon by us as wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful;
while we think our ſelves the Children of God
in doing the ſame things to the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt.
We ſay he is our Pledge, and by his Sufferings has paid
the Penalty due to our Sins, having died to redeem us;
while we will ſuffer nothing, nor ſhare in his Pains, being
well pleaſed to have our Debts paid with the Goods of
another.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>—It is, on the other hand, a great Boldneſs in thoſe who
think they ſhall be ſaved by their own Merits without the
Merits of Jeſus Chriſt. For if Jeſus Chriſt had not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
for them the Grace to do well, they were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of having ſo much as one good Thought or Deſire of
doing one good Work. So that all the Grace they have
of doing any Good, comes from the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt,
tho' by Ignorance they deſpiſe it, as poor blinded ones
who can diſcern nothing thro' the Weakneſs of their
Sight. For if Jeſus Chriſt had not come to bring Light
to the World, no body would have perceived his own
miſerable State; and if he had not interceded with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
no body would have had the Grace to receive his
Light; ſo that without Jeſus Chriſt all Men would have
remained loſt, thro' their Blindneſs, and would never have
been able to comprehend by what Means they ought to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94808:51"/>
return to God, if Jeſus Chriſt had not come to teach
them by Word and Deed. And if he had only taught
them by Word as the other Prophets, no body would
have followed him; ſince they believe even yet that it is
impoſſible to imitate Jeſus Chriſt, and to follow the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Life. But he himſelf has put it in Practice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Mens Eyes, that after his Example they muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God by the Union of his
Sufferings, and of his Charity, which are Sacrifices more
agreeable to God his Father, than our unclean Offerings
and our Works defiled with Sin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If one had mortally offended his Equal, he durſt not
of himſelf procure Peace and the Pardon of his Offence,
but he would interpoſe ſome Mediator who were a
Friend of the offended Perſon, to ſatisfie his juſt Wrath.
But they who would be ſaved by their good Works
have too much Pride to take Jeſus Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
but, with an up-lifted Head, they addreſs to God
whom they have ſo often offended; that they rather draw
down his avenging Hand upon their Heads than the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of their Sins; for God reſiſts the Proud, and gives
his Heart to the Humble. If they join'd their good
Works to the Humility of Jeſus Chriſt, they might
peradventure receive the Mercy of God by his Son Jeſus
Chriſt; but ſtanding up as the Phariſee who thanked
God for his good Works, they ſhall no more be juſtified
than he was when he went out of the Temple: Becauſe
he who is not cloathed with Jeſus Chriſt is not admitted
to his Father; ſince before his Coming into the World
all Men were Enemies to God. So that he who is not
cloathed with Jeſus Chriſt cannot be acknowledged for
his Friend, far leſs for his Son, ſeeing the Spirit of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt is the only Son in which he takes Pleaſure,
and not in another. He therefore who thinks to go to
God without the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, will be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
as unworthy and raſh, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is the only
Door of Salvation: They are Thieves who would enter
by the Windows into the Kingdom of Heaven, for that
only belongs to the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In which thoſe greatly deceive themſelves, who believe
that they may enter into it while they deſpiſe him or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
his Merits, which have opened the Door to all thoſe
who will follow and imitate him: Yet not to thoſe who
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94808:52"/>
eſteem Jeſus Chriſt and his Merits; but with all this, will
not embrace Penitence, under a Pretext that Jeſus Chriſt
has ſatisfi'd wholly for their Sins, comprehending even thoſe
which they ſhall commit in time to come, as well as thoſe
which they have committed in time paſt. In which Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
are the moſt part of thoſe who are called Chriſtians,
yea, amongſt others the moſt perfect. We hear nothing
more ordinary in their pious Diſcourſes, than to ſay, God is
Good, he will ſave us; and Jeſus Chriſt died to give us Entry
into Paradiſe. And with theſe fine Diſcourſes every one
thinks they are ſure of Paradiſe, even tho' they live and
die in their natural Motions and Sentiments, which is a
great Miſtake; for God, tho' he be good, will ſave no
body but him who ſhall ſatisfie his Divine Juſtice. The
Merits of the Death and Suffering of Jeſus Chriſt will
never be applied but to Souls which are regenerated in
the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt: For he has not ſuffered but
for thoſe who from a natural Life ſhall enter into a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
one. For Jeſus Chriſt ſays, that all Righteouſneſs
muſt be fulfilled. Now it were not juſt that they who
have forſaken a Dependance upon God to depend upon
their own Wills, ſhould enjoy the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt
without being converted and embracing his Spirit, ſince
he came not but to bring Sinners to Repentance; and he
who continues to perſevere in his natural Life cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and ſo cannot enjoy the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt,
ſince it is not for thoſe that he has ſuffered or merited,
but only for thoſe who by Ignorance or Frailty have
quitted their Dependance upon God, and delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Creatures without thinking they ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
themſelves in God alone. They lived in the Darkneſs
of Death without knowing it: Therefore Chriſt had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on them, and offered himſelf to his Father, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
unto him that they ſhould be converted and do
Penitence, provided he brought them the Light of Truth,
by which they might get out of their Darkneſs and their
Errors. In this Jeſus Chriſt was our Pledge, and anſwered
for our Penitence, with which we muſt be ſaved and not
otherwiſe.—</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>—Therefore they form to themſelves imaginary
Ways in the Air, who think that Jeſus Chriſt is come to
ſave us in ſpeculative Way, or by ſome incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Myſteries, ſeeing our Redemption is accommodated
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94808:52"/>
to our Capacity. But the Devil, to divert us from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the ſtraight Way, thro' which Jeſus Chriſt walked,
blinds our Eyes with imaginary Things, that we may
never come to the Knowledge of the ſtraight Truth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſome believe that they cannot be ſaved by the Merits
of Jeſus Chriſt; and others, that his Merits will ſave them,

               <p>The Sum of her Sentiments comes to this,<note place="margin">The Sum of her Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, as to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt.</note> That Man
turning away his Heart and his Affections from God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all Communion between God and Man ceas'd, and ſo
Man was plung'd into an irrecoverable State of Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
as well as the fallen Angels, if there had been none
to interpoſe for him with God, for whoſe Sake he ſhould
ſhew him Mercy, there being nothing now in Man that
could move God to have any Regard for him: That Jeſus
Chriſt, true God and true Man, infinitely beloved by his
Father, full of Love to him, and of Charity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for Man, ardently intercedes with God for him,
that he would have Mercy on him. His Father could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
him nothing that was conſiſtent with his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Truth. It was not juſt that he ſhould receive Man
into Favour, if he ſhould continue ſtill to turn away his
Love from God to the Creatures and to himſelf; nor had it
been juſt and ſafe to have reſtor'd him preſently to the ſame
State of Divine Communion and Joy from whence he had
fallen; it was neceſſary he ſhould feel firſt the Evil of
Forſaking his God, that ſo his corrupt Nature might be
mortified, and he eſtabliſh'd in the Love of God. God
then for the Merits and Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
Man upon Condition he turn again to the Love of
his God from the Creatures and himſelf; and for this End
he communicates again to him his Light and Grace, and
allows him a Time of Trial wherein he is to do Penitence
for offending his God, that thereby his corrupt Nature and
his Love to the Creatures and himſelf may be throughly
mortified, and he return and be eſtabliſh'd in the Love of
God. Jeſus Chriſt accepts of the Terms, and becomes
Surety for Man that he ſhall fulfil them, and applies
himſelf with ardent Love to bring Man back again to God.
The Delights of the Creatures being that which had turn'd
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94808:53"/>
away Man's Affections from God, it was juſt and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that he ſhould deny himſelf to them, and make an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Sacrifice of all thoſe Delights and of his Luſts after
them to the Love of God: To make which the more eaſie
for him, the Earth was accurſed for his Sake. Jeſus Chriſt
coming now to interpoſe with God, to bring him back to
his Duty, leaves no Means uneſſay'd to effectuate it; of
inward Light and Grace, and outward Laws and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
according to Man's State and Circumſtances. When the
Corruption of Man's Nature had reſiſted and baſſl'd all thoſe
Means, yet nothing being able to quench his Love, he at
laſt cloaths himſelf with Man's mortal Nature, puts on all
his Infirmities, becomes in all things like to him, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sin, and, as if he had been the greateſt Sinner, does Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence
for him, denies himſelf to all Honours, Riches,
Pleaſures, Sciences, Eaſes, Accommodations, Self-ſeeking, and
Self-will, lives and dies in perfect Poverty, Contempt, and
Pain, makes an enitre Sacrifice of himſelf, his Life, and all
things of the World unto his God; and this, both that by his
Doctrine and by his perfect Example he might ſhew Man
what Way to return to God, how to do Penitence for his
Sins, how to deny himſelf and take up his Croſs, and to
make a Sacrifice of himſelf and all unto God; and by doing
all this in Man's Nature, to ſhew him how practicable it was,
and alſo that for the ſake of this pure and perfect Oblation
of himſelf, done from ſo great Love to God and Charity to
Man, God might be ſtill moved to have Mercy on Man, to
grant him his Grace, and to accept of his Penitence, united
to this Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt: What Jeſus Chriſt has done
and ſuffered for Man on Earth has infinitely heightned his
Merits and the Power of his Interceſſion with God, ſo that
he obtains for Man, Pardon, and Grace, and Time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and the being receiv'd into perfect Favour with God,
upon his Penitence, as if he had never ſinned: Jeſus Chriſt
has ſatisfied on his part the Juſtice of God, but they only
receive the Benefit of it who follow his Example in denying
themſelves, and taking up their Croſs, and do thereby
mortifie their corrupt Nature and return to the Love of
God. It is in this Sence that we alſo muſt ſatisfie God's
Juſtice, not that we can make any Satisfaction to God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to our Demerits. Not that we can merit his
Pardon or Salvation; but it being juſt with God not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Man into Communion again with him till he do
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94808:53"/>
Penitence for his Sins, and thereby mortifie his ſelfiſh and
carnal Affections; not that God ſtands in need of this, but
that it is abſolutely neceſſary for Man's Recovery, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect Salvation without ſatisfying in this manner on
our part.</p>
               <p>The Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt for our Sins may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in two Sences, by way of Merits, or by way of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge:
The Firſt way, That he has thereby merited Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Grace, and Salvation for all who ſhall follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
is moſt true: The Second, by way of Diſcharge,
That Jeſus Chriſt has ſo fully ſatisfied the Juſtice of God,
for the Sins of his Elect, that nothing is required of them
but to believe and rely on his Merits; and nothing due from
them, but by way of Gratitude, as if God ſtood in need of
their Services; or that they need do, for the mortifying of
corrupt Nature, as much only as their Love and Care for the
World and themſelves will permit, and truſt in Chriſt's
Merits for the reſt. This, I ſay, is moſt falſe, Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
merited for us Grace to mortifie our corrupt Nature,
and Pardon, and eternal Life, if we return to the Love of
God.</p>
               <p>Again, there is a twofold Subſtitution, or the having one
in our ſtead to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for us: There is
a Subſtitution of Self-love, and another of Charity, or
the Love of God: The Firſt is, when we deſire to gratifie
our ſenſual and corrupt Nature, and follow our own Wills
and Luſts, and are very well pleas'd to hear that there is
one has ſuffered for us, and ſatisfied God's Juſtice; ſo that
we are content to believe in him and hope in his Merits,
going on in the mean time to indulge our corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
excuſing our ſelves becauſe of our Frailty and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and that we cannot do otherwiſe; but our Saviour
Jeſus Chriſt has made an Atonement for all, and we hope
in his Merits. This is a Falſe, Diabolical, and Antichriſtian
Subſtitution, as <hi>A. B.</hi> makes abundantly appear through
all her Writings. The Subſtitution of Charity, is when
out of a deep Sence of our Baſeneſs and Undutifulneſs to
God, and the Propenſity of our Natures to continue ſo
ſtill, and to gratifie our corrupt Inclinations, we apply
our ſelves by his Grace to deny our ſelves, and to make a
Sacrifice of all that's dear to us to God, in leading a Life
of conſtant Penitence; but ſeeing our Penitence bears not
Proportion to the infinite Greatneſ and Goodneſs of that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94808:54"/>
God whom we have offended, we rejoice to know that
there is one of perfect Purity, and in full Favour with God,
who for us has made a ſuitable Oblation of himſelf, not
to diſcharge us from a Life of Penitence, but to obtain
Grace for us to do it, and Acceptance of it with God, and
ſhew us how to perform it: To him we flie, and for his ſake
we beg for the Acceptance of our imperfect Penitence, and
deſire it may be united to his Sacrifice and done in his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that he, dwelling in our Hearts by Faith, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
himſelf to us with all his Graces and Merits.
It is in the former Sence only that <hi>A. B.</hi> declares againſt
the common Doctrine <hi>Of the Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
as if it were a Subſtitution of total Diſcharge, diſpenſing
with the Obligation that lies on us to live a Life of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and not at all in the Second.</p>
               <p>They who read the Writings of <hi>A. B.</hi> will ſee that this
is the Summ and Subſtance of her Sentiments on this
Head, and that any ſimple Expreſſions which ſeem harſh
by themſelves are to be interpreted by this Meaſure. And
they who conſider by what Principles the Generality of
the Chriſtian World do, I do not ſay ſpeculate and talk,
but live and act, and what Encouragement the Doctrine
and Gloſſes of Men has given thereunto; and how, tho'
they live in a perfect Contradiction to the Life and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Jeſus Chriſt, yet they hope and believe they ſhall
be ſaved by his Merits, will ſee how neceſſary and how
ſeaſonable it is to inculcate thoſe Truths upon the Hearts
of Men.</p>
               <p>VIII.<note place="margin">VIII. Of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction due by Man.</note> But becauſe it gives great Offence to ſome, that
<hi>ſhe ſays,</hi> Tho' Chriſt has ſatisfied all for us on his part, yet
that the Merits of his Satisfaction will not be applied to
us, unleſs we our ſelves do ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for
our Sins, and in order to our Purification; I ſhall ſet down
her Sentiment more particularly in this Matter: We ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſtumble at Words and Terms when we grant the
thing it ſelf upon the matter, and it is like this is the
caſe with many here.</p>
               <p>1. Then,<note place="margin">Le Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moign. de Verite. part 1. p. 83.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhe ſays,</hi> That no Man could merit Eternal
Life, tho' <hi>Adam</hi> had never ſinn'd; for all our good Works
are but Temporal, and bear no proportion to eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
Heaven and eternal Life is the free Gift of God,
which he prepared for Man before he created him, and
ſo he could not merit it. He does not therefore beſtow it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94808:54"/>
for our Merits,<note place="margin">Renouv. de l'Eſpr. Evang avant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop. n. 35.</note> but for his great Mercy, and for the Love
he bears us: He is no Merchant, and will not ſell his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
at any price, but will give it freely; and he has no
need of our good Works or Penitence, but becauſe of our
Corruption and Infirmity we have great need of them,
without which we muſt periſh.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">Preface, n. 33, 40. 47, 67. 103, 138, 139, 140.</note> That we having forfeited God's Favour and eternal
Life, Jeſus Chriſt has merited for us Pardon, Grace, and
Life Eternal, upon Condition that we receive and correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond
with the Pardon and Grace offered, and turn again
to God with all our Hearts, and embrace the Means that
are neceſſary for this End, without which in Juſtice, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and Grace could not be demanded for Man; and for
our Performance of this, Jeſus Chriſt becomes our Pledge
and Surety.</p>
               <p>3. As ſuch he cloaths himſelf with our Mortality, and
undergoes all the Parts of this Penitence himſelf, that he
might merit Grace and Pardon for Man, and might
ſtrengthen and direct him how to embrace this Penitence,
and to follow his Example.</p>
               <p>4. Upon his Interceſſion,<note place="margin">Le Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moign. de Verite. Part 1. n. 59, 61, 64.</note> and obtaining of Grace and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for Man, the <hi>Love of God</hi> is not immediatly conferr'd
upon Man, but the <hi>Grace of doing</hi> Penitence, by which he
might recover it. And this was a greate Mercy to Man,
than if God had ſimply pardon'd him, and reſtor'd him to
his <hi>Love,</hi> without ſuffering the Earth to be accurſed, or all
to be corrupted by Sin; ſince it is to be fear'd Man would
have quickly fallen back again into new Sins, finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as before in all ſorts of Delights, ſuch as <hi>Adam</hi> had.
For we ſee how Men now turn away their Hearts from
God to love the Creatures and themſelves, even when they
ſee they are ſo wretched, weak, and imperfect, ſubject to
all ſorts of Maladies and to Death, and that all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
now do them miſchief, whereas formerly they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
and obey'd them as their Lord; and tho' they ſee
themſelves and all the Creatures ſo filthy, corrupt and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
yet they cannot abſtain from loving them to the
Prejudice of the Love they owe to God. How much more
would Man have done ſo, in caſe he had remained as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and perfect after his Sin, and all the other Creatures
had continued as lovely as before? It is to be fear'd he
would not have remained in the Love of God, if he had
recovered it after his Sin by the pure Mercy of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94808:55"/>
out the Condition of doing Penitence; or without all the
other Creatures their being accurſed in him; ſince we ſee
Men do yet love this Life that is ſo miſerable, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that are ſo wretched, and Man feels in himſelf Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
Griefs, Diſpleaſures, and all ſorts of vicious
Paſſions, which he cannot govern by his Reaſon; and yet
his Spirit is become ſo brutiſh, that it loves thoſe Miſeries
and Imperfections, tho' he find nothing in himſelf or the
other Creatures, but what is worthy of Contempt and
Hatred: Yet he loves and eſteems them to the Contempt
of the Love of his God; who knowing the Baſeneſs of
Man's Heart, has given him Penitence as a neceſſary Mean
to withdraw his Affections from this wretched Life, that
he may turn them to his God, who will have Man to love
him only. And for the ſame Reaſon he has permitted all
the Creatures which were ſubject to Man, to contract with
him the Malediction of Sin; that by this Mean, occaſion
might be given to Man to return to the Love of his God,
the only lovely Object.</p>
               <p>5. Since this Penitence contains the neceſſary Means to
recover the Love of God, and we cannot do this ſo long as
we love Self and the Creatures, and this corrupt Love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be mortified ſo long as we gratifie our Senſes, and our
Appetites, and enjoy a Paradiſe here; and our Luſts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſubdued without feeling the Bitterneſs, Anguiſh,
Griefs, and Pains of them, to extinguiſh the Sence of the
unlawful Pleaſure and Delight we took in them; Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
therefore is, 1. The turning away our Hearts and
Affections from every thing that hinders the Love of God.
<hi>Love not the World,</hi> &amp;c. 2. And in order to this, the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Occaſions that may foſter the Love of other
things, and continually ſtriving againſt and doing Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to Self-love, Self-will, and Corrupt Nature. <hi>He that
will come after me,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>let him deny himſelf.</hi>
And, 3. The embracing willingly the Anguiſh, Bitterneſs,
and Pains, the Afflictions both inward and outward, that
muſt be endured for the purifying of our Hearts, and
bringing us to the Love of God; <hi>and let him take up his
Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6.<note place="margin">Renouv. de l'Eſpr. Ev. Pref. n. 52.</note> Jeſus Chriſt has taught us how to undergo this Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
by his Doctrine, and by his Example; <hi>and follow
me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:94808:55"/>
7. It is moſt unreaſonable to think that we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
from this Penitence, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt did thus
live and ſuffer for us; for we muſt <hi>have the Spirit of Chriſt;
our Old Man muſt be crucified with him; we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to his Image; we muſt ſuffer with him, if we would
reign with him.</hi> His was meritorious, and expiatory, and
exemplary; ours is abſolutely neceſſary for our Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
By his he obtain'd Pardon and Grace for us, and
chang'd the Eternal Puniſhment we deſerved,<note place="margin">Ibid. n. 35.</note> into a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Penitence for our Purification and Recovery; and
to ſay we cannot undergo this Penitence, is to have no
Faith in his Merits; to believe that it is enough that he did
undergo this for us, is the greateſt Indignity done him,
and the greateſt Cheat that we can put upon our Souls; it
is to belie, and be falſe to our Surety and our Pledge: It
is like Bankrupts to ſwagger and rant it out with our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor's
Goods; becauſe our Surety has paid the Debt for
us: It is to make Jeſus our Slave to ſuffer all manner of
Afflictions, Poverty, Reproach, and Pain for us, that we
may go to Heaven in the pleaſant and broad Way of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
Wealth, and Pleaſures: It is to be well pleas'd that
the Phyſician has provided wholſome and neceſſary Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
for our Recovery, and has taken it himſelf for our
Direction and Encouragement; but tho' we be ſick to
Death we will not taſte it our ſelves, becauſe of the Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
of it, believing that we ſhall Recover nevertheleſs,
becauſe the Phyſician has taken it. Jeſus Chriſt led this
Life of Penitence for us in his viſible and mortal Body,
that he might ſhew us how ready he is ſtill to undergo it
in every one of us by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>8. God has no need of this our Penitence,<note place="margin">Renouv. de l' Eſp. Evang. avant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop. n. 34, 35.</note> but we ſtand
in need of it to recover the <hi>Love of God.</hi> He does not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
our Wealth, or Honours, or Friends, or Eaſe, in that
he requires of us to be poor in Spirit, to deny our ſelves,
to take up our Croſs and follow Chriſt, to forſake all things,
ſince he created all things for Man, and would be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
he could enjoy them ſtill. But Man is become ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
that he cannot enjoy theſe things without ſetting
his Heart upon them and turning it away from God; and
therefore Jeſus Chriſt has given this his Goſpel-Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which no body can recover the Love of God. It is a
ſad Miſtake then to think that there is no neceſſity of good
Works, but only by way of Gratitude and Thankfulneſs
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94808:56"/>
to God, as if he had need of our Acknowledgments, or as
if we could make him Preſents of our Good Works to
thank him; which cannot be ſaid but in Contempt of the
Riches of God, who poſſeſſes all in himſelf and ſeeks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without himſelf, and needs not that we ſhould give
him any thing; all the good Works that Men can do, are
for no other End but to reſiſt and overcome the Evils of
their Corruption. And they are as neceſſary for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
as Bread is for the Life of the Body; for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaved without ſubduing our Corruption, and no
Body can do this but by the means of ſuch good Works,
and ſuch Penitence as ſtifles and mortifies the Vices and Sins
which this Corruption has brought into the Soul.</p>
               <p>9. It is a Pride to glory in our Penitence,<note place="margin">Le Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moign. de Verite. p. 1. n. 107</note> ſince it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
us for our Sins; it ought rather to fill us with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Confuſion; for in the Beginning it was not ſo.
God created us to live in all ſorts of Delights without any
Pain. All this beautiful World was created to ſerve for
Pleaſures to the Body of Man, and God himſelf was the
Delight of his Soul. But Sin only has changed that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Order, and made Man ſubject to that over which he
ought to rule, becauſe he had withdrawn his Subjection
from God. Our Sins have occaſioned the Law of Penitence,
which Jeſus Chriſt came to teach us by Word and Deed.
This Penitence does not conſiſt in Undergoing Pennances
choſen by our ſelves and after our Fancy,<note place="margin">Light of the World part 2. conf. 11.</note> by which the
Devil would drive us headlong and excite us to Vain-glory,
and which uſually make Men preſumptuous, believing
themſelves to be better than others, and that God is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to them for their good Works, as the Phariſee. All
this proceeds from Self-love; but true Penitence conſiſts in
taking patiently whatſoever God permits to befall us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to our Body, Eſtate, or Mind, and willingly to ſuffer
it in the Spirit of Penitence to ſatisfie for our Sins; for
every Moment there falls out Occaſions of Suffering and
and Submiſſion, ſo that we need not ſeek for them. It is
neceſſary that we practiſe this <hi>Reſignation</hi> of our Will to
God, for accompliſhing the ſaving Penitence which he has
enjoined us, and for the Exerciſe of all ſort of Vertues.</p>
               <p>10.<note place="margin">Renouv. de l' Eſpr. Ev. p. 2. n. 105, 106</note> Since then the Juſtice of God could not permit that
Pardon and Grace ſhould be given to ſinful Man, but upon
Condition that he turn away from Sin to God, and in order
to that live a Life of Penitence, and co-operate with the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94808:56"/>
Spirit of Suffering, Self-denial and Mortification, which
God will communicate to him if he ſincerely deſire to be
ſaved; it is neceſſary that Man <hi>ſatisfie</hi> this Duty which is
ſo <hi>juſt</hi> before God, and which the Juſtice of God requires,
as well as the Nature of the thing it ſelf. This is that which
ſhe calls <hi>Man's Satisfying God's Juſtice</hi> on his Part; this is
that from which the <hi>Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
us a Diſpenſation, for then he had neither been juſt to
God nor us; but he merited the Acceptance of it at God's
Hands, and Grace and Strength for us to perform it, and
taught us how to undergo it. If People are nice and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and will needs carp at Words and Expreſſions, as
<hi>Satisfaction and the Satisfying the Juſtice of God,</hi> while they
underſtand what is meant by them, no body will contend
with them about them provided they grant the Truth and
Reality of the thing; that no body will be ſaved by the
Merits and Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, without the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of their corrupt Nature and the Recovery of the
Love of God.</p>
               <p>It is good Conſideration which is now generally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,<note place="margin">Et eſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiae Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritudo cum Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis Gratia concordans, ut quoniam bonorum inferiorum dulcedine decepti ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritudine paenarum crudiamur. <hi>S.</hi> Aug. <hi>de Vera Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig. c.</hi> 15.</note>
why God thought not fit as Governour of the
World to pardon Rebellious Man without the Intervention
of an expiatory Sacrifice in the Life and Death of Jeſus
Chriſt, that Men might thereby ſee the Evil of Sin, and
God's infinite Hatred and Abhorrence of it, and ſo might
be diverted from continuing in it or returning to it. It is
for the very ſame Reaſon, that God thought not fit to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
Man for the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, unleſs he alſo
follow him in a Life of Penitence and Sufferings; for we
are not ſo ſenſible of what others ſuffer, neither does it
breed in us ſuch an Abhorrence of that which has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
their Sufferings, as when we ſuffer the like Pains
and Evils our ſelves, without which we have as ſuperficial a
Senſe of them as of the Actings on a Theatre. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to give us the more lively Senſe of the Sufferings of
Jeſus Chriſt, and to enflame our Love to him, and to work
in us the greater Deteſtation of Sin and of our corrupt
Nature, God thinks fit that we ſhould feel in our Souls
the Evil and the Bitterneſs of Forſaking him, without
which they can never be purified nor come to ſee God.</p>
               <p>IX.<note place="margin">IX. Of a State of Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after this Life.</note> There is another Prejudice which has ſome Affinity
to this, and which the generality of Proteſtants are prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
with, and that is becauſe ſhe affirms that there is a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94808:57"/>
State of Purification after this Life for ſuch Souls as are
truly converted unto God, and yet are not wholly purified
from their Corruption, and ſo are not immediately capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of enjoying God. All corrupt Doctrine has generally
ſome Fond of Truth, with which they mingle many other
things that tend to promote Men's worldly Intereſts; the
Wealth of the Clergy, and the Dependance of the People.
Thus in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they have founded a Purgatory
in a Place near to Hell, where Souls are tormented by a
material Fire, from whence they are delivered by ſome
Soul-Maſſes, ſome ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, the dying in a
Cordelier's Habit, and a thouſand Fopperies of this Nature.
But that Souls which die truly converted unto God, and
yet have not attained to ſuch a State of Purity as to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of enjoying him,<note place="margin">L'Eroile du Matin. Let. 25, 26. Le Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moign. de Verite. p 1. n. 53, 66.</note> ſhall undergo a State of Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before they can ſee God, is more than probable. The
Sum of her Sentiments as to this are, 1. That is evident,
none can enjoy God who are not in a State of ſo perfect
Purity, that there remains in them no Degree of Corruption
neither Actual nor Habitual. For <hi>no unclean thing can
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: There is no Fellowſhip
between Light and Darkneſs:</hi> And they are only <hi>the pure
in Heart who ſhall ſee God.</hi> 2. It is certain that they
who are truly converted unto God, are in a State of Grace
and Salvation, tho' Sin be yet in him, and the Old <hi>Adam</hi>
is not yet dead. If a Perſon full of Sins and evil Habits be
in his Heart and Deſires truly turned unto God, he receives
him into his Grace, tho' his habitual Sins are not yet rooted
out; much more him who is greatly advanced in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of his corrupt Nature, but has not yet attained
to a State of perfect Purity. 3. It is as certain that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
and Regeneration are not one and the ſame thing.
The firſt being the turning away from Evil to Good, from
Sin to God; the ſecond being the Renovation of the
whole Man after the Image of God, a Creature altogether
new, whoſe Will is wholly reſigned to God, who lives no
longer but Chriſt lives in it. 4. It is in Grace and ſpiritual
things as it is in Nature and bodily things: All things ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to their Perfection by Degrees, and not in an Inſtant.
God does all things in Order, in Number, Weight and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and conformably to the Nature of the Beings he has
formed. We are firſt Children before we are Men, and we
advance by Degrees to the Stature and Wiſdom of Men,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94808:57"/>
and put away Childiſh Things. But if the Child come
forth of the Womb void of the bodily Life, it remains ſo
ſtill. We are told of Children, and Youth, and Men in
Chriſt Jeſus, and we muſt not think that all theſe States
are attain'd to in an Inſtant in the ſpiritual Life no more
than in the bodily. 5. It cannot be denied but that many
who are ſaved do go out of this World truly converted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, but yet not throughly renewed and purified; and
as, on the one hand, God will not reject and caſt away
ſuch Souls as ſeek him with all their Heart; ſo on the other
hand in this State of Impurity they are not capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
him: And therefore God in his infinite Goodneſs,
Truth, and Righteouſneſs, will place them in ſuch a State
as whereby all their evil Habits may be wholly rooted out,
all their Corruption ſubdued, all their Filthineſs cleanſed,
and they purified as God is pure 6. This ſo great and ſo
extraordinary a Change cannot be ſuppoſed to be wrought
in an Inſtant, nor yet without moſt ſenſible Pain and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to the Soul in whom this Change is wrought. The
Soul is of a moſt ſenſible Nature, and when freed of this
mortal Body that ſtupifies it, its Senſibilities muſt be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more lively and piercing; and therefore the Sentiment
of being deprived of the glorious Preſence of God which it
ardently thirſts after, and of having within it Diſpoſitions
repugnant to this Enjoyment, which a Ray from God
manifeſts it to, cannot but give it unſpeakable Pain and
Anguiſh. We ſee here no ſenſible Being that is in Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
can be reſtored to its right State without Pain and
Trouble; a broken Leg, a disjointed Member, a Part of
the Body ulcer'd, corrupt Humours, cannot be rectified
without Pain and Trouble. It all the Parts and all the
Members of a Body were diſlocated, corrupted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered,
the Pain and Trouble that would be felt in the
reſtoring of that Body would be unſpeakably greater. All
this is but a faint Image of the State of the Soul; all its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
are more corrupted and diſordered than it is poſſible
for the Body to be; the Reſtitution of which by the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Divine Grace cannot be perform'd even in this
State of Stupidity without much Pain and Anguiſh, but
after this Life when the Soul is fully awakened, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Divine Grace to undergo this Change, but
with Dolours beyond Compariſon greater. No living
thing can paſs from one State to another without great
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94808:58"/>
Senſibility, can enter into a new Element, unto which it is
not entirely conformable, without ſuffering its Impreſſions
with Pain; weak and ſickly Eyes cannot endure great
Light without Pain, nor a weak Body ſtrong Nouriſhment
without Trouble. So a Soul falling into the Element of

ſenſible and dolorous Sentiments, till by the Force and
Continuance of theſe Impreſſions they have baniſh'd out
all that is contrary to his Divine Light and Love, which
then transforms the Soul wholly into its own Nature. It
is unreaſonable to oppoſe that Paſſage of Scripture, <hi>that the
Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth from all Sins;</hi> for the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it is not, that becauſe Jeſus Chriſt has ſhed his
Blood, we ought to be cleanſed from our Sins without
Mortifications and ſufferings, but the quite contrary; for
the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt is the Grace that he has merited
by his Blood; whereby we may be purified from our Sins
by Sufferings, and by a Conformity to his Sorrows and
Death: And when this is not fully done here, it continues
to be done in the other Life, as the Soul is capable to admit
it, and its Indiſpoſition requires.</p>
               <p>This is a Doctrine very agreeable to the Tenour of the
Holy Scriptures, which tell us, that God will render to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man according to his Works; that no unclean thing can
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; that only the pure in
Heart only ſhall ſee God. The Sence of it ſeems to be
imprinted in the Spirits of all Men, from the Sence they
have of the Purity and Righteouſneſs of God and their
Conſciouſneſs of their own Impurity. The <hi>Heathens,
Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have been perſwaded of it,
thoſe of the Antient Church both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> It is a
Doctrine that moſt powerfully engages to lead a Life of
Penitence here, in which the Anguiſh and Pain of Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is far leſs ſenſible, and whereby a Soul may ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
new Graces and Capacities of Attaining to a higher
Degree of Glory; whereas the Sufferings of Purification
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94808:58"/>
after Death are unſpeakably more ſenſible, and the Soul
is not capable of advancing to a higher State. It affords
alſo great Conſolation to truly ſincere and pious Souls who
ſeek God unfeignedly, but are ſenſible of the greatneſs of
their Corruption, to know that God will not caſt them
off, nor deny them his purifying Grace here and hereafter,
till he have made them fit Temples for himſelf to dwell
in; and will ſtill ſo ſupport them in the moſt dolorous
Purification, with a full Acquieſcence in his righteous Will,
that they would not deſire that it were otherwiſe, but
will ſay with <hi>Job, Tho' he ſlay me, yet will I trust in
him.</hi> I ſhall conclude this with a Paſſage of the moſt

God did certainly create all Men for Salvation, and none
for Damnation: That God being infinitely Good without
any mixture of Evil, and his Nature Love, nothing can
come from him but what is Good; but if he had created
a Maſs of abſolutely reprobated, he would have made Evil
things: That Predeſtination to Damnation could not come
from God, ſince the Damnation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul is the greateſt
Evil in the World; that this had been to give them occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to curſe him to all Eternity, looking on him as very
unjuſt toward them, for having predeſtinated them for
Damnation before they had received a Being, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
merited or demerited any thing: That in Truth and
Juſtice ſuch might have ſaid,<note place="margin">Tomb. de la fauſſ. Theol. Part 2. Let. 3. L'Acad. des ſcav. Theoi. p. 1. ch. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Why didſt thou not leave me
into nothing, rather than to have created me for an eternal
Damnation? What had I done before I had a Being to render
me thus Miſerable? For it had been far better I had never
been created, than to have created me only for Damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How cruel is it to hear that God ſhould predeſtinate a
Maſs of Reprobates! This is to proclaim God wicked in
the Creation of Man! For elſe he would not have created
a Maſs of Reprobates to be Miſerable to all Eternity, do
what they will; he could not create them for Damnation,
but out of pure Malice! A greater Blaſphemy cannot be
uttered againſt God than this! For it ſhocks all his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, and Truth, without
which he can never do any thing. If he had created one
part of Men for Damnation, he ſhould not have done a juſt
thing; ſince thoſe Reproabates did not merit Damnation
before they had a Being, and could not in Juſtice be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
without having deſerved it: Neither could he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
his Goodneſs in decreeing the Damnation of any thing;
ſince this Damnation is the greateſt Evil in the World.
And how ſhould he be true in reprobating thoſe of whom
he ſays, that <hi>his Delight is to be with them,</hi> ſince they are
<hi>the Children of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is inconſiſtent with the original Deſign of creating
Man,<note place="margin">Le Nouv. Ciel. p. 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and the manner of his Formation. He made him to
take his Delight with him; and that Man might love and
enjoy his God, he form'd him for that End after his own
Image. He created one Man only, and in him all Men.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94808:59"/>
Would he predeſtinate to Damnation a Creature whom
he made to take his Delight with him,<note place="margin">Le Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moign. de Verite. Part 1. n. 22, 56, 67, 109.</note> before he had a
Being, whom he endued with ſuch wonderful Perfections?
Was this only to damn him the more profoundly? Were
not all Men created in one Man for Grace and Salvation?
He took not two Maſſes of Earth, to create the one of them
for Salvation, and the other for Damnation; but one Maſs
only, with which he created one Man only for Salvation,
creating in him all the Men that ever were or ſhall be; he
created them all in general in the State of Innocence and
Salvation, and for this End gave abundance of Graces both
bodily and ſpiritual, and that equally to all, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of any, giving to all a Divine Soul and Free-will,
that they might be capable of all manner of Good. And
ſeeing he thus created all Men in <hi>Adam,</hi> he could not have
created any for Reprobation, but all for Salvation.</p>
               <p>Is it not to aſcribe vitious Paſſion to God,<note place="margin">Light of the world Part 3. Conf. 22.</note> to ſay that
he reprobated Man becauſe of the foreſight of the Sins
which he would commit after his Creation; and that he
predeſtinated him to Salvation, foreſeeing his future Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?
Had God need of Man's Merits to ſave him? Can all
Men together with all their Merits bring one Ray of Glory
to God? Is not this to go over to their ſide, who ſay, that
Men ſhall be elected and ſaved by their good Works, and
not by Grace only; in which they make God a Liar, who
has promiſed (as they grant) that he will ſave us by
Grace?</p>
               <p>To ſay that God did not create Man for Damnation,
but reprobated Man after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, which had undone
them all, is moſt abſurd. For as all Men were created in
<hi>Adam,</hi> ſo they were alſo all alike fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> and all in
general reprobated by the ſame Sin of <hi>Adam;</hi> for he could
not have a divided Will, one part of it ſound, and another
damn'd; there being but one Man only, and he had but
one Will, in which was included the Will of all Men that
ſhould ever ariſe from him. And if God had left <hi>Adam</hi>
in the reprobated State wherein he fell, all Men had equally
remained ſo. And when <hi>Adam</hi> received the Pardon of his
Sin, and was admitted to Penitence, all Men were ſtill in
him, and conſequently all were reſtored to Favour, upon
Condition of performing the Penitence that God enjoyn'd
in <hi>Adam.</hi> So that God could not leave one part of Men in
the Curſe, without dividing <hi>Adam,</hi> and appointing one
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94808:60"/>
part of his Body for Salvation, and another for Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſince there was but one Man. If there had been
two, it might have been ſaid of Men, what is ſaid of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
that one part of the Angels was damn'd, and another
confirm'd in Grace; but that of one Soul and one Body
there ſhould proceed reprobated and ſaved by the Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of God, this is odious.</p>
               <p>They who ſay that God did not predeſtinate to Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but only left one part of Men who were in <hi>Adam</hi> in
Damnation, and did elect another part to Salvation, do
directly contradict the Scriptures; for the Scripture ſays
expreſly, that <hi>with God there is no reſpect of Perſons.</hi> How
could he then predeſtinate one part of Men to Salvation, and
leave the other part into the Damnation into which they
were all equally plung'd; ſince all had equally ſinn'd in
<hi>Adam,</hi> and one no more than another? How then can it be
that God, who is no Reſpecter of Perſons, can damn one
part and ſave another, of the ſame Maſs of Perſons, (which
have equally contracted the, ſame Sin) without Injuſtice,
which cannot be in God? And tho' he be almighty to ſave
one and damn another, as thoſe Caſuiſts ſay, yet he will
never do it, for he will never do any Injuſtice; For my part,
<hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> I would not commit the leaſt Injuſtice againſt
my Enemies, not againſt the Devil himſelf. How much
leſs would God, who is incomprehenſibly more Juſt than
I, do ſuch an Injuſtice as to damn one and ſave another of
the Perſons who have committed the ſame Fault, even
tho it were in his Power.</p>
               <p>They ſay, may not a Man do with his own Goods what
he will? how much more may God diſpoſe of Man as he
pleaſes, who abſolutely belongs to him! and none can ask
him, why he ſaves one and lets another periſh. This, <hi>ſays
ſhe,</hi> ſeems a weak Argument even in the Compariſon; for
it is not true that a Man can do with his Goods what he
pleaſes, he ought to uſe them according to Juſtice and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and if he do otherwiſe, he will bear his Puniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, who will not ſuffer Injuſtice, nor us to abuſe our
Goods without calling us to an Account at the Day of
Judgment. How much more will God diſpoſe of Men
juſtly, even tho' they belong to him? How much leſs can
he commit this Injuſtice of damning one and ſaving ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thoſe who have fallen into the ſame Fault, and are
equally Guilty? It is true God is Almighty, and can do
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94808:60"/>
what he will, but he can never will to do any thing unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as this would be, which could not be without reſpect
of Perſons, and this cannot be in God.</p>
               <p>To ſay that he expreſly predeſtinated one part of them
to Damnation, is to ſay that he had not ſo much Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
in himſelf, as that which he requires of Men; for
he ſays to them, <hi>Love your Enemies, do good to them that hate
you.</hi> This Counſel would have had no Authority, if he
himſelf had reprobated thoſe who are become his Enemies.
This abſolute Reprobation would not be Good, but the
greateſt Evil that could be imagin'd. How could he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Men to do Good to their Enemies, when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
would do ſo great and eternal an Evil, for the Fault
they had committed againſt him, and that while they were
yet in a State of Penitence, as they are during this Life,
where Reprobation ſhall never have place, ſince till the very
laſt Inſtant they may find Mercy and Pardon. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
can only have place after Death, and not during
this Life. Becauſe this is the Time of Penitence, in which,
if Men were certainly reprobated, they could have no part;
and it would be a very rigorous and unjuſt thing to oblige
thoſe to Penitence whom he abſolutely reſolves to damn.
Men it ſeems confound the Times when they ſpeak of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,
and take the preſent for the time to come. For at
the Judgment God will ſeparate two maſſes, the one of Elect,
the other of Reprobates, who ſhall then aſſuredly be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
becauſe the Time of Penitence will then be paſt; but
during this Life there can be no predeſtinated Reprobates.</p>
               <p>If God has reprobated the Wicked to Damnation, he
would not give them ſo many ſecret and inward Warnings
to turn them unto him; as all Sinners may know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that even when by Sin they have turn'd away from
God, they feel how oft he recals them by many Occaſions,
and by Checks of Conſcience. All the Souls who are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
have been often admoniſhed by God both inwardly
and outwardly; as may be ſeen in the Holy Scriptures.
How often did he admoniſh <hi>Pharoah</hi> and other wicked
Men? If it were true that God had reprobated them, he
would not have been ſincere in giving them ſo many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
to turn them from their Wickedneſs, or at leaſt
they were all vain Admonitions, ſince being predeſtinated to
Evil, it was impoſſible for them to do Good. Muſt God
tempt Men, or render them more guilty than otherwiſe
they would have been of themſelves?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:94808:61"/>
God has declared that <hi>as he Lives he has no pleaſure in the
Death of the Wicked, but that the wicked Man turn from
his way and live;</hi> and <hi>that he is not willing that any ſhould
Periſh.</hi> God then ſhould not be ſincere in his words, if
he had predeſtinated ſome Souls to Damnation; which
cannot be ſaid of God who is Truth it ſelf, always faithful
in his Promiſes; and no ſooner is a Sinner converted, but he
receives him with joy, according to the Parable of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal,
and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>there is Joy in Heaven at the
Converſion of a Sinner, more than over Ninety and Nine
righteous Perſons:</hi> All this ſhews that God is ſo far from
predeſtinating any Soul to Damnation, that even he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
comes to ſeek and to ſave thoſe who would damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as appears by the <hi>Good Shepherd that left his many
Sheep to go and ſeek the One Sheep that had gone aſtray, and
brings it back on his Shoulders with Joy.</hi> After all this, who
can doubt that God has created us all for Salvation, and
none for Damnation, which proceeds only from Mens
Self-will, and not at all from the Predeſtination or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God?</p>
               <p>This Doctrine of Predeſtination to Damnation is, <hi>ſhe
ſays,</hi> a moſt blaſphemous and dangerous Doctrine, robs
God of the Honour due to him, ſhocks all his Attributes
of Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth, renders him very
unlovely to his Creatures; gives thoſe occaſion who think
they are reprobated to ſpend all their Life in blaſpheming
God, for creating them to Damnation for no Fault of
theirs, before they had a Being, and not rather leaving them
into nothing, and diſcourages them from all Endeavours
of becoming better, ſince of neceſſity they muſt be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
however; and it encourages thoſe who think they are
predeſtinated to Salvation to a Libertine kind of Life, ſince
they are perſwaded that notwithſtanding of this they ſhall
be ſaved, and God will ſome time or other bring them to
Repentance.</p>
               <p>It ſeems Men have taken up theſe Sentiments that they
may attribute to God the Cauſe of their Damnation, and
not to themſelves, which is a horrible Pride and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
or to flatter their Wickedneſs in excuſing it by <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Sin, and that they may not fulfill the Penitence that God
has enjoyn'd them by him. And being full of Paſſions
themſelves without Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth,
they would give Authority to their Wickedneſs, by making
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94808:61"/>
a God to go before them, in the matter of their Paſſions.
And as they ſee thoſe who rule over Men do according to
their Inclinations, diſgrace or favour them, ſo they would
make God as partial, ſaying, that he damns ſome, and
ſaves others according to his Pleaſure; which will never be,
for God is no more ſubject to Paſſions than to Change.</p>
               <p>Yet nevertheleſs Men are ready to colour this Doctrine
with Paſſages from the Holy Scripture, eſpecially ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
miſunderſtood in the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The
Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> when he touches this very Subject, and tells
us the reaſon of the Long-ſuffering of God, <hi>becauſe he is
not willing that any ſhould Periſh, but that all ſhould come to
Repentance,</hi> he adduces St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Teſtimony to confirm
the Truth of it, and tells us that he has ſaid the ſame in
his Epiſtles, but withal warns us that there are ſome things
in them hard to be underſtood, which the Unſtable wreſt
to their own Deſtruction, pointing out it ſeems to this
very Subject. The neceſſary Duties of Chriſtianity are
plainly ſet down in the Holy Scriptures, and other things
cannot be well underſtood but by the ſame Spirit that endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them; and the Rule already mention'd for interpreting
the Holy Scripture may be of great uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That we ſo
interpret it as may conſiſt with the known Perfections of
the Divine Nature, and may lead us to the Love of God,
and to a ſence of our own Nothingneſs; and if there be
multitudes of Places of Holy Scripture that do plainly
lead us to this, and ſome few that are apt to be wreſted to
a Sence contrary to all theſe, we ought certainly to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
them by thoſe plain Paſſages of the Holy Scripture,
which do clearly repreſent the Perfections of God. Thus
ſhe inſtanceth in that Expreſſion, Jacob <hi>have I loved, and</hi>
Eſau <hi>have I hated,</hi> and makes appear, that to take it in
the Sence of an irreſpective and abſolute Predeſtination and
Reprobation from all Eternity, is inconſiſtent with the
Nature of God, and the other plain Directions of the
Holy Scripture; which ſhew that God has no reſpect of
Perſons. <hi>She ſays,</hi> That all the things of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are Figures of the New, and that <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi>
are the Figure of a Perſon ſanctified, and of him who
lives according to corrupt Nature; of the Soul that loves
its God, and the Soul that loves it ſelf. This is the <hi>Eſau</hi>
and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which the Scripture underſtands by thoſe Twins
come from One Womb; for all Men who are born ſince
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94808:62"/>
the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> bring with them into the World the good
Spirit of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Evil of <hi>Eſau:</hi> For God gave
<hi>Adam</hi> his good Spirit when he created him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
the Divil by the Conſent of the Will of <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve</hi> produced there his Evil Spirit, ſo that thoſe two
are engendred in the Soul of all Men before they come out
of the Womb: They reſide in the Womb of the Free-will

the Inſtinct which he retain'd from the Corruption of his
Corrupt Nature. So theſe two Spirits live in Men before
they are born, as we ſee the natural Inſtinct of Beaſts as
ſoon as they are form'd, as a Duckling come out of the
Shell can ſwim and duck in the Water without being
taught by its Mother; ſo this Evil Spirit of <hi>Eſau</hi> gives all
Men this natural Inſtinct to Evil, which they ſtill follow
if the Spirit of <hi>Jacob</hi> do not conſtrain them to Good, and
hinder them from Evil. Hence comes the War which
Man feels throughout all his Life, and according to the
Victory ſo is his eternal Lot. This Evil Spirit of <hi>Eſau</hi>
always gets firſt out of the Wombs of our Free-will, which
is rather inclin'd to the things we ſee, than to the Good
that is inviſible; the Pleaſures of our Senſes, rather than
the divine and inward Pleaſures, which we cannot perceive
but at a great Diſtance, and through Darkneſs. This we
cannot hinder till we have attain'd the uſe of Reaſon, when
we ought by all means to labour that the Spirit of <hi>Jacob</hi>

things are true both in the Nature of theſe two Children,

and has ſpar'd no Mean to recover him from it. But Man
has wilfully deſtroyed himſelf.</p>
               <p>God created him out of pure Love to delight himſelf in
him,<note place="margin">Light of the World Part 3. Conf. 2, 21, 22.</note> and therefore to make this Love perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
he created him altogether Free and Perfect. He
would not bound nor limit the Will of Man, whom he
would needs make after his own Likeneſs, to be his Spouſe,
and not his Slave, or conſtrain'd to do his Will, as are all
the other Creatures. But Man was created altogether Free,
as a little God, Sovereign and Ruler over the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and free to uſe them well or ill, as he would.</p>
               <p>If he had received only a limited Will,<note place="margin">Le Nouv. Ciel p. 67. Renouv. de l'Eſpr. Evang<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> avant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop. n. 11. 18, 24, 25, 31.</note> he would have
had no Divine Quality for God to take his Delight with
him; for that two Beings may find Contentment together,
there muſt be a Proportion and Sympathy between them.
God cannot take his Delight with any Creature of a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Will, he himſelf being an infinite God; there muſt be
in Man ſome infinite Quality by which he may unite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to God, and that is an abſolute Liberty of willing, which
nothing can conſtrain. This was the moſt precious thing
that God could give to Man, for by it he was made like to
God; for otherwiſe he ſhould have been a limited Creature
in whom God could not take Pleaſure. Could God take
Delight in a thing ſo unlike himſelf? Could ſo powerful
a God unite himſelf to ſuch an impotent Creature that had
not Free-will to love him? God having no Bounds nor Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
could he take Pleaſure in a Creature whoſe Will was
bounded? And could a limited Will attain to the Love of a
God without Limits? This is the only thing that makes
Man capable of being united to God. We ſee in Nature
the Alliance is not true and agreeable, if two Perſons be
not united in their Wills in God; if there be Force, Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or Conſtraint on either ſide, the Contentment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be compleat. This is the Figure of the perfectly Free
Union that the Soul ought to have with God; and if the
Soul were conſtrain'd or forc'd to this Union, God could
not take perfect Delight in it. Where there is Conſtraint,
there can be no perfect Love; the Free Conſent and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation
of two united muſt neceſſarily concur to make
the Love compleat,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:94808:63"/>
As God gave this Liberty to Man when he created him,
ſo he will never take it from him; for his Deſigns are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable,
all his Works are Eternal, and his Gifts are
without Repentance. Both Devils and Men ſhall have
their Free-will to all Eternity, elſe they could not do Evil,
for God never retracts what he has once given; he will
never retake thoſe Divine Qualities, the Divine Soul and
Eternal Liberty, and cannot bound them, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be changeable in his Gifts, nor can he take away what
he has been pleas'd once to give. If it be eſtabliſh'd among
Men to lay no longer Claim to a thing given, how much
more ought we to hold, that God lays no Claim to the Free-will
of Devils and Men, to whom he voluntarily gave it.
The Devils and demned Souls will never uſe their Liberty
to do well, being ſo habituated to Evil and in the Element
of it; as the Holy Angels and Bleſſed Saints will never uſe
their Liberty to do Evil, it being ſwallowed up in God.</p>
               <p>From hence it is evident, that God did not predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
Man from all Eternity to Good or Evil by any abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Decree; for this is to conſtrain that which he would
have to be Free, to ranverſe the Order he had ſo wiſely
eſtabliſh'd, and to take from man the moſt precious thing
that he gave him. If he had made Man a limited Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he would have predeſtinated all Men to Salvation, ſo
that none of them ſhould have periſhed. For all that God
makes abſolutely dependent on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is always Good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any mixture of Evil; and it can never be that a limited
Creature can do Evil, ſince God can create nothing that is
Evil.</p>
               <p>God endued Man with ſuch an unlimited Free-will,
that he would not only not predetermine him, but alſo
not foreſee how he ſhould diſpoſe of that Free-will, that
he might not thereby limit it, or oblige Man to do what
he had foreſeen. His Power and Wiſdom is as great, (yea
far more conſpicuous) in forming him thus Free, and
letting him fully enjoy the Liberty that he had given
him, than if he had limited him by Fore-ſight and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination.</p>
               <p>God being Almighty can ſave or damn as he pleaſes, and
no body can withſtand him, for all are ſubject to him;
but he neither does, nor ever will do it, but in the Ways
which his powerful Wiſdom and the Love, he has conceived
for Man, have reſolved upon, whom he would needs create
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94808:63"/>
like unto himſelf by the abſolute Free-will he gave him,
and would neither conſtrain him to Good, nor hinder him
from Evil; but would have him his by pure Love, with the
free Conſent of his Will, that he might delight in him, and
Man alſo might voluntarily delight in the Love of his God.
Thus we ſee how Sin came into the World, and how
Man damns himſelf. God neither willed it nor permitted
it, that he might bring Glory to himſelf; (a moſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Sentiment) but, againſt the Will of God, Man abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the moſt precious Gift that could be beſtowed upon
him, his Free-will, and turn'd away his Love from God,
and placed it on himſelf and on the Creature. God does
not permit Man to do Evil, but by all Means reſtrains
him. He permits him only to uſe the Free-will he has given
him; and, having endued him with an immortal Soul, and
an eternal Liberty, he can no more take away this Liberty
without deſtroying his Nature and making him ceaſe to be
Man, than he can make a Circle to be a Square without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
the Nature of a Circle. God, by giving Man Free-will
to make him capable of the greateſt Good, is no more
the Cauſe of Man's Sin and Reprobation, than a Cutler
would be the Cauſe of a Lord's murthering of his Brother,
becauſe it was done with a Weapon which he had made
for him of well-temper'd Steel, of a ſharp Edge, and for
good Uſes. It would be a cruel Malice to accuſe the Cutler
of the Murther; the Malice is infinitely greater to ſay, that
God created us for Damnation, or is the Cauſe of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he has given us Free-will.</p>

where theſe are entire, who is the Giver of them but
God the Giver of all Good. Wherefore as you approve
of thoſe in the Body, and without regarding thoſe that
miſuſe them, give Praiſe to God that gave them: So it is
neceſſary that the Free-will, without which no one can
order his Life aright, muſt be both Good and alſo the

how God gives his Grace to Man, and how he muſt
co-operate therewith, we need but conſider the Order
that he has placed in Nature as to the human Body. It is
he who forms it independantly from the Creatures; ſo that
Parents cannot add one Hair to the Head of their Infant.
Yet he brings no Men into the World but by the Co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

one in Chriſt Jeſus, for the Forming of the Holy Church.
God might have created all Men of the Duſt of the Earth
as he did <hi>Adam,</hi> or made them generate as Fiſhes; but he
wills this Conjugal Co-operation, to maintain his Charity
among his Creatures, and produces no Men by any other
Way, tho' he be Almighty. Even ſo he gives his Grace to

<hi>that Man can do Good of himſelf.</hi> Theſe are Sayings as

attribute to Man the Power of doing Good, without being
prevented by his Grace, is a Pride ſurpaſſing that of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer,</hi>
who would only equal himſelf to God; whereas
Man who would do Good of himſelf, preferrs himſelf
to him, and will not take him for the Co-operator of
his Good, but will aſſume the Power of doing it by
himſelf.</p>
               <p>That we may conceive how all Good comes from God,
and that Man can do no good of himſelf, we are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that Man being created to enjoy God, and to enjoy all
his Works, is made up of many ſeveral Faculties, Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or Veſſels, as it were, fitted for receiving and being
filled with their reſpective Goods from God and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and is endued with a Free-will, whereby he may
turn theſe Faculties to their reſpective Objects, or turn
them away from them as he pleaſes. We may conceive
this as to ſpiritual things, by conſidering the Caſe as to
bodily things. Thus his Eyes are formed to receive the
Light and all the Objects which it preſents. The Light
ſurrounds him, he opens his Eyes and receives it; or he ſhuts
them, and keeps it out, and walks in Darkneſs; or he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſes
himſelf with a thick Wall that he may not behold
the Light; or he does that which makes them blind, and ſo
his Darkneſs comprehends it not. Has he reaſon to boaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
becauſe he opens his Eyes and beholds the Light as if he
were the Author of it, or had given himſelf the Power to
behold it; or to accuſe the Light, when he ſhuts his Eyes
againſt it, or makes himſelf Blind. The Delight and
Good he receives is not from himſelf, but from the Light,
nor yet the Power of beholding it; and the Evil or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of it is purely owing to himſelf. Even ſo God's
Delight is with the Soul, as the Light is to ſhine into the
Eyes, if it turn to him he fills it with Good; if it turn away
from him, it is all Miſery and Darkneſs.</p>

himſelf ſince he was corrupted by Sin,<note place="margin">Academ. Theol. p. 1. c. 1.</note> as well as when he

Grace alone that works in us all our good Works and our
Salvation: For Man has nothing of himſelf but the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to adhere to Good, which he received at his Creation,
and which will never be taken from him. Yet this Grace is
not ſufficient to work out his Salvation, if God do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually

                  <note place="margin">Acad. de Theol. p. 1. c. 1, 2.</note> They do not know the Love that God
has for Man, who ſay that <hi>their Reprobation proceeds from
the Want of his Grace;</hi> for it is never wanting on God's
Part, even towards the moſt Wicked, and if it do not
produce its Operations, it is becauſe the Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Man reſiſts it: Even as the Sun by his Nature
darts his Rays as brightly on the Dunghil as on a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
yet the one receives more Splendour than the other,
becauſe of the Difference of the Objects which receive
them; the ſame Sun makes the Dunghil to ſtink and the
Diamond to ſparkle, yet he gives no more of himſelf to
the one than the other.</p>
               <p>The Property of God is to give continually new Grace
to Man, to the Sinner and to the Juſt; yet if it do not
operate on the Wicked, his Sin hinders it; the ſame Grace
that makes the Juſt to ſhine, makes the Wicked more fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
he making Uſe of it to ſin the more. It is impoſſible
for him to perceive this, becauſe of the Oppoſition which
his Sin makes, rendring him inſenſible of it, even as a thick
Cloud before the Sun will neither let us ſee his Light nor
feel his Heat. The Sun never ceaſes to ſhine and give heat
in all Seaſons; and God does not ceaſe always to give his
Grace, but our Oppoſition hinders the Operations and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it in our Soul, purely thro' our own Fault; for if
we were faithful in little things he would place us over great
things.</p>
               <p>He created <hi>Adam</hi> in a Grace as bright as the Sun at Noon-Day;
his Soul beheld and taſted his God. But after that,
by his Rebellion he oppoſed his Will, this Sin ſet it ſelf
againſt the Grace of God, as a thick Wall before the Sun,
which hindred the Seeing and Feeling its favourable Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
God did not ceaſe to give his Grace to <hi>Adam</hi> after
this Sin as before; but the Wall that this Sin had built up
between God and him, keeps him from ſeeing God any
more, or receiving his Grace to operate as before.</p>
               <p>So long as this Sin is between God and our Soul, its Eyes
are blinded, and its Underſtanding darkned as to Good, and
it knows not whither it goes; and therefore it was ſaid,
<hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> after he had ſinned: For having loſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94808:66"/>
the Light of Grace, no body knows where he is, nor can
find the Way to recover it; tho' Grace is not wanting on
God's part, no more than the Sun is wanting in Light, tho'
he who has a thick Wall between him and it has no more
Benefit than if it did not ſhine.</p>
               <p>It is only by the help of a Candle that he can diſcern the
Objects that are about him; ſo it is only ſenſible Lights
and Grace, ſuch as are to be perceived by the Senſes, that
can make him diſcern inward Good; his Heart is ſo fix'd
to the Earth by his Sin, that he cannot perceive Divine
things but by the help of Material ones. And if his Free-will
do not chooſe the Good which he may know by this
Mean, he can never work out his Salvation.—Thus the
Sinner has always ſome ſenſible Grace ſufficient to raiſe him
again, as Diſpleaſure for his Sin, the Diſquiet it brings,
Remorſe of Conſcience, or the Fear of his Damnation;
which are ſo many ſenſible Graces that God gives him,
whereby to call him back again, making him ſee as it were
by the help of a Candle, the Miſeries that his Sin has
brought upon him, with a deſire to riſe again, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſenſible Graces are more than ſufficient to work
out Man's Salvation after a great many Sins, provided his
Free-will be effectualy reſolved to deteſt and abandon
his Sins with a ſtrong Reſiſtance, which breaks down at
leaſt ſome Stones of the Wall that is oppos'd to Grace;
that he may perceive as it were by a chink, ſome ſmall Ray
of that enlightning and warming Grace loſt by Sin, which
will give him new force to break down more and more of
this Oppoſition to Grace, if ſo be the Soul be faithful and
force it ſelf according as the Light manifeſts it ſelf. It is
thus, that <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers Violence, and that
the Violent take it by force;</hi> for if the Will do not Violence
to it ſelf, to forſake its Sins, when Reaſon makes it ſee the
Evil they bring, and it feels Vexation of Spirit, with the
fear of Damnation, (all which are ſenſible Graces which
Sin never deprives him of; no more than of his Free will
to effectuate this Deſire of getting out of his miſerable
State: Unleſs his rebellious Will do yet reſiſt theſe ſenſible
Graces, and wilfully ſtifle thoſe Trouble and Fears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it loves the Pleaſure of its Sin, more than the Love
of its God, this will harden the Heart, and ſo thicken the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94808:67"/>
Wall of Oppoſition to Grace, making it at laſt uncapable
of being ſaved.</p>
               <p>It is certain God cannot reprobrate any Man without
ceaſing to be the Fountain of all Good, and Man cannot
ſave himſelf, ſince he is a Nothing who can do Nothing.
His Salvation can never come from himſelf, no more than
his Damnation can come from God; for he created all
Men for Salvation, and none of them ſhall periſh for want
of his Grace, who never fails to give to every one what is
neceſſary for his Salvation.</p>
               <p>It is true, he ſometimes makes particular Elections, as
of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> for the Mother of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> for his Diſciple, and ſome others; but
he does not encreaſe his Grace to them, but according to
their Co-operation with the Firſt, with which they ſtrive
to reſiſt vicious Inclinations, and to break the Wall of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to Grace, that they may receive inward Light in
greater Abundance, which comes into their Souls from the
Abundance of his Grace, ſo that they can no longer reſiſt
it; for their Sins being removed, Grace has its full Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
dilating it ſelf into all the parts of the Soul, and
there it conſumes all that is Imperfect, yea, the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to Evil; ſo that Grace dwells and rules in all the
Faculties of the Soul without any Impediment, and at
laſt deifies it, by yielding up entirely its Free-will unto the
full Power and Liberty of its God who gave it.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Souls whom I call <hi>the Elect of God,</hi> becauſe
they can no more periſh; and thoſe whom I call <hi>the Elect
who have choſen to follow God by the help of his Grace,</hi> are
all others who have choſen to follow Good and to forſake
Evil. Theſe laſt may periſh, not having entirely reſign'd
their Free-will into the hands of God, nor broken down
the Wall of Sins which reſiſt his Grace; but they abide in
the Poſſeſſion of this Free-will, which ſometimes enclines
them to Good, oft-times to Evil, co-operating ſometimes
with Grace, and falling alſo ſometimes into Sin, from
whence they ariſe again by the effort they make to break
down that Wall of Sin, which they know to be oppoſite to
Grace, by the Diſquiet it brings into the Soul, by checks
of Conſcience, and at other times by the Attractions they
have to Good, and the fear of Damnation, which are ſo
many Evidences that they have choſen to follow God by
his Grace, for if this Grace were not, they would not feel
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94808:67"/>
Remorſe of Conſcience, nor a deſire to return to God after
their Sin. They are therefore Elect, not that they have
elected themſelves, for they could not have choſen God
before they had a Being; but God who always was, may
have elected them from all Eternity, ſince all is ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to him, both what is paſt, and what is to come; but
he has choſen them conditionally, in caſe they co-operate
with his Grace, and no otherwiſe; leaving their Free-will
ſtill to act, without which he forces no Body.</p>
               <p>But when he has re-taken the Free-will which thoſe
firſt Elect would yield up to him, then he conſtrains them
by the force of his Love, and of his Grace; ſo that they
can no more forſake him: This is not of themſelves, but
by the force of his Love, which he manifeſts to them;
binding them to himſelf by an inſeparable Bond of mutual
Love; ſo that the Soul becomes ſo united to him, that it
can no more forſake God than he can forſake it without
Infidelity, which can never be in God, nor yet the want
of his Grace. And if a Soul ſin after having received
much Grace from God, (as it ſometimes falls out) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it has not effectually yielded up its Free-will unto
its God, but only us'd it ſelf to co-operate with his Grace,
to which if it abide faithful, it aſſuredly works out its Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
which it has choſen to do by theſe Graces; but if
it come in the End to reſiſt them, it may periſh, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of much Grace received: For this Election is
not Abſolute, but Conditional.</p>
               <p>How many great Saints have attain'd to great Perfection,
with this Election of obeying God, by the help of his
Grace? Having co-operated with the Talents which they
have received and gained by them, God has at laſt ſet them
over all his Goods; as he has promis'd in his Goſpel to the
Faithful, and from the Unfaithful he cauſes to take the
Talent to give it to him who will put it to Profit. This
falls out daily as to our Souls. He aſſuredly gives them
his neceſſary Grace, if they correſpond to it, he encreaſes
it; and the more they have, the more they ſhall receive;
their being faithful to one meaſure of Grace procures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
greater, and that infinitely; for the Bounty of God
is great, that he delights continually to give and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
his Gifts. But if the Soul reſiſt the firſt Graces, it
loſes them; and hinders the effect of others which would
have followed, had it not been for this Reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:94808:68"/>
To lay the Blame of this Reſiſtance upon God is a great
Injury done him; ſince he gives liberally without being
oblig'd to it. If he would with-hold the Grace of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating
with it, it were better for him to with-hold
the firſt Grace than to render the ſecond Grace of co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
therewith uſeleſs. God does nothing in vain, if he
give Grace to be ſaved, he gives at the ſame time Grace to
co-operate to this Salvation; and if Man reſiſt this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation,
this is only from his own depraved Will; for
no Body can damn us but our ſelves. It is true, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
may tempt us many ways, but they can never force
our Free-will. Wicked Men may adviſe us to Evil, but
we are ſtill free not to believe or follow them. Nothing
can conſtrain the Free-will that God has given us to chooſe
Good or Evil. We but flatter our ſelves when we ſay or
believe it.</p>
               <p>He flatters himſelf yet more who believes it is for
want of the Grace of God, that he does no Good, and
works not out his Salvation. He deceives himſelf and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
Falſhoods, which he may eaſily diſcover if he will
ſeriouſly examine his own Conſcience, and remark how
oft God has prevented him with his Grace, which he has
reſiſted. How many good Thoughts God has put into
his Mind, which he has rejected? How many ſecret inward
Motions, which he has neglected? How many good Books
and holy Admonitions which might help him to Salvation,
which he has deſpiſed? How many occaſions favourable
for his Salvation, which he has us'd for his Damnation?
So many Proſperities, to make him acknowledge the Love
and Care that God had for him! So many Adverſities to
recal him from his Sin, and to ſet him in the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation!
How many diverſe Accidents have fallen out as to
Neighbours, which have mov'd him to Contrition, as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Deaths, Slaughters, Plagues, Fire, and other things,
which no Man can avoid! Nevertheleſs, all theſe Graces and
Drawings have met with no Correſpondence from Man's
Will, on the contrary they turning away from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
have turn'd to the Creature to love it more than God.
And which is more, they will lay the Blame of all their
Damnation upon him for want of his Grace; a horrible
and inſuppertable Abuſe! That Man is not ſatisfied to
abuſe the Grace of God, but he will alſo make him guilty
of his Damnation. It is an unſpeakable Pride, when we
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94808:68"/>
feel that we reſiſt his Grace every Moment, and yet ſay,
our Damnation comes from the want of this Grace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of giving Sentence againſt our Baſeneſs and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which we may ſo ſenſibly perceive and feel.</p>
               <p>It were better to ſmite the Breaſt and condemn our ſelves,
than to argue about the Grace of God, ſince our own
Conſcience is an irrefragable Witneſs that Grace has been
ſtill given us, yea even in the midſt of our Sins. How
many amorous pulls has God given our Hearts to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
them from Damnation? How many new Graces for
our correſponding with ſome ſmall Grace; always when
we have caſt an Eye to God, and lifted up our Hands, yea
a Finger, has he not drawn us ſtrongly to himſelf and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
our Sins? What Effort did we ever make to reſiſt Sin,
without feeling immediately his Help and his Grace? Who
ever call'd on him without being help'd, or ſought him
without finding him? No Body can ſay it without a Lie,
for he always delights to do us Good. Our Prayers are
agreeable to him, and our Complaints are pleaſant. He
wills not the Death of a Sinner, but that he be converted
and live.</p>
               <p>If we do not always feel the Effects of his Mercy, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our Converſion is not ſincere, and we ſeek ſome other
thing than God; and often think we love him, when we
love our ſelves: And it is no wonder then that we do not
find Grace, for we have nothing and can give nothing
either to our ſelves or others; God, being the only True
Good, and all that is not God is nothing. We are often
ſorry that we have ſinn'd without regarding God, but our
ſelves, conſidering the Sins as Evil or diſagreeable to Men,
and this makes us ſorry to have committed them; on the
other ſide, we look on Vertue as beautiful, pleaſant, and
honourable; this makes us deſire it, for Good is always
Lovely of it ſelf. But in theſe we do not reſpect God, to
oblige him to give us his Grace. It is rather a Self-love
that makes us deſire it. Yet our Wickedneſs has the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to ſay that we ſeek God and do not find him. Is
it a wonder if ſuch a Soul feels not the Influence of his
God, ſo long as it voluntarily Delights in the Creatures in
Contempt of the Creator.</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſs the Reſentment I have that we would
attribute to God the Cauſe of our Damnation, or that it is
for the want of his Grace; ſince I have found that God has
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94808:69"/>
often prevented and recall'd me, even when I would have
forſaken him: And if he had not prevented me, I would
have thruſt my ſelf into all the ways that lead to Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being gone ſo far as to ſay to his inward Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<hi>I will never have pleaſure in thinking always upon this.</hi>
I would have withdrawn from God, and he call'd upon
me again, inwardly to make me remember him; and ſo
ſoon as I return'd to him, he receiv'd me lovingly, giving
me ſtronger Grace to withſtand all that would divert me
from him. All Men will find this, if they would enter
into themſelves, that God has ſtill prevented them with
his Grace, even tho' they have been moſt wicked. Why
then to Men ſay, when they live ill, <hi>That they have not the
Grace of God,</hi> if he never fail to give it? They ought to
ſay, <hi>It is my Fault, for I have certainly reſiſted his Grace,
inſtead of obliging him to give me more by my Correſpondence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true God gives all; the Will to do good, and to be
ſaved comes from him, as alſo the Courage and Conſtancy
to perſevere in it. It is God who does all in us. Sin only
is our Work. All Good comes from God, who is pleas'd
to give it us. If we think we have Good of our ſelves,
we fall yet into a greater Error than the former; for tho'
God ſhould not give us Grace, he is not obliged to it by
us, for he has no need of us: But to ſay that we can do
Good and work out our Salvation of our ſelves, is moſt
falſe. For how can a Nothing do any thing that's Good?
Man in his Nothing was Nothing. If he be ſince Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
it is by the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>He who is all Good, out of whom there is no Good,
will not communicate himſelf to the Soul, but with its
Conſent he firſt ſhews it its Good, he gives it the deſire to
deſire it; thereafter he offers it. If the Soul accepts it,
it enjoys him; if it refuſe it, it remains depriv'd of it.
For God never gives his Graces by force, nor without the
Conſent of the Soul; unleſs it yield up it ſelf entirely unto
him.</p>
               <p>God deals with the Soul as an honeſt Lover who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
to eſpouſe his Miſtreſs; he ſerves her, he courts her,
he careſſes her, and by all means endeavours to gain her
Friendſhip. If his Love be agreeable to her, ſhe loves him
reciprocally, and fully enjoys his Perſon, and all his Goods.
If ſhe diſdain this Love, and all his Offices of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
he withdraws and leaves her, tho' with regret, having
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94808:69"/>
employed in vain to the utmoſt all ſort of means to oblige
her to love him. He endeavours then to forget her, and
to efface her out of his Memory; not that his Love chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or that he is unconſtant on his part; but becauſe there
is no Correſpondence or Agreement on the part of his
Miſtreſs. God loves the Soul as a perfect faithful Lover,
he ſhews her the excellency of his Love, by Rays of inward
Light, which do ſometimes warm the Soul with Love to
him. He excites her by good Motions; he draws her by
ſome ſweet inward Conſolation; he gives her Deſires to
love him; he prevents her with many Favours, ſhewing
her that he ſeeks her and would give himſelf to her by
the Vexations that ſhe meets with in every other thing
that ſhe would love. But if after a long courſe of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Favours, the Soul comes to reject them, and to diſdain
the Friendſhip of her God, to wed her ſelf to ſome other
thing, whether the Love of her ſelf or any Creatures;
God then withdraws from her, and leaves her; not that
on his part his Love changes, or can changes; but becauſe
the Soul diſdains his Friendſhip, to which he would have
her to correſpond, that the love he bears to her might be
perfect, and that he might fully delight himſelf in her;
not that he can delight in her for her ſelf, being a Subject
too remote from his Greatneſs, but for the Love he bears
himſelf: But ſhe only receives all the Advantages of this
Love; for ſo ſoon as ſhe gives her full Conſent to the Love
of her God, ſhe enjoys him and all his Graces in ſuch
Abundance, that if God himſelf did not hold her in Life,
ſhe would expire with ſo many Conſolations ſurpaſſing her
natural Strength.</p>
               <p>What hinders all Men from enjoying this Abyſs of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs?
Nothing but Sin alone! And what is Sin? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the turning away from God, to turn to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
they give divers Names to it, and yet all are but
one and the ſame thing, to wit, a turning away from God
to love the Creature.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſet down at ſome length, in her own Words,
her Sentiments about theſe Matters; wherein ſhe makes
appear that all Men were created by God for Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
and to enjoy him, and therefore that God has not
by an Eternal Decree reprobated any Man for Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but is deſirous that all ſhould be ſaved. That he
gave Man irrevocably a Liberty and Free-will which he has
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94808:70"/>
not limited by predetermining the Acts of it from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or by any other manner of way; becauſe he would
have him to love him freely, and from a moſt willing
Choice. That Sin came into the World neither by the
Will, nor Decree, nor Permiſſion of God, but by Man's
abuſe of the Free-will which he had irrevocably given him,
the greateſt Natural Gift that could be beſtow'd upon him.
That Man notwithſtanding of his Liberty can of himſelf
do nothing that is truly Good without the Grace of God,
there being nothing Good but what comes from God.
That in his Fallen Eſtate he cannot of himſelf return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to God, without his preventing and concurring Grace.
That he denies his Grace to none, not to the moſt Wicked.
That Man in his Corrupt State not being capable of his
moſt inward enlightning Grace, he fails not to recal him
by ſenſible Graces, Providence, Fears of Hell, Remorſe of
Conſcience, good Deſires and Purpoſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That God
requires Man's Co-operation with his Grace, to which he
enables him, and will thereupon ſtill give him more Grace.
That if he deny this Co-operation with God's Grace he
deſtroys himſelf, and puts a ſtop to the Operations of the
Divine Grace. That if he entirely and abſolutely yield up
his Free-will into the hands of God, to be wholly directed
by him, he then takes him into his immediate Direction,
enters in that Soul and makes his abode with it, it does not
ſo much live as Chriſt lives in it, it is one of his abſolute
Elect and cannot fall away. Sure they who conſider theſe
things without Prejudice, will ſee how ſutable they are to
the Nature of God; how truly they repreſent his Power,
and Righteouſneſs, and Wiſdom, and Holineſs, and Love,
and Impartiality, and Conſtancy, and Sincerity, and Truth,
and what a Conſiſtency there is between his Attributes
and his Providence; how clear it is that Man's Sin and
Damnation is owing entirely to himſelf, and all his Good
to God; what reaſon we have to be deeply humbled, to
diſtruſt and deny our ſelves, and what great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Prayer, to turn to God with all our Heart, and
entirely to depend upon him. They will ſee how clearly
the Difficulties about Providence are reſolv'd, which are ſo
unaccountable by the other Syſtems. They who deſire a

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94808:71"/>
againſt this Sentiment of <hi>A. B.</hi> are, that, 1. It
enroaches on God's Omniſcience. 2. That it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with Prophecies and Predictions of future Events.
To clear the Firſt, It is to be conſidered that God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
Self-ſufficient, and ſtands not in need of any other
Being in the World, nor the Idea of any other Being to
make him infinitely Perfect. So that all Beings beſides
himſelf and all their Idea's are the reſult of his Arbitrary
Will and Pleaſure, and are therefore form'd of ſuch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Perfections, as he in his infinite Wiſdom and
Goodneſs, was freely pleas'd to grant. It was free then to
God to form the Idea's of other Beings or not, to create
them or not, to give them Liberty or not, to determine,
to foreſee all their Acts or not, all this was indifferent to
God, who is Self-ſufficient and ſtands not in need of any
thing beſides himſelf. God having created Man perfectly
free in his Light and Love, did foreſee in the general all
the poſſible ways, how he might determine the Liberty of
his Acts; but would not determine them nor foreſee them
determined, and far leſs determine or determinately foreſee
that Man would turn away from God, and that by ſuch
Ways and Actions, all determined and foreſeen. Now it
cannot be ſaid that God could not form a Man with ſuch
a Liberty. This would be indeed to deny his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
there is no Contradiction in the Nature of the
thing, and therefore it was not impoſſible to God. Now
ſuppoſe that God determined ſo to do, and actually did
form Man in this Nature, then his not foreſeeing determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
how he would diſpoſe of this Liberty is not a denial
of the Omniſcience of God. Such a foreſight is not an Object
of Knowledge. Our Concerns have no more relation to
his abſolute Perfections in himſelf, than the dim Light of
a Candle has to the Sun. His Knowledge of us, as well
as his forming us, is but the effect of his Arbitrary Will.
Beſides, if it be ſaid that God cannot make a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be true; will we therefore affirm that ſuch deny his
Omnipotence? Not at all, for this is not the Object of it;
even ſo, to ſay that the indeterminate Actions of free
Agents are not determinately foreſeen, is not to deny Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience,
becauſe this is not the Object of it; yea, to
affirm the contrary is to aſcribe to God a Knowledge that
is not conformable to the Nature of things; for to know a
thing determinately, that is, in its own Nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:94808:71"/>
ever till the free Agent determine himſelf, is to know it
contrary to its Nature, and not as it is in its ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Divine Decrees being the pure effect of his Good
Pleaſure, without any neceſſity in himſelf, it was free for
God, either to decree from all Eternity, all that he ſhould
bring to paſs in all Events, and all Circumſtances in all
Ages of the World. Or otherwiſe having eſtabliſhed
his general Purpoſes in creating of the World, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
himſelf as to particular Events and Circumſtances
in effectuating and bringing about the ſame according to
Occurrences in the Correſponding of free Agents through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ſeries of Ages. The former looks like the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
a Fate, to which not only all the Creatures but
God himſelf is ſubjected, and by which he has bound up
his own Hands to all Eternity. And it lays an eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
both upon his Liberty and Power. If the other be
granted, which is moſt ſutable to the Nature of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
Free, Wiſe, Good, and Powerful Being, and is the
greateſt encouragement to Prayer, and a continual Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon God, then all the reſt of the Firſt Objection
falls to the Ground.</p>
               <p>The Learned Dr. <hi>Henry More,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Divine Dialogues Part 1. p. 80, 81, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> declares for this Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the very ſame Reaſons. He ſhews that as no
Body thinks the Omnipotency of God maimed, becauſe
he cannot do thoſe things that imply a Contradiction: So
if the certain Preſcience of uncertain things imply a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
it may be ſtruck out of the Omniſcience of
God, and yet God will nevertheleſs be as Omniſcient as he
is Omnipotent. That this is no Impediment to his ordering
the Affairs of the World, for that eternal Mind that knows
all things poſſible to be known, comprehends all things,
and ſo has laid ſuch Trains of Cauſes as ſhall moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meet every one in due time in Judgment and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
let him take what way he will. That the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Knowledge is to know things as they are in their
Nature, and therefore to know a free Agent which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate
to either part, to be ſo undeterminate, and
that he may chooſe which part he will, is the moſt perfect
Knowledge of ſuch an Agent and of his Action, till he be
perfectly determinate and has made his Choice. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to know him determined, before he be determined,
or while he is free, is an Imperfection of Knowledge, or
rather no Knowledge at all, but a Miſtake and Error: And
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94808:72"/>
indeed is a Contradiction to the Nature of God, who can
underſtand nothing but according to the diſtinct Idea's
of things in his own Mind. And the Idea of a free Agent
is undeterminateneſs to one part before he has made his
Choice. Whence to foreſee that a free Agent will pitch
upon ſuch a part in his Choice, with Knowledge certain
and infallible, is to foreſee a thing as certain even then
when it is uncertain; which is a plain Contradiction or
groſs Miſtake.</p>
               <p>And as to the Second Objection, that this is inconſiſtent
with Propheſies and Predictions of future Events, he ſhews,
That there is ſtill room enough for Millions of certain
Predictions, if God thought fit to communicate them ſo
throughly to the World. For tho' the Souls of Men are
free, yet there are infinite numbers of Actions, wherein
they are certainly determined: Such are the Actions of all
thoſe that are deeply lapſed into Corruption, and of thoſe
few that are grown up to a more heroical State of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
It is certainly foreknowable what they will do in ſuch
and ſuch Circumſtances. Not to add, <hi>ſays he,</hi> That the
Divine Decrees, when they find not Men fitting Tools,
make them ſo where Prophecies are peremptory, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditionate.
This he tells, he propoſes by way of Eſſay,
rather than that of Dogmatizing; and when ſo worthy and
pious a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo rational a
Defender of the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, againſt the Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Deiſts, thought fit to offer this as an Eſſay for the
clearing of thoſe Myſteries, it may teach others to be more
Sober in their Characters and Cenſures.</p>
               <p>But this matter of the Divine Preſcience, and of the
certainty of Divine Predictions and Prophecies is at large
and moſt diſtinctly treated of in M. <hi>Poiret's Oeconomie de
la Providence,</hi> Chap. 10. upon more Juſt and Divine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
than thoſe which make the Introduction of Sin and
Wickedneſs into the World, neceſſary for the Glory of
God, for accompliſhing his great Deſigns on Mankind, and
for the Manifeſtation of his Wiſdom, Mercy, Juſtice, and
other Glorious Attributes; a moſt curſed and blaſphemous
Principle. The former are moſt Juſt Repreſentations of
the Truth, and Righteouſneſs, and Goodneſs of God; the
latter moſt contrary to all of them: A diſtinct Account of
the former Principles is to be had beſt from the Book it

                  <q>It is true,
<hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> if we conſider only the Miſeries and Weakneſs
of Man corrupted by Sin, the Goſpel-Law is impoſſible,
but not if we have regard to the Power of God's Grace:
This Jeſus Chriſt intimated to his Apoſtles, when he
told, as to a rich Man's entring into the Kingdom of
Heaven, <hi>that it was impoſſible with Men, but not with
God;</hi> when a Man ſhall entirely yield up himſelf to him
to be wholly governed by him, God will eaſily operate
in him a Goſpel-Life; and Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>if you
who are evil, know how to give good things to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
how much more will your heavenly Father give his
holy Spirit to them that ask him!</hi> It is falſe therefore to
ſay that the Goſpel-Law cannot be kept, ſince it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for no other End, and Jeſus Chriſt brought it from
Heaven as the only Remedy of all our Evils, and the
only Means of our Salvation; and has ſaid, <hi>I have done
theſe things to give you an Example.</hi> And God will
never enjoyn Man to do any thing but what he will give
him Grace to accompliſh. But ſuch is Man's Wickedneſs,
that he would impute to God his own Faults, and the
Blame of his Damnation on him, as if he were ſevere
and cruel, by laying on him Burthens of Commands
that are inſupportable (that Man may thus be juſtified
and God condemned) tho' truly Man only is worthy
of Condemnation.—For God ſtill imparts his Graces
to him, and all thoſe Laws are ſpecial Inſtances of his
Love to Man, that by them he might bring him back to
the Love of his God for his eternal Salvation.</q>

are the Sentences which God has often confirmed to me,

the Laws and Commands which God has given to Men
are only ſo many Means to make them return to his

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>—Now the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel is nothing
elſe but ſo many Means to withdraw Man from Sin, that
he may recover the <hi>Love of God.</hi> And when this Law
teaches him <hi>Poverty of Spirit,</hi> it is to ſhew him that
Covetouſneſs has withdrawn him from the Love of his
God, and that he cannot return to it without leaving off
to covet earthly Goods. And when it teaches him to be
<hi>humble of Heart,</hi> and <hi>to chuſe the laſt Place,</hi> it is becauſe
he had loſt the <hi>Love of God,</hi> by loving himſelf, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

worthy of nothing but Shame and Confuſion. And he
not knowing this, ſtands in need of a Doctrine contrary
to his Errours and Ignorance, to make him return to the
<hi>Love of God</hi> which he had loſt by his Pride. And when
Jeſus Chriſt declares, <hi>that he came not to do his own Will,

have left off to do the Will of God and to love him,

Evil, or tends to an evil End; which becauſe Men did
not well know, God would ſhew them in particular

it is impoſſible for him to keep thoſe Commands becauſe

the Neceſſity of this, and how poſſible and eaſie it is to

Strength, but only by the Grace of God; that we are firſt
Children before we are Men, and our Falls and Stumbles
ought not to diſcourage us, but we muſt get up and go
forward, and depend upon God, and he will be with us, as
the Child that is learning to walk muſt not be diſcouraged

all Eternity, who have been ſo unhappy as to hearken to
them, and to live in Sloth, and be ſeduced by their Means.
Let us go up, let us go up, ſaid <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> wiſely,
let us go up boldly and poſſeſs this Land, certainly we ſhall
be ſtronger; if we ſtrive to pleaſe the Lord, he will bring
us into it, and will give it to us. Let us not rebel againſt
the Lord; let us not fear thoſe Enemies, we ſhall conſume
them as Bread; God will not defend them, and he is with
us; therefore let us not fear them. Thus we ought to
animate all well-diſpoſed Perſons and let them ſee that
the Ways and the End of Chriſtianity are very poſſible
with the Grace of God.—If this Method had been
taken, the Doctrine of Chriſtian Perfection and its Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
would not have been ſo ſtrange and ſo rare a thing.</p>

cannot fall any more; for in Effect I have no other Fear
but that of not abiding faithful to my God; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure thoſe who ſay or believe that there is a State
of Perfection in this World in which Perſons are impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.
I look on this as a great Errour and Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.
Is it poſſible that I ſhould hold my ſelf what
I blame ſo much in others? I ſay God ought to be ſerved
with Fear and Trembling; and I never demand of others
what I do not firſt my ſelf; If I ſay that God ought to
be ſerved with Fear, I ſtill do it firſt; and I am ſure
if God did withdraw his Grace from me, I ſhould fall
preſently.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>You have been preſent ſeveral times when I related to
many how I fell, after that I had been from my Youth
prevented by the Grace of God; yet being grown up, I
let my ſelf be carried away to follow the Vanities of the
World, and reſiſted the Inſpiration of God, which drew
me to the contrary; and becauſe of this Reſiſtance, I deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that God ſhould withdraw from me, and I began to
pleaſe my ſelf in the Pleaſures and Divertiſements of the
World, and the Praiſes of Men; ſo that this Fall was the
Cauſe that I gave my ſelf to great Mortifications of Body,
to Watchings, Tears and Prayers, for the Space of about
7 Years. This Story was told many times to your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
and in your Preſence. Now if I relate ſo freely
how I fell ſo baſely from ſo exalted a State of Grace in
which God had put me, how could I ſay or believe that I
could not f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ll any more, or think my ſelf impeccable?
ſince what a Perſon has done once, they may do many
times. The State of Integrity, in which I was before
my Fall, might rather have rendred me impeccable, than
that in which I live after it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I do not believe that ever any Creature on Earth can
be impeccable during this miſerable Life, where there
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94808:76"/>
are ſo many Stones of Stumbling, a S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle,
a <hi>David</hi> according to God's own Heart, a <hi>Solomon</hi> filled
with the Holy Spirit, with ſo many others, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
groſs Faults and great Faults, after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
great Grace from God: Should I be ſo Ignorant as
to believe that I could not fall any more or fail of the
Grace of God? I may do it aſſuredly every Moment,
if I ſhould withdraw my Converſation with God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with my Senſes; for God forces no Body, having
given to all Men Free-will, with which they ſhall act to
all Eternity; and as long as this Will abides fix'd in God,
it is impoſſible that the Perſon fall; but if this Will
withdraw it ſelf from a Dependance on its God, it falls
eaſily, even tho' it had been exalted as high as a Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim.
For this Cauſe I ſaid, I have no other Fear in
the World, but that of not abiding faithful to God;
becauſe I know that ſo long as I ſhall be united to him
I cannot fall; but if I withdraw my ſelf from him I
ſhall fall at the firſt Step, as an Infant that cannot
walk. And yet you dare ſay, that I call my ſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peccable,
and when I ask where I have ſaid or written
ſuch things? You tell you draw it from my Writings by
Conſequences. But I would gladly ask you if in caſe I
had drawn by Conſequences out of your Letters or
Words, that you are a wicked Man, would it be lawful for
me to go and publiſh it from Town to Town, as you do
the ill and abuſive Conſequences that you ſay you draw
from my Writings, without letting me know where,
how, in what Place, and by what Words I may have
given Matter for drawing of ſuch Conſequences, directly
contrary to the true Sentiments that I profeſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I know not with what Conſcience you can do this, and
ſay that it is for Good, that you may warn Perſons that
I believe my ſelf impeccable, and that I exalt my ſelf and
ſo forth; but tho' indeed there were in me any ſuch
thing, it would neither be good nor neceſſary to advertiſe
ſo many Perſons of it. For Firſt my Imperfections can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
defile them, it is I that muſt account for them to God,
and my Words cannot wound them, becauſe all thoſe
whom you ſent to me are Perſons who have their Five
Senſes, and a good enough Judgment to diſcern if what
I ſay be Good or Evil, and to take only that that may
ſerve them for Good, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94808:76"/>
not neceſſary for you to go tell them the Faults which
your Fancy has imagin'd. Your procedure is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaid to the People,
ſpeaking of the Phariſees, Hypocrites, <hi>do what they bid
you, but do not as they do.</hi> You will grant I ſay very good
things, as the Truth is, but you would annihilate that
Good, by the Evil, that you untruly ſay is mine. The
Evil that was in theſe Phariſees was not powerful enough
to diſcredit the Good that was in their Words; but you
make my imaginary Sins mount to ſo high a degree, that
they are capable of diſcrediting all the Good, even that
which you confeſs to be there. If you were Juſt, you
would make a right Judgment of what you ought to do
and leave; and if you had Goodneſs, you would procure
to all thoſe Perſons the Good that they might receive by
the Light which God gives me, and if you had Truth,
you would not perſwade them to believe a Lie in this,
that I ſay I am impeccable.</q>

                  <q>That Jeſus
Chriſt was united always to his Heavenly Father in his
Superiour part, is moſt true. I have written that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
contracted Sin, tho' he contracted all the Maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Sin, after he cloathed himſelf with our Mortality.
But he reſolving to become a Mortal Man, ſubjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to all the Miſeries both of Body and Mind, which
Sin had brought into humane Nature, and according to
this, he felt in his natural Will a Rebellion to the Will of
God in Sentiment, but never in Conſent, and reſiſted this
Rebellion, which he felt in his Corruption; for he ſays,
<hi>I came not to do my own Will, but the Will of him that ſent
me.</hi> Now if his own natural Will had been ſo inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="041" facs="tcp:94808:77"/>
united to the Will of his Father, to what purpoſe
would he have diſtinguiſh'd theſe two Wills, ſince they
were but one. For he gives us ſufficiently to underſtand
thereby, that his own Will was Evil, ſince he would not
follow it; but that of his Father which alone he knew
to be Good; for there is nothing Good but God, and
Jeſus Chriſt himſelf had nothing Good in him but what
God did operate there; ſo that as he was God, he was
moſt Good, moſt Wiſe, and moſt Powerful; but as Man,
he was every way frail as all other Men, ſince he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
cloathed himſelf with their Miſeries in the Womb
of the Virgin, and became then truly Man of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Race of <hi>Adam:</hi> And in this corrupt maſs he felt a
Rebellion of his Will againſt the Will of God, which all
Men feel in themſelves.—And therefore he behov'd to
reſiſt his own Will, and contradict it with ſo much Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
that he ſweat Blood in the Garden, where he
ſays alſo to ſhew his wreſtings, <hi>my Soul is heavy even
unto Death;</hi> and to his Father, <hi>Not my Will, but thino
be done,</hi> after his own Will had pray'd, <hi>If it be poſſible,
let this Cup paſs from me;</hi> and even being on the Croſs,
he ſays, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>—Could
he ſay in Truth that he was forſaken by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if he had not found in his Inferiour part the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Will from that of God; he could not believe
nor ſay that he was forſaken of his eternal Father, ſince
his Superiour part was never divided from him one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For if it had been never ſo little ſeparated, he had
certainly fallen into Sin as other Men; whereas it may
be ſaid to the Praiſe of Jeſus Chriſt, excluſively of all
other, that he never ſinn'd, and that his Soul remain'd
ſtill pure and immaculate in the Frailty and Rebellion
with which he charg'd himſelf, for the Love he bare to
us, doing as a moſt faithful Brother, who throws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into a Sink of Uncleanneſs to draw out his Brother,
whom he ſees periſhing without Succour and Help. For
Jeſus Chriſt according to his humane Nature is truly our
Brother, come of <hi>Adam</hi> our common Father, and he
ſaw in the Boſom of his Father, that we were all loſt in
the Sink of our Self-will. Therefore he would needs
throw himſelf into it, to draw us out and ſave us from
thoſe Dangers. Would you think it a diſhonour if your
Brother ſhould voluntarily throw himſelf into a Sink to
get you out of it, when without his Help we could not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94808:77"/>
Recover, but muſt periſh for ever; would you not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be oblig'd to honour ſuch a Benefactor, and to eſteem
as Jewels the Filth that he had contracted to deliver you
from Death? How can you think that this is to diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Jeſus Chriſt?—All thoſe things are ſo clear that it
is a wonder how Men find Difficulty in them; but they
judge of God and his Works as they would of their
Equals, and would attribute Honour to Chriſt by the
Contempt they have for his Perſon: Seeing he would
not be ſo valuable in his humane Nature, if he had not
therein a Will rebellious to the Superiour part of his
Soul; for in that caſe he would have had nothing to fight
againſt, and conſequently could not carry the Victory,
which belongs only to victorious Combatants, and not to
thoſe who are in Quiet, and without Enemies. And if
Jeſus Chriſt had not charg'd himſelf with our corrupt
Will, he could not endure and ſuffer, for in this caſe all
his Sufferings would have been inſenſible, by the inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Union with God, who is Impaſſible as well as
Immortal. And of neceſſity this Divinity of Jeſus
Chriſt behov'd to be in ſome way ſeparated from his
Humanity, for to work our Redemption: For abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in this perfect Union with the Divinity, he could
not ſatisfie for Man, ſince Man himſelf owes this Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to the Divinity; ſeeing he alone had done Evil
againſt the Will of God, he alſo ought to repair it, but
God ought not to ſatisfie himſelf for guilty Man, ſince
being Independent on all things, he has no need of Men
nor of their Satisfaction; but Jeſus Chriſt as Man, being
the true natural Brother of Men, would needs for the
Love he bare them, charge himſelf with the Miſeries and
Sins into which they had wilfully plung'd themſelves.
And I think, Sir, you will find in the Scripture that <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt was even made Sin for Men.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Not that it is to be underſtood that Jeſus Chriſt ever
ſinn'd, or actually followed the rebellious Will of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature.—But the Inferiour and Mortal part gave
him Combats and Aſſaults which Jeſus Chriſt behov'd to
reſiſt.—Jeſus Chriſt alſo could not in Juſtice ſay to Men as
he does, <hi>Be ye Followers of me,</hi> if it had not been ſo; ſince
their rebellious Wills could not attain to the Perfection
of a Will altogether holy and united with that of God.
And if God required of Men the Imitation of Jeſus
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94808:78"/>
Chriſt, in caſe he had not had Rebellion in his humane
Nature, he ſhould have required of them impoſſible
things, as ſome erroneous Perſons would maintain, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and preaching that it is impoſſible to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God, or the Law of the Goſpel, and tho'
theſe are Blaſphemies againſt God, many believe them,
becauſe this Doctrine flatters their Corruption, and lets
them live quietly in their Sins and Negligence, on this
falſe Suppoſition, that they cannot keep the Commands
of God, nor imitate Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Will of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, his Apoſtles, and all
Perſons living in the World, even tho' they were rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, have all of them
their natural Evil-wills, and all their Vertues and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
conſiſt in reſiſting them manfully, which they
muſt do even till Death; for tho' they have overcome
their own Wills by force of Reſiſtance, yet it is but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep
or mortified, and may be awakened or revive
by diverſe Accidents. Therefore a regenerate Perſon
himſelf has ſtill his Self will to fight againſt even to
Death: Wherefore the Apoſtle ſays <hi>Our Life is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Warfare,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt makes appear ſufficiently
that he had his Self-will to reſiſt even to Death, when to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of Life he yet prays, <hi>Not my Will, but thy
Will, Father, be done.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But if you cannot underſtand theſe things, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi>
leave them for thoſe who ſhall underſtand them; take
only of my Writings what is good and profitable for
your Soul, and ſuſpend your Judgment as to the reſt, till
God give you Light; for there are many things in them
which it is not neceſſary for the Salvation of many to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.—And
it is far better to know well how to
love God, than how to ſpeak well of Vertue:</q>

this Sentiment,<note place="margin">The reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of her Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this.</note> and yet how far ſhe is from requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a Belief of it from all as of neceſſity to Salvation, how
clearly ſhe ſhews, that it is ſo far from diſhonouring Jeſus
Chriſt, or being contrary to his Purity, (in that State of
Trial and Temptations to which he voluntarily ſubjected
himſelf) that on the contrary it manifeſts the greatneſs
and conſtancy of his Love to God, the ardency of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for Men, the firmneſs of his Adherence to God amidſt
all Temptations, the value of his Merits and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94808:78"/>
for us, and the encouragement he has given us by his
Example to reſiſt all Temptations, and to follow his Steps,
and to depend on him for Succour and Compaſſion, ſince
we have not a High-Prieſt who cannot be touch'd with the
feeling of our Infirmities,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note> but was in all Points tempted
like as we are, yet without Sin. In this Paſſage, we ſee
alſo how expreſly ſhe aſſerts our Redemption by Jeſus
Chriſt, and his Satisfaction for our Sins. They who deſire
this Matter handled at more length, may find it in <hi>Oecon.
Div.</hi> Part 5. p. 21, to 60. and in the Acceſſory Letter
above-mention'd. I ſhall here only add, that we ought not
to ſtumble at harſh Expreſſions when we know the main
intent of them, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, Chriſt <hi>was made a Curſe
and Sin,</hi> which ſeems moſt harſh. There is an ambiguity
in the Words, <hi>Evil, Corrupted, and Corruption,</hi> which may
either ſignifie Sin it ſelf, or the Effects and Conſequences
of it. So the Will ſignifies ſometimes the Superiour Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Soul; ſometimes the Bent and Inclination of
ſenſible Nature to pleaſe it ſelf, and in this laſt Sence one
may have a Self-will evil and corrupted, yet without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
when he reſiſts it. So the Summ of her Sentiment
is, that Jeſus Chriſt took on him, not the act of Evil, or
Sin, but the Impulſions, the Inclinations, the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
weakneſſes of the Inferiour Will, of ſenſible Nature,
not to conſent to it in any thing, but to reſiſt it, and to
make all theſe die in himſelf by the Power of his Spirit,
and his Eternal Light, and by means moſt contrary to the
Inclinations of ſenſible Nature, that he might the more
help and encourage his Brethren to the ſame Fight and
Victory.</p>

                  </note> then they are free to chooſe Good or Evil, and
to be ſav'd, or damn themſelves, according to this Choice.
<q>But before they come to the uſe of Reaſon, this Choice
is in the Power of their Parents, who may ſave or damn
them, even as they can give them natural Life or Death;
becauſe of the ſtrict Union and Sympathy between the
Body of the Mother and of the Child in the Womb. If
ſhe takes in Poyſon, the Child dies; if Phyſick, it is healed;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94808:79"/>
for theſe two Bodies are but one and the ſame Subſtance
divided into two parts.—This is true alſo as to the Soul,
ſo that if a Mother give the Child in her Womb to the
Devil, it is his, till being come to the uſe of Reaſon, it
reſiſts the Devil, renouncing him with its Free-will, and
abjuring its evil Inclinations to become the Child of God.—And
if Fathers or Mothers were true Chriſtians, or
Perſons regenerated in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
they would produce alſo Chriſtian Children in this
Regeneration, and till they had attain'd the uſe of their
Reaſon, they would always be God's, by the Free-will of
their Parents; but if they become Wicked of their own
Wills after this, they are free to do it, and their Parents
cannot hinder them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I know many doubt of a Child dying in Infancy can
be damn'd, but it is for want of Divine Light that they
do not comprehend the Works of God, with whom it is
as Juſt to damn the Child of a wicked one, as it is to
ſave the Child of a juſt Man; for he has united inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
the Will of the Father to that of the Child, as he
has united the Body of the Child with that of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—And
if they will condemn this for an Injuſtice,
they may as well hold it an Injuſtice that all Men are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
in <hi>Adam,</hi> which would be a Blaſphemy againſt God.
—He created at the Beginning all Men in <hi>Adam,</hi> as he
did all the Trees of one kind in the firſt Tree of that
kind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all things with Seeds for to produce each
one their like; which will never change, for the Works
of God are Eternal, being created by an Eternal God;
and Man not being capable of uſing this Free-will in his
Childhood, of neceſſity it muſt ſubſiſt ſomewhere to be
preſerv'd, till it may reſide in the Perſon for whom it
was created: As we ſee, the Free-will of all Men was in
the Free-will of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſince all are Partakers of his Sin
and Miſeries that he brought upon Man; for it is moſt
certain, that God could not have given to Man an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to Evil, which he feels from his Birth, nor the
Miſeries of Body and Mind in which he finds himſelf.
For God being all Good, cannot do any Evil; and we
muſt of neceſſity conclude that the Free-wills of Men
were in the Free-will of <hi>Adam</hi> when he ſinn'd. And
ſince all Chriſtians believe that all Men ſinn'd in <hi>Adam,</hi>
why ought they not by the ſame Conſequence to believe,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94808:79"/>
that Children ſin in their Parents, or are damn'd in
them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Catholicks believe that all Children are ſav'd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they be baptized, and that thoſe Children ſhall be
damn'd who ſhall die without Baptiſm, but that they
ſhall not endure the Pains of Hell, as thoſe who ſin with
their Free-will. It is true as in Paradiſe there are diverſe
Degrees of Glory, ſignified by thoſe Words of Scripture,
which ſay, In God's Houſe <hi>there are many Manſions,</hi> there
are alſo diverſe Puniſhments in Hell; but it is not true
that all Children dying without outward Baptiſm ſhall
be damn'd: For this is but a Teſtimony of the Faith
which the faithful Chriſtian has in his Soul, which he
declares to all Men by the means of the Water of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Baptiſm; but if this living Faith is not in the
Man's Soul, this outward Baptiſm will ſerve him for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
This is the Reaſon why Anabaptiſts will not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
Children; but they themſelves ſeem to have no more
Faith when they are grown up, than when they were
Children, for the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays, <hi>He who believes in Jeſus

till they come to the uſe of Reaſon. So the Soul of
Man cannot receive Salvation by the means of outward
Baptiſm, when he has not in him living Faith, or his
Parents for him, if he be in Childhood. The Catholicks
then have no ground to believe that all Children who are
baptized ſhall be ſaved, and that they who die without
Baptiſm ſhall be damn'd, ſince this depends upon the
Free-will of their Parents; who offering willingly their
Children to God to become true Chriſtians, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of God by the Will of their Parents, and will aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
be ſaved if they die before the uſe of Reaſon: And
if others by their Parents are offered to the Devil, and to
Sin, and die in their Nonage, they will be damned by the
Evil will of their Parents, even tho' outwardly they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Baptiſm of Water, which without Faith is
null, and Faith without Baptiſm in diverſe caſes does
ſave.</q>

               <p>We ſee with what ſtrength of Reaſon ſhe declares this
Sentiment, and tho' there were nothing elſe but the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of our caſe in <hi>Adam,</hi> it ſerves to confirm it; for
there is no partiality in God, no reſpect of Perſons, he acts

by the ſame Meaſures, and the ſame Rules, with Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the ſame Kind and Qualities.</p>
               <p>The Offence we take at this,<note place="margin">The reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of this Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> proceeds from our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of God and his Works, and the Deſire we have to
extenuate the Guilt and damnable Effects of our Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Care of our Children. When God created things at
firſt,<note place="margin">L'Oecon. Divine, Part 3. p. 299, 300, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> he did not eſtabliſh them in the Diſorder in which we
now ſee them, but all good and excellent in their reſpective
kinds. When he eſtabliſh'd the Propagation of Man to
come from Man, it was not that they might communicate
Imperfections to one another, but the Perfections he had
given them; and God's wiſe and admirable Conduct in this,
is thus in ſome meaſure repreſented. When he created free
and intelligent Beings, it was not poſſible but that at firſt
they muſt be frail and capable of falling away, for then
they had no Habits to Good, which conſiſting in frequently
repeated Acts, and being acquired thereby; intelligent
Creatures at firſt were not ſtrengthned in Good, and thro'
their weakneſs they might abuſe their Liberty and fall away.
God having ſeen this come to paſs in an infinite Number of
Angels, and deſiring to ſettle other Creatures in their room,
thought how he might place others who from their Birth
or Being might have Habits to Good, and ſo being thus
eſtabliſh'd in it, might not ſo eaſily fall away. If then all
thoſe Creatures ſhould come from one Source that were
habitually Good, then they who came of them ſhould be
born all with an habitual ſtrength to Good, and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
and ſtrengthning their good Habits, thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from them ſhould be yet much more eſtabliſh'd
and invincible in Goodneſs, and ſo on by a continual Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
But to accompliſh this charitable Deſign, the
firſt Creature of that kind muſt be produc'd in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Lot, without an habitual Firmneſs, but in a State
actually Good, and ſuch care taken to prevent his Fall, as
that God bodily converſes with him. If therefore Man do
not correſpond to this Care, it is purely his own fault, who
of his Free-will has chang'd into a Source of Miſery that
which ought to have been a Source of Communication of
Good. Now the ſame Reaſon for which Men were to come
of one another by Propagation, is the Reaſon alſo why
the Lot of Children is the ſame with that of the Parents
ſo long as they have not the uſe of their Liberty. If Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
had remain'd in the Perfection in which God plac'd
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94808:80"/>
them, and encreas'd in it according to his Eſtabliſhment,
this had been a great Happineſs for their Children, who
had thus been Partakers of habitual Good even from their
Original; but if the contrary did afterwards happen, this
is neither from the Decree nor Deſign of God, but purely
the fault of Man, with which God's Decree has no concern.
Now ſuppoſe that God has appointed that Men ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
of one another by Propagation, it follows immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
and naturally without the intervention of a New
Decree, that the Lot and Liberty of the Children ſhould
be bound up in the Parents ſo long as they are not in a
State to make uſe of it freely themſelves. As long as an
Effect is in its Cauſe, it is one and the ſame with its Cauſe:
And as long as it is not like to its Cauſe, and is not Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
on it, it is alſo in it; for it goes out from it, but
according as it has it ſelf apart the natural and neceſſary
Faculties and Functions for its own Conſtitution, and for
its individual Government, as its Cauſe has, to be naturally
compleat. If therefore it have not as yet the free conduct
of it ſelf, (being found to be a free Agent) it is as yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of that in its Cauſe or in its Parents. Not that for
ſome Years after a Child is born, his Free-will is yet in an
inherent manner in his Parents, and that it muſt flow from
them into the Child, when he is farther advanc'd in Age.
But that the Parents produce a Body and a Soul in a State
imperfect enough, ſo as yet to need their Care and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo to ſpeak, for ſome Years, before the Subject which
hitherto is imperfect become perfect. And ſo long as it is
not, it belongs yet naturally to the producing Cauſe, which
is obliged to have a care of it, as a part of it ſelf, as in
effect it is. Hence alſo comes the Right which Fathers and
Mothers have of educating their Children, which is not a
Right that is poſitive or may be diſpenc'd with, or which
ſimply regards the Body; but a natural indiſpenſible Right,
which much more reſpects the Soul than the Body.</p>

Empires, Dignities, Honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and may be call'd
Divine, Rational, and Earthly; the Grandeur of Charity

in the laſt, and ſeem Great to the Eyes of Fleſh; <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
and others have excell'd in the ſecond, and ſeem
Great to the Eyes of Reaſon. Jeſus Chriſt appear'd in
none of theſe Grandeurs, had neither Learning nor world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Greatneſs, and was of no regard neither to the Eyes of
the Fleſh, nor thoſe of the Great Philoſophers, and of
Reaſon; but O! how Great was he in the Eyes of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity!
how Meek and Humble, and Patient and Self-denied,
in a Life of abſolute Poverty, Contempt, and Pain for the
Love of God and Men. Now all the Writings and Actions
of <hi>A. B.</hi> tending to draw Men into this Kingdom of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and the Love of God, which is of a quite diſtinct Rank
and Order from that of humane Reaſon, as well as of
worldly Greatneſs, it was no wonder that ſhe put no great

not conſiſt in believing only with the underſtanding the
Twelve Articles of the Creed, which may be done by a
humane Faith, as we believe the recital of ſome Hiſtory
when a Perſon worthy of Credit relates it; this gives not
to the Soul any Divine Vertues, which God only can ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in us. Faith is a Divine Light which God infuſes
in the Soul, which makes us to know and deſire Eternal
things, and deſpiſe Temporal. It is not a natural Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as our Reaſon, but a Divine Quality, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from God, as the Beams do from the Sun, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can make us ſee the Sun, but the Sun himſelf. It
was communicated to all Men at their Creation, loſt
by their Fall, renew'd by the Merits and Grace of Jeſus
Chriſt. When it ſhines in our Souls, it warms them with
the Love of God and Men who bear his Image and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and produces Charity: And this Charity regulates
all our Life, and gives weight and meaſure to all our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For Divine Faith is always living and operating;
It partakes of all the Divine Qualities, Righteouſneſs,
Goodneſs, and Truth. So that he who has Faith in his
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94808:81"/>
Soul cannot be Unjuſt, nor a Liar, nor a Deceiver, nor
Wicked, nor ſeek his own Intereſt, his own Glory, his
own Pleaſure or Satisfaction; ſeeing all theſe reſpect time
and earthly things. Humane Reaſon is an Inferiour Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
that may indeed convince us that there is a God, the
Author of Nature, who made and ſuſtains all things,
but this cannot produce in our Souls, Faith and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Vertues derived immediately from God, and not
from Nature, or the Underſtanding of Man, which is a
frail Creature limited to Earth and Time. And to think
to know or comprehend God by the natural Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is a greater Folly than the Heathens committed in
worſhipping the Sun.</q>

Kingdom of God. He founded no Colleges nor Academies

the true Sence of the Scriptures, and by their

Schools are expreſly inſtituted to forge Caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
capable of leading Men to Hell. For what need is
there to Gloſs the Goſpel, and the Life of Jeſus Chriſt?
They are clear Truths which Jeſus Chriſt taught by Word
and Deed, that we muſt be poor in Spirit, humble in
Heart, deſirous to ſuffer Perſecution for Righteouſneſs
ſake, and to do to others as we would have them do to us;
but to corrupt all theſe things, the Learned make Gloſſes,
that it is not againſt Poverty of Spirit to labour or trade
that we may get Money, and make ſome Fortune in the
World, and to flatter Men the better to their Ruine, they
add by Word, that we muſt poſſeſs Riches as not poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them; which is a great Deceit, for Men are not now
ſo diſpos'd as thoſe of the Old Teſtament, who receiv'd
Temporal Goods from God as a Bleſſing to employ them
to his Glory, not having their Hearts any ways wedded
to them, as thoſe of our Time, who inceſſantly covet
Riches, deſiring ſtill more and more. It is an infallible
Truth that all who would be ſaved muſt <hi>love God with all
their Heart.</hi> And if we ask thoſe Divines if it be not
lawful for a Man to love his Father, Mother, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Kinsfolk, Friends, yea his Country, Money, Houſe,
Honour, Divertiſements, Meat, Drink, Cloaths, and
every other Creature; they will anſwer, yes; becauſe they
love them themſelves, and yet imagine they fulfil the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, of loving him with all their Heart; and
to diſguiſe this Lie the better, they will ſay, We muſt not
love all theſe things inordinately, giving us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
thereby, that our Hearts may be well divided into ſo
many different Affections without ſinning, which has ſo
authoriz'd the neglect of the Command of loving God
with all our Heart, that no Body thinks it is needful.
They live and die in the Love of all ſorts of Creatures
and yet think to be ſaved; for their Divines have found
out Philoſophical Reaſons to maintain this.</q>

not that ſhe will deſpiſe Learning or the Study of Sciences
and Languages: Since all theſe things may ſerve for the
Glory of God, when we will apply them to thoſe Ends;
and moral Vertues give Advantage to divine Vertues. For
a well bred Perſon will ſtill be more docile in the Practice
of true Vertue, than one ill-bred; and one of good Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
will be more able to underſtand and receive true
Vertue than a rude and ignorant Perſon; ſo that what,
<hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> makes me fear that few of the Learned and of
the Great ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, is that
I ſee in effect that very few of them are humble in Heart,
and that it is impoſſible (ſpeaking naturally) that they
ſhould not eſteem themſelves more than another, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
more ground for it. And unleſs by Divine Vertue,

which Sin has plung'd him, he can never be without Self-eſteem

                  </note> concerning the Nature of

Method conformable to our ways of reaſoning and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

for by M. <hi>Poiret</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>De Eruditione,</hi> to which I
refer thoſe who deſire to enquire farther into it for full
Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>1. The Original Ends of God's creating Man being to
enjoy him and all his Works, the one as his Eſſential Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
and the other as Acceſſory, he therefore gives him
an Immortal and Divine Soul and a Material Body, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues
theſe with ſutable Faculties capable of enjoying this
twofold Happineſs; the one material and ſenſible, his bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Senſes by which he might take in the Beauty and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of all the Creatures; and the other Divine and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
his Underſtanding, by which he might be capable of
enjoying God and Divine things, and of receiving his Light
and Love.</p>
               <p>2. Thoſe Faculties are paſſive, and do not by any activity
of theirs, produce their Objects, but only are laid open and
turn'd to them to receive them. Our Eyes do not form
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94808:83"/>
the Light, but only paſſively receive it and the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the other Creatures; and in the Night, tho' we open
and turn them about never ſo earneſtly, we meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Darkneſs. So is it as to our ſpiritual Faculties
and their Objects.</p>
               <p>3. Thoſe reſpective Objects when they are preſent to
their reſpective Faculties, do make ſo ſtrong and vivid an
Impreſſion on them, that in their Abſence we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of forming to our ſelves in our Minds, Images and
Pictures of them, and of compounding, or dividing, or
comparing theſe Pictures together, and of forming Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
and Conſultations about them, and according as
theſe paſſive Faculties have received due and vivid Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or faint, or none at all, from their reſpective Objects,
we are accordingly capable of forming true or falſe Pictures
of them. And this is the active Faculty which we call
Reaſon.</p>
               <p>4. The Knowledge we have by the Impreſſions from the
Objects themſelves in our paſſive Faculties, is a loving, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
real Knowledge, making us enjoy the Object, and the
Delight, and Happineſs it can give us. The Knowledge we
have by the Exerciſe of this active Faculty of our Reaſon,
is a dead, dry, barren, ſuperficial Knowledge, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
nothing to the Soul of the Delight and Reality
of the Objects themſelves. We ſee what a difference there
is between beholding the Sun, and forming to our ſelves
Idea's and Pictures of him in his Abſence; the firſt enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens,
warms, delights, directs us, lets us ſee the Beauty of
all the Creation; the other affords nothing of this; and
if we had ſtill been Blind and never ſeen the Light, even
the very Pictures of it, we fancy to our ſelves, would be
falſe as well as ſuperficial. Now it is juſt the ſame as to the
ſpiritual things; the natural Man perceives not the things
of God, they ſeem Fooliſhneſs to him. His Idea's and
Reaſonings about them are like a Blind Man's Reaſoning
about Colours, and tho' they were never ſo Juſt, yet they
cannot make him Happy, nor to enjoy the Object them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
no more than a Man's drawing the Pictures of Light,
Fire, Meat, and Drink, can enlighten, warm, and nouriſh
his Body. Our Souls muſt be turn'd to God and taken off
from all other things; <hi>And bleſſed are the pure in Heart,
for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> The Knowledge we have by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
then is a ſuperficial, barren, and dead Knowledge,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94808:83"/>
does not bring to the Soul the true and living Knowledge
of God. They who give themſelves up to it, do really deny
God, make their Reaſon their God, are guilty of a more
dangerous Idolatry than they who worſhip the Sun; and
how univerſal this Evil is now in the World, he that runs
may read. The true and living Knowledge of God is to
be had only from God, our divine Faculties muſt be turn'd
to him, and turn'd away from other Things, that they
may be enlightned by him; they are in our corrupt State
more dead and defiled and vitiated than the weakeſt or moſt
blinded Eyes, and Reaſoning will not recover them, more
than it will give Eyes to the Blind. Phyſick is indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably
neceſſary to heal them, and the Laws and Life of
Jeſus Chriſt tranſcribed into our Hearts and Practice is the
only Remedy for them.</p>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94808:84"/>
there were no Government and Magiſtrates to rule and
govern them.—I indeed deſpiſe the Abuſe of Churches,
and Sermons, and Sacraments, but not the Uſe of them, nor
the Eſſence of theſe, which are eſtabliſhed by God, as
is alſo Government and Magiſtracy. And there is a
great Difference between the deſpiſing a thing in it ſelf,
and the Abuſe that is made of it. For it is one thing
to ſay that every Sect abuſes the Holy Scriptures, and
another to ſay that the Scripture is of no Worth, or to
deſpiſe it becauſe many abuſe it. Now it ſeems <hi>Buchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
would make People believe that I deſpiſe all theſe
Holy Things, when I deſpiſe only the Abuſe of them,
as true Chriſtians ought to do, who lay to Heart God's
Honour: They ought to lament when they ſee Men to
degenerate as to the Love of God, that they ſeem to
hold meerly to the Bark of the things ordained by God,
without ſquaring their Lives by them.</q>

them more than I do: For the Quakers accuſed me, by
their defamatory Treatiſe, <hi>That I had an abominable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
ſending Perſons to Churches, Sermons, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or other outward Solemnities;</hi> deſiring to infer
from this, that I had not the Spirit of God, ſince I ſtill

                  <q>Your Preachers may read what I have written in that
Advertiſement upon this Head, ſo that I need not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
my ſelf farther here, but will ſatisfie them as to
what they ſay, <hi>That in effect I deſpiſe the Sacraments
and other outward Devotions, becauſe I do not go my ſelf
to the Church nor to the Sacraments;</hi> and they will needs
reject all that I ſay in the Praiſe of Holy Things, becauſe
I do not obſerve them my ſelf to give an Example to
others; and would infer from thence, <hi>That I ſpeak with
Diſſimulation in praiſe of Holy Things, and not ſincerely
as I think in my Heart.</hi> This convinces me that they
no ways know me. For if they only knew me outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they would ſufficiently ſee that I am ſincere, and not
at all feigned or diſſembled; ſo that if I had in my Heart
a Contempt for the Sacraments and other outward Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
I would openly declare it by Word and Writ; for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94808:85"/>
I have overcome the World, and am not afraid to tell the
Truth of what I know.</q>
               </p>

                  <q>I have indeed written <hi>againſt the Abuſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
and other outward Solemnities, but I never ſpoke
againſt the things themſelves, ſeeing they are good, and
have often ſerv'd me as Means of Union with God. But
if I do not go now to the Church or Sacraments, it is not
out of Contempt of Holy Things, but becauſe I have no
longer ſo great need of outward Means of Union with
God as I had formerly, when the Converſation of Men,
and the Diverſion of the Cares of temporal Affairs did
divert my Attention from God. I retired then to Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and approached the Sacraments, that I might be
the more recollected and united to God. But ſince
God has given me the Grace to find this Recollection in
my little Chamber, and to entertain my ſelf in Spirit
with God in Solitude, I have not thought it ſo neceſſary
to uſe theſe outward Ceremonies, which ſometimes
would ſerve me for a Diſtraction to my inward Recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This is partly the Reaſon why I have left them off;
but this is not all: For if I had the Freedom to go to
Church, I would go to it on the Days commanded, and
would receive the Sacrament at the Times appointed:
Since I am under the Ordinances of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
Jeſus Chriſt teaches me to obey the Laws both of God and
Men, as he himſelf did on Earth, obeying <hi>Caeſar</hi> and
other Superiours, tho' they were ſometimes evil, but
their Ordinances good, as I have particularly ſhewn in
the ſaid Advertiſement.—But I cannot go to Church
without hazard of my Life, and it is not lawful for me
to expoſe my ſelf to ſo evident Dangers, and Neceſſity
has no Law. There are Perſons in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
who do as your Preachers, and ſay that I am become a
Heretick, and therefore would think they did God good
Service to take away my Life, and have even watched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Occaſions to murther me, which God diſcovered to
me timouſly that I might avoid them; and if I would
yet go to their Churches, I think I ſhould not come out
alive, but they would ſtone me as they did S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> for
having ſpoke the Truth. And being born and brought
up in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, it is not permitted me to go to
another without ſinning mortally (according to their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances)
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94808:85"/>
ſo that by Force I muſt ſtay in Solitude and
not go to Church, which I ſuffer willingly, and comfort
my ſelf that ſo many Fathers Hermits were ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God while they lived in the Deſarts, and did not
uſe the Sacraments nor other outward Solemnities.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And in her forecited Letter to Mr. <hi>Reinboth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Le Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moign. de Verite. Part 2. p. 74, 75.</note>—As to
what you tell me, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> that you wiſh <hi>I had not
touched the Eccleſiaſtick State,</hi> I could not omit it, ſince
for them particularly that Work was made (<hi>The Light
of the World</hi>) and they ought all to thank God that he
has permitted their Faults to be known, that they may
amend them while they are yet in this World. But in
order to this, they muſt really deſire to become true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
ſuch as I have deſcribed them; for otherwiſe they
will take God's Admonitions for the Reproofs of a Wife,
which they will not endure. I pardon them, for they
do it out of Ignorance, thinking theſe are Novelties, tho'
they be the ancient Truths of God, but a little grievous
to thoſe who live according to the Motions of corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For it would always bear Rule, be praiſed and
eſteemed, and cannot endure Reproof, nor bear its Faults,
without taking the Alarm or avenging it ſelf, oppoſing
ſtill the Truth that reproves it, and will not acknowledge
its Fault. This is the Way of a natural Man, who has
not yet overcome himſelf, in which your Paſtours ſeem
yet to be fix'd; ſince they would blame me for ſpeaking
the Truth of the Degeneracy of the Eccleſiaſtick
State, of which too much cannot be ſpoken; and they
themſelves ought to publiſh it if they were free of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and regarded more the Glory of God and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Souls. But impartial and diſintereſted Perſons
are no longer to be met with. Every one looks to his
own Advantage, his own Glory and Profit; and when
they are in this State I need not wonder if your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
blame me, ſince I bring them no Profit, Advantage,
or Vain-glory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This is not that I will not honour or prefer Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in their Dignities, ſince I eſteem them as the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of God, of which I have ſpoken ſufficiently in the
Advertiſement againſt the Quakers. For I always diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the State from the Perſon. I honour Prieſts, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
Judges, and other Superiours, becauſe God has
eſtabliſh'd this Order upon Earth, without which. Men
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94808:86"/>
would be much more diſorderly. But I cannot honour the
Faults of all thoſe Perſons who are plac'd in State and
Dignity, ſince they ſeem to me more heinous in ſuch,
than in the Common People; and I remark that Jeſus
Chriſt deſpiſed wicked Prieſts and Judges, more than he
did private Sinners; for he diſmiſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d the Woman taken
in Adultery, ſaying only to her, <hi>Go, and ſin no more.</hi> He
called an Uſurer to be an Apoſtle; he ſuffered a <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
a common Sinner, to kiſs and follow him. But he
does not ſo treat the Phariſaical Prieſts or Judges and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
but gives them publickly many Reproaches and
Contempts, calling them ſo often Hypocrites, whited
Sepulchers, Generation of Vipers, and ſaying they made
clean the out-ſide of the Cup and Platter, but within
were full of Corruption and dead Mens Bones.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And if you had liv'd, Sir, in the Times of Jeſus Chriſt,
and heard him thus deſpiſe and condemn the Prieſts and
Superiours, you would have taken Offence, that he
blamed ſo particularly the Eccleſiaſtick State, ſince you
take Offence now that I blame the Faults which God has
made known to be univerſally in that State. And if you
believe there are amongſt others ſome good Men who are
not guilty of the Faults that I have marked in that
<hi>Light of the World;</hi> it is not of them that I ſpeak, ſince
I will not blame the Office in it ſelf, ſeeing God has
eſtabliſhed it, and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf honour'd it, even
in wicked Perſons, whom he reproved for many Faults;
for after he had healed the Leper, he commanded him
to go ſhew himſelf to the Prieſt. It is not to be believ'd
that this was to a holy Prieſt, ſince he was of the ſame Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue
with thoſe who out of Envy crucified Jeſus
Chriſt; but he would teach the Reſpect and Honour
that ought to be had to the Prieſtly Dignity, tho' the
Vices of the Perſons placed in that Dignity are much
more diſpleaſing to God than the Vices of others, and they
will certainly be more puniſh'd in Hell for their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Offices which they have unworthily diſcharged.
Therefore I had more ground to touch the Eccleſiaſtick
State than any other on that Occaſion, when I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
with Eccleſiaſtick Perſons: For it would not
have touched them ſo nearly to have ſpoken to them of
the deplorable State in which Lawyers, Merchants,
Phyſicians, and other ſecular Perſons do now live, ſince
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94808:86"/>
the Vices of others could not be corrected by thoſe
Church-men, and they might well correct their own
Vices which I diſcover'd to them to be crept into the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick
State; for they muſt account for this before the
great Judge.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I never repented of having touched on that Occaſion
the Eccleſiaſtick State, ſince this is the chief Cauſe of
the Degeneracy of Chriſtendom: For if the Prieſts had
continued true Chriſtians and Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt,
undoubtedly they would yet draw to that State of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
a great Number of People after them. But
when we ſee the Heads of the Chriſtian Church degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from that Spirit, and that they will not ſo much as
hear their Degeneracy ſpoken of, what can be hoped for
from the People, but that they will become ſtill worſe,
as Experience makes appear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it appears how far ſhe is from overturning or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
Prieſthood and the outward Ordinances, how
plainly ſhe diſtinguiſhes the Offices and Dignities from
the Perſons, the Uſe of Divine things from the Abuſe of
them; and that ſhe as much honours the former, as ſhe
expoſes the Evils of the latter, and why it is the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
on all ſides raiſe ſuch a Hue-and-Cry againſt her. I
deſigned once to have ſet down here her execellent Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Sacraments and outward Ordinances, and the
Dignity and Reverence of the Prieſthood from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of the Quakers, in her Advertiſement againſt them.
But leſt it ſhould make this Paper ſwell too much, I have

               <p>XXI.<note place="margin">XXI. Nor reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> They accuſed her that ſhe rejected and deſpiſed

all; for I ſaid from the Beginning, that if my Life and
Words are not conformable to the ſaid Scriptures, they
ought not to believe me:<note place="margin">Tomb. de la fauſſe Theol. part 2 p. 78 Light of the world. part 1. p. 101. Lum. nec en tenebr. P. 2. p. 81.</note> This I have often repeated
ſince, and ſay it over again now, and on all fit Occaſions,
I tell every one that the Sence of the Scriptures is the
Nouriſhment of Souls.—It ſeems to me, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi>
a very ill thing to forbid Chriſtians the Reading of the
Bible in the vulgar Tongue, ſince it muſt teach us all
that we ought to do and forſake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The only Good, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> that remains in the World
is, that the Text of Scripture remains in its Integrity, that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:94808:87"/>
the Devil has never had Power to change and falſifie it,
but to oppoſe it only by the Gloſſes and Inventions of
Men, who endeavour to accommodate it to the modern
Corruption, but in vain; they cannot change it, ſince
they who will follow Jeſus Chriſt may yet find it entire,
and draw in its Fountain all that is written by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
Prophets, and other Souls filled with the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
In this the Promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt is fulfilled, That
Hell ſhall never be able to pluck it out of the Hands of
the Chriſtians, that it may ſerve for Food and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all true Believers, who not ſtopping at the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Ciſterns of human Learning, ſhall draw out of the
Fountain of living Water to the End of the World.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In a Word, thro' all her Writings ſhe recommends the
Reading of the Holy Scriptures, looks on it as one of the
greateſt Miracles of Providence that they have been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
uncorrupted and entire, to be a ſtanding Teſtimony
againſt the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, while their Lives are
a flat Contradiction to them. That the Doctrine of Jeſus
Chriſt contained in the Goſpels is the laſt Doctrine that is
to come into the World, and fully directs us the Way to
eternal Life, and deſires that her Life and Doctrine may
be examined thereby, and no Regard had to it but in ſo
far as it is conformable thereunto; and that ſhe aims at
nothing but to perſwade People to embrace in their Life
and Spirit, the Life and Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt contained
in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>It is true, ſhe did not give her ſelf to reading of the
Holy Scriptures, being immediately and inwardly taught
by God the ſame Truths which are contained in them.
Every one, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> ought to uſe the Means that lead
them beſt to the Love of God, becauſe the Ways to this
Love are divers, ſome attain to it by the Means of
reading ſeriouſly the Holy Scriptures, others by humble
aſſiduous Prayers, others by Solitude and retiring from
human Converſation, and ſo of many others. It is of
ſmall Moment to know by what Means others have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to this Love of God, provided we take the Means
that are moſt fit for us to attain to it alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There are divers Ways,<note place="margin">Tomb. de la fauſſe Theol. Part 1. p. 17, 18.</note> as there are divers Sins which
are Hindrances in thoſe Ways, which every one ought to
oppoſe, according as he knows them to be in himſelf,
without offering to make one general Law and Rule
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94808:87"/>
whereby to lead all to God; for he who is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
inſtructed by the Holy Spirit, would do very ill,
if he ſhould not make uſe of the reading of the Holy
Scripture, or if he ſhould not ſearch for thoſe who ſpeak
by the Holy Spirit; for this would be to tempt God to
Will that he ſhould inſtruct all Men immediately, while
they are ſo taken up with, or wedded to the Affairs of this
World. And on the contrary it would be very ill done,
if one ſhould make uſe of Reading or other outward
Means, when he has withdrawn from all Creatures, and
finds the immediate Conduct of God. Such a Soul
would oppoſe the Holy Spirit, and would hinder the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Graces, if it ſhould make uſe of Reading
or other outward Means, becauſe in this State it ought
not any longer to act, but to be paſſive, and follow the
Spirit, who guides it it, without operating any more it
ſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In doing this, ſhe is far from deſpiſing or rejecting the
Holy Scriptures; when I am with a Friend and converſe
with him by Word of Mouth, and he anſwers me after
the ſame manner, we will not then make uſe of Writing or
Letters, and yet it cannot be concluded from thence, that
I reject or deſpiſe his Letters; this way of Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Letters is moſt agreeable, but it is for the Abſent.
They who ſee and converſe with one another make no
uſe of Writing, but they do not deſpiſe it; they have a
more ſpeedy and delightful way of communicating their
Thoughts. Thus <hi>A. B.</hi> having inward and immediate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with God, had no need of the Scripture for to
know his Will, ſhe learned it from his own Mouth, and
enjoy'd his Preſence, but they who have not recovered that
Divine Converſation, muſt have Recourſe to the Scriptures,
and other outward Means, according as they find them help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to bring them nearer to God, till they attain to the
Enjoyment of himſelf.</p>
               <p>And this is very agreeable to St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Doctrine in

                  </note> That ſhe declared ſo poſitively, that there are no
True Chriſtians at preſent upon Earth, and that God would
make her the Inſtrument of renewing the Spirit of the
Goſpel is another grievous Prejudice againſt her; this was
often objected to her, and is anſwered by her in many
Places of her Writings. It was not Uncharitableneſs, but
great Charity to Men's Souls, that mov'd her to declare
this to all the World. She was perſwaded that none were
True Chriſtians but they in whom the Spirit of Chriſt did
live, whoſe Affections and Deſires were ſet only on things
Eternal, and not on things Temporal; that one could not
be a True Chriſtian by ſerving God and Mammon both,
by joining the Love of God and Self-love, ſeeking to pleaſe
Men and to pleaſe God too. She met with many of good
Inclinations,<note place="margin">Tomb. de la fauſſ. Theol. Part 2. p. 155.</note> but none who were truly Regenerated. <q>She
did well, <hi>as ſhe ſays,</hi> to tell this, and ſhe had done a great
Evil in ſaying the contrary; for to have ſaid ſo to others
could not have profited them, even tho' it had been true;
it could not encreaſe their Holineſs, but rather give them
occaſion of Vain-glory, Nature being tickled with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
But when we are told that we are not True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
we have reaſon to uſe the means to become ſo, and
to humble our ſelves before God, that we may obtain his
Grace. If there are True Chriſtians, they will become
no leſs for this Saying; and if there are none, at leaſt
ſome will be awakened out of their Security and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to become ſo.</q> If <hi>A. B.</hi> had ſaid, that God by
an unchangeable Decree from all Eternity had predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the greateſt part of the World to Damnation, it might
then indeed be ſaid that ſhe is void of Charity to God and
Man: But when ſhe declares that God is not willing that any
ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance,
and yet that all Men were living in a Contradiction to the
Life and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe could not do them a
more charitable Office than to warn them of their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Will they ſay the Pſalmiſt was uncharitable, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94808:88"/>
damn'd all the World,<note place="margin">Pſal. 14. 2, 3.</note> becauſe he tells us, <hi>the Lord look'd
down from Heaven upon the Children of Men, to ſee if there
were any that did underſtand and ſeek God; they are all gone

Good, no not one.</hi> Every Man ought to weigh the Truth
or Falſhood of this Saying as to himſelf, and ſee if he can
make this particular Exception to the general Saying,
<hi>There is no True Chriſtians upon Earth;</hi> let him ſet at the
Foot of it, <hi>Except I my ſelf.</hi> And if his Conſcience dare
not write down this Exception, he has reaſon to thank
the Charity that put him to the Trial, without regard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>that being a Woman, yet
ſhe would preſume to inſtruct the World,</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi>
would not ſuffer a Woman to ſpeak in the Church, and
therefore calling her in Contempt and Old Wife, <hi>ſhe ſaid,</hi>
That for her being a Woman ſhe could not hinder it, ſince
no Body forms themſelves; they muſt ask God, if they
would know why he created her a Woman and not a Man,
that ſhe her ſelf had been diſpleas'd at it, but ſince God
made her know it was his Pleaſure, ſhe was content; for ſhe
lov'd rather to be a little Atom in the Will of God, than
a whole World in her own Will. And when ſhe began to
teach by her Writings, it was by an expreſs Command of
God, which ſhe long reſiſted, for which ſhe begs Pardon;
for ſhe could not reſolve on this becauſe ſhe was a Woman,
who has never ſo much Authority in matter of Doctrine
as a Man.—But ſhe came over all humane Reſpects, and
expos'd her ſelf to all their Mockeries. <hi>She ſays,</hi> If the
Truths of God muſt be rejected becauſe they are dictated
by a Woman, all the Great and Learned that ever were in
the World ought alſo to be rejected, ſeeing all are equally
come of a Woman. Why ſhould they then deſpiſe their
Origin, ſince God does not deſpiſe it, but makes uſe of
them to operate his greateſt Marvels, and always Figures
the Church, his Spouſe, by a Woman. Women are as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of receiving the Graces of God as Men, there being no
difference between their Souls, and the bodily difference
reſpecting Nature only; in which even Woman ought to
be more regarded than Men, ſeeing when God would needs
become Man, he would have a Woman for his Mother,
but not a Man for his Father, and he has done his greateſt
Wonders by the means of Women. What Triumphant
Victory did <hi>Judith</hi> obtain againſt <hi>Holofernes;</hi> and <hi>Eſther</hi> in

Times to a Prophet by a Beaſt; that he beſtows his
Graces and Wiſdom on whom he pleaſes, and Man ought
not to ask him why he does ſo. That before God it is not
Man or Woman that ſignifies any thing, but the Spirit of
Righteouſneſs and Truth: That they ought not to regard
whether ſhe be Man or Woman, but whether what ſhe
ſays be Juſt and True: That ſhe writes by an expreſs
Command of God, doing this as ſecretly as ſhe can,
ſhut up in her Chamber: That Men are now leſs diſpos'd
to receive his Divine Light than Women, ſince their Hearts
are blown up with Pride, to apply all Glory and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to themſelves, inſtead of referring it to God, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure that a ſimple Woman as ſhe, ſhould ſpeak of
Divine Things, leaſt their Learning ſhould be leſs eſteem'd.
So thoſe Great Philoſophers will not let God do his Marvels
by the means of a Virgin, but will oblige him to operate
by Great Divines,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 27, 28.</note> not remembring that he has ſaid, * <hi>He

And thus he deſtroys the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and brings

Sayings themſelves. In his time, when the Faithful met
together, it was not as now, when a Man who has his
Head full of Learning declaims an Hour or two alone,
very often with Conceitedneſs enough, to the People, who
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94808:90"/>
muſt take for good Coin all that he ſays is ſuch, and which
he ſtamps with Paſſages of Holy Scripture. But then
there were mutual Conferences where each of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
were allow'd to tell their Sentiment, or ask that of his
Brethren and Elders; but that all might be done in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ordains that their Women might not be of the
number of the Interlocutors, either by telling their own
Thoughts, or asking thoſe of others; but that they ſhould
do this at Home, and even there ſhould not pretend to
teach their Husbands, but learn of them. It is evident
then, he ſpeaks of ordinary Women, married, and encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with the Cares of their Houſe, who have need to learn,
and yet would be thought very Knowing, and it is a Rule
of Decency to avoid Confuſion. But at preſent they would
have St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Meaning to be, that Women enlightned by
God, in a free State, always employed about Divine things,
ſhould, I do not ſay abſtain from ſpeaking publickly, but
even not write in ſecret, in their own Houſes, the ſaving
Light that God communicates to them, and commands
them; and that when there is no fear of Confuſion, ſince
ſuch being very rare, it is not to be fear'd that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
will bring Confuſion. This is as far from his Opinion,
as Falſhood from Truth, who a little before allows a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

                  <q>Did they believe truly that there is a living God, they
durſt not treat ſo ill the things which are declared from
God, and cauſe to be burnt by the Hangman the Books
which the Holy Spirit has dictated, of which they may
have Evidence both from God and Men; for they who
ſee me write, know very well that I do it without any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Speculation or Study, and that this flows from my
Spirit as a River of Water flows from its Fountain, and
that I only lend my Hand and my Spirit to another Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than mine.—Many Perſons are Witneſſes of this.
God alſo has given me a more ſure Teſtimony, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
to me his Righteouſneſs, his Truth, and his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
for theſe things cannot come from Nature, which
being corrupt, cannot produce any Good, nor any Divine
Vertues; becauſe I am come from the corrupt maſs of
<hi>Adam,</hi> as all the reſt of Men, there could not be in me
any Righteouſneſs, Truth, or Charity, which are all
Divine and Supernatural Vertues, which come not into
the Souls of Men, but by the work of the Holy Spirit;
for none but God only is perfectly Juſt and True. And
no Body can glory in the Righteouſneſs, Truth, and
Charity that he poſſeſſes, without having a diſordered
Mind; becauſe theſe Vertues are no ways in the Perſon,
but in God alone, who imparts them to whom he pleaſes.
And he who has receiv'd any of theſe Vertues ought to
glorifie God, and not to glory in himſelf for them, as by
the Grace of God I do not glory in my ſelf. And I do
not fear that any Body can prove that I aſcribe any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
or Vertue any manner of way to my ſelf; for
God has given me too much of the Light of Truth to do
this, having made me ſee clearly that all Good comes
from God, and all Evil from Man and from the Devil;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94808:91"/>
which two Creatures being equally withdrawn from God,
the Fountain of all Good, are fallen into all ſort of Evil.
And therefore nothing can proceed from the corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man but Evil and Sin; for this cauſe a Man can
have no occaſion of glorying in himſelf for his Vertues,
which are not his, nor at his diſpoſal. And therefore <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardus</hi>
has ſaid moſt injuriouſly in his Book, that I
eſteem my ſelf more than the Prophets, Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
of whom I do not know to what Degrees of Grace they
arriv'd, that I ſhould compare them to the Graces that
God has imparted to me. I know well that I am a poor
Creature ſubject to many Miſeries and Infirmities, which
makes me often humble my ſelf before God and Man:
But I well know alſo that God dwells in my Heart by his
Righteouſneſs, Truth, and Charity, and that he makes
me govern all my Actions by the ſquare of theſe Vertues,
which is a ſufficient Evidence to me that it is God who
guides me, ſince the Devil and Nature have nothing of
theſe Vertues. And therefore there cannot be a ſurer
Teſtimony that a Soul is guided by the Holy Spirit, than
when it is poſſeſt with the Righteouſneſs, Truth, and
Charity of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I imagine if <hi>Bucchardus</hi> heard that I ſay, I have the
Truth,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 209.</note> Righteouſneſs, and Charity of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he will
condemn me more than ever, having done it ſo often thro'
his Book, tho' I had not there ſpoken openly of the
Graces which God had given me. But the being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
by ſo imperfect a Man, can do no hurt to my
Soul. For God knows, it is he who commands me to do
this, and it matters little whether it pleaſe or diſpleaſe
Men; it is enough to me, when it pleaſes God. Yet I
will not ſay that I have the ſame Degrees of the Vertues,
Righteouſneſs; and Charity that <hi>Moſes</hi> had: For God
has not reveal'd to me how much of them he imparted
to him; but I will only ſay, that my Soul is poſſeſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with the ſame Charity, Righteouſneſs, and Truth
that <hi>Moſes</hi> had; but if he had a Pound of each of
theſe Vertues, and I an Ounce only, I do not at all know,
neither will I ask; for the Vertue of another does not
concern me, it is enough for me that I be faithful in
what is committed to me. If God has given me his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love,</hi> I muſt do all my Actions, and form all my
Intentions for this Love, without ſeeking in any thing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94808:91"/>
my own, or the Satisfaction of Men; and if God has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me his Righteouſneſs, I muſt exerciſe this Vertue
equally in things great and little, according to my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
doing always juſtly to every one, even to my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
And God has ſo planted this Righteouſneſs in the
bottom of my Soul, that I cannot ſuffer Injuſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Beaſts, far leſs towards any Perſon. And the
Truth that God has imparted to me is ſo rooted in my
Soul, that I ſuffer for it all ſort of Perſecutions. And
tho' it be hard for me to ſuffer ſo much for having told
the Truth which God commands me, I cannot ceaſe to
do it. For it is better to obey God than Man.</q>

all this was ſpoken without blaſphemous Pride, appears by

cannot be denied; that God may give a fuller underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

ſhe calls her ſelf a Mother of True Believers, for which
the Anabaptiſts or Mennoniſts accuſe her of blaſphemous
Pride, ſhe unanſwerably vindicates her ſelf. <q>I do not
wonder, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> that thoſe Mennoniſts are ſcandaliz'd
at it, for they do not know from what Fund it is
taken; and while they think I am led by the ſame Spirit
with them, they muſt needs be ſcandaliz'd at the ſimple
Truth with which I expreſs my Sentiments. They think
I would do better to ſtudy humble Words, to ſpeak ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
in what relates to me; and that I ought not to tell
ſo openly the things which God communicates to me;
for they practice the quite contrary to my Sentiments,
and yet think they poſſeſs the fineſt Vertues. They have
for a Maxim, to learn to ſpeak humbly; and have for
Rules, to be ſimply apparel'd, to be ſtrictly united to their
Party, and not to converſe nor drink or eat with thoſe
who are cut off from it, and far leſs to aſſiſt them any
manner of way. And all theſe things are contrary to
what God has planted in my Soul.—To ſtudy to ſpeak
humbly of ones ſelf, having a proud Heart, is a great
Pride accompanied with Deceit and Lying: The Pride
conſiſts in deſiring to be thought Humble before Men, by
ſpeaking humbly; the Lying conſiſts in ſaying often that
which is Falſe; for he who ſays he is Weak and has no
Good in him, is ſometimes ſo proud at the Bottom, that
he cannot endure that another ſhould have ſo mean
Thoughts of him, and would be ill content to hear ſome
one ſay that he has not Vertue, or that he is not in a State
of Perfection.</q>

                  <q>Do you not remember, Sir, that ſome of thoſe learned
Perſons ask'd you, if I durſt ſay that they are not rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in Jeſus Chriſt, while none of their Actions do
diſcover this Regeneration? For we ſee them as much
wedded to earthly things as other Men; for they are well
pleas'd to be honoured, and ſerved, and eſteemed by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body. If they were regenerated, all theſe Deſires
would be dead in them; the Spirit of Poverty, Sufferings,
Humility, and Charity would effectually live in their
Souls; for Regeneration conſiſts in dying to ones ſelf to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94808:92"/>
live to God, and if they were dead to the World, they wuold
ſeek the things which are above, and no longer thoſe
which are on Earth.—And yet they who are ſunk into
the Traffick of the World, and gain as much as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them; would have it be believ'd that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, tho' all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be quite contrary to thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
for tho' they ſpeak humbly, and have an humble
Shew and Geſtures, yet they have a very proud Heart,
and then they would have it believed that they are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
and would take it in ill part if I would ſay they
are not.—They do not perceive that it is a greater Pride
in them to ſay that they are regenerated, than in me to
ſay, that I am a Mother of true Believers; for he who is
regenerated in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, lives no longer,
but Jeſus Chriſt lives in him.—And a Mother of True
Believers, is nothing but a frail Creature, who may yet ſin
and undo her ſelf.—It is a ſmall matter to be a Mother
or Father of True Believers, as to our own Perfection,
this gives us no more. If God give us ſufficient Light for
the Conduct of our own Life in particular, or if he give
us of it in Abundance to enlighten others alſo, this will
not add one Degree of Glory to our Soul, but in as far
as we have been faithful Diſpenſers of the Graces of God.
For to be only the matter of a Father or Mother of True
Believers, a Statue or Image of Wood or Stone would
ſerve as well as a living Perſon; for as much as God is not
tied to any thing, he can as well ſpeak by the Organ of a
Statue of Wood or Stone, as he did heretofore by Clouds,
by a burning Buſh; by Thunder; all theſe matters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
boaſt themſelves becauſe God operates by them, for
he has equally Power over all things, and makes uſe of
ſuch Inſtruments as he pleaſes. If he will beget True

I had explain'd to them what I meant by that Word,
a Mother of True Believers, that I underſtood that all
thoſe whom God ſhall make uſe of for the Converſion of
others, ſhall be the True Fathers and Mothers of thoſe
who ſhall become True Believers by their means; and
that it is after this manner that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
you.</hi> The Apoſtle knew well that he had not Power
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94808:93"/>
to beget Children to God; but he perceived well that God
gave him Light in his Underſtanding, and Words in his
Mouth, and Charity in his Heart; and that by all theſe
things many would be regenerated, by becoming True
Children of God, and dying to the Fleſh, to live to the
Spirit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have explain'd this Word of Mother of True Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 58.</note>
by ſaying, that God by my Organ will give his Light
to Men, by which they ſhall ſee their Darkneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Underſtanding of the Truth. This Light with
which he will produce True Believers is not mine, tho'
he produce them by my Mouth, my Hand, or my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but it is God's, even as our Bodies are not our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
but of God, for they cannot make one Hair of our
Head, yet God calls them Fathers and Mothers, and
commands to obey them, under pain of Damnation.</q>

               <p>This one Inſtance of an Expreſſion ſo highly exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
formerly, and of late, which I think ſhe vindicates as
to the true Sence and Meaning, to the Satisfaction of all
equitable Readers, (upon the ſuppoſition of her being
endued with Light by God for the Good of others) this
Inſtance I ſay may ſerve for a Sample to ſhew how unjuſt
Men are in forming Characters of Perſons from ſhreds of
Expreſſions gathered here and there and put altogether,
without letting the World ſee the Contexts of them, the
main Scope of them, or the Sence and Meaning given of
them by the Perſons concern'd, and how highly thereby
they ſin againſt the Truth, murther the Reputation of
ſuch, impoſe upon the reſt of Mankind, and beget (and
become real Fathers of) Hatred and Averſion in their Minds
and Spirits. <hi>Lord open their Eyes, and lay not this Sin to
their Charge.</hi>

Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> treated Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Abraham, ſay they, is

well of themſelves, and not from a Spirit of Pride or Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorying,
as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>David, S. Paul,</hi> and
other Saints have done. Falſe Humility ſpeaks meanly of
ones ſelf to cover its ſecret Pride, and to get the Reputation
of being humble. True Humility ſpeaks the Truth in
Simplicity, whether of ones ſelf or others, without regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the World will Cenſure it as an Effect of Pride
and Vain-glory. By this Spirit the Saints were acted, from

Sentiments and Opinions, upon Parties and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
which they do not own: She, <hi>ſay they,</hi> makes Men
more guilty than they are; ſhe imputes to particular
Perſons, to Doctors, and even to whole Parties, Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Vices and Sins which they have not, and of which
all think them innocent. With this alſo the Enemies of
Jeſus Chriſt did reproach him, that he falſly imputed to
them Evils of which they were innocent, as Murther:
<hi>Thou haſt a Devil who ſeeks to kill thee?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 7. 20.</note> Jeſus Chriſt tells

and they wholly diſclaim it. The <hi>Jews,</hi> not doubt, were
aſtoniſh'd when the Prophets imputed to them atheiſtical,

Providence, and the Immortality of the Soul, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their chief Happineſs to conſiſt in being wicked. No
doubt they would cry out againſt them as Calumniators,
and imputing to them Sentiments quite contrary to what
they had. It is like this was not their Doctrine, nor the
Sentiments according to which they reaſoned, far leſs the
Subject of their publick Inſtructions. And yet God by his
Prophets reproaches them with it, as if they had taught it
in expreſs Terms.<note place="margin">Ezek. 9. 9. Iſ. 22. 13, 28. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſays of them; <hi>They ſay the

This was not true in the Sight of Men, but it was true in
the Sight of God, who ſaw that there were no living Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
in their Hearts of the Divine Providence, of a
happy or miſerable Eternity, of the great Happineſs of
Vertue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are generally two ſorts of Principles and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Men, which do widely differ from one another;
one by which they reaſon, and diſcourſe, and preach, and
write Books, and teach Doctrines; and this is their ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Principle. The other is that by which a Man acts
and governs both his inward Affections and his Life. This
laſt only is a Man's true Sentiments and Principle, tho' for
the moſt part this is unknown to the Man himſelf. S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
before his Converſion, and e'er he was enlightned by the
Holy Ghoſt, would have been highly offended with any
that ſhould have call'd him a Blaſphemer, a Perſecuter of
God, and good Men, and the Chief of Sinners, as imputing
to him Crimes and Sentiments of which he not only thought
himſelf innocent, but that thoſe very things were Vertues
in the Sight of God; tho' when God opened his Eyes, he
found he had been truly ſuch. So ſtrange is the Blindneſs
of corrupt Man! Therefore when God would deliver Men
from Death, he ſtops not at the outward Appearance, and
what Men ſay, and at their dead Reaſonings and Sentiments,
who may tell him, <hi>We teach Vertue, we preach good Works,
we recommend Mortification of the Old Man, we deteſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and Preſumption,</hi> &amp;c. while in effect their Lives are
regulated by quite contrary Principles, and their Hearts
live in another Element; and therefore he warns them of
that which is hid within them, and which they do not yet
perceive, and tells them, that tho' <hi>they profeſs to know him,
yet by their Works they deny him, being abominable, diſobedient,
and to every good Work reprobate.</hi> Now it is according to
this Meaſure that <hi>A. B.</hi> ſpeaks of Men and Parties, and of
their Sentiments. When a whole Society lives according to
Principles, the contrary of which they affirm with their
Mouths, it is certain this may be imputed to that Society.
When the greateſt part of particular Perſons in that Society
have certain Sentiments, as to flatter themſelves that they
are in the State of Grace, or predeſtinated to Salvation, it is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94808:94"/>
certain that the Society, in the groſs, may be ſaid to have
theſe Sentiments.<note place="margin">Vide pref. apolog. Le Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moign. de Verite. Part 1. p. 90.</note> If, while they live in a worldly and
carnal Manner, yet they commonly believe they ſhall be
ſaved by the Uſe of the Ceremonies and Sacraments, this is
to be reckoned the real Sentiment of the Society in groſs,
tho' the Speculations of ſome particular Perſons and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
do not ſay ſo. It is the People that makes the Church,
and not a ſmall Number of learned Heads. It is the living
and inward Principles, Inclinations and Diſpoſitions of the
Spirits and Hearts of the People that makes the Sentiments
of the Church, and not ſome vain Theories of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which are oft-times dead and barren in their own
Hearts. When in a Society ſome particular Perſons teach
expreſly evil Doctrines, as the Juſtifying of horrid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or that we may be ſaved without the Love of God,
and direct Souls according to theſe Doctrines; if the whole
Body of ſuch a Church, knowing this, do not openly and
loudly extirpate ſuch a Doctrine by their Councils or other
proper Means, undoubtedly ſuch a Society, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
they who preſide in it, are reckoned by God as if they
themſelves authoritatively taught and maintained theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
Maxims. Now if what <hi>A. B.</hi> ſays as to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Sentiments, and Evils of Parties or Perſons be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by theſe Rules, it will appear that ſhe imputes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to them falſly.</p>
               <p>XXV.<note place="margin">XXV. Of wrong Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Scriptures.</note> Another Accuſation brought againſt <hi>A. B.</hi> is, that
ſhe gives wrong Explications of ſeveral Paſſages in the Holy
Scripture, as her applying that of S. <hi>Paul, We know in part,</hi> &amp;c.
to a greater Degree of Knowledge and Illumination than
God will give in this laſt Age of the World. Her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Words of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 23. of his
glorious Appearing in the End of the World, when the
Context ſhews it is meant of his Death and Sufferings;
her ſingular Expoſition of the Lord's Prayer, as containing
things that we are to obtain only in Perfection when Chriſt
comes to reign in Glory. We ſee what Expoſitions the
Apoſtles give of the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, and
the Fathers, of both the Old and New, which oft-times
ſeem very different from the Sence that naturally offers.
S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Rule, already mentioned, has Place here,
<q>That whoſoever gives ſuch a Sence of the Scripture as
ſerves to promote the Love of God and our Neighbours,
which is the great End, tho' it cannot be made appear
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94808:95"/>
that the Pen-man of the Scripture did ſo underſtand it in
that particular Place, he does not err damnably, nor does
he make a Lye.</q>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de Doct. Chr. Lib. 3. c. 27</note> But that other remarkable Rule he gives,
ſerves fully to remove this Accuſation. <q>That as to all the
Sences that are given of the Holy Scripture, which are
not repugnant to the Truth, it is to be believed they
were intended by the Holy Spirit. That when many
Sences are given of the ſame Words, if it appear from
other Places of the Scripture, that they are agreeable to
the Truth and to Faith, there is no Danger. For perhaps
the Author of thoſe Writings did perceive the ſame
Sence of them; and certainly the Spirit of God, who
wrought by him, foreſaw without doubt that this would
occur to the Reader and the Hearer, yea, took care that it
ſhould occur. For what more liberal and bountiful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
could be made by God in the Divine Oracles, than that
the ſame Words ſhould be underſtood in many Sences, all
which the other no leſs Divine Writings might confirm.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Agreeable to this,<note place="margin">M. Weye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri Effata. Eff. 1.</note> we have a Divine Maxim of a pious
Writer of the laſt Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That, according to the State
that Man is in, ſo he underſtands the Holy Scripture;
if he be as yet in the State of Nature, he explains it of
Natural Things; if he have aſcended higher, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
it of more ſublime Things; and the higher State
he is advanced to, he ſtill finds ſo much the more ſublime
Teſtimonies of things in the Scripture. Inferiour things
are the Image and Similitude of the ſuperiour: If a Man
therefore be in the loweſt Degree, the Scripture propoſes
low things to him; but if he be placed in ſuperiour De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
it points out to him higher things.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>When <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Not in Rioting and Drunkenneſs, not
in Chambering and Wantonneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 19. this
concerns a Man according to the different State of this
Life, either literally or ſpiritually: If he live carnally, it is
to be underſtood of the viſible Fleſh: If he lives ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
it denotes alſo the Fleſh, but a more ſubtile Fleſh,
to which he muſt likewiſe die. But before he die to it,
he muſt firſt live to it; but he cannot live to it until he
be firſt dead to the more groſs Carnality.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is impoſſible that a Man can conceive this ſublime
Way of Dying until he have attained to that Degree,
but if any attain it rather in the Contemplation than as to
the true Eſſence of things, there is great Hazard of Erring.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:94808:95"/>
                  <q>The carnal Life ſpiritually underſtood, is moſt clearly
expreſs'd in that <hi>rich Man who was cloathed in Purple,
and fared ſumptuouſly;</hi> while on the other hand <hi>Lazarus
was lying poor, and hungry, and naked, and full of Sores.</hi>
But what's the Event? Riches are reduced into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt
Poverty, and extream Poverty is exchanged for
the greateſt Riches.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ought to conſider that the Holy Scriptures are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
by the Spirit of God, to afford Life and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Mens Souls, according to all the different States
of Men, and all the ſeveral Ages of the Church, to the end
of the World; and as the ſame Holy Spirit that endited
them gives the true Underſtanding of them only to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſimple Souls, ſo he gives them different Degrees
of Light and Notices from them, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
States they are advanced to, when it is for their own
ſpiritual Profit only; or according to the different States
of the Church, when it is for the ſpiritual Good of the reſt
of Mankind, and when he is to accompliſh the things
he has foretold; and all theſe Sences are intended by
the Holy Spirit, one of them always being not only true
in it ſelf, but alſo a. Figure and Similitude of what is to
follow, and the full Sence of them cannot be had till the
Perfection and Completion of all things. We ſee an
Image of this in Natural Things. Thus the Buds of Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees
in the Winter-ſeaſon are very ſmall to Appearance,
and ſeem nothing but a little dry Excreſcence; but when
the Spring comes, firſt the Leaves break forth, and after
them the Flowers and Bloſſoms, and laſt of all the Fruit,
which by Degrees advances to Ripeneſs and Perfection; all
which are not new form'd, but were originally in the Bud,
even in the Winter-ſeaſon, and were diſcoverable by mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
Glaſſes, ſo they are only an Evolution and Diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what was all formerly ſhut up in the Bud, according
to the different Seaſons. Thus from the ſmall Eggs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects
there break out firſt Caterpillars and ſmall Worms,
which afterwards caſting Skins, put on another Shape, and
at laſt break forth into Butterflies, or Flies of their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Kinds, which is no Transformation, but an Evolution
of Parts which were formerly wrapp'd up within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillar,
as it were in Swaddling-cloaths (as Dr. <hi>Swam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merdam</hi>
moſt ingeniouſly diſcovers) and were no doubt
alſo originally within the little Egg. So the ſame Seed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94808:96"/>
of the Word of God, which to the natural Man ſeems dry
and inſipid, does by the Warmth and Operation of God's
Spirit diſplay different Degrees of Light and Truth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the different Degrees by which the Soul advances
towards God, or the Periods of Time in which things are
to be accompliſhed, the Diſplaying of one Degree ſtill
making Way for another. Thus God in his Word has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
Idolatry; when all the Heathen Nations were given
to the Worſhipping of Idols, and the Groſſneſs and Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation was ſuch, that they were eaſily led
to imitate them, the Commandment was underſtood no
farther. But when afterwards in our Saviour's Days they
had a ſufficient Averſion from the worſhipping of outward
Idols in Groves or Temples; but in the mean time their
Hearts were ſet upon Riches and this Worlds Goods, the
Commandment was farther explained, and they were told
that that was <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and that they <hi>could not ſerve God
and Mammon.</hi> And as the Soul is weaned from this Idol
and advances to another State, the Spirit of God does there
alſo diſcover to it other more ſpiritual things which it is
ready to worſhip inſtead of God, and ſo the Sence of God's
Law is diſplayed to it, far beyond what could be at firſt
conceived. So true is that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I have ſeen an
end of all Perfections, but thy Commandments is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
broad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, with thoſe who are not diſpoſed to cavil, will ſerve
to clear <hi>A. B.</hi> as to this Accuſation form'd againſt her. And
as to the Paſſages mentioned, as 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 8. &amp;c.</hi> tho' ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
it is to be underſtood of the Life to come, yet it is
no Abſurdity, to ſay that it may imply alſo a more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Light and Communication of God's Spirit in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.
S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> we ſee, gives an Interpretation of it
relating even to this preſent Life. <q>They, <hi>ſays he,</hi> who
have Faith,<note place="margin">Aug. de Doct Chr. L 1. c 39.</note> Hope, and Charity, and do firmly cleave to
them, do not need the Scriptures except for Inſtructing
others. And therefore many live by theſe Three in the
Deſart, without Books. Whence I think that Saying is
already fulfilled in them; Whether there be Prophecies,
they ſhall fail; whether there be Tongues, they ſhall
ceaſe; whether there be Knowledge, it ſhall vaniſh
away.</q> As to <hi>Job.</hi> 12. 32. I think it will be granted that
the full Completion of it is not yet come to paſs, but is
that we look for. As for her Expoſition of the Lord's

                  <q>That in it is comprehended all that we
can ever ask of God for his Honour and our Salvation;
all the Adorations we owe to God; all the Thankſgivings
we can render him; all that we may or ought to ask of

Sence likewiſe, as ſhe does ſo interpret it in other Places,
yet ſince it contains all that we ought to ask of God, and
nothing in Perfection is granted here, and God will not
make us ask the things which he has no Mind to grant, it
is moſt reaſonable to conclude that this moſt excellent
Prayer in its compleat and perfect Sence refers to a future
State, which he would have us always to long after, (as
the Jews did <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> when they were by the Rivers of
<hi>Babylon</hi>) and in which we ſhall obtain in Perfection the

continued always in the State of Innocence perfectly Pure
and Holy, whether they would have called his State a
<hi>Mahumetan</hi> Paradiſe, and a ſenſual Life. If there were no
Concupiſcence in Man's Nature, but a moſt ardent, pure,
and habitual Love of God, the Beauties and Delights of
all the Creatures would ſerve to enflame the Soul ſtill the
more with the Love of God. There needs no more but
to underſtand her Sentiments, to be convinced of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
Falſhood of their Reproaches.</p>
               <p>She ſays then, That the Earth, and all this viſible World
being wholly renewed and reſtored to that glorious State
in which it was at firſt formed, (of which in the <hi>Firſt Part</hi>)
ſhall be the Seat of the Kingdom of God with Men for
ever, where Jeſus Chriſt, God-Man, will reign with the
Bleſſed, both as to his Divinity and Humanity. That Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as to the Soul, is the Preſence of God, and we are in
Heaven, when we are in God, and God is in Heaven as he
is in the Souls of his Saints, as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> interprets, <hi>Our
Father which art in the Heavens;</hi> but as God has given us
both a Body and Soul, he has given us alſo a Paradiſe of
both, the Soul can have its compleat Paradiſe in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, but the Body muſt have a material and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
one, like it ſelf: For this end, the Earth, and all this
viſible World, and all that therein is, were created, and for
the ſame Reaſon God would have become Man, tho' Man
had never ſinn'd, that he might live with him both bodily
and ſpiritually, and to make his Happineſs compleat. And
therefore he being unchangeable in his infinitely Wiſe and
Good Deſigns, he will certainly make, not an imaginary,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94808:97"/>
but a real, divine, and corporeal Reparation of all things to
laſt for ever; for his Recompences are Eternal, and will
purge away from all the Creatures the Malignity and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
that Sin has brought upon them. And in this
State every individual Saint being reſtored in Body and
Soul to the State in which <hi>Adam</hi> was in his greateſt purity
before the Woman was formed out of him; ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
his like of himſelf alone through all Eternity, from
a Principle of the Love of God, and by an ardent Deſire
that there may be ſtill more Creatures to love and praiſe
the Divine Majeſty. This then ſhall not be a corrupt, luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and ſhameful Propagation, like to that of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
World, but altogether Pure, Holy, and Glorious;
as we ſee in a manner an earthly Figure of it ſtill in all the
Plants and Trees.<note place="margin">Matt. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now what is there in all this, unworthy of God, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable
to the State of the Bleſſed, or contrary to the
Holy Scriptures, or to the Nature of things? It is certain
none of the Works of God ſhall periſh, but all ſhall be
reſtored to their primitive Perfection. The Scripture tells
us there ſhall <hi>be a new Heaven and a new Earth.</hi> Whoſe
Habitation would the Earth have been if Man had never
ſinn'd, and if the Earth had never been accurſed? And
whoſe Habitation ſhall it be when it is renewed and made
a new Earth? When Men fancied all the Works of God
to be ſhut up as it were in a round Sphere, and the Earth
to be its Centre, and the Planetary and Starry Heavens
ſo many firm and ſolid Orbs moving round about it, and
the Empyreal Heaven above all, this Sentiment about the
Earth might have been thought abſurd. But in the Age
we live in, wherein is made known the vaſtneſs of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
and that all the fix'd Stars are probably Suns and
Centres of different Syſtems of the whole, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Planets as well as our Earth among which it moves,
repleniſh'd no doubt with variety of living and intelligent
Beings, we have reaſon to admire the Providence of God
in giving Diſcoveries to a ſimple unlearned Woman, of the
State and Habitation of the Bleſſed, ſutable to what is now
known of the Frame of the Univerſe, which is alſo fully
confirmed from the Holy Scriptures, as was ſhewn in the
<hi>Firſt Part;</hi> and does ſo clearly demonſtrate the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94808:98"/>
Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, who having created
Man in a Pure and Happy State, and the Delights and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this World for his Acceſſory Felicity; and the Devil
by his Craft and Subtilty having perverted both, and made
this Earth for many Ages nothing but Scenes of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Miſery; yet God by his infinitely Wiſe Conduct
and Providence brings about at laſt the perfect Renovation
of Man, and of his Habitation, the Earth, and of all the
Creatures, and makes it an Eternal Paradiſe of unſpotted
Purity and Bliſs: Whereas on the other Hand it is moſt
unaccountable how infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, who
changes not, after he had form'd Man and this World in
ſo excellent a State, and both are corrupted by the Devils,
ſhould continue the Earth for ſo many Ages, to be the
Theatre of their Wickedneſs, and then entirely deſtroy it.
Might it not then be ſaid, as ſhe expreſſes it, That God
had created the Earth and ſo many reaſonable Creatures,
only for the Glory of the Devil and his Adherents, if he
did not renew the Earth, and make it bring forth Fruit for
his Glory.</p>
               <p>And as to Man's Propagation of his like to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
if Man had continued Pure and Holy, I am ſure this
would not have been thought a ſenſual State. A Power to
produce a Creature that is capable of loving and enjoying
God, is an aſtoniſhing Perfection; only Concupiſcence has
now ſo polluted our Hearts that we cannot think of this,
but our Imagination preſently defiles it, and we joyn it to
the ſenſual Idea's that Sin and Luſt have brought into
the World, and cannot conceive how the one can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the other, judging of things according to our Corrupt
Nature; and we preſently cry out, <hi>A Mahumetan Paradiſe!</hi>
Which truly diſcovers only the Filthineſs and Corruption
of our Hearts, and not the Impurity of the Sentiment,
but only, that to the Impure nothing is pure. If there
were a Creature perfectly Pure and Holy, and if God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
it with a Power of producing its like, this Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would be no Act of Concupiſcence, but an Act of the
moſt ardent Love of God. This is the State, <hi>ſhe ſays,</hi> the
Saints ſhall be in to all Eternity, which, whatever be of
the Truth of it, is no <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Paradiſe; and as there
are remarkable Places of Scripture cited for the Proof of
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the Reaſon ſhe aſſigns is very weighty, to wit, That
all the Works of God are Eternal, and his Gifts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94808:98"/>
out Repentance; and if there were no ſuch Production
to all Eternity, a very ſmall number of Men would bleſs
him for rever, whereas ſo many reaſonable Creatures are
become Adherents to the Devil. It muſt needs be then,
that the Generation of the Bleſſed multiply eternally, as
the Generation of the Miſerable has multiplied temporally
from the Beginning of the World.</p>
               <p>And why ſhould we think it abſurd to ſay, that Angels
do thus produce their like to all Eternity? We ſee here in
this viſible World that all Creatures who have any Degree
of Life, from the higheſt to the loweſt, are endued with this
Power of producing their like; all the Plants and Trees, all
the Beaſts, Birds, Fiſhes and Inſects, and the reaſonable
Creature, Man, both as to his Soul and Body, as has been
made appear; and you know the Rule of Analogy is of
great weight as to all the Works of Nature. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unleſs we ſhould ſuppoſe God to act unlike himſelf,
as to a higher Degree of living Beings, we have all the
Reaſon that the Nature and Analogy of things does ſuggeſt,
to conclude that Angels alſo do produce their like, to all
Eternity.</p>

by ſeeing the many falſe Pretenders to Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
which have been in the World. The Devil ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
always to ape and counteract God, and ſince he can
eaſily transform himſelf into an Angel of Light, he moſt
effectually undermines the True Religion of Jeſus Chriſt,
by appearing to be for it, and under a Cover of Religion,
he inſinuates into Mens Minds his Infernal Qualities of
Pride, Hypocriſie, and Unrighteouſneſs; and one of the
Diſguiſes under which he acts, is that of a Pretence to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inſpiration, and the being led by the Spirit of God.
And this he has done in all Ages, both before and ſince
the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt. He rais'd up among the Jews
falſe Prophets, and that eſpecially when there were any
truly inſpir'd by God, that thoſe laſt might be diſcredited
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94808:100"/>
and deſpiſed, becauſe of the Impoſtures of the other: And
this is alſo one of the Artifices he had uſed among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
through all the Ages of the Church, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in this laſt Age, ſetting up whole Orders and Societies
of Perſons who pretend to be immediately enlightned and
guided by the Spirit of God, tho' the quite contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by their Life and Spirit. And thereby he not only
infatuates ſome, but makes them alſo ſuch a Stumbling-Block
to others, as to make ſome of them to deſpiſe all
Revelation from God, and to look upon it as an Impoſture,
and others to be altogether prejudic'd againſt any who may
be truly inſpir'd by God, in this preſent Age, tho' the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
were never ſo Unconteſtable and Convincing; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they own the Divine Authority of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
becauſe the Convincing Reaſons which prove it,
have not the Prejudices of a contrary Education to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

in Diſparaging and putting out of Credit with the Wiſe,

it is a folly to think of Convincing them that God

were ſincerely, and truly rational, and not fantaſtically ſo,

to ſee a Chain of Sentiments, ſo well connected,
ſo agreeable to True Reaſon, ſo worthy of God, ſo ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Divine Perfections, ſo clearly pointing out the
Nature and Duty of Man, the great End of his Being, and
the true way to proſecute it, ſo plainly unfolding the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of Providence, and the paſt, preſent, and future
State of the World; ſo far beyond all that ever any, or
all of the Philoſophers have ſaid of former or later Ages;
and that declared by an illiterate Woman, void of all Study

to love and to enjoy his Maker, and that he might take his
Delight with Man, his Soul was originally deſign'd for
God's Temple and Dwelling-place, that he might reſide
in it, and fill it with his Light and Love. And tho' Man
by turning away from God, did wilfully deprive himſelf
of this Happineſs, yet through the Merits and Interceſſion
of Jeſus Chriſt, God has pity on him, and continues to
proſecute his firſt Deſign of taking his Delight with him:
And this is the End of all his outward Diſpenſations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Man. Therefore, ſays St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> 
                  <q>We ought
in all things to lead ſo pure a Life, as that we ſhould no
ways need the help of Letters, but inſtead of them
ſhould uſe the Grace of the Holy Spirit; that the Holy
Spirit might write upon the Table of our Hearts, as they
write upon Paper. But ſince we have thruſt this Grace
from us, let us at leaſt make uſe of the ſecond Mercy. But
that the firſt was far more ſublime, God makes appear
both by his Words and Deeds. For he ſpoke to <hi>Noah,</hi>
and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Poſterity, and to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
not by Scripture, but by himſelf, becauſe he found
their Hearts Pure. But when all the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
did degenerate into the Sink of Vices, then Scripture and
Tables were given them, by which they were warn'd.
And we ſee this happened not only to the Holy Men of
the Old Teſtament, but alſo of the New. For Chriſt
did not deliver any Writing to the Apoſtles, but inſtead
of Scripture promiſed to give them the Grace of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit: He, <hi>ſays he,</hi> will teach you all things. And
that you may know that this is far better than the other,
hear what the Lord ſays by the Prophet: And I, ſaith
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94808:101"/>
the Lord, will make a New Covenant with you: I will
put my Laws in your Minds, and write them in your
Hearts, and they ſhall be all taught of God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo,
to ſhew the Excellency of this, ſays, he had receiv'd the
Law not in Tables of Stone, but in fleſhly Tables of the
Heart. But becauſe in proceſs of time many had ſtray'd
from the right way, they needed therefore again that
Warning that is given by Scripture. Conſider then what
a Degree of Madneſs it is, that when we ought to lead
a Life of ſuch Integrity and Perfection, as not to need
Scripture, but ſhould yield up our Hearts to the Holy
Spirit for Paper to be writ upon; how is it, I ſay, if
when we have loſt this firſt Dignity, and ſtand in need of
the leſſer, yet we will not uſe aright even this ſecond Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for our Salvation.</q> Thus he begins the Preface to
his Homilies on St. <hi>Matt.</hi> ſhewing, that if Mens Hearts
were pure, God would ſpeak inwardly to them by his Holy
Spirit; that he has done ſo to pure and well-diſpoſed Souls
both under the Old and New Teſtament; and that the
Scriptures are a ſecond Remedy which God makes uſe of
becauſe of the Blindneſs and Impurity of Mens Hearts.
Thus St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Aug. de Doct. Chr. Lib. 1. c. 10. 11.</note> likewiſe makes appear that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and all the outward Diſpenſations of the Goſpel do
lead us to this, and that a pure Heart, and a good Life are
neceſſary Diſpoſitions for it. St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, that<note n="a" place="margin">John 1. 1, 4, 5, 9, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>In the

Word was God. In him was Life, and the Life was the Light
of Men, and the Light ſhineth in Darkneſs, and the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
comprehended it not. That was the true Light which
lighteth every Man that cometh into the World. And the Word
was made Fleſh and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the Glory as of the only Begotten of the Father) full of
Grace and Truth.</hi> And our Saviour ſays, He<note n="b" place="margin">John 14 21, 22, 23.</note> that <hi>hath my

Inſtruction of Mankind is to be expected after the Days
of the Apoſtles, becauſe the Will of God, and the Way
of Salvation were clearly and fully declar'd by Jeſus Chriſt;
if this Argument were good, it would follow that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Apoſtles is not to be received as a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
but in ſo far as it contains a Relation of that
which was delivered to them by Jeſus Chriſt, whereas it is
certain they delivered to the Church many other things
immediately taught them by the Spirit of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from the Fulneſs, Clearneſs, and Perfection of the
Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt we may well infer that there ſhall
be no Revelation of a New Doctrine or a New Religion
after it; but nevertheleſs, an immediate Revelation ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to explain and illuſtrate the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt,
to vindicate it from the falſe Gloſſes of Corrupt Teachers,
and to awaken and excite Men to follow and obey it, may
be both uſeful and neceſſary. The Jewiſh State did no
more call for his Mercy, than does ours: Have we the
whole Will of God and our Duty conſign'd to us in Writ?
So had they: Was it that from time to time their Faith

of the Prieſt and People, that they needed ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Meſſages and Warnings from God? So do we: Ought
we to reject all who lay any Claim to Divine Inſpiration
without any farther Enquiry, becauſe there are in this Age
many Impoſtours, Enthuſiaſts, who falſly pretend to be
led by the Spirit of God, and are not? So might they:
Were they in Circumſtances to diſcern thoſe who were
truly led by the Spirit of God, from thoſe who were acted
by a Lying Spirit? So may we. So that from the Nature
of God, the Methods of his dealing with Men, and the

                  <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 2. 16, 17.</note> applies this Prophecy to the Deſcent of the Holy

meant not thereby to limit that Promiſe to that Time, as
if it had its full Completion, but to ſhew that then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be fulfilled, and that Jeſus being now aſcended to
his Father, and having received the Promiſe of the Holy
Ghoſt, had ſhed forth this upon them. And it evidently
appears that he did not limit it to that Time, but ſhew
that that was rather the firſt Fruits of it, and that it was
to be fulfilled and continued in all After-ages; he ſaying
expreſly,<note n="c" place="margin">Act 2. 38, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Repent and be baptized, every one of you in the

unto you and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even
as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> Which was as it
were a Preludium and firſt Fruits of what they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.

liberally, and to perform meanly and ſparingly; and the
Number of Perſons on whom the Gifts of the Spirit were
poured out in thoſe Days was too ſmall to fill up the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of <hi>Joel</hi>'s Prophecy, eſpecially if we compare it with
and interpret it by other Prophecies of the ſame Nature, it
will appear that this is a Mercy which God deſigns to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
in a higher Meaſure after the coming of Jeſus
Chriſt than formerly. For he has promiſed that <hi>he will put
his Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts.—And

among Chriſtians now adays, is not becauſe the Lord's Hand
is ſhortned, that he cannot do it, or that this was a Mercy to
be ſhewn only to the firſt Chriſtians; but becauſe our Sins

                  <q>The ſureſt Mark to know true Prophets,<note place="margin">Tomb. de la fauſſ. Theol. Part 1. p. 77, 78.</note> is to remark
if they who call themſelves ſuch are true Chriſtians,
ſince of Neceſſity they muſt firſt be this, before they
can be true Prophets.—Examine if they have the
Qualities of a true Chriſtian, and if they truly know
God.—He who truly knows him, loves him, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
love him without partaking of his Divine Qualities
and being transform'd into them: As God is good, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and true, ſo will he be who truly knows and loves
him. If we ſee in theſe Prophets any thing contrary to
the Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs and Truth of God, we muſt
not believe that they are ſent from him, becauſe he who
is his Friend is always transform'd into him, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
expreſly of his Three Qualities, Righteouſneſs,
Goodneſs and Truth, bringing them forth in all his
Works.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>They alſo are not true Chriſtians who are not true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
and Followers of Jeſus Chriſt. To be his Diſciple
we muſt do as he did; and to be his Follower we muſt
depend in all things on God as he depended; and be
willing, for the Salvation of our Neighbour, to endure
hard Treatments, Affronts, Pains, yea, Death. And if
they who call themſelves Prophets are not poſſeſs'd with
this Sentiment, they have not true Charity, are not true
Chriſtians,</q> nor the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

and the Eight Beatitudes, you ought not to believe
it: For theſe Marks are infallible to a truly Chriſtian

               <p>
                  <q>The Affectation of Deſiring that People believe them,
is a Sign that they ſeek their own Glory: For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of God affects nothing and forces nothing. He
only declares his Commiſſion to him to whom he is
ſent, as a Meſſenger that has no Concern in the Contents
of the Letter that he carries. Therefore they uſe to
make themſelves be believed; the Deſires they have
that their Prophecies may come to paſs, and their Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs
to act in their Deſigns, ſhew that they ſeek
their own Satisfaction; For the Friend of God acts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with Meekneſs and Indifferency, leaving all the
Succeſs of his Commiſſion to God; and he is as content
with his own Confuſion as with his Honour, ſeeking

conformably and alſo with Conſtancy; for there can be
no mutability in God; what he ſaid to the Ancient
Prophets, he ſays yet now adays to the Souls which he
poſſeſſeth. They can be no new Prophecies, for God
has for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the underſtanding and clearing of theſe ancient Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to Souls reſign'd to him. Neither do they bring new
Laws or Inſtructions, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt has brought
the laſt which is the Goſpel, and he teaches all things in
Perfection, and what Men ought to do and avoid, that
they may return to a Dependance upon God, from
whence they have ſtrayed; and this ſo perfectly, that he
has perfectly compleated all the Laws and all ſaving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions:
So that if any would teach another thing, he
is a Seducer and ought not to be believed.</q>

upon God, making this appear to them by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Truths and by ſo clear Reaſons, that all Men of ſound
judgment may comprehend it; theſe things ought not
to be rejected becauſe they are good in themſelves, and
cannot but profit thoſe who believe them, tho' they
ſhould come from the Mouth of a falſe Prophet, yea of
the Devil himſelf. We ought not then to ſtick ſo much
at examining the Inſtrument from whence thoſe Truths
came, to know if it be true and good, and aim at God's
Glory and the Salvation of Souls. For God makes uſe
ſometimes of Perſons who are imperfect and vicious,
yea, of the Devil himſelf, to declare to us the Truth
that is neceſſary for us, that we may not pretend Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or blame God for our Damnation, as being wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to warn us. He therefore ſometimes makes Beaſts,
wicked and poſſeſs'd Perſons to ſpeak, that they may
manifeſt his Will to us; but we muſt not therefore make
reckoning of the Beaſts, Devils, and wicked Perſons, but
Profit by the Things that God makes known to us by
them, when that which they ſay is good and true.</q>

God was written in her Heart, from whence her Doctrine
came as from a Fountain of Living Water ſpringing up to
Everlaſting Life, and was not derived from the broken

Anſwer to which ſhe ſays.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is a great Ignorance to deſire to ſee Miracles that we
may believe that a Soul is poſſeſt with the Holy Spirit;
for the Devil at this time can eaſily do Wonders. Jeſus
Chriſt has aſſur'd us that in the laſt Times many falſe
Prophets will ariſe that ſhall do great Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
And we live now in the Reign of Antichriſt. They
who ask now for Miracles deſerve to be ſeduc'd by Satan;
for what need is there of them, ſince God is not to ſend
into the World a New Doctrine. The Goſpel Law is the
laſt and moſt perfect of all Laws. Nothing New will
come to inſtruct Men, except the fulfilling of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Law, which was ſufficiently confirm'd by Jeſus Chriſt
and his Apoſtles, who needed then for the Hardneſs of
Mens Hearts to work outward Miracles, becauſe of their
Unbelief. For thoſe Perſons, Signs were wrought that
were viſible to their Senſes. But now Men are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirm'd in the Goſpel Law. There are no Chriſtians
incredulous in this Point. And therefore Miracles would
ſerve to no purpoſe now, ſince nothing is taught but
what Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught, and this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
both by good and bad Chriſtians.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I think you have not the true Touchſtone to diſcern if
a Perſon has the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 13.</note> when you would try him
by Miracles; for the Spirit of Satan may do great Signs
and Wonders in the Perſons where he dwells. I have
ſeen Perſons poſſeſt with that unclean Spirit who would
have done admirable things. Some were Blind for ſome
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94808:109"/>
Years, and recovered their Sight in an Inſtant; others
were Dumb, and recovered their Speech by ſupernatural
Means; others did hang and flee viſibly in the Air, before
all the People; others were without Pulſe and Motion
for ſome Nights and Days, and in an Inſtant would
ariſe and walk chearfully. Are not here the Dead raiſed,
the Sick healed, the Blind recovered to their Sight, the
Dumb to their Speech, and Bodies ſuſpended in the Air
by the Power of the Devil? How could you judge then
by Miracles if a Perſon be led by the Spirit of God, or
of the Devil?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>You will tell me that you would try the Spirit of God by
true Miracles, and not by ſuch as come by the Interventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Devil. I ask by what means you ſhall diſcern
between theſe, ſo long as you have not that Holy Spirit
which would learn you all Truth? Then you would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern
all things, and would not need to ask Miracles to
know if another be guided by that true Spirit. For Faith
alone would give you Evidence enough. When the
Phariſees ask'd Miracles of Chriſt, and he had done ſome,
they ſaid preſently, he had a Devil, and that he caſt out
Devils by the Power of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> who was more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than the inferiour Devils. Do you not think that the
ſame would happen now, and if I alſo wrought Miracles,
would they not undoubtedly ſay that I were a Sorcereſs,
which were even to be feared; ſince now there is no more
need of Miracles, except to bewitch Mens Spirits with
Admiration, our Faith being ſufficiently confirm'd, and
the Goſpel Law verified. There is nothing wanting but
that it is not put in practice; and there is no need of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
to aſſure all Chriſtians that they cannot be ſav'd
without the practice of it, ſince Jeſus Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
have ſo ſtrongly affirm'd it. One muſt deny the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to believe that he can be ſaved without imitating Jeſus
Chriſt, ſeeing he ſays, that <hi>he is the way,</hi> and that <hi>he who
enters by him ſhall be ſaved,</hi> that <hi>he alſo is the Door;</hi> and
that we cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven but
by him. What Miracles will you require, Sir, from one
who does no other thing but repeat the ſame Words
which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles pronounc'd, and ſays
no other thing but that to be a Chriſtian we muſt have
the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</q>

not True Chriſtians. All theſe Truths are ſo clear that
all Men ought to become ſilent and confounded by them;
ſilent in that they cannot bely the Truth; and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to ſee that they are ſo far from God, and the practice
of True Chriſtians. But being unwilling to yield to this
Truth, and to be aſham'd that their Degeneracy is laid
open, they will not be ſilent, but ſtrive to reproach thoſe
who tell this Truth, and tempt them with Foreign
Queſtions and Arguments, even demanding of them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Signs and Miracles, as if they were of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Vertue, while they cannot give the leaſt Ray of
Vertue to him who works them; for True Miracles come
from God, and not from the Perſon that does them, who
is only his Inſtrument to ſhew to Men that which God
operates.—So that you cannot be aſſured that a Perſon
has the Holy Spirit, even tho' he ſhould work outward
Miracles, ſince <hi>Judas</hi> did them as well as the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and yet was a Devil. We need another Touchſtone
to know the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 1, 2. Ibid. p. 26,</note> for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>tho' we could
remove Mountains, and had the Gift of Prophecy, all this
would be nothing without Charity.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is a great Blindneſs to ſeek for Miracles, and outward
Signs, that we may believe that a Soul is guided by the
Holy Spirit. It were better to ſearch in the Scriptures
what <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> the Holy Spirit brings always along
with him, and obſerve if they who ſay they are endued
with the Holy Spirit have in them thoſe Gifts and Fruits,
for then it is certain they are poſſeſt with the Holy Spirit,
for all theſe things are Supernatural and Divine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Not that I would exclude True Miracles from Souls
that love God;<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 27.</note> for they would certainly do them in this
preſent Time, as much as the Apoſtles did them in their
Days, if it were neceſſary for God's Glory, who will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
do the Will of thoſe who love him in all Times
and Places: But I have ſaid all this, to make appear to
you that this is the leaſt Favour that God does in this
World to a faithful Soul, that it has the Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94808:110"/>
or of doing Miracles; and that theſe things ought
not to be valued in reſpect of Faith and Charity which
unite Souls to God. Theſe are True Miracles with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the Souls of their Neighbour, they reſtore to them
Sight, Health, and Life, and with thoſe Philoſophers Stones
of Living Faith and Charity, they change earthly Souls
into the pure Gold of Divine Charity. Theſe are the
True Miracles which ſhall be done in this Fulneſs of
Time, to prove the force of the Holy Spirit, by the Cure
of Souls more worthy beyond Compariſon than Mortal
Bodies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Summ of what ſhe ſays on this Head is this, That it
is not neceſſary that every one who is immediately taught
by the Spirit of God ſhould prove the ſame by outward
Miracles; that they are neceſſary only for the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a New Doctrine: That ſhe declares no other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
than the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, which our Lord and
his Apoſtles have ſufficiently confirm'd already: That to
demand Miracles now, is to tempt God, and to expoſe our
ſelves to be deluded by the Devil; who we are told will
in theſe laſt Times by his falſe Prophets do Signs and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wonders, which without the Spirit of God cannot eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be diſtinguiſhed from true Ones: That they are not the
ſureſt Touchſtones of one's being guided and taught by
the Spirit of God, but the Gifts and Fruits of the Spirit,
particularly Living Faith and Charity; and that by theſe
the Spirit of God does greater Miracles in converting and
healing the Souls of others, than all outward Miracles on
Bodies would amount to: And that in theſe laſt Times,
God will manifeſt the Power of his Spirit by working theſe
Miracles on Souls, by turning them away from things
Earthly and Temporal, to things Heavenly and Eternal.</p>
               <p>There were many of the ancient Prophets of whom
we do not read that they wrought Miracles, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies
were generally for After-times, and not fulfilled in
their own Days; yet the People were bound to receive
them as ſent from God, and there were ſufficient Evidences
for it in their Doctrine and Lives. Beſides, it was no leſs
than a Miracle, and beyond the Power of Nature, that ſhe
knew the Thoughts of other Mens Hearts and their inward
Diſpoſitions, not that ſhe always did ſo, but when God
thought fit to diſcover them to her, either for her own
Safety, or for the Good of others. This is oft-times
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94808:110"/>
declared, and Inſtances given of it, not only by her ſelf, but
alſo by M. <hi>de Cort, Poiret, Tiellens, Francken,</hi> and many
others. The manner alſo of having ſo clear and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
a Knowledge of Divine Things, without Study,
Conferences, Meditation, or Books, is no leſs ſtrange and
extraordinary.</p>

of God, that many have had Viſions and Revelations
and yet not from God, but that they have been acted either
by the Heat of their own Imagination, or by Illuſions
from the Devil, who can transform himſelf into an Angel
of Light, and work upon the Fancies and Imaginations
of corrupt Men, ſo as to make his Illuſions paſs for Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Communications from God, and therefore ſhe may
be reckoned among the Enthuſiaſts and Viſionaries with
which the World abounds. <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> is a Word which at
firſt had a Good meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> one truly led by the Spirit
of God; but now generally it is taken for one who falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pretends to it, and is not. And of ſuch there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſorts of falſe Enthuſiaſts in the World, tho' all of them
do not go under that Name. 1. Many there are who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging
ſtill their corrupt Nature, and being ſtrongly acted
by their own Imagination, or by Impulſes of the Devil,
pretend to Divine Inſpiration, and vent impious, abſurd
and corrupt things, as inſpir'd by God. By their Fruits ye
ſhall know them. Others are become Idolaters of their
Reaſon, make it their God. But the moſt ordinary falſe
Enthuſiaſts are they who leaſt of all will own the Name,
thoſe I mean, who pretend to be Embaſſadours from God,
and that to reſiſt them is all one as to reſiſt the Spirit of
God, and that their Sermons, and Explications of the
Holy Scriptures are to be received as the Word of God,
tho' in the mean time they have not the Spirit of Jeſus
Chriſt, are far from being enlightned by him, venting
their own Notions, Paſſions, Errors, and Wranglings for
the Word of God, wreſting it to ſpeak as they would have
it; and in the mean time hating and perſecuting thoſe who
are truly taught of God, and calling them by the odious
Names that belong to themſelves.</p>
               <p>True Divine Inſpiration, ſo far as we can conceive it,
from the Repreſentations of thoſe who have been truly
and immediately Illuminated of God, may be conſidered
under theſe Two general Heads: 1. Either God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94808:111"/>
himſelf, his Light, and Truth, immediately to the
Soul without the Intervention of any ſenſible Idea or
Image. Or, 2. He makes uſe of ſenſible Images to affect
the Soul, and that after different manners, by Dreams, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
Voices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it is in theſe eſpecially, and not in
the former, that the Devil labours to ape God and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
Souls, or that Men are deluded by their own warm
Imaginations, and the Devil's Illuſions, or their own Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

that it may appear Humble before thoſe who

of his Works; we need only conſider them with
a ſingle Eye, with a pure Intention, without Curioſity or
Affectation, and then we cannot be deceived; for God
promiſes, that if our Eye be Single, our whole Body ſhall
be full of Light; and if it be Evil, it will be full of
Darkneſs.—For tho' a Soul have not in it ſelf the Holy
Spirit, yet it ſhall have the Underſtanding enlightned to
diſcover him in others, provided it behold them with a
ſingle Eye, without Diſſimulation or Surprize; but in
the Simplicity of a Child, as Jeſus Chriſt ſays we muſt

               <p>
                  <q>They who ſee me write,<note place="margin">Pierre de Touch. p. 293.</note> know well that I do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Study or humane Speculation; and that it flows
from my Spirit as Water flows from its Fountain, and that
I do nothing but lend my Hand and my Spirit to another
Power than mine.—And God gives yet a more ſure

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For theſe things cannot come from Nature, which
being corrupted, can produce no Good, nor any Divine
Vertues; becauſe I am come of the Corrupt Maſs of
<hi>Adam,</hi> as all the reſt of Men, there could not be in me
any Righteouſneſs, Truth, and Charity, which are all
Divine and Supernatural Vertues, which cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Soul of Men, but by the Work of the Holy Spirit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This gives me a ſufficient Teſtimony that I am led
by God,<note place="margin">p. 295.</note> ſince the Devil and Nature have nothing of
thoſe Vertues. And therefore we cannot find a ſurer
Evidence that a Soul is led by the Holy Spirit, than when
it is poſſeſt of the Righteouſneſs, Truth, and Charity of
God: For if we deſire to ſee Miracles for a Proof, we
may be deceived, ſince the Devil can do Miracles, or
things which ſeem Supernatural; but he can never have
in him the Righteouſneſs, Truth, and Love of God.</q>

                  <q>The Good Spirit,<note place="margin">Tomb. de la fauſſe Theol. Part 3. p. 49.</note> and the Evil, may be known by the
Qualities which they have. The Spirit of God has in
him a Peace and Sweetneſs that comforts the Soul, and
draws it to an inward Quiet. But the Spirit of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
diſturbs the Underſtanding, diſquiets it, and robs it of
Tranquility and Reſt. The Spirit of God acts ſweetly
and ſtrongly in Peace and Tranquility of Mind.—All
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94808:112"/>
that comes from the Spirit of God, is always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with the Qualities of God, which are Goodneſs,
Righteouſneſs, and Truth. And that which comes from
the Spirit of the Devil, carries always the Qualities of
the Devil; which are Malice, Injuſtice, and Lying.—The
Evil Spirit may ſometimes move to do a good thing, to
draw Evil out of it; but that ſeeming Goodneſs can
never be accompanied with Righteouſneſs, and Truth,
which are the inſeparable Qualities of God; which the
Devil may ſometimes ſeparately make uſe of to deceive
Men, aping the Works of God; but he can never do a
thing that is Good, Juſt, and True, altogether; ſince this
appertains to God only, who cannot be divided in any
of theſe Qualities.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>God does not ſpeak to me by Voices,<note place="margin">Pierre de Touch. p. 299, 300.</note> Thundrings,
and Lightnings, as he did of Old to the Prophets; or as
he ſpake to <hi>Tobit,</hi> by Angels in the Likeneſs of Young
Men; or as he ſpoke to <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Viſion of a Ladder,
upon which Angels did aſcend and deſcend; or as he
ſpoke to <hi>Joſeph</hi> in a Dream, ſaying to him, <hi>Take the
Child and the Mother, and flee into</hi> Egypt: For I durſt
not rely upon all theſe things, in which the Devil and
the Fancy of Man may mingle themſelves, and make
ſuch things be ſeen and heard, as if they came from the
Spirit of God. But I fix on the ſolid <hi>Truth</hi> of God, on
his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and on his <hi>Love,</hi> becauſe in ſuch things
the Devil can have no hold. I have ſometimes had
Dreams and Viſions coming from God, as I may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
make appear by Experience; but I do not rely
on theſe Dreams and Viſions, unleſs the ſame things that
I have ſeen and dream'd be confirm'd unto me by a ſecret
Notice, (Intelligence) after the manner that I converſe
ordinarily with God. For ſo ſoon as the Soul is free of
all Image, and delivered from the agitation of its Paſſions,
and the Imagination ceaſes to operate; then I hear the
Voice of God, and his Reaſoning, not with my Ears,
but with my Underſtanding. And after this manner he
makes me ſee and hear all that I need to know both for
my own Conduct, and that of others; which many have
experienc'd, and found that I have told them the moſt
ſecret things of their Hearts, which neither Men nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils

made to you or others, if you do not perceive
aſſuredly that they are accompanied with the Qualities
of the Good Spirit of God, or otherwiſe you will be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deceived. Remark always if what you ſay or do be
accompanied with the Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and
Truth of God, and then you ſhall aſſuredly hear God
ſpeak to your Soul.—For if you walk in theſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
you will be in God, and the Devil can deceive you
no longer by Illuſions, or falſe Imaginations; as he will
eaſily do, ſo long as you do not poſſeſs thoſe eſſential
Vertues of the Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth of
God, in which you ought always to walk, if you would
not be ſeduced by Satan.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Devil can give Viſions,<note place="margin">Part 1. p. 69, 70.</note> Raviſhments, or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Extaſies to Sorcerers; yea, make them foretel
things to come, being a ſubtile Spirit, and foreſeeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far,
and by conjectures, what will come to paſs, and he
may make them fall out by the means of his Sorcerers;
who being powerful and numerous, may by their Power
and Authority bring about what has been Fore told.
—Therefore it is fit to receive nothing for Truth, but
the things which lead us to a more ſtrict Union with God,
and Denial of our ſelves. Theſe things are always Good,
even tho' they ſhould come from the Devil himſelf, we
cannot be deceived in believing them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I can never have the leaſt doubt as if it were an evil
Spirit that communicates himſelf to my Underſtanding;<note place="margin">Lum. nee en tenebr. Part 3. p. 184.</note>
for the evil Spirit could not in my Judgment produce
ſo good and ſo conſtant Operations, ſuch as the Love of
God, and the Hatred of ones Self: Moreover he could
not ſeparate the Soul from the Pleaſures of this Life,
nor remove from it the coveting the Riches and Honours
of the World; nor give it a full Contentment in the
want of all humane Conſolation, nor yet Joy in Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
and Contempt. All theſe things cannot come from
the Devil, for he is too oppoſite to all theſe Vertues,
and leads ordinarily to all ſort of Evil; tho' at firſt he
cover them with Vertues. The End of his Operations
make appear ſufficiently the Deeds of the Author, and
make known the Workman by his Works.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how certain Marks ſhe gives whereby to

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94808:113"/>
Inſpiration of the Spirit of God from the Illuſions of the
Devil, or Ones own Imagination, and how Men may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
themſelves from being impos'd upon by the laſt:
That where a Soul is truly purified, and the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of God's Spirit are to the inferiour Underſtanding,
without the uſe of the Imagination or Senſes, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
on them Images, Viſions, or Voices, there neither
the Devil nor Man's Imagination can have any hold; that
the Devil cannot work on the Imagination of ſuch, as he
does on Wicked and Brain ſick Perſons: That when Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Voices, and ſenſible Raptures are communicated to
ſuch, that they may be aſſured that they are from God,
they ought to apply to him in that inward way in which he
is pleas'd to communicate himſelf, the Soul being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the agitation of its Paſſions, and the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
That the Spirit of God brings along with him Peace
and Tranquility of Soul, and his Divine Qualities of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Righteouſneſs, and Truth, and his Operations are
both good and abiding; but the Spirit of the Devil diſturbs
the Underſtanding, robs it of Tranquility and Reſt, and
that which proceeds from that Spirit carries always with
it the Qualities of the Devil, Injuſtice, Malice, Hypocriſie.
Theſe are the diſtinguiſhing Evidences for ones ſelf. And
for others, that they may not be impos'd upon by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be led by the Spirit of God, when it may be
they are guided by the Illuſions of the Devil or their own
Fancy; that there is no Hazard of being miſtaken, if we
follow that only which is conformable to the Goſpel, tho'
it were declared by a wicked Perſon or the Devil himſelf;
that there cannot be a ſurer Teſtimony that one is led by
the Spirit of God, than if he produce in them his Fruits
and Gifts, and impart to them the Divine Qualities of
Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Charity, and by their means
produce the ſame good Effects in others: That the evil
Spirit may ſometimes move to do a good thing to draw
Evil out of it, but can never do that that is Juſt, and
Good, and True altogether, which comes from God only;
and tho' the Devil cover his Wickedneſs at firſt with ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vertues, yet the End of all his Operations ſhew from
whom they come.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>A. B.</hi> lays no ſtreſs on Viſions, Extaſies, Raptures,
or other Senſibilities to which the Imagination contributes,
and where the Devil and Fancy may impoſe, but upon the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94808:114"/>
immediate Notices of God to the Underſtanding; and for
the Truth of this and her Sincerity in it, appeals to the
Fruits of God's Spirit, and the Divine Qualities which he
had implanted in her Soul, and by which ſhe conſtantly
ſteer'd all her Actions: And that no Body may be deceived
by her declaring things as Truths from God which are not;
ſhe deſires they may receive them only in ſo far as they
are conformable to the Goſpel, and then there is no Hazard
of being deceived, thoſe Truths being ſo well confirm'd
already, and ſo neceſſary for all who would be ſaved; and
in ſo far as they lead us to a more ſtrict Union with
God, and Denial of ones ſelf. And theſe are always Good;
tho' the Devil ſhould declare them, we cannot be deceived
in believing them.</p>

was no wonder tho' ſhe had clear and extraordinary
Thoughts and Sentiments beyond others; all this might
be the Effect of the excellency of her Natural Spirit, and

               <p>
                  <q>You ought to have more Charity for me,<note place="margin">Tomb de la fauſſe Theol. Part 2. p. 124, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> than to call
me <hi>Wiſe, and of a good Natural Judgment,</hi> when you
judge that <hi>I am Proud,</hi> for your ſaying, ſerves only to
make me more ſo. I have always ſaid, that I am nothing
but a ſimple Child, and now I hear Divines and the
Learned ſay, that I have a great Natural Spirit, which
makes me ſay and write things which ſo many Perſons do
admire.—I have always referr'd them to the Spirit of
God, who produces them immediately in me, and now
you would have me ſo Preſumptuous as to believe that
all this comes <hi>from my ſelf,</hi> or from <hi>my Natural Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
I ſhould be a wiſe Girl indeed, if I had found
out ſo many excellent Truths, without School or Study,
without Books, and without Maſters. I believe it is Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
that makes you ſpeak ſo, and that you know
not what the Spirit of God is, nor what a Natural Spirit
is; and cannot diſtinguiſh that which comes from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
from that which comes from Grace, as not being
ſufficiently advanced in the Wiſdom of the Holy Spirit.</q>

                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:94808:114"/>
                  <q>I am afraid my Judgment may offend you; but I will
make it appear to you, that it is moſt true, and that you
have not yet penetrated nor diſcovered how the Spirit of
God acts, and how the Spirit of Nature acts; and not
having this Touchſtone which diſcovers fine Gold from
the Counterfeit, you eaſily take the one for the other: You
will needs hold the rank of Maſters, whereas it were your
Happineſs to be good Scholars. To ſhew that I have
more Charity for your Soul, than you have Ill-will for
mine, I will declare what the Spirit of God is, and what
the Natural Spirit is, that you may no longer be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
I will tell you what Operations proceed from both
theſe Spirits, and how they muſt be animated. The thing
is clear and certain, eaſie to be underſtood by thoſe who
will uſe their Reaſon, and they who do not uſe it are
Beaſts, for nothing diſtinguiſhes a Man from a Beaſt but
Faith, and Reaſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I ſet down therefore for the chief Mark and Ground
of diſcerning Spirits, that the Spirit of God has this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that he never acts and operates but for things Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Eternal, or tending to Eternity; and that the
Natural Spirit never acts nor aims but for things Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Temporal: For all that is from Nature tends to
its Centre, which is the Earth and Time, where Nature
is bounded to delight it ſelf, without knowing or tending
to any other thing, but what is conformable to Nature.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>When you would know then if it be Nature that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
the Actions of a Perſon, remark only if by what
they ſay or do, they aim only at things earthly and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory;
in this caſe you may well judge, that they have
but a Natural Spirit, and not the Spirit of God, ſince
this never acts but for Divine things tending to Eternity.
So that when you ſee Perſons labour to gain Money, or
to have Pleaſure and Satisfaction in this World, it may
be abſolutely ſaid, they have but Natural Spirits, and
cannot thereby find God, nor Life Eternal; for tho'
they flatter themſelves, and ſay, that they trade, only to
make a right uſe of their Wealth; and ſtudy, that they
may make a right uſe of their Learning; all this is but
for Time and earthly Things, proceeding only from the
Natural Spirit that cloaks it ſelf with the Spirit of
God, for this Divine Spirit never tends but to Divine
Things.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:94808:115"/>
                  <q>If you had obſerved, Sir, that that fine Spirit which
you attribute to me, had been applied to get Wealth or
to gain Praiſe, or to Converſation, to take Pleaſure with
Men, you would have had ſome Reaſon to ſay that I had
nothing but a natural Spirit; or if you had diſcovered in
my Words any Ornament of Language to make me be
eſteemed Eloquent; or in my Writing any Affectation of
ſpeaking well, that I might be praiſed; theſe would be
all Marks of a human Spirit.—</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I would gladly ask you, Sir, if you have ever ſeen me
acted by this natural Spirit? Firſt, if I have ever done
any thing to gain Money? Or, if I have deſir'd any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
Pleaſures, or fed my ſelf with Praiſes, or lov'd the
Converſation of Men? Have you not rather perceiv'd
that I ask nothing of any Body? For I can ſay in Truth,
that if they would give me Riches I would not accept
of them, for my own Goods are a burthen to me, and
the two things I hate in the World are, Honour, and Sin;
the Converſations and Divertiſements of the World are
a Wearineſs to me; and if I affected to be prais'd for
my Words or Writings, I would ſtudy to ſpeak well, to
write well, and to ſpell well; whereas I have nothing
but a ſimple vulgar Language, nakedly to ſignifie my
Thoughts, without Curioſity or any Circumſpection.
And for my Writings, do you not ſee they are without
any Study or Ornament, full of Faults of Writing and
Orthography, without any human Regard or Reflection.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Do you think I have not enough of Spirit to correct
all theſe Faults, and to learn in a little time to write and
ſpell perfectly, that Men might ſee my Skill? I am far
from theſe Sentiments; for I would never learn any thing
of Men, becauſe I deſired not to be prais'd by them.
One would have freely taught me Orthography, another
Poeſy, another the Mathematicks, another the Latin
Tongue; and I deſpis'd all this, to content my ſelf with
writing on my Knees, on a little piece of Board, the
things that God ſheds into my Spirit, without deſiring to
make any Reflection to ſee if I wrote well or ill, or if what
I ſay will pleaſe one or diſpleaſe another, whether they will
be well receiv'd and approved, or deſpis'd or cenſur'd: I
have no other aim in Speaking or Writing but eternal
things, without caring for temporal and earthly things;
having no Pretenſions upon Earth, but only that of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94808:115"/>
God, and ſtirring up my Neighbour to his Love.
This cannot proceed from a Natural Spirit which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to earthly things, and cannot aim to pleaſe God,
nor at eternal things; for Nature cannot find its Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and Satisfaction in a God which it does not ſee and
feel: What is beyond Senſe, is not Food agreeable to
Nature, more than precious Stones can be Food for Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
for neither of theſe are Aliments proportioned to
the Nature of either: For the Natural Senſes will no
more be filled with God and things Eternal, than a Horſe
will be ſatisfied with Jewels for his Food, but he loves the
Graſs and Hay far better, as Food more ſutable to his
Nature.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Even ſo it is of the Natural Spirit and Senſes, they do
far more eſteem things earthly and ſenſual, than God,
who is an Inviſible Spirit; or things Eternal, which
they do not perceive and feel with their Senſes. Whence
we may draw a ſure Conſequence, that he who does not
ſeek or deſire the Goods and Pleaſures which tickle our
Senſes, has the Spirit of God, and lives ſupernaturally;
and he who ſeeks nothing but God and things Eternal,
cannot have this from a Natural Spirit; and when you
will needs ſay that my <hi>Writings proceed from a Natural
Spirit,</hi> you muſt prove that they aim at ſome Profit,
Pleaſure, or Praiſe from Men. If I deſired to Profit by
them, I would endeavour to pleaſe them, and to gain
their Friendſhip; and if I deſired to take Pleaſure among
them, I would draw them to me as you do; and if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
their Praiſes, I would ſpeak that which they would
willingly hear, and would not ſay, that they are not true
Chriſtians: For if I would ſay, that all who have viſited
me are vertuous Souls and true Chriſtians, undoubtedly
every one would eſteem me, and greatly praiſe me; but
when I do the quite contrary, I ſhew it is the Spirit of
God who acts in my Writings, ſince they aim at nothing
but to make known the Truth of God, which alone can
guide Souls to eternal Life, and that the ſame Writings
ſpeak nothing but of deſpiſing earthly and temporal
things.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There cannot be a more evident mark of Diſtinction
between the actings of the Spiri of God, and that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
than what is aſſign'd by her; the laſt tending only
to things Temporal, and the other to things Eternal; and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94808:116"/>
that the Spirit ſhe was guided by had this conſtant Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency

God never makes uſe of for declaring his Truths to Men.
But the Devil has oft ſpoken by ſuch Oracles. But God
ſpake by his Holy Prophets, Natural Perſons as others

very great Faults; yea, ſometimes groſs Sins. Muſt we
doubt if <hi>Moſes</hi> had the Spirit of God, and that he ſpake

to doubt if <hi>David</hi> had the Spirit of God, becauſe he fell

extravagant, and render all the Works of God ſuſpected
and doubtful, becauſe of the Trailty of Men. For in the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94808:116"/>
New Teſtament, does not the Apoſtle make this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of his own Spirit from the Spirit of God? When
he ſays, <hi>It is I who ſays or does this;</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>It is
the Spirit of God who ſays it.</hi> Even Jeſus Chriſt, had he
not the Spirit of God in him, and the Natural Spirit
both? When he prays to his Father, <hi>that his own Will
might not be done.</hi> If he had not had a Natural Will, he
would not have prayed thus. And it could not be the
Spirit of God that made him ſay: <hi>If it be poſſible let this
Cup paſs from me;</hi> Nor which made him doubt <hi>that he
was forſaken of his Father</hi> in the very brink of Death:
of neceſſity theſe were ſimply natural Motions which
mov'd him to all theſe things, and not at all the Motions
of the Holy Spirit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Why would they then have me of another Stuff than
the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; and
hinder that my natural Motions ſhould not act any more
in me, after that I have received the Holy Spirit? Muſt
I become immoveable in Body and Spirit, that I may
move no longer naturally? Muſt the Spirit of God make
all the Functions of my Spirit and Body to ceaſe, that
he alone may operate in them? Truly God would make
uſe of a ſtrange Figure, againſt his Ordinary, ſince he
always makes uſe of humane Creatures to ſpeak to Men,
and to make known his Will to them by Organs of thoſe
like themſelves. And for this Cauſe Jeſus Chriſt took a
truly humane Body, that by means palpable to their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
he might make himſelf to be underſtood and
obeyed. And the Body and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt did act
humanly.—And the Apoſtles acted in many things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their natural Motions, and in many things
were miſtaken;<note place="margin">Acts 12. 12, 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> for we read that the Apoſtles <hi>being one
night aſſembled,</hi> after that they had received the Holy
Spirit, when St. <hi>Peter</hi> was in Priſon; from whence being
come out miraculouſly, <hi>he knock'd at the Gate where they

the Gate,</hi> they thought with one common Judgment that
the Maid dream'd, ſaying, to her, <hi>that ſhe was a Fool.</hi> All
the Motions which this Holy Aſſembly had, could not
come but from Nature. Muſt we conclude from thence
that they had not received the Holy Spirit, or that they
had loſt him becauſe of ſuch Miſtakes, or becauſe they
acted according to their natural Paſſions or Functions in
this Opinion.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:94808:117"/>
                  <q>I think we ſhould commit a great Sin to believe any
ſuch thing, or to ſuſpect the Holy Spirit in them, becauſe
they are miſtaken in ſome things; for theſe Faults and
Miſtakes are annexed to humane Nature ſince Sin; which
has ſo blinded Man's Underſtanding, that he is oft-times
miſtaken in that which he ſees before his Eyes: But the
Holy Spirit can never be miſtaken in any thing, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
things that are not true. And it would be an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
thing to believe it, or to judge that a Perſon were
not guided by the Holy Spirit, becauſe he is miſtaken in
ſome indifferent things. For the Holy Spirit does not
teach the Soul that he poſſeſſes all the Circumſtances of
that which it ought to do and ſay; but he teaches it the
<hi>eſſential things</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> in
all that it ought to do or avoid. And it is the Buſineſs
of the Underſtanding to comprehend and ſearch out the
means to attain to theſe Ends; whetting its Spirit and all
the Faculties of its Soul, that it may rightly accompliſh
in all things Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth. And
if thoſe natural Functions were made to ceaſe acting
after this manner, the Holy Spirit could do nothing by
the Perſon, who is the viſible and ſenſible Organ, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of God, without which Inſtrument he cannot
make groſs and natural Men to underſtand him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Angels themſelves have ſometimes taken humane
Bodies, to make themſelves be ſeen and perceived by Men,
according to their natural Sight and Sentiments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now it is true that God has given me his Holy Spirit
promiſed by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>which teaches me all Truth,</hi> but
yet it is not true, that he teaches me in particular all the
Words that proceed out of my Mouth, nor all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or Syllables that I write, far leſs all the Motions of
my Body; for this is done humanly by my own Spirit
or my viſible Body. For if the Holy Spirit did dictate to
me all the Words that I muſt pronounce, or all the
Words that I muſt write, I could never commit Faults
in Speaking or Writing, which I do often commit, not
knowing ſometimes where to find Words to expreſs my
ſelf well, nor Orthography to write well; which I have
declared in my printed Writings, ſaying; <hi>It is the Spirit
that teaches me the Doctrine which I write, but as for the
Faults which are in the Pen or the Words, it is I who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them, and not the Holy Spirit;</hi> which may ſatisfie all
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94808:117"/>
captious Spirits, who ſeek to diſcredit the Wiſdom of
God, by the Faults that I might have done Naturally:
Since the Proverb ſays, <hi>that all Men do fail and miſtake
themſelves, and the Perfect are in Heaven,</hi> becauſe there
are no Perfections but in God alone.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And it would be to tempt him, to require of a human
Creature the Perfection of all things; ſince this apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to God only, and not to Men, who have only a
limited Perfection, every one his Talent; one the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ſpeaking well, another of writing well, another
of ſinging well, with other natural Gifts, which do not
come immediately from the Holy Spirit, tho' he makes
uſe of all thoſe Gifts, when they may ſerve for the Glory
of God, and when the Perſon offers and reſigns them up
to his Government. For Example: God has given me
an Ability to compoſe my Writings, and it is his Will
that I do it for his Glory, and the Good of Souls. Theſe
things come in Subſtance from the Holy Spirit; but it
is my natural Hand that writes it, and my natural Spirit
that conceives it, which may commit accidental or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Faults; but there can be no Faults in the thing it
ſelf; every one may aſſuredly believe and follow that,
without amuſing himſelf whether I have any Defect in
the Manner, or if there be any thing of <hi>natural mingled</hi>
with it, ſince God makes uſe of Nature and even of its
Defects, to teach Men <hi>to ſeek thoſe things that are above,
and not the things that are upon the Earth.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For all that fine Learning, and ſtudied Words, yea theſe
Niceties of the preciſe Truth of Terms, are <hi>things on
Earth,</hi> eſteemed by vain Men, who ſeek Praiſe and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities
more than the Eſſence of the Means of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and the Holy Spirit will not encourage theſe
Niceties, but inſpires always Simplicity. For this Cauſe
I do not reflect upon the Miſtake that I oft times commit
of naming <hi>Peter</hi> for <hi>Paul,</hi> or Wood for Stone. It is
enough to me that I make the Subſtance of the thing be
underſtood, that Men may return to the Love of God.
And he having permitted me to cauſe to be printed all
my Writings, has not appointed in what Time, by what
Perſon, in what Place, or by what Means I might do it.
I muſt therefore apply my natural Spirit to find out theſe
Means. I have writ of it to my Friends, and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
them that it was the Will of God that this ſhould
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94808:118"/>
be done for his Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>, And if I had not acted naturally
in this, theſe Perſons could not know this expreſs Will of
God, becauſe they are not yet ſo diſengaged that they may
hear the Voice of God. Ought I therefore to hold my
Peace and not to write, becauſe the Holy Spirit does not
dictate to me all the Words, and becauſe I make uſe of
thoſe which I ſpeak in my homely vulgar Language?
And muſt I prove otherwiſe than by my Words, that it is
the Holy Spirit who acts in me?</q>

               <p>They who conſider this without an evil Eye, will, I am
perſwaded, be convinc'd that ſhe is far from attributing
her Miſtakes and Defects to the Dictates of the Spirit of
God, and that yet it might be very well ſaid to him who
was deſirous to reduce her Writings to a greater Exactneſs,
free of all Miſtakes, <hi>What Raſhneſs is it for Men to offer
to correct the Works of God?</hi> For God thinks fit to <hi>chuſe
weak and fooliſh things to confound the wiſe and mighty,</hi> and to
make his <hi>ſtrength appear in their weakneſs;</hi> that when we
ſee the great and ſubſtantial Truths of God declared by one
of ſuch Simplicity, without Diſguiſe and Affectation,
without all Human Learning, and the Artifices and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs
whereby we recommend our Writings to the World,
we may clearly ſee that it is not her own Natural Spirit,
that by its Induſtry and Application ſearches out and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
thoſe Divine Truths (tho' its Defects and Weakneſs
appear in applying to declare them to the World) but that
it is the Spirit of God. And as they who are very intent
upon the cultivating of their Minds with Human Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
are very unconcern'd as to fine Cloaths and other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, about which others are very nice and ready to
laugh at their unfaſhionableneſs; ſo one who is wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with the great and ſubſtantial Truths of God and
Eternity, and intent to impreſs them on the Hearts of
others, has no regard to niceneſs of Words and Terms, is
not curious to avoid little Miſtakes about leſſer and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
Matters; but earneſt only to inculcate to them the
great things of Eternity. And that this was the Diſpoſition
of <hi>A. B</hi>'s Spirit, appears thro' all her Writings.</p>
               <p>It may be <hi>Joſhuah</hi> knew not whether it was the Sun or
Earth that ſtood ſtill; and <hi>Eſay</hi> thought that <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
would undoubtedly die of his Diſeaſe; and S. <hi>Matthew</hi>
that <hi>Jeremy</hi> had written that which <hi>Zachary</hi> had ſaid, and
that there were two Thieves who up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on the Croſs, tho' S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells it was but one of them; and
Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, that there were Figs on a Fig-Tree
when there were none. But what, will ſome ſay, is not
this to take from the divine Writers their Authority and
Force. This is as ridiculous as if a Man dying for Hunger
would not take the Bread offer'd him, under a Pretext that
he who offer'd it was miſtaken in ſome Words when he
offered it; as that he ſaid it was bak'd ſuch a Day, whereas
it was on another Day; or that it came from <hi>Peter</hi>'s Houſe
whereas it came from <hi>John</hi>'s; or that the Corn it was
made of came from <hi>France,</hi> when it was from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi>
from whence the poor famiſh'd Man would fancy
that the Bread could not nouriſh him, that it was not
good, that they who were miſtaken in this, might be
miſtaken in taking, it may be, Poiſon or Tares for Corn,
or Arſnick for Meal.</p>
               <p>But what, ought ſuch Miſtakes to be imputed to the
Holy Spirit? God forbid! they belong only to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And when it pleaſes the Holy Spirit for ſo ſaving
Ends, as to recommend Simplicity, the ſtudy of Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the cleaving to the one thing needful; to teach thoſe
who deſire to be enlightned by God, that they muſt leave
off the ways of humane Exactneſs and Speculation, and of
confounding the Underſtanding with a Thouſand barren
and needleſs Curioſities, which certainly devour much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
time, without making us well-pleaſing to God, or
advancing one ſtep in his Love, but have rather turn'd us
away from it, and occupied and blown us up with theſe uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Vanities: That the Holy Spirit, I ſay, ſhould permit, for
ſo ſaving an Advantage, ſome Miſtakes which regard Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental,
Foreign, and Acceſſory things, to remain ſome
time in the Inſtruments which he makes uſe of moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
and infallibly in the things that concern the way
to Heaven; What is there in all this that derogates from
the Glory of God, the Salvation of Souls, or the Divine
Authority of thoſe ſent by God to guide Man without fail
to this ſupream End.</p>
               <p>The Difference that is obſerved amongſt Perſons inſpired by
God, and ſometimes of the ſame Perſon from himſelf comes
from this, that they have not the ſame Gifts by Nature, or
are not equally enlightned, or the ſame Perſon is not ſo
much at one time as at another, even touching Divine
Things, when they are Acceſſories. Thus the Apoſtles
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94808:119"/>
knew not from the Beginning that the Gentiles would be
called to the Goſpel, and therefore at firſt they lived exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the Manner of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But when God gave and
encreaſed this Light, they acted and ſpoke otherwiſe; muſt
we conclude from this, that they were firſt deceived, or
that the Holy Spirit did not inſpire them, or did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
them aright? Not at all. But that at firſt it was not
neceſſary it ſhould be made known to them, till the ſaving
Doctrine of the Goſpel were eſtabliſhed among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
So that we muſt hence conclude only that the Holy Spirit
gives and encreaſes his Light as he ſees it expedient for Men's
Salvation. Thus <hi>A. B.</hi> in her younger Years had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Light which reſpects the glorious State in which
<hi>Adam</hi> was created before <hi>Eve,</hi> and therefore ſpake of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
then according to the common Opinion, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in a more ſublime Manner.</p>

both the Holy Scriptures and her ſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be led by the Spirit of God. To this ſhe
replied; <q>That this cannot be true indeed, if her Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
be endited by the Spirit of God, who cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
himſelf; for God is Yeſterday and to day the
ſame, unchangeable, and always equal to himſelf, from
whom no Variableneſs nor Contradiction can proceed. But
if her Adverſary would examine all the Holy Scripture
after the Manner he had done her Writings,<note place="margin">Avertiſ. contr. le Trembl. p. 8.</note> he would
find many more ſuch ſeeming Contradictions in the Bible.
For indeed there are many more according to the narrow
Apprehenſion and ſhallow Judgment of Men, who being
earthly and carnal, cannot underſtand ſpiritual things,
or thoſe endited by the Holy Spirit, and they forge in
their little Brains Errours out of moſt ſolid Truths, and
Contradictions out of the greateſt Conformities.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>From hence have ſprung ſo many Errours, Schiſms,
and Diviſions in the Church of God; becauſe every one
would underſtand the Scripture after their own Mode,
they have invented ſo many different Religions; and
each ſays, This is founded on the Holy Scripture: tho'
very often they have different Sentiments, and contradict
one another in the ſame Truths, while every one thinks
he underſtands them aright.—Tho' they are uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of underſtanding Divine Things; for the ſame Spirit
that endited the Holy Scriptures, gives the Underſtanding
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94808:119"/>
of them; and when the Spirit of Man undertakes to do
it, he ſtill falls from one Errour into another, and loſes
himſelf in that great Ocean of Divine Wiſdom, which he
cannot underſtand nor comprehend.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>—It does not trouble me that there appears to be
Contradictions in my Writings to the Judgments of Men,
ſince they will hardly find two Prophets ſpeak the ſame
Words upon the ſame Matter; and the four Evangeliſts
do not relate the ſame Things after the ſame Manner:
Muſt it therefore be ſaid that there are Contradictions in
the Holy Scriptures, as this <hi>Benjamin Furly</hi> ſays there are
in my Writings?—God commands to <hi>honour Father
and Mother;</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt ſays we <hi>muſt hate Father
and Mother;</hi> adding, that he <hi>who does not forſake Father
and Mother, and all things, cannot be his Diſciple.</hi> How
will this <hi>Benjamin</hi> reconcile theſe two Paſſages.—For,
to honour Father and Mother, is a thing quite contrary
to the hating and forſaking them. And Jeſus Chriſt ſays
that he <hi>is not come to bring Peace upon Earth, but War
between Father and Son,</hi> &amp;c. And elſewhere he ſays, <hi>my
Peace I give you.</hi>—In one Place he ſays, <hi>Drunkards
and Gluttons ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi>
and elſewhere he ſays, <hi>that that which enters into the
Mouth does not defile the Soul.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>—Truth is invincible and does not change, for all that
may be thundered againſt it; but it is the more eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
when it is oppoſed and contradicted by ignorant
Perſons, as this <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who cannot diſcern Truth from
Lying and from Contradictions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He confounds one time with another, and will needs
give general Rules for all ſorts of Occaſions; and when
theſe Rules are not punctually obſerved at all times, he
thinks that Perſons do change or contradict themſelves.
And if he had been an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt when he
lived upon Earth, he would have often reproved him (as
at preſent he does me.) For when Jeſus Chriſt was afraid
of his Enemies, he bids his Apoſtles <hi>buy Swords,</hi> and if
they <hi>wanted money to do it, that they ſhould ſell their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
and a little after he commands to put up the
Sword, and threatens that <hi>he who ſtrikes with the Sword,
ſhall be ſtrucken by it.</hi>—If this <hi>Benjamin</hi> had been
in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Place when he cut off <hi>Malchus</hi>'s Ear, he
would certainly have been diſpleaſed at Jeſus Chriſt, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94808:120"/>
blamed him for Inconſtancy and Contradiction, becauſe
he could not diſcern the time when he ought to ſtrike,
and when he ought to forbear.—He reproaches me that
I have written ſomewhere, that I might ſay ſomething
that is not true, without lying or ſinning. He does not
conſider that there are material Lies which are not Sins.
—He would have Words preciſely ſpoken, which are
true according to his Caprice; for it is a chief Article of
the Quakers to juſtifie themſelves before Men; for they
ſtudy preciſe Words, that they may not commit a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Lie, and they dare not call a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> by that Name,
without adding <hi>as they call them,</hi> fearing to Lie by calling
him a Chriſtian when he is not truly ſuch.—</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For my part I am far from theſe Maxims, for I never
regard the pronunciation of Words, but the Eſſence of
the Truth of the things which I advance. If I expreſs
them in this or that Term, it is all one to me, provided
I deceive no Body, and that I make the things to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
which I would ſignifie. But there is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the Spirit that guides me, and the Spirit
that guides that Sect, that they would be eſteem'd by
Men for good Men, and for the <hi>People of God;</hi> whereas
I am not concern'd how they eſteem me, for I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with the Teſtimony of my own Conſcience, and
ſeek not the Approbation of Men, far leſs will I ſay any
Words to the end they may think that I am Juſt and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by God. It ſuffices me that I know it, and God
knows it; for it is written, <hi>He who would pleaſe Men is not
the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore I will freely ſpeak
a material Lie, when I believe the thing is true: for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
I have often ſaid that I was Two Years youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than I find I am ſince I caus'd one to ſearch the
Regiſter of my Baptiſm. I grant I have thus made
many material Lies, yet without ſinning thereby or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
ſince a Lie is a Deceit or Falſeneſs of the Heart that
kills the Soul; which I could not do by ſaying that I
was Two Years younger; for I aim'd not thereby to
deceive any Body, nor to ſpeak againſt the Truth. I
have uttered many ſuch material Lies.—I love ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to poſſeſs the Eſſence of Truth in the bottom of
my Soul, than to ſpeak verbally true Words through
Hypocriſie.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:94808:120"/>
                  <q>For what elſe is it to call Men by the Name of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and to add to it <hi>as they call them</hi> than <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and
Contempt of the Truth, ſuch as the Jews had, when
they ſaid to <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he ought to write on the Croſs
of Jeſus Chriſt, that he was <hi>King of the Jews,</hi> by adding
to it, <hi>as he ſaid;</hi> which <hi>Pilate</hi> would not add, ſaying on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>What is written, is written;</hi> as I alſo anſwer to this
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> when he would teach me to ſpeak Words
which are true before Men: For I know well that all
whom I call Chriſtians, are not truly Chriſtians before
God; yet I will not learn from the Quakers to add to
the Name of <hi>Chriſtian, as they call them;</hi> ſince this ſeems
to me ſuperfluous, and I have no other Intention in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them ſimply Chriſtians, but to make it be underſtood
of whom I ſpeak, to wit, that I ſpeak not of the Jews
or Heathens, but of thoſe only whom I call Chriſtians,
yet without deſign to maintain that they are true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
Since I declare elſewhere, that I know no true
Chriſtians, it cannot be underſtood that I know them
for true Chriſtians, becauſe I call them by that Name;
but I conform my ſelf in this, to the Diſpoſition of thoſe
who hear me, and not to the Truth of what they are:
Which if I would follow, I behov'd ſometimes to call
thoſe nominal Chriſtians, Atheiſts, or Antichriſtians,
which ſcarce any Man would underſtand; therefore to
make my ſelf be underſtood, I muſt uſe common and
ordinary Terms, and pronounce them as briefly as I can;
ſince <hi>we muſt give an account of every idle Word,</hi> I ought
not to add uſeleſly to the Name of <hi>Chriſtians, as they call
them,</hi> ſince it is underſtood well enough of it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pronouncing thoſe Words as the Quakers do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To make appear how fully ſhe clears her ſelf as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
which they were ready to impute to her, I ſhall

                  </note> 
                  <q>I underſtand, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> by
yours, that my Writings have had ſome good Operation
in your Soul; but withal that you have found (as it ſeems
to you) ſome Contradiction in them, in that I ſay abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
<hi>that to be a true Chriſtian one muſt abandon all
that he poſſeſſes,</hi> and nevertheleſs you find in one of my
Letters, <hi>that a Man muſt keep his Goods for his Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ſince the World is now without Charity, and they would
leave the Juſt without help in his need.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:94808:121"/>
                  <q>Both theſe things are moſt true, and do not at all
contradict one another; for a Man muſt abſolutely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
the Love of earthly Goods, if he would become
a true Chriſtian. Jeſus Chriſt has very often affirm'd this
Truth in his Goſpel, and ſaid, that <hi>he who does not renounce
all that he poſſeſſes cannot be his Diſciple.</hi> I bring no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties,
when through all my Writings I preſs this Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of forſaking all things to be a Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt,
ſince Jeſus Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and all who have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Holy Spirit, ſay the ſame thing, and there is but
one Truth, which is God, which ſays through all the
ſame thing: So that they who ſpeak otherwiſe, are Liars
and Seducers of the People, who flatter Men to deſtroy
them, under the Pretext of Gloſſes, and falſe Reaſons
which they draw from the Holy Scriptures, without any
Ground.—This I have declar'd ſufficiently in my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
as you have well obſerv'd and approved as you
ſay; ſeeing I very much blam'd a Woman of <hi>Frieſland,</hi>
who was yet careful what ſhe ſhould eat and drink, and
wherewithal ſhe ſhould be cloathed, after ſhe had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to become a true Chriſtian, as you have remarked in
the Second Letter of the Fourth Part of <hi>La lum. née en
tenebres.</hi> And I am ſtill of the ſame Sentiment, that
when one relies upon temporal things, and will not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
abandon them to follow Jeſus Chriſt, he cannot
be his Diſciple; and that Woman will never be one, ſo
long as ſhe is not diſengag'd from temporal Goods: Tho'
ſhe be now gone out of her Country with a deſign to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
a Goſpel Life, ſhe cannot attain to it, becauſe of the
Affection ſhe has ſtill for her Eaſe and Conveniences,
which proceeds from Self-love, being anxious for the
temporal Part, and fearing Want. And I can aſſure all
thoſe who are ſtill in that Diſpoſition, that they are not
true Chriſtians.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But when I wrote to one of my Friends, in the 24th.
Letter of the Fourth Part of <hi>La lum. née en tenebr.</hi> as
you alledge, <hi>that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ought to keep his Goods for his own
Neceſſities, or that of others; without leaving them to his
Friends, or giving them to the Poor now adays:</hi> I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to do it, becauſe this Man was more diſengag'd in his
Soul from temporal Wealth than that Woman, and had
already reſolv'd to abandon them all, ſo that his Heart
was free to poſſeſs them, as if he did not poſſeſs them:
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94808:121"/>
which a Perſon wedded to them could not do, tho' it ſeems
to him he could, and he will ſay ſo with his Mouth;
<hi>for there is nothing more deceitful than the Heart of Man,
which none knows but God,</hi> and he to whom God reveals it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And I had reaſon to adviſe this Man to keep his Goods,
and that Woman that ſhe ſhould not care for the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
without any Contradiction in my Advices; but in
the Diſpoſition of thoſe Two Perſons whom you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Since the one was free to poſſeſs Wealth without
ſinning, and not the other; and a good Phyſician ought
always to conſider the Original of his Patient's Diſeaſe,
if he would heal him. For if he ordain the ſame Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
for all ſorts of Maladies, he would kill more than
all the Executioners together.—So you muſt not think
that there is a Contradiction in my Two Letters menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by you, but that there are Two divers Remedies for
Two different Diſeaſes; to wit, one Remedy againſt the
Love or Deſire of earthly things; and another againſt
too great Liberality or Indiſcretion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>A. B.</hi> ſays ſomewhere <hi>That no Body ever was or
can be ſaved but by the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſome
Pages after in the ſame Treatiſe, ſhe ſays, <hi>that no Body
can be ſaved by the Merits of another:</hi> This ſeems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory,
as well as thoſe Two Propoſitions, the one of
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other of St. <hi>James; Man is juſtified by
Faith without the Works of the Law;</hi> and <hi>Man is juſtified
by Works and not by Faith only.</hi> This laſt Contradiction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
reconciled by ſaying that St. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtands that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
which admits in us that true Righteouſneſs which
God places there, is Faith; and that Works are not that
Principle: But St. <hi>James</hi> means that that Principle which
admits in us the Righteouſneſs of God, is Faith; but that
Faith is not deſtitute of Works, for if Faith were without
Works, it were a dead Faith, which would juſtifie no
Body. Thus theſe have no Contradiction, and yet are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to reconcile than any Paſſages of the Writings of <hi>A. B.</hi>
Thus as to the forecited Paſſage, when ſhe ſays, <hi>that
no Body is ſaved but by the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> her
meaning is, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Author and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cauſe of the Salvation of Men, who will accept of this
Salvation by the ways that God teaches them; and when
ſhe ſays, <hi>that no Body can be ſaved by the Merits of another,</hi>
this ſignifies that none who will not co-operate to their
Salvation by the ways that God pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſaved by the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, or that the Merits of
Jeſus Chriſt will not ſave thoſe who will not follow the
way of Salvation.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how eaſie it is for critical and captious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
to find Contradictions where there are none; that the
Holy Scriptures themſelves have many ſeeming Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
tho none in Truth; that they who are led by
the Spirit of God write in great Simplicity, regarding the
Eſſence and Subſtance of divine Truths, and not the nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Terms; and how captious Spirits may miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
them; and divine Truths had need to be read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
with the ſame Spirit that dictates them, at leaſt
with a ſingle Eye; for to an evil Eye they look as the

Scoffers walking after their own Luſts, and ſaying, Where is
the Promiſe of his Coming? For ſince the Fathers fell aſleep,
all things continue as they were ſince the Beginning of the
Creation.</hi> For the removal of this Prejudice, there is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
an excellent Paſſage of a Devout Author, which I
ſhall tranſcribe here likewiſe, ſince it gives ſo great Light
in this Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Viſions and Words of God, ſays that Author, tho'
they are always true and certain in themſelves, yet are
not always ſo after our way of underſtanding them, and
that for Two Reaſons, the one proceeds from the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of our way of underſtanding them; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the Reaſons and Grounds upon which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Words and Viſions are eſtabliſh'd; for oft-times
they are Comminations, and of a conditional Nature, or
Condition; for Example, that ſuch ſhall amend, ſuch a
thing ſhall be done; tho' nevertheleſs the divine Word,
to take it in the Letter, is abſolute, and does not expreſs
this Condition. Theſe two things I prove by Authorities
of Holy Scripture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt, it is evident that the Word of God is not always,
and does not always come to paſs, after our way of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it, becauſe of the weakneſs and imperfection of our
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94808:122"/>
Underſtanding. For God being Immenſe and Profound,
it is no wonder that in his Words and Revelations there
is ordinarily a ſenſe and meaning far beyond our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
way of conceiving them, and which ſhall be ſo
much the more true and certain in themſelves, the leſs
probability and certainty they ſeem to us to have. We
find very often in the Scripture that the Ancients found
many of the Divine Words and Prophecies to fall out
quite otherwiſe than they conceiv'd and hop'd for after
their groſs way of underſtanding them: For Example.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>God ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> after he had led him into the
Land of the <hi>Canaanites, I will give thee this Land.</hi> Gen. 13.
15, 17. and he often repeats this to him; nevertheleſs
<hi>Abraham</hi> waxed Old, and God did not give it to him:
therefore when God ſaid to him the ſame Words once
again, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeeing no effect of them, ask'd him,
Lord, <hi>whereby ſhall I know that I ſhall inherit it?</hi> Gen 15.
7, 8. Then God made known to him, that it was not
his Perſon that ſhould poſſeſs that Land, but his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Poſterity, and that not till after 400 Years.
<hi>Abraham</hi> thereby underſtood that God's Promiſe was
moſt true in it ſelf, becauſe God giving it to his Children,
and that out of Love to him, this was to give it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<hi>Abraham</hi> was therefore miſtaken in his way of
conceiving it, and if he had acted at firſt according to his
way of underſtanding that Promiſe, he might have
really deceived himſelf, the Promiſe not being expreſly
annext to that time. And they who had ſeen <hi>Abraham</hi>
die without poſſeſſing that Land, after that God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
it to him, might have remain'd confounded, and
believed that it was falſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This alſo befell <hi>Jacob,</hi> when <hi>Joſeph</hi> made him come
from <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Egypt,</hi> with all his Houſe, to ſave him
from the general Famine; God appear'd to him in the
way, and ſaid to him, <hi>Fear not</hi> Jacob, <hi>go down into</hi>
Egypt; <hi>I will go with thee, and I will ſurely bring thee up
again,</hi> Gen. 46. 3, 4. Yet this came not to paſs, as we
would have taken it, after our way of conceiving things;
for we know <hi>Jacob</hi> died there: It was in his Poſterity
that this was to be accompliſh'd, and it was long after
that God brought back his Race. Now he who had
known whilſt <hi>Jacob</hi> liv'd, that God had made this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to him, would without doubt have believ'd and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94808:123"/>
thought that <hi>Jacob</hi> going down to <hi>Egypt</hi> in Life, muſt
by the Favour of God come out of it in Life alſo. Yet
he would have been miſtaken, and would have wonder'd
to ſee him die in <hi>Egypt</hi> without ſeeing any Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of what he might have hoped for. We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be miſtaken in the Words of God, which yet are
moſt true in themſelves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We read in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Judges,</hi> that all the
Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being aſſembled to fight againſt <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi>
and to puniſh a Crime to which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
God having appointed who ſhould fight firſt,
they were ſo perſwaded of the Victory, that having been
defeated with the loſs of 22000 of their Men, they were
greatly aſtoniſh'd at it, and wept before the Lord till Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night;
for they couldnot conceive, how having look'd on
the Victory as ſo certain, they ſhould be ſo greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.
And having ask'd, if they ſhould fight again?
And God having anſwered them, Yes; they reckon'd at
this time the Victory to be altogether certain: But being
put to flight again with the loſs of 18000 Men, they
were ſo amazed that they knew not what to think of it,
when they ſaw that with 40000, and withal the expreſs
Command of God, they could not ſtand before 26000.
But they were miſtaken in their way of conceiving God's
Word, who would needs chaſtiſe and humble them, by
allowing them to fight, yet without promiſing them the
Victory, except at the third time, when they overcame,
but with much pains, and a ſtratagem which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd
to make uſe of.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this and many other ways, it falls out that Souls
deceive themſelves, as to the Revelations and Word of
God, taking it too literally. God's main deſign when
he ſpeaks, is to ſhew and give the Spirit which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
and hid under theſe Words, which Men after their
way of conceiving do not ſo eaſily comprehend, for it is
much more ample than the Letter, beyond its Bounds
and Extraordinary. So that whoſoever will tie himſelf
to the Letter of God's Word, and to the Appearances of
the divine Viſions, do what he will, he cannot miſs to be
much miſtaken, and to come ſhort of, and be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as to the full and true meaning, becauſe he has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his way of conceiving, and has not given place to
the Spirit, emptying himſelf of his own Sentiment; <hi>the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94808:123"/>
Letter kills,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>ſays St.</hi> Paul, <hi>but the Spirit quickneth.</hi> On
this Occaſion therefore, we ought to looſe our ſelves
from the Letter, and yield to a Faith, which will make
our Sentiments paſs for Darkneſs: For this Faith finds
the Spirit, which Senſe cannot comprehend. For this
Cauſe, the Sayings and Predictions of the Prophets did
not ſucceed to many of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> according
to their Hope, for they took them too much in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and becauſe they came not to paſs as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
them, they afterwards deſpis'd them, and would no
longer believe them, ſo as to mock and make a by-Word
of what the Prophets ſaid to them. Even <hi>Jeremy</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
thought he was much miſtaken, when he ſaw not
the Effect of the good Promiſes that God had made to
his People;<note place="margin">Jer. 4. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Ah! Lord God, ſurely thou haſt greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
this People, and</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſaying, Ye ſhall have
Peace, whereas the Sword reacheth unto the Soul.</hi> The
ſame Difficulty of not being able to comprehend the
Word of God, according to our way of conceiving it,
befel the very Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd
with him, they were miſtaken and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
deceived, witneſs the two, who after his Death,
going to <hi>Emmaus</hi> ſad and without hope,<note place="margin">Luke 24. 21.</note> ſaid, <hi>We truſted
that it had been he who ſhould have redeemed</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
all this, to Day is the third Day ſince theſe things were
done.</hi> And even when Jeſus Chriſt aſcended into Heaven,
ſome ask'd him,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>if at this time he would reſtore</hi> Iſrael.
The Holy Spirit makes many things be ſaid in another
Senſe than Men underſtand it,</q> as in what he made <hi>Caiphas</hi>
ſay,<note place="margin">John 11. 60.</note> concerning Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that it was expedient that one
Man ſhould die, that the whole People periſh not;</hi> which he
ſpoke not of himſelf, and underſtood in another manner,
and for a quite different end than that of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus we ſee we may be eaſily miſtaken by our way
of underſtanding the Words and Revelations of God.
They are an Abyſs and Depth of Spirit, which our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Senſe cannot comprehend. We muſt free our Mind
from our way of conceiving things, and place it in the
Liberty of a Faith which may make it reckon its own
ways of conceiving obſcure and dark. There we ſhall
receive the Abundance of the Spirit, Wiſdom, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
proper for conceiving aright the Words of
God, which no Man that is not Spiritual can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:94808:124"/>
or judge of, they being Divine. He cannot judge
even reaſonably of them, and if he judge of them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the outſide, he is not Spiritual: For tho' they be
covered with this outſide, yet he cannot underſtand them;
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that the <hi>natural Man does not conceive the
things which are of the Spirit of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>for they are fooliſhneſs
to him, and he cannot underſtand them, becauſe they are
Spiritual: But the ſpiritual Man diſcerns all things.</hi> It
is a raſhneſs therefore to give our ſelves the Liberty to
treat of Divine things by a way of comprehending them
naturally, when they require a Diſcerning that is Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
to Senſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let us conceive this alſo by ſome Examples: Suppoſe
a Holy Perſon ſees he is perſecuted by his Enemies, and
God ſays to him, <hi>I will deliver thee from them all,</hi> (ſee
<hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 19.) this Prophecy may be true, tho' his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
kill him, (as it happened to that Prophet:) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he who ſhould underſtand this Prediction in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
way, ſhould be deceived; for God might have
ſpoken of the true and chief Deliverance and Victory,
which is Salvation, by which the Soul is victorious and
delivered from all its Enemies, in a far more true and
profitable way than the temporal and outward Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
And in this Senſe, that Prediction was more true
and ample, than the Man would have conceiv'd it to be,
if he underſtood it only for this temporal Life: For the
Words of God do comprehend always the principal and
moſt uſeful Senſe, and Man may underſtand them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his way according to the leſs principal Senſe, and ſo
be miſtaken. (Add, that if a Perſon to whom God has
given ſuch a Promiſe, be the Head of a Family or Society,
bodily or ſpiritual, the Promiſe may concern his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or thoſe aſſociated with him bodily, and may be
fulfilled in them, tho' as to the Death of the Head, the
Promiſe is annihilated.) Even ſo if a Soul deſiring to
die a Martyr for God, receive this Word from him, Thou
ſhalt be a Martyr, it may fall out that the Perſon ſhall
not die a Martyr, and yet the Promiſe remain true;
for it will be accompliſh'd according to the principal
and eſſential part, God giving him the Love and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of Martyrdom, making him a Martyr of Love, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him a Martyrdom lengthned out in Labours, the
continuance of which will be more troubleſome than
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:94808:124"/>
Death. In which he will accompliſh both the deſire of
the Soul, and his own Promiſe; for the deſire of the
Soul was not ſimply that kind of Death, which of it ſelf
would ſignifie nothing without God's Friendſhip; but
to render to God the Service and the Love of a Martyr:
The other, becauſe God will give moſt perfectly the
Reality and Recompence of this, tho' by other means.
God has promiſed <hi>to fulfil the Deſire of the Righteous,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Deſires are juſt and true, If therefore God
do not fulfil them during this temporal Life, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
he will do it after this Life, and in a moſt perfect
manner; ſo that the Promiſes do ſtill remain moſt true.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſecond Cauſe why divine Words and Viſions, tho'
always true in themſelves, yet nevertheleſs are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
certain as to us, is becauſe of the Reaſons, Motives,
and Grounds upon which they are built, ſince they may
change, the Effect does not follow. We muſt therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that theſe things will infallibly come to paſs, ſo long
as that ſhall remain which moves and incites God: for
Example, to puniſh, as if God ſaid, <hi>Within a Year I will
ſend ſuch a Plague upon this Kingdom;</hi> the Ground of this
Threatning is a certain Tranſgreſſion which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in this Kingdom againſt God. If therefore the
Tranſgreſſion ceaſe or vary, the Puniſhment may alſo
ceaſe or be changed. Nevertheleſs the Threatning was
true, foraſmuch as it was founded on an actual Fault,
and it would have been executed, if the Offence had
continued. This appears in what happened to the City
of <hi>Ninevah,</hi> whither God ſent the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
from him; <hi>Yet Forty Days, and</hi> Ninevah <hi>ſhall
be deſtroyed.</hi> Which nevertheleſs was not fulfilled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Cauſe of this Threatning ceas'd, which was the
Sins of the People, who immediately repented; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
this Denunciation from God would certainly have
taken effect. The ſame thing as to the matter of divine
Threatning we ſee in King <hi>Ahab,</hi> whom God threatned
by the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> with a great Judgment, Him, his
Houſe, and Kingdom. But becauſe he rent his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with Grief, covered himſelf with Sackcloth,
faſted and lay in Sackcloth and Aſhes, humbled and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
himſelf, God immediately tells him by the ſame
Prophet, that he would not ſend that Evil in his Days.
Where we ſee, becauſe <hi>Ahab</hi> chang'd, the Threatning
and Sentence of God ceas'd alſo.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:94808:125"/>
                  <q>From hence we muſt conclude, that tho' God reveal or
ſpeak affirmatively to a Soul any thing in Good or Evil
concerning it ſelf or others; this may change more or leſs,
or none at all, according to the Change of the Affection or
Diſpoſition of that or theſe Souls, and according to the
Cauſe and Reaſon that God looks to; and this will not be
fulfill'd after the Manner that we look for it, even without
knowing ſometimes wherefore, but God only knows. For
tho' he ſay, and teach, and promiſe things many times,
this is not that they are to be underſtood, received, or
poſſeſſed at the ſame time, but that they are to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
underſtood, or when it ſhall be fit to give Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in them, or when the Effect ſhall follow; as this
fell out often even to the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 12. 16</note> of
whom S. <hi>John</hi> ſays; <hi>Theſe things underſtood not his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
at the firſt, but when Jeſus was glorified, then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
they that theſe things were written of him.</hi> There
may paſs many particular things after this Manner, which
cannot be underſtood before their Time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To ſhew this in the Matter of the Promiſes of God,
which are not fulfilled to thoſe to whom they were made
for want of good Diſpoſitions; we read in the Book of
the <hi>Kings,</hi> that God being provoked againſt the High-Prieſt
<hi>Eli,</hi> becauſe of the Sins of his Children whom he
did not correct, ſent to tell him theſe Words by <hi>Samuel;
I ſaid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 20. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>indeed, that thy Houſe and the Houſe of thy Father
ſhould walk before me for ever,</hi> (as to the Prieſthood) <hi>but
now the Lord ſaith, be it far from me.</hi> For this Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
founded on this, that he ought to glorifie and honour
God, and God having promiſed the Continuance of it to
him upon the ſame Ground, preſuppoſing that on his
Part he would not be wanting in his Duty, it came to
paſs that <hi>Eli</hi> coming ſhort in his Zeal for God's Honour,
who, as the Lord complains of him, honoured his Sons
more than God himſelf, diſſembling their Sins for fear of
diſhonouring them; it fell out, I ſay, that God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
failed him alſo, which would have been firm, if they
had remained firm in their Piety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We muſt not therefore think that Divine Viſions and
Revelations, tho' true in themſelves, ought to fall out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound, particularly when by the Order of
God they depend upon human things, which may vary,
change, be omitted, or not. Now God knows when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:94808:125"/>
are thus annex'd to Conditions and Diſpoſitions
which depend upon Men, and he does not always diſcover
it, and oftentimes he ſpeaks or reveals the Thing without
ſaying any thing of the Condition, as he did to the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
to whom he foretold determinately, that they
ſhould periſh within Forty Days. Sometimes alſo God
declares this Condition, as he did to <hi>Roboam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If thou
keep my Commandments as my Servant</hi> David, <hi>I alſo will
be with thee, and will build thee a ſtable Houſe as I did
to</hi> David.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But whether he declare theſe Conditions or not, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by what has been ſaid hitherto, that we cannot be
aſſured by the natural Way of Perceiving, that we are not
miſtaken in the Underſtanding of Divine Revelations.
They will ſay, it may be, Why then does God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
them? It is to make them be underſtood in their
Time, by the Order of him who has told them; and he
ſhall conceive them to whom it ſhall pleaſe God to give
the Underſtanding of them [yea, even thoſe ſhall ſee the
Ratification of them who ſhall be in the Diſpoſitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
and annex'd to thoſe Declarations.] Laying aſide
this, People expoſe themſelves to great Dangers of Error
and Confuſion, when they will needs judge determinately
and abſolutely of them, by what ſeems and appears at
firſt outwardly of them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Prophets knew this very well, they who had God's
Word in their Mouth, and to whom it was heavy and
grievous to carry it to the People; becauſe a great Part
of the Predictions did not fall out according to the Sence
of the Letter [nor ſo ſoon as they look'd for them] which
made the Prophets ſo ridiculous,<note place="margin">Jer. 26. 6, 7, 8.</note> that <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am in
Deriſion daily, every one mocketh me; for ſince I ſpake, I
cried out, I cried Violence and Spoil; but the Word of the
Lord was made a Reproach unto me, and a Deriſion daily.
Then I ſaid I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeak
any more in his Name.</hi> And the Reaſon why <hi>Jonah</hi> fled
when God ſent him to denounce the Deſtruction of
<hi>Ninevah,</hi> was, that he could not comprehend aſſuredly
the Truth of the Divine Words, nor determinately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
their Sence. So for fear they ſhould mock at
him, if this Prophecy came not to paſs, he choſe rather to
flee than to propheſie; and having propheſied, he abode
forty Days without the City, to ſee if his Prophecy
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94808:126"/>
ſhould be fulfilled; which when it was not, he was ſo far
grieved,<note place="margin">Jon. 4. 2.</note> as to ſay to God in his Complaint; <hi>I pray thee,
O Lord, was not this my Saying when I was yet in my
Country? Therefore I fled before unto</hi> Tarſhiſh, <hi>for I know
that thou art a Gracious God and a Merciful.</hi> And the
Saint being grieved, prayed to God that he would take
him out of this World. Muſt we therefore be aſtoniſh'd
if the things that God reveals to his Friends do not fall
out as they might have conceived them, and far leſs as
others underſtood them? For ſuppoſe God declare unto
them ſome Good or Evil for them or others; if theſe
things are founded on certain Diſpoſitions of Spirit, the
Obedience of thoſe Souls as to God, and a certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance,
and that this muſt fall out upon theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
yet it is not certain for this, that the Event ſhall
fall out as the Words ſound, ſo long as the Condition and
Perſeverance are uncertain and do not appear.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here is more than ſufficient for ſolving all the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that may occur in the Writings of <hi>A. B.</hi> as to any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.
And as to the Promiſes and Declarations of God
how abſolute ſoever they may ſeem in Words, yet the
Completion of them is not to be look'd for, when there is
not a Correſpondence by an entire Converſion unto God,
in thoſe to whom they are given. God does not retract
his Promiſes, but he leaves them to whom they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
takes his Talents from them to give them to others,
till he find ſuch as will profit by them. <hi>A. B.</hi> has decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all that has been ſaid on this Head,<note place="margin">Avertiſ. contr. le Trembl. n. 96.</note> in Two or Three
Lines. <q>God, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> is always True and cannot Lie:
But Men do not underſtand his Language, or do not know
the Time of his Predictions, or they hinder the Effect of
his Promiſes by their Sins or Indiſpoſitions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>XXV.<note place="margin">XXV. That ſhe was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon by Impoſtors, is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhe had not the Spirit of God.</note> In the laſt Place it is given as an Inſtance that

not confer his Gifts upon thoſe in whom Self-will does yet
reign, and who are guided by it, but on thoſe only who are
dead to their own Wills. When theſe are endued with the
Gifts of the Holy Spirit, they do not exerciſe them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their own Will, or as they pleaſe, but they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to God, that he may do in them, and by them,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94808:126"/>
when, and how he pleaſe. For Example: St. <hi>Paul</hi> had
without doubt the Gift of Miracles; he ſtruck<note n="a" place="margin">Acts 13. 20. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Elymas</hi>
Blind, raiſed the Young Man that fell down dead, and
healed others. And yet nevertheleſs when he was taken
he made none Blind, that he might eſcape from his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,
neither did he miraculouſly heal <hi>Epaphirus, Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimus,
Timothy.</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 2. 27. Tit. 4. 20. 1. Tim. 5. 23.</note> And even ſo when the Light of God,
the Gift of Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is given unto the Saints; they
do not therefore diſcover all things in that Light and by
that Gift, according to their Will; but being dead to their
own Will, and reſign'd to the Will of God, they diſcover
in that Light of God, thoſe things only which he is pleaſed
to manifeſt unto them in it: ſo that if God in his Wiſdom
ſee it convenient for them that they be ignorant of the
Evils of ſome with whom they converſe, whether to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
them, or that ſome external things may be done to
them by theſe Hypocrites, or for other Ends known to his
infinite Wiſdom; then without any Prejudice to the Light
of God, or the Gift of Diſcerning of Spirits, they ſhall
not know theſe Hypocrites, till God be pleas'd to bring
that Gift into act, as to that Matter, which he uſes to do
when he ſees it neceſſary either for their own Salvation, or
that of others, or for the Glory of his Name. It is a great
Error then for us to think that the Gifts of God are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by Mens Self-will, or Self-wiſdom, and from hence
to conclude, that that Perſon to whom the inward Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of others was known for ſome time, did not only
want the Gift of Diſcerning Spirits, but that alſo it is from
hence evident that it cannot be known from ſuch a Perſon's
Life and Doctrine that he was led by the Spirit of God,
ſince he did embrace in others that which was but Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and Impoſture only, for Truth: For<note n="c" place="margin">Pſa. 55. 14, 15. Jer. 11. 19. 1 Kings 13. 2 Tim. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>David,
Jeremy,</hi> another true Prophet; they who baptized <hi>Simon
Magus, Paul</hi> (as to <hi>Demas</hi>) have ſometimes taken the
Appearance or Impoſture of ſome Hypocrites or Liars for
Truth: Does it from hence follow that it could not be
known by their Life and Doctrine, that they were led by
the Spirit of God? As if the ſtreſs of their whole Life and
Doctrine were to be laid upon ſome one or other innocent
Miſtake. Or, as if rather from hence it ought not to be
inferred, that God in his Wiſdom ſaw it expedient that
they ſhould be ignorant of the Hypocriſie of ſuch Perſons
for ſome time; and that the Gift of Diſcerning of Spirits
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94808:127"/>
ſhould be differently directed and applied in thoſe who
are acted by the Spirit of God, according to his Will; who
can truly ſay, <hi>Not I live, but Chriſt lives in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have given a plain and true Narrative of the
Sentiments of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> both as to the Eſſential
and Acceſſory Truths: And of the Prejudices generally
raiſed againſt her; and the juſt Defences ſhe makes for her
ſelf, by which ſhe clears and removes them; and of the
Evidences ſhe brings for her being led by the Spirit of
God, and not by that of the Devil or Nature, or her own
Imagination; and the Anſwers given to what is oppos'd
againſt it. And tho' I might have contracted all into leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
Bounds, yet I choſe rather to give it in her own Words,
and to let her ſpeak for her ſelf. And now after all, I beg
leave to ſumm up the Evidence.</p>
               <p>XXVI.<note place="margin">XXVI. The whole Evidence ſumm'd up.</note> If any pretend to be led by the Spirit of God,
and in the mean time are worldly, or ſenſual, or ſelfiſh, or
contradict the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, it is evident they
are not of God. But if any publiſh to the World a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that is Pure and Holy, tending only to mortifie Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Nature, and to recover the Love of God; if it be
wholly conformable unto, and the ſame with the Doctrine
of Jeſus Chriſt and of his Goſpel: If they who publiſh it
do ſtill live conformably unto it, and bring forth the Fruits
of the Spirit of God in their whole Life and Practice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
all temporal things, and tending only to things eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
and manifeſting the Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and
Truth of God in all their Actions; if their Words be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a Force and Power which reaches the
Heart and convinces the Conſcience; If they diſcover often
the ſecret Thoughts of the Hearts of others, and their
Diſpoſitions, even ſometimes tho' their Perſons be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to them; If they be Perſons full of Simplicity and
Sincerity, having no worldly Aim, doing nothing to pleaſe
Men, nor to gain their Eſteem, but declaring the Truth
in Simplicity, even in things which they know will be moſt
unpleaſing to Men, and will bring upon them Hatred,
Contempt, and Perſecution from Men, inſtead of their
Favour and Eſteem: If they are altogether Illiterate, and
have acquired no Knowledge by the humane means of
Study, Reading, Converſation, and Meditation; and yet
manifeſt a clear, diſtinct, and comprehenſive Knowledge
of Divine Things, far beyond the moſt Learned Divines:
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:94808:127"/>
If in declaring thoſe Truths to the World by writing, they
flowed from them as Water does from a Fountain, as faſt as
their Hand could guide the Pen, without muſing or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
what to write, or changing and correcting what
they had once written, or reading it over again; and yet all
as to the main is of a Thread, moſt rational, and clear,
and conſiſtent, and no real Contradiction either to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures, or amongſt thoſe Writings themſelves as to
the Eſſence and Subſtance of them: And if ſuch declare
to the World, that of themſelves they are ſinful Nothings,
of the corrupt Maſs of <hi>Adam,</hi> from whence nothing can
come but Evil; and that all the Good that is in them, and
all the Truths they communicate to the World, is not from
them, but from God and the immediate Operation of his
Holy Spirit, who is pleaſed to make uſe of weak and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Means to confound the Mighty and Wiſe: If all theſe
can be truly ſaid of any, theſe are certainly Evidences that
will abide the Verdict of an impartial Jury; even tho'
there be no viſible Miracles, as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and many
of the ancient Prophets did none, there being no New
Doctrine publiſh'd, but the preſſing and clearing of that
already declared and confirm'd by Jeſus Chriſt and his
Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Now this is the Summ of the Plea of <hi>Antonia Bourig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non;</hi>
and for the Proof of it, as to her Doctrine and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
ſhe refers to her Writings, which any that pleaſe
may conſult; as to her Life and Spirit, to thoſe who were
daily Witneſſes of it, (of which there are a Cloud of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
made publick,) as alſo for the manner of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
her Writings: As to the Force and Efficacy of them,
to thoſe who by their Experience have found and do atteſt
it. And theſe are the greateſt Evidences that can be given
to thoſe who were not Eye-Witneſſes, nor have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd
that Efficacy of her Writings themſelves.</p>
               <p>XXVII.<note place="margin">XXVII. What Weight the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of others may have.</note> And ſeeing by the Teſtimony of her greateſt
Enemies, theſe Writings are valued and eſteem'd by ſome
who have the Reputation of being Men of Senſe, Learning,
and Probity, and that there are others highly deſerving that
Character ſtill alive, who were Witneſſes of her Life and
Spirit, and have found ſo much of the Divine Power ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
thoſe Writings, as has made them abandon
the Love and Care of all Temporal things, to mind and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for Eternity. And ſeeing they are known to be Men
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94808:128"/>
of no Hypochondriack nor Enthuſiaſtick Spirit, do not
pretend to immediate Revelations themſelves, are not led
by the heat of Fancy or Imagination, but were addicted to
all the ſorts of rational Learing, and to the mechanical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
wherewith the World now abounds; this may ſo
far Counter-ballance the Prejudices raiſed by ſome other
Men of Reputation for Learning and Parts, (who never
read thoſe Writings till they came to them with an evil
Eye, with a deſign to expoſe, ridicule, and confute them)
this, I ſay, may ſo far Counter-ballance that Prejudice, as
to encline People not to throw them away, as unworthy of
their notice, but impartially to weigh and conſider what
they ſay.</p>

the horrid Corruption of our Nature; the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
neceſſity of the Love of God to be ſaved; the only
means to recover it by following the Life and Doctrine of
Jeſus Chriſt: how contrary all Men walk to this and yet

and Doctrine; and the great and univerſal Judgments that
God is now to bring upon the World, as he did in the
Days of <hi>Noah,</hi> its Wickedneſs being as Univerſal, and at
as great a Height: With many other important Truths
which I cannot now repeat. And as they are of ſuch

repreſented as to convince our natural Reaſon.</p>
               <p>XXIX.<note place="margin">XXIX. That the acceſſory things need deter none.</note> It needs divert none from laying to Heart thoſe
great and neceſſary Truths, becauſe they may meet with

That they being declared to be revealed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

alſo that they are not neceſſary to Salvation, and that
they who do not reliſh them, and are not bettered by them,
may let them alone. Even as God of his infinite Bounty,
has provided not only for the Neceſſities of Man's Life,

               <p>God grant us all the Spirit of divine Charity and a

                  <p>IN Oppoſition to all the Prejudices rais'd againſt the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>A. B.</hi> this may be a favourable one for them, that
whereas her Enemies do all they can to frighten People from
looking into them, and would have them to know no further of
them, than what they think fit to put into their Narratives, thoſe
on the other hand who give good Characters of them, aim at
nothing thereby but to perſwade People impartially to read and
conſider the Writings themſelves, and not to truſt them upon
their Words, no more than thoſe who beſpatter them; even as
we Proteſtants perſwade the People to read the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and thoſe of the Roman Church do all they can to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, as being conſcious that they make againſt them.
And as thus the Intention of theſe Witneſſes is much more
Candid and Juſt than the other; ſo their Teſtimony will by all
impartial Judges be eſteem'd no leſs Weighty: The one are
Eye-Witneſſes, and the other only upon Conjecture, Inferences,
or Hearſay, and they who thruſt in to be Evidences upon no
better Grounds, give occaſion to ſuſpect them as falſe Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and to put them to the Oath of Calumny e'er they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
And as they had far the Advantage of knowing the
Truth of what they declare beyond theſe others; ſo their
Ability to make a right Judgment and their Probity is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable;
of theſe I ſhall inſtance only in two. The one
is the great Anatomiſt and Naturaliſt, Dr. <hi>Swammerdam,</hi>
whoſe Writings are well known and eſteem'd by all Enquirers
into the History of Nature, and it is certain that that Genius
does not lead to a Brainſick Enthuſiaſm; but after that he
had ſeen ſome of the Writings of <hi>A. B.</hi> and convers'd with
her, he was fully perſwaded in his Conſcience that ſhe was led
by the Spirit of God, and found the happy Effect of it upon
own his Heart and Spirit. The other is Dr. <hi>Ant. de Heyde,</hi>
known alſo to the World by ſome curious Enquiries and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
in the History of Nature and in Phyſick, who for
many Years had no ſmall Contempt and Averſion for <hi>A. B.</hi> and
her Writings, ſo that it was the force of Truth only, and no
favourable Prepoſſeſſion that brought him to eſteem them,
who has now abandon'd all earthly things to follow his Maſter
Jeſus Chriſt, and ſuch powerful a Mean they were for this
End, appears from this following Account, which he permits
to be communicated to the World, being heartily deſirous to
contribute for the Good of thoſe who labour under the ſame
Indiſpoſitions.</p>

two Contraries cannot be lov'd at the ſame time, and the
Love of the Creatures and things Temporal, is oppoſite to
the Love of the Creator and of things Eternal; it is from

II.<note place="margin">II. To be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern'd by Divine Light only.</note> This is likewiſe confirm'd by the Example of all the
Holy Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apoſtles, as he who reads
the Holy Scriptures will find through all, ſo that there is no
need to produce Teſtimonies here. But ſeeing this Love
of God, and of things Eternal, is hidden in the Heart, and
the Heart is known by God only, it is therefore difficult
to know if any truly love God. This Difficulty is ſo
much the greater, that Hypocrites and wicked Perſons
can ſo craftily counterfeit the outward Actions which are
the Signs and Fruits of this Love, that it is hard to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
them. That this Difficulty may be removed, it is
to be obſerved and conſidered: 1. That there are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſure Signs by which one may be convinc'd of the
Holineſs of another, and that he is endued with the Love
of God. For we affirm that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and
the other Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apoſtles, were Holy,
and that with ſo much Aſſurance, that we look upon it as
an Example which we ought to imitate. But 2. it is to be
conſidered that we cannot know but by Divine Light, and
not at all by Natural Reaſon, if one be Holy and a Lover
of God: And this is beſtowed on thoſe only who are Holy
themſelves, or at leaſt endeavour in Sincerity of Heart to
become ſo. To ſuch God reveals his Secrets, in ſo far as it
is fit for them to know them for their own Conduct, or
that of others; as for others who are not in that State, but
care for and ſeek after earthly things, they really cannot
know if any be truly Holy and a Lover of God or not. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
they take upon them to judge magiſterially of
all things, as if they only did poſſeſs all divine and humane
Wiſdom; tho' in the mean time they are ignorant of the
Eſſence of things, and content themſelves with their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
and ſurface. So that their Teſtimony as to Holineſs
and the Love of God, even of the Patriarchs, Prophets,
and Apoſtles, is founded meerly upon their own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
For they judge that to be Good and Holy which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
this; but on the other hand they account that to
be Evil and Prophane which brings them in no temporal
Gain.</p>
                  <p>III.<note place="margin">III. Illuſtrated by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Light.</note> It is juſt of this Matter as it is of the Light, of
which a Blind Man cannot judge, neither can he form the
Idea of it, becauſe his Eyes, by which alone the material
Light is perceived, are ill diſpoſed for it. Yet this does not
hinder, but that he whoſe Eyes are well-diſpoſed may be
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94808:130"/>
certain that he ſees the Light, becauſe when he opens his
Eyes, he diſcovers many things round about him, which
without this Light could not be diſcern'd, and withal he
can walk and do other Works, which would be impoſſible
for him, if he were depriv'd of that Light: And when he
ſees other Men walk reſolutely and ſteddily, and do their
Works by ſure Rules, he has reaſon to conclude that theſe
Men do alſo enjoy the Light. This may be eaſily applied
to Spiritual things. For tho' the natural Man turning his
cloſed Eyes towards the Divine Light, is Blind in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things, neither can he know if one be Holy and have
the Love of God, yet this does not hinder, but that he
who has the Eyes of his Mind opened, may be aſſured
that he himſelf and others like unto him, are illuminated
by God; for when the inward State of his Soul is diſcovered
to him, and the work of God in his Soul, and the means
that are to be made uſe of for the preſerving and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that Work, he juſtly concludes from hence that
he enjoys the Divine Light, and he, walking in that Light,
and abandoning all the Creatures, that he may love the
Creator only, may be certain that he loves God, and is
Holy: And obſerving the like in others, he concludes that
they alſo do truly love God and are Holy. Upon ſuch
Grounds is founded that Knowledge by which Holy
Men do underſtand their own State, and the State of other
Holy Men. And after this manner are they perſwaded
that the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apoſtles were Holy
Men.</p>
                  <p>IV.<note place="margin">IV. Two ſorts of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Blind. The 1. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſeeing, the 2. not.</note> Some perhaps may reply to all this. Altho' Good
and Holy Men may mutually know their own and others
State, yet it is not ſo with thoſe who has not as yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to Holineſs and the Love of God. I anſwer, ſuch
imperfect Perſons may be of two ſorts, to wit, ſome know
that they are Blind and therefore are deſirous of the means
whereby they may ſee and be enlightned; others, altho'
they be more Blind, than Moles, yet they do not deſire
to ſee; either becauſe they imagine that they are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and ſee ſufficiently, or for that they are ſo ſunk into
and carried away by the Love of the Creatures, that they
have no thought of the Creator and of things Eternal.
Thoſe of this ſecond kind are ſo far from being able to know
their own State or that of others that they cannot form
any Idea of it, more than a Blind Man can judge of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94808:131"/>
Light and Colours. Hence it would be to no purpoſe to
endeavour to demoſtrate to ſuch that one is Holy, and in
the Love of God. But as for thoſe of the firſt ſort, who
know they are Blind and deſire the Light, they, according
to our Saviour's Promiſe, <hi>ſhall ſee.</hi> And as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of their own Blindneſs, and anxious about it; ſo
God will reveal unto them the Holineſs and Illumination
of his beloved ones, in ſo far as that may be a Mean of
recovering them out of Darkneſs into Light, and from
Sin to Holineſs. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> was inſtructed by <hi>Ananias;
Cornclius,</hi> the Centurion, by St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And God in all
times has employ'd Holy Men for the enlightning of others,
and for guiding them by their Examples, Words, and
Writings into the way of Holineſs. This is the Ground
and Origine of the Divine Miniſtery, which for this very
Reaſon is highly neceſſary, to wit, that they who live holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and are illuminated by God may ſhine and go before
others. Even as an Artificer that is skilful in any Art,
goes before his Scholars and Apprentices by working, that
they may imitate him. And as in an unknown way we
chooſe a Guide who may lead us into the right and ſhorteſt
way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as there are certain Signs given whereby we
may know if this Artificer underſtand his Trade, and if
the Guide know well the beſt and ſhorteſt way, ſo there
are ſure Marks whereby we may know if any be Holy and
enlightned by God, and do truly love him. This is a ſign;
if he ſeek thoſe things that are above, and not thoſe
things that are on Earth; if he love not the World, nor
the things that are in the World. And altho' it fall out,
and falls out but too often that Hypocrites and wicked
Perſons may outwardly ſo behave themſelves, as if they
were truly Holy and in the Love of God, that by their
feigned Piety, the Good may be ſeduced; yet God will
not permit their Hyprociſie to be always hid, eſpecially
when the Salvation of others is thereby in hazard.</p>
                  <p>V.<note place="margin">V. Five Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Holineſs in any.</note> It is therefore certain and acknowedg'd by all Men
of ſound Reaſon, that it may be known by manifeſt and
undoubted Signs if any love God and is Holy. So all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
are fully perſwaded that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,
Moſes,</hi> and the other Patriarchs, and alſo the Apoſtles
were Holy Men. This we know, 1. by the Evidence they
gave from their Deeds, Words, and Writings, that they
ſaw clearly that God, and things inviſible, were far more
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:94808:131"/>
excellent than the Creatures and things viſible, and were
thereby engaged to forſake theſe things and count them as
nothing, and only to ſeek and love thoſe other things with
all their Heart. Believing that God is, and that he is a
Rewarder of thoſe who ſeek him. To this Teſtimony,
2. there is added the Teſtimony of others, who well knew
the thing, and are not moved by any Self-Intereſt or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
to give this Teſtimony; which gives us ſo much
Aſſurance that we may acquieſce in it, as we do in the
Teſtimonies of Hiſtorians, Geographers, and Naturaliſts, in
things of which they have been Eye Witneſſes in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Sciences. To this add, 3. that ſo long as there is
nothing made appear contrary to theſe Teſtimonies, there
is no reaſon to call them in Queſtion. 4. We may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Holineſs of another, and of their Love of
God by the Teſtimony of our own Conſcience; for he
who is truly Holy and poſſeſſes the Love of God, does
rightly infer from the Conformity of anothers Actions to
his, that that other Perſon is Holy and loves God. But he
who has not attain'd to this Perfection, may yet be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Holineſs of others, by obſerving that their
Actions do as far excel and tranſcend his, as the Actions
of him who ſees clearly and walks at Noon-day, do tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
thoſe of a Blind Man, or of one groping in the Dark.
But as for thoſe of an evil Eye, as they are Blind, tho'
they boaſt that they ſee, ſo they are not in a State of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of others. Beſides it would ſerve them to no purpoſe,
ſo long as they remain in that damnable State, to know
if others be Holy or not. To theſe may be added, 5. as
a Teſtimony of the Holineſs of any the Miracles and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Works which ſuch Men do, and the extraordinary
Light communicated unto them by God. But whereas
there are alſo lying Wonders, by which falſe Prophets do
ſeduce many, and the Dragon is worſhipped by all the
World; and ſeeing the Devil has great Knowledge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Teſtimony alone without the foregoing, is not
enough to aſcertain us of the Holineſs of any.</p>

and Signs which convince us that the Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and Apoſtles, were endued with Holineſs and the

                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:94808:132"/>

not doubted by any who has look'd though but ſuperficially
into her Writings: For ſhe bears Witneſs in many places
of her Sanctity and extraordinary Love of God. So that
her Adverſaries take occaſion from hence to reproach her,
as if it were not ſutable to the Sanctity of Holy Perſons
that they themſelves ſhould publiſh the Grace given
them by God; and they would moſt abſurdly diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
ſuch a Teſtimony. As the corrupt Jews did for the
ſame Reaſon reject Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe he bore Witneſs
of himſelf. But our Saviour did ſo little regard this, that
he ſaid nothing elſe, but, <hi>I have ſpoken the Truth, and if
ye will not believe me, believe the Works which I do.</hi> Thus
we ſee alſo, that <hi>Moſes, David, Paul,</hi> and other Holy
Writers were not afraid to declare the Grace given them
by God. Which Teſtimony ought not in any wiſe to be
look'd upon as a Token of Pride, becauſe theſe Holy Men
were convinc'd that they were nothing, that they were
come of the corrupt maſs of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo worthy of
Damnation; that of themſelves they could not think one
good Thought, but that all their ſufficiency was of God,
and that they had no Good, but what they had received.
Moreover thoſe Holy Men were commanded by God to
bear Witneſs to the Truth of themſelves, that they might
ſtop the Mouths of Gainſayers, and might encourage
the Good to yield up themſelves wholly to God, who can
do even in the weakeſt, when they deny themſelves, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
abundantly above all that we can ask or think.
For God has no reſpect of Perſons, but he gives to every
one liberally. And that <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> did truly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
thoſe Holy Men, is abundantly demonſtrated in her
Writings, even to the Confuſion of Gainſayers; for ſhe
was in that State, that ſhe endeavour'd always to ſpeak the
Truth only, whether it made for her or againſt her, not
Studying to pleaſe Men, as becomes the Servants of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>

all her Life ſhe ſought only God and things Eternal, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
abandoning all the Creatures and things Temporal.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94808:132"/>
If you except ſome Years, in which ſhe followed the
Vanities of the World, not out of Inclination, but that
ſhe might pleaſe Men; tho' even then ſhe did nothing
that by Chriſtians now adays is reckon'd to be Evil, or
blameworthy: Yet this withdrawing from God did greatly
hurt her; while ſhe enjoy'd worldly Delights, ſhe loſt the
Divine Ones, and that with ſuch bitter Remorſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that ſhe thought her ſelf in Hell. She got no reſt
till ſhe forſook the World, the Things of the World
and Self, that ſhe might love God only, and be reſign'd to
his Will in every thing. In which Reſolution ſhe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
ſo faithfully, even to the end of her Life, that ſhe
would rather have died a Thouſand times, than have deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
any Creature, or followed her own Will in any thing;
never undertaking any thing till ſhe was firſt perſwaded
that it was the Good-will of God. As appears every where
in the Writings of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> particularly in the
Account of her inward and outward Life, and the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of it; where this is ſufficiently demonſtrated:
Which Teſtimony tho' given by her ſelf, is nevertheleſs

                     </gap>ous Men who knew <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> from
her Infancy, and did narrowly obſerve her Converſation:
Many ſuch Teſtimonies are to be met with, in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of <hi>A. B.</hi> which is called, <hi>The Teſtimony of the Truth.</hi>
It is worthy of Obſervation, that theſe Teſtimonies ſeem
to have been publiſhed by the Providence of God, that it
might be evident to every one that <hi>A. B.</hi> led a Pious and
Holy Life; and that the Mouths of malicious Slanderers
might be ſtopped, not only by Two or Three Witneſſes,
by whoſe Mouth every Truth is eſtabliſhed; but by ſuch
a Cloud of Witneſſes; who aſſure us that the Thoughts
and Words of <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> were ſerious and pious,
even from her early Infancy; ſo that obſerving the change
that Man is ſubject to throughout all his Life, and that
he muſt part with all at Death, while he ſeems to propoſe
to himſelf, in every thing that he undertakes, an abiding
and perpetual Good: this made her conclude that we were
not created for this wretched Life, but for an abiding, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and bleſſed Life; of which ſhe became ſo deſirous,
that ſhe counted all bodily Delights, Recreations, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
fine Cloaths, and all other periſhing things, as Dung
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94808:133"/>
and Loſs, for the Love of thoſe good things which were
Eternal, and would never fail. And about the Fourth
Year of her Age, having learned that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt
and his Apoſtles did lead a Life wholly free of all earthly
and temporal Cares and Deſires, that they might only
care and ſeek for thoſe things which are above, and are
eternal, ſhe look'd on ſuch a Life as moſt reaſonable and
worthy of a Man; but obſerving that the Life of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
now adays was altogether contrary to that kind of Life,
hence ſhe concluded that they were not True Chriſtians,
and begging that her Parents would have her to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
where the Chriſtians liv'd, ſhe vehemently thirſted
to go thither, that ſhe might lead a truly Chriſtian Life.
And tho' they endeavour'd to perſwade her that ſhe liv'd
amongſt Chriſtians, yet ſhe could not believe this, eſpecially
when advancing more in Years ſhe found that the beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the Parties of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> did ſtill love and ſeek
after earthly things; ſo that their Deeds were directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to the Deeds of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
While in the mean time our Saviour ſays expreſly,
<hi>That the Diſciple ought to be like his Maſter, and that he who
believes in him ſhall do the Works that he did, yea, greater
Works than theſe;</hi> as the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> do the

and her Neighbour did encreaſe in her, of which ſhe gave
infallible Proofs on all Occaſions; for obſerving that
the Converſation of Men was an effectual Mean to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
us from God, and to deprive us of his Love, ſhe
therefore lived as ſolitarily as was poſſible; not that ſhe was
Melancholly or Brainſick, for ſuch alſo ſeek to be Solitary,
but that applying her ſelf to the Contemplation of God,
and of his Perfections, ſhe might the better continue in
his Love. She was otherwiſe of a chearful, ſociable, and
ingenuous Temper, and underſtood well how they ought
to carry themſelves who deſire to be lov'd by the World;
as appear'd in the time that ſhe applied her ſelf to the
Converſation of the World.</p>

for the ſupport of Life; and this, both that ſhe might not
adhere to any Creature, and that ſhe might beſtow on the

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:94808:133"/>
And that <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> did theſe things, not that ſhe
might be ſeen of Men, like unto the Hypocrites, but only
from the Love of God, and her Neighbour, and things
Eternal, appears from hence, that ſhe did all theſe things
in ſecret, as much as was poſſible, entering into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and ſhutting the Door, pray'd to her Father in Secret,
and gave Alms, her Lefthand not knowing what her Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand

did proceed from the Love of God, appears alſo from this,
that ſhe perſever'd in them conſtantly to the end of her
Life; except that ſhort time in which ſhe engag'd her
ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fair Words, and feign'd Sanctity of Hypocrites and
Impoſtours, who continually endeavour'd by many ways
to diſtract her, and to withdraw her from the Love of God.
So that ſhe had received the Gift of Fortitude from the
Holy Spirit, to ſuch a Degree, that ſhe would not have
done any thing againſt the Will of God, nor omitted that
which ſhe knew to be agreeable to the Will of God, no not
for the whole World. And tho' ſhe greatly deſired Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
becauſe there ſhe had learned to converſe with God,
and to hear him in a profound Silence, yet when the Glory
of God, or the Salvation of her Neighbour did require that
ſhe ſhould converſe with Men, ſhe willingly left that Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
For ſhe ever obſerved this Rule, to prefer the Glory
of God and the Salvation of her Neighbour, to her own
Profit; being always ready not only to lay down her Life
for her Neighbour, but being content alſo to be blotted out
of God's Book, and with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to be an Anathema
for her Chriſtian Brethren.</p>
                  <p>XIII.<note place="margin">XIII. The purity of her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin State.</note> 
                     <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> finding that Virginity was moſt
acceptable to God, and an effectual Mean of perſevering
in the Love of God; ſhe therefore from her Childhood
begg'd of God that ſhe might be the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt,
earneſtly deſiring never to be married to any Man. This
ſhe obtain'd ſo perfectly from God, that ſhe never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a Thought contrary to it, tho' ſhe was oft-times
ſought in Marriage by Perſons who could have afforded
her many worldly Advantages, and her Parents were ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:94808:134"/>
to have her married; Yea, her Father, contrary to
her Will, promiſed her in Marriage to a rich Merchant.
And that ſhe might avoid that Stroke, ſhe ſeparated her
ſelf from the World, and from all Creatures, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Eighteenth Year of her Age, having put on the
Habit of a Hermit, ſhe left her Father's Houſe, without
taking with her ſo much as a Penny, forſaking Wealth,
Accommodations, Delights, and all temporal Things, only
for the Love of God. The abandoning of all which, was ſo
well-pleaſing to God, that he wonderfully guided and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
her, and delivered her out of the Hands of wicked
Men, and committed her to the Care of ſuch as were truly
Good, who were ready to be helpful to her in all things.</p>
                  <p>XIV.<note place="margin">XIV. Of Faith, Hope, and Charity.</note> That I may not be too tedious, as to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
which others give concerning the Piety and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> I ſhall only propoſe ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
as to thoſe Three principal Vertues: 1. Faith. 2. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
3. Hope. For if there can be ſufficient Evidences
brought, whereby it can be made appear that <hi>A. B.</hi> did poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
theſe, there can be then no doubt but that ſhe was
Holy and Pious. That this may be made appear, it is not
needful to examine each of theſe Vertues particularly by
it ſelf, becauſe they always go together. There is no doubt
then, yea, we may be aſſured of it, that he who poſſeſſes
one of theſe Vertues, does poſſeſs them all. <hi>Faith then is the
Subſiſtence of things hoped for,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Evidence of things
not ſeen:</hi> Or, Faith is that Divine Light infus'd by God
into Man at his Creation, by which he conceives things
Divine and Eternal, which by the natural Underſtanding
are unconceivable. In this Senſe, Faith is communicated
unto all Men; for it is that true Light that enlightens eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man that comes into the World. But this Light is ſo
darkned and hindred to encreaſe, by the Love of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and of temporal Things, in which Sin conſiſts, that
Faith, being without Life and Spirit, becomes dead and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.
To make appear therefore that any has Faith,
it is not enough that he is endued with this firſt innate
Light, becauſe in that Senſe all Men have Faith, while in
the mean time all are not Holy. But here we ſpeak of the
Faith which all have not, but they only who do not reſiſt
this Divine Light, nor ſtrive to quench it; and who they
are that follow it, and walk in it, and whoſe Faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by Love, muſt and ought to be made evident by their
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94808:134"/>
Works, that it may appear to be living and not dead.
This was the Faith in <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and the reſt of the Holy Men, ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. who
ſeeing the inviſible God, contemned all viſible Things,
ſuffering all manner of Reproaches, Perſecutions, and
Torments, that they might ever ſee and enjoy him, and
this with ſo great Reſolution, as the whole World could
not divert them from their purpoſe, or ſeparate them from
the Love of God, becauſe they knew certainly that the
Hope they had, would never make them aſhamed.</p>
                  <p>XV.<note place="margin">XV. That theſe did live and operate in her.</note> Now that in <hi>A. B.</hi> Faith did thus work by Love,
with an aſſured Hope of enjoying God, appears by all her
Life, as has been already ſhewn. And that we may have
the greater Evidence of this, we need read only the Account
of her Life, given both by her ſelf and others. Among in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Inſtances it is very remarkable, that <hi>A. B.</hi> took
upon her the Care of governing, educating, and inſtructing
in the Chriſtian Religion, many poor Orphan Girls in an
Hoſpital, and that without any Tie or Obligation, or any
other End, but the Hope ſhe had of bringing up theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins
in the Fear of God, and of forming them to be true
Chriſtians; employing in this Office all her Induſtry, her
Goods, and the Strength both of her Body and Mind. In
which Work of Charity, ſhe continued for Nine Years,
confiding ſo firmly in God, that tho' ſhe was toſs'd with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Afflictions, her Refuge was in him alone, and that
with ſuch an aſſured Hope, that ſhe was never confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
nor fruſtrated of her End. In ſuch Works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>A. B.</hi> continued even to Death, but with this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
afterwards, that having found by Experience that
moſt of the Poor, and other Men alſo, did abuſe Alms,
and the other Offices of Charity, to encourage themſelves
the more in their Sins, ſhe did diſpence the Gifts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
more warily, enquiring firſt if they might promote
the Salvation of her Neighbour, which ought to be our
great aim; and being once perſwaded of this, ſhe ſpar'd
neither Money, nor Travel, nor her own Life, where ſhe
could contribute for the Salvation of others. But where
ſhe ſaw that her good Works could contribute nothing to
this, ſhe endeavoured to live in as much Retiredneſs and
Quiet with God as was poſſible, that ſhe might work out
her own Salvation with fear and trembling, being thus
truly helpful to all, when a few had rejected her Help.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:94808:135"/>
The Malicious therefore have no reaſon to accuſe <hi>A. B.</hi> of
Avarice, or Cruelty, becauſe ſhe did not diſtribute her Goods
indifferently to all the Poor; for this did not ſpring from
ſo evil an Original, but from true Charity, that ſhe might
not concur by the Poors abuſing of her Alms to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying
of their Sins, and ſo to the aggravating of their
Damnation. This proceeded alſo from the Care ſhe had
that the Goods which God had committed unto her, as
to a Steward, might be faithfully diſtributed.</p>

to admit the fore-mentioned Evidences for proving a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be Holy, and a Lover of God, as good and valid,
ſo long as the contrary is not made appear. Now as to the
Holineſs of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> and her Love to God, that
the contrary is not yet made appear, is evident from this,
that no body could ever yet diſcover that her Life and
Actions were at any time blameworthy, even then, when
to follow the Vanity of the World, ſhe lived for ſome time
diſtracted from God. But from hence we ought not to
conclude, as ſome malicious Perſons have done, that <hi>Ant.
Bourignon</hi> and her Friends do affirm, that ſhe neither ſinn'd
in <hi>Adam</hi> nor in her ſelf; which is moſt falſe: For <hi>A. B.</hi>
declares in many places that ſhe, as well as other Men,
was born of the corrupt maſs of <hi>Adam,</hi> and did ſin in him.
And not only ſo, but that turning aſide from God unto
the World, ſhe ſinn'd in her ſelf; tho' ſhe never did any
thing that is blame worthy before Men. For ſhe was fully
perſwaded that every turning aſide from God unto the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is a Sin that deſerves Damnation.</p>

as to the Sanctity of <hi>A. B.</hi> is moſt abundant; for
many Perſons of all Parties of Chriſtians, of all ſorts of
Ranks, and thoſe moſt Pious, do decalre that they have
felt ſuch Operations in their Souls by the Preſence, the
Words, and Writings of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> that they were
ſufficiently convinced in their Conſcience that <hi>A. B.</hi> was
Holy, and in the Love of God, and that to ſuch a Degree,
that this Love ſeem'd to flow from her into them and other
well-diſpoſed Souls, becauſe many are brought by her to
abandon their own Wills and the Creatures, that they
may Love God only, and ſubject themſelves wholly to his
Will. And I am perſwaded that her Writings will have
ſuch Operations in all thoſe, who ſhall read them with a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94808:135"/>
ſincere and hearty deſire to find the ſaving Truth, and to
endeavour to walk in it, in ſo far as they know it. Unleſs
they be ſo far poſſeſt with Prejudices, as that they will
admit of nothing for Truth, but what is conſonant to their
formerly receiv'd Opinions, looking upon every thing that
differs from them, or ſeems contrary unto them, as Lies
and Error. This is as if one looking always through a
coloured Glaſs, by which all Bodies would appear to him
of the ſame Colour, ſhould imagine and affirm, that other
Men who look with the naked and ſingle Eye, are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miſtaken when they ſay that they ſee clearly that every
Body has its own diſtinct Colour.</p>
                  <p>XVIII.<note place="margin">XVIII. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works ſhe did, and the Divine Light gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her.</note> Unto theſe Four Evidences of the Sanctity of
<hi>A. B.</hi> this Fifth ought to be added; to wit, the wonderful
Works that <hi>A. B.</hi> did, and the extraordinary Divine Lights
that God communicated to her. To reckon up all theſe
we behov'd to narrate her whole Life, and to adduce all
her Writings, which are full of ſuch wonderful Works and
Light. Therefore let every one that loves the Truth, apply
to theſe Writings, and (which ſoever he ſhall be pleas'd
to peruſe) he will by them be ſufficiently convinc'd of this
matter. But that ſome Inſtance of this may be given,
it is to be conſidered, that this ought to be look'd upon
as a great Miracle in <hi>A. B.</hi> that ſhe ſo generouſly fought
againſt her corrupt Nature, that ſhe wholly ſubdued it,
not by her own Strength, which could do nothing but Evil,
but by the Grace of God, through which the weakeſt can
do all things. This Miracle ought to be more eſteemed
than raiſing the Dead, giving Sight to the Blind, and ſuch
like, which ſerve only for this preſent Life, and therefore
may be performed by Men who are not Holy. But to

Lights communicated to <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> this is the
chief, that ſhe had explain'd the Truths of the Goſpel
more clearly and efficaciouſly than any has done hitherto,
demonſtrating that an Obedience to them is abſolutely
neceſſary for Salvation, and reſcuing them from the Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

the Truths of the Goſpel, that almoſt every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

what has been ſaid, that <hi>A. B.</hi> was Holy, and in the Love
of God; it will be now fit to conſider the Second Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
propoſed, to wit, If ſhe was moved by the Spirit of
God to write and to enlighten others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For anſwer to this.
Queſtion there needs nothing be adduc'd but what has been
ſaid as to the Firſt Queſtion: For it <hi>A. B.</hi> was Holy and
in the Love of God, ſhe would not have committed ſo
great a Sin, as to pretend that ſhe was moved to write by
the Spirit of God, if it was falſe, or if ſhe was not certain
that it was moſt true. But that I may anſwer ſomething
in particular to this Second Queſtion, it is to be conſidered,
how we may be aſſured that any Writing is endited by
God. In order to this, let us enquire, how it appears that
the Holy Scriptures were written by Men led by the Spirit
of God, as all Chriſtians do believe.</p>
                  <p>XX.<note place="margin">XX. Natural Gifts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make Happy, without a continual Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God.</note> That we may proceed aright in this Enquiry, it
is to be remarked, that God gives unto Men Breath, and
Life, and all Things, for in him we live and move, and have
our Being. Nevertheleſs, he has given to all Creatures
the Faculty whereby to continue in their Being, or to
exiſt. For God is Eternal, and his Gifts are without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
therefore his Works do never periſh; beſides
they are endued with a Power of multiplying themſelves,
and producing their like. It is true, many things periſh,
but theſe are not the Works of God, but Corruption and
Vanity, brought into the World, and yet coming into it
by Sin and Luſt. But beſides theſe Faculties of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
themſelves, and producing their like, God gave to
Man the Liberty of turning himſelf to God, that he might
be govern'd and ruled by him, or of acting by the Strength
already given him, without asking new Strength from
God. If he do ſo, he departs from God the Author of all
Light and Good; and then ſuch a Man of neceſſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Miſerable, and is ſunk in Darkneſs, as appear'd in
the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and is to be ſeen daily in thoſe who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their own Wills; that is, who act by the Strength
once given them, and will not ask new Strength from God,
nor yield up themſelves to be govern'd by him. But if a
Man yield up himſelf to God, and ask help from him in
every thing he goes about, he will find God ready to help
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:94808:136"/>
him. Even as one in a very cloſe Chamber is in the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
immediately enlightned by the Sun, how ſoon he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the Windows of the Chamber to be opened, and the
more Windows there are opened, he receives the greater
Light.</p>

                        </gap>ars the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were endited by the Holy Spirit.</note> From what has been ſaid, it appears that when we
ſay, that the Holy Scripture is endited by God, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
thereby that the Holy Men, who committed it to
Writing, did ſo wholly deny their own Strength, whether
innate unto them, or acquired by Diligence, Learning, and
Meditation, that they willingly acknowledged that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they could do no good nor any thing that was accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God, but did ſo entirely yield up themſelves to be
govern'd by God, that they no longer lived to themſelves,
but God did live and operate in them. Now that we may
be aſſured that the Holy Scriptures were penned by ſuch
Men, we muſt examine what Operation the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have in our Souls. When then we experience that
the Thoughts of our Hearts are manifeſted by them,
which can be done by none but God, who alone knows the
Heart; and if this Holy Scripture be a powerful Mean
for looſing our Hearts from the Love of Temporal things,
and drawing them to the Love of God and of things
Eternal: For the Word of God is quick, and powerful,
and ſharper than any Two-edged Sword; piercing even
to the dividing aſunder of the Soul and Spirit, the Joynts
and Marrow; and is a diſcerner of the Thoughts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the Heart; overthrowing every Imagination and
Thought that exalts it ſelf againſt God: So that an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer
perceiving that by this Word the inward Thoughts
of his Heart are made manifeſt and laid open, he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to fall down upon his Face and to acknowledge that
it is God who ſpeaks unto him. This one Mark is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to prove the Divine Authority of the Holy Scripture,
and it is ſo clear that it may be underſtood by the moſt
ſimple, moreover it is moſt certain and infallible. To this,
many other Marks might be added, which for brevity's ſake
I paſs over, and ſo much the rather that they are to be
had abundantly from thoſe Writers who have deſignedly
treated of the Divine Authority of the Holy Scriptures.</p>

God were immediately ſpeaking unto us. Moreover, they
do ſo clearly and ſo lively ſet before our Eyes the Vanity
and Nothingneſs of all Earthly and Temporal things, and
the Glory of Heavenly and Eternal things, that we are
forced, unleſs we would do Violence to our Conſcience, to
love and ſeek after theſe laſt things only, and abſolutely to
forſake and avoid the other. And there is no doubt but
that all they who ſincerely deſire to do the Will of God,
and to embrace and practice the Truth which they know,
ſhall experience in themſelves the ſame Effects from the
reading of thoſe Writings, and give Teſtimony that they
are endited by the Spirit of God.</p>

ſo conſonant to the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New

temporal Advantage; but on the contrary, foreſeeing that
ſhe muſt ſuffer much becauſe of theſe Writings, as the

that ſhe had enough of Spirit, and was not a Fool as her

Her Parents were anxious to have her married, being Rich,
and having but Two Daughters, and many Young Men
would have had her for their Wife, but ſhe could never
reſolve to marry, having an Averſion to it. Yet ſhe took
Pleaſure in the Converſation of the Youth, till they urg'd

all the time that ſhe was deſpiſed, now withdrew from
her; and her Prayers were without any fervour. Her
Conſcience often check'd her when ſhe did or ſaid any
thing to pleaſe the World, but ſhe had not the courage
to withdraw from it. But God had pity on her who had
abandon'd him to turn to the Creatures. She oft-times felt
inward Motions from God, and even in the midſt of her
Divertiſements and Dancings, ſhe had ſometimes ſecret
Reproofs from him, piercing her Heart with thoſe inward
Words. <hi>Will you forſake me then for another? Will you
find a Lover more compleat and more faithful than I am?</hi>
But a little after, Company and Divertiſements got the
Aſcendant; and even when ſhe was excited by thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Motions to abandon all, ſhe would reply, <hi>Then I
ſhould never have Pleaſure! It is fit for one to take ſome
Pleaſure in their Youth!</hi>

nothing, took more ſevere means to recover her, and fill'd
her Spirit with fearful Apprehenſions of Death, Judgment,
and Hell; the hearing of the Deaths of others, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
about Death and Judgment, did before that touch
her but very little, like the Stories of Foreign Countries,
and ſhe would not let her ſelf think that ſhe was concern'd
in them. But when God was pleas'd to open her Eyes, and
let her ſee ſhe muſt Die, and appear at the great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then unexpreſſible Apprehenſions ſeiz'd her, and
all the Day long, when ſhe was alone, ſhe would ſay to
her ſelf, <hi>Poor Creature! What will become of thee? Thou
muſt die; all the things of the World cannot ſave thee from
this fearful Death; thou ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

repeated both in her Mind and by Word. They with
whom ſhe convers'd obſerving her Sadneſs, endeavour'd
to chear and divert her, but all in vain: For then ſhe had
a diſguſt of all Recreations and earthly Pleaſures. And
when ſhe forc'd her ſelf to take Contentment in any thing,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94808:140"/>
ſhe thought it was ſaid to her Heart, <hi>To what purpoſe takeſt
thou Pleaſure, ſince thou muſt die? For what will this ſerve
thee before God?</hi> But the ſenſitive part of her Soul was very
diſpleas'd to ſee it ſelf thus afflicted, and ſaid in its mute
Language, <hi>Thou ſhalt never be well, if thou put not theſe
Fancies out of thy Head; but will die very ſhortly if thou
continue in ſuch Apprehenſions:</hi> This made her leave oft
for ſome time. But as ſoon as ſhe came to her ſelf, the
ſuperiour part ſaid, <hi>Forget Death as much as you will;
it ſhall not forget thee. It is a folly to think to free thy ſelf
of it by ſhutting it out of thy Memory. It will find thee
every where, and does not wait till thou be ready; but comes
at its time unlook'd for, and when thou ſhalt think leaſt of
it. And if the Idea of it only does ſo affright, yea put thy
Life in hazard; how will the reality of it make thee afraid,
when thy Soul ſhall be in Danger. Give place to thoſe Truths,
without flattering thy ſelf with any Reaſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII.<note place="margin">VIII. The thoughts of Death fix'd upon her Spirit.</note> Theſe were the Debates which toſs'd her Spirit
without ceaſing. She reſolv'd then to quit all the World,
and prepare for Death and prevent it, ſince it followed
her ſo hard. But ſhe found great Difficulty to do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Young and in the midſt of all worldly Advantages,
ſo that ſhe might promiſe to her ſelf as much of worldly
Pleaſures, Honour, and Wealth, as any of her rank. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
the thoughts of Death had yet greater force,
when ſhe thought on the future State. She ſaid to her ſelf,
<hi>It is very true, Mirth is agreeable, Pleaſures are ſweet, and
Wealth delightful; but this laſts but for a little time; Death
will come and change all; and all muſt be parted with, with
a lamentable regret, and it may be an eternal Puniſhment
for a good of ſo ſhort continuance.</hi> So that perceiving clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this Truth, ſhe prayed earneſtly to God, to give her
Grace to think always upon Death, and never to let it be
out of her Mind for any thing that might befall her;
which ſhe obtain'd, after a long perſeverance in this Prayer.
And to fix it the more upon her Spirit, ſhe went oft to
the Church-yard, where looking on the Bones of the dead,
ſhe ſaid, <hi>See my Body; what will become of thee? Thy own
Head, and thy own Hands will be very ſhortly thrown into
this Company;</hi> and ſhe was afraid to look upon them, and
forc'd her ſelf to approach them, being naturally timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and to handle them, ſaving, <hi>O miſerable Creature!
Wilt thou have a Horror for thy ſelf? Draw near boldly.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:94808:141"/>
Thou ſhalt be a Thouſand times more vile, when the Worms

her ſelf; and after her Siſter was married, ſhe retir'd from
all ſort of Company, ſtaid alone in her Chamber, entered
upon a very auſtere Life, Lying hard, Sleeping little, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much, mingling what ſhe did eat with Aſhes to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
her Taſte, wearing hair cloath next to her Skin, and
afflicting her Body, and praying, and weeping the moſt
part of her time, for Grief that ſhe had left the ſweet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
ſhe had with God, to pleaſe her ſelf in the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements
of the World. She viſited the Poor and Sick,
frequented the Churches and Sacraments, not knowing by
what means ſhe could recover the Favour of God, which
ſhe had loſt through her own Fault. She durſt ſcarce ſleep
in the Night, fearing to fall into Hell while aſleep, and
that the Earth would not bear her. So terrible were her
Apprehenſions of the Judgments of God, that ſhe durſt
not ſhut her Eyes becauſe of her Sins, which ſeem'd to her
ſo great, that none had ever committed the like, not that
ſhe was guilty of any Crime or wicked Deed, but becauſe
ſhe had forſaken the <hi>ſweet Converſation</hi> that her Soul had
with God, to pleaſe her ſelf with the Divertiſements of
the World, after having received ſo many Favours from
God, which deſerved the Thankſgiving of her whole Life.
This appear'd to her ſo great a Sin, that Hell was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to puniſh it. She continued in thoſe Auſterities and
Mortification for Seven Years, and would have done ſo ſtill,
if God had not commanded her when ſhe was Twenty
Five Years of Age to leave this, and lead an ordinary Life.
Her <hi>Mortifications</hi> were not the Effect of a melancholy
Humour, nor accompanied with it; for ſhe was of the
moſt ſerene and chearful Temper, even to her Death.
But ſhe chaſtis'd her ſelf with an inward Contentment
and Tranquillity, out of a Principle of Juſtice: And her
Floods of Tears flowing from the Love of God, whoſe
Friendſhip ſhe had loſt through her own Fault, were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with a ſecret and moſt ſolid Pleaſure, founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, that there was nothing more juſt than to bewail
the Fault of ceaſing to love ſo Lovely a God. Yet ſhe
confeſt that ſhe had run too far to an Extremity in her
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:94808:141"/>
Mortifications, and that ſo great, that ſhe would never
tell it but to one, and would never adviſe any to do as ſhe
had done, but only to yield up themſelves to God, and
ſuffer themſelves to be exercis'd by him, and by the Events
which he ſends them.</p>

<hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And being one
Night in a moſt profound Penitence, ſhe ſaid from the
bottom of her Heart. <q>O, my Lord! What muſt I do
to pleaſe thee? For I have no body to teach me. Speak
to my Soul, and it will hear thee.</q> At that Inſtant
ſhe heard, as if another had ſpoke within her; <hi>Forſake all
earthly things. Separate thy ſelf from the Love of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

                     <hi>XI.</hi> She would go into a Monaſtery.</note> not underſtanding this
Language, and mus'd long on theſe Three Points, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how ſhe could fulfil them. She thought ſhe could not
live without earthly things, nor without loving the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
nor without loving her ſelf. Yet ſhe ſaid, <hi>By thy
Grace I will do it, Lord.</hi> But when ſhe would perform her
Promiſe, ſhe knew not where to begin, finding her ſelf
ſtrongly engag'd in the Love of all earthly things, which
ſhe did not obſerve before, and knew not how to be diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.
Having thought on the Religious in Monaſteries,
that they forſook all earthly things, and the Converſation
of the Creatures, by being ſhut up in a Cloyſter, and the
Love of themſelves, by ſubjecting of their Wills: She ask'd
leave of her Father to enter into a Cloyſter, of the diſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceated
Carmelites, but he would not permit it, ſaying, He
had rather ſee her laid in her Grave. This ſeem'd to her
a great Cruelty; for ſhe thought to find in the Cloyſters
the True Chriſtians ſhe had been ſeeking, but ſhe found
afterwards that he knew the Cloyſters better than ſhe; for
after he had forbidden her, and told her he would never
permit her to be a Religious, nor give her any Mony to
enter there, yet ſhe went to Father <hi>Laurens,</hi> the Director,
and offered to ſerve in the Monaſtery, and work hard for
her Bread, and be content with little, if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her: At which he ſmiled, and ſaid, <hi>That cannot be,
we muſt have Money to build; we take no Maids without
Money, you muſt find the way to get it; elſe there is no entry
here.</hi> This aſtoniſh'd her greatly, and ſhe was thereby
undeceiv'd as to the Cloyſters, reſolving to forſake all
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94808:142"/>
Company, and live alone, till it ſhould pleaſe God to ſhew
her what ſhe ought to do, and whither to go.</p>
               <p>XII. The more ſhe entered into her ſelf,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XII.</hi> God's Call.</note> the more ſhe
was enclin'd to abandon all, and to retire ſomewhere,
without knowing whether her Heart was diſengag'd from
temporal Goods, from worldly Pleaſures, from all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Yet ſhe did not find her ſelf altogether free nor
entirely united unto God, for ſhe was apt ſometimes to
turn again to what ſhe had left. She ask'd always
earneſtly, <q>When ſhall I be perfectly thine,</q> O, my God?
And ſhe thought he ſtill anſwered her, <hi>When thou ſhalt
no longer poſſeſs any thing, and ſhalt die to thy ſelf.</hi> 
                  <q>And
where ſhall I do that,</q> Lord? He anſwered her <hi>In the
Deſart.</hi> This made ſo ſtrong an Impreſſion on her Soul,
that ſhe aſpired after this; but being a Maid, of Eighteen
Years only, ſhe was afraid of unlucky chances, and was
never us'd to travel, and knew no way. She laid aſide
all theſe Doubts, and ſaid, <q>Lord, thou wilt guide me
how and where it ſhall pleaſe thee. It is for thee that
I do it. I will lay aſide my Habit of a Maid, and will
take that of a Hermit,</q> that I may paſs unknown.</p>

the time, and on <hi>Eaſter</hi> Evening, having cut her Hair,
put on the Habit, and ſlept a little, ſhe went out of her
Chamber about Four in the Morning, taking nothing but
One Penny to buy Bread for that Day; and it being ſaid
to her in the going out, <hi>Where is thy Faith? in a Penny.</hi>
She threw it a way, begging pardon of God for her Fault,
and ſaying, <q>No, Lord, my Faith is not in a Penny, but
in thee alone.</q> Thus ſhe went away wholly delivered from
the heavy Burthen of the Cares and good Things of this
World, and found her Soul ſo ſatisfied, that ſhe no longer
wiſh'd for any thing upon Earth, reſting entirely upon
God, with this only fear, leaſt ſhe ſhould be diſcovered
and be oblig'd to return home; for ſhe felt already more
Content in this Poverty, than ſhe had done for all her
Life, in all the Delights of the World.</p>

and coming through a Village called <hi>Baſſec,</hi> where were
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94808:142"/>
arriv'd that Day a Company of Soldiers, who were play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Market-Place, when ſhe had paſt by them, and
come to the end of the Village, ſhe met a number of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at their Play, who looking on her, began to ſay it
was a Maid, and crying this ſo loud to one another, the
Soldiers ran to know the Fray, and then taking Horſe,
they overtook her in the Fields, and ſtopt her, asking who
ſhe was, and whither ſhe went. She was ſurpriz'd, but
looking before her, ſhe ſaw a Church, and hoping there
might be ſome good Paſtor there to deliver her, ſhe ſaid
ſhe was going to the Paſtor who would ſatisfie them. The
Commander brought her to the next Village, <hi>Blatton,</hi> to
the old Mayor's Houſe, promiſing to have her to the
Paſtor's when once his Men were lodged. There he
thought to have abus'd her by force or enticement, but
ſhe told him reſolutely that he ſhould firſt kill her or
ſhe him, and that ſhe believ'd the Earth would open to
ſwallow him up. The old Mayor and his Wife defended
her, and he threatned to burn the Houſe, and call'd his
Men to Arms about it, The Maid of the Houſe got out
at a Window, and told the Paſtor, who coming into the
Chamber where the Captain was, raging like one mad,
gravely rebuked him, and taking her by the Hand, he
with his Chaplain, led her through the Soldiers into his
Lodging, the Captain ſinking into an Aſtoniſhment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Wall without ſtirring; for the Paſtor was a
grave and vertuous Man, of great Age, whoſe Words had
ſtruck the Captain and taken away all his Strength and
Spirit. But when this was over, he came with his Men
to the Paſtour's Houſe to ſearch for her, and not finding
her, and being made believe ſhe was gone, they gallop'd
toward <hi>Mons,</hi> thinking to overtake her.</p>
               <p>XV. The Paſtor ask'd who ſhe was;<note place="margin">

and that ſhe fled out of the Dangers of the World to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Jeſus Chriſt; the good Man wept, and his Soul was
confounded, to ſee a Child, like her, quit all the Wealth and
Pleaſures of the World to embrace Poverty and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
while he after ſo many Years of Penitence was not
come to ſuch a Diſengagement. Ye, he was a very Holy

had for ſome Years exercis'd the Functions of the Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Charge, after the manner that is uſually done; living
after the way of the World in God's Judgment, though
Honeſtly and without Scandal in the World's Senſe, being
often in Company as others of his rank, and there diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelf, Eating, Drinking, and making Merry, till
it pleas'd God to touch his Heart, and draw him from the

               <p>He and the Mayor having been invited on <hi>Shrove-Tueſday</hi>
to make good Chear with the Lord of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
after having paſt a part of the Night in Feaſting, as
they came home about Midnight, an enraged Soldier
met them, who had ſworn to kill the firſt he met with, he
ſhot the Mayor, who fell down dead at the Paſtor's
Feet, who immediately was inwardly ſtruck by God with
theſe Thoughts. <q>How is it that thou art not in the
place of this Man? And if thou wet there, in what
State could thy Soul be, but that of eternal Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
dying in ſo wretched a Diſpoſition as the fulneſs of
Meat, Wine, and good Cheer, which thou haſt made?
O my God, ſaid he, (turning ſuddenly to God) What
Mercy haſt thou ſhewn to make me now eſcape the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and certain Damnation of my Soul? I'll now watch
and take care to be in a better Diſpoſition.</q> Which he
reſolv'd and executed from that very Moment, beginning
to lead a Penitent and Chriſtian Life, without ever draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back from it, to his Death.</p>
               <p>Firſt he reſolv'd to live Solitary for ſome time, to
ſtrengthen him in Good, and having ſubſtituted one to
wait on his Cure for Six Months, he ſought out a Holy
Perſon by whom he might be directed, who accordingly
for Six Months treated him with great Auſterity. And
when he return'd to his Cure, he encreas'd and continu'd
what he had begun. He reſolved to mortifie his Body,
becauſe it was ſo ready to tempt his Soul, and to puniſh
it for having taken too much its Eaſe and Pleaſures. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had pleas'd himſelf with fine Linen, and fine
Cloaths, he never wore Linens any more, and girded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with a great Chain of Iron, which went twice about
and ſunk into his Fleſh. Becauſe he had lov'd to Sleep
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:94808:143"/>
at Eaſe in a good Bed, he caus'd them to bring his Coffin
and a Stone in it for his Pillow, where he lay with his
Chain about his Loins all the reſt of his Life. Becauſe
he had taken too much Reſt, and paſt ſometimes a part
of the Night in Mirth and Laughter, he ſpent Three
Hours every Night, from Eleven to Two after Midnight,
in Prayers and Tears on his Knees, before the high Altar
of his Church, to bewail his Sins, and Mens Blindneſs
and Hardneſs. Becauſe he had plesa'd himſelf with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
Lodging, he ſtaid in an Apartment which was
almoſt always full of Smoke. To puniſh the Exceſs he
thought he had committed in Eating and Drinking, he
not only abſtain'd from Fleſh and Wine, all his Days, but
alſo Seven whole Years from drinking Wine, Water, or
any Liquor, He would have been in the heats of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
as in a Furnace all dry, Mouth, Tongue, Palate,
Lips peel'd, on Fire, and like one in a burning Fever.
He renounc'd all Studies, and all curious Learning, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only Two Books, the Holy Bible, and the Lives of
the Saints, in the one of which he read every Day a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in the other a Life; ſaying of theſe Two Books,
<hi>Here's the Doctrine, (the Bible;) and here's the Practice,
(the Lives of the Saints.</hi>) He had led this Life many
Years when <hi>A. B.</hi> met with him firſt, being then Sixty
Years of Age, and continued in it Twelve Years more.
This Holy Man had received Power from God over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Spirits, and cur'd many poſſeſt with Devils; a <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
Soldier was brought to him afflicted with a Devil;
he ſtaid with him for ſome Months, and finding himſelf
better, went away; the Paſtor exhorting him to live in
the fear of God, leaſt if he ſhould fall again into Sin, the
Devil get more hold of him than formerly. But he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

made him more wicked than before, and among other
things, inſpir'd him with ſuch a helliſh Rage againſt the
Paſtor, that he reſolv'd to kill him, becauſe he had remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
to him that his Life was Evil. He told it openly,
and threatned it for Three Years, and when he came there
to his Winter-Quarters, they advertis'd the Paſtor, but he
judg'd it was nothing but Menaces, and thought himſelf
unworthy to die the Death of a Martyr. On <hi>Good-Friday</hi>
having heard the Confeſſions of his Pariſhioners who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd

the Seats with his Carbine, ſhot at him, who fell ſuddenly
down, calling upon God: The Villain perceiving that he
yet breathed, ran and gave him many ſtrokes with his drawn
Sword in the Head, till he cleav'd it ſo as the Brains fell on
the Pavement. Some Children who had ſtaid in the
Church, ran and publiſh'd the Murther. He was carried

well pleaſing to God, there is nothing needful but to love
him. He replied, <q>You do not know me: In the Age
in which you ſee me, I aſſure you my Fleſh is yet ſo
rebellious, that if I did not tame it and make it ſuffer,
it would yet riſe up againſt my Spirit, it would rule

Pleaſure and Satisfaction in them, which would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

ſhe ſhould ſerve him perfectly in the Deſart, it was told
her, <hi>That the time was not yet come, many Societies of Men
and Women muſt follow her thither, and that ſhe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh
his Goſpel Spirit.</hi> And when ſhe could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
how this could be, being an ignorant Child, who
had never learnt of any what a Goſpel Life was, and knew
none, and had no Authority; it was ſaid to her, <hi>Behold
theſe Trees in the Church-Yard, they ſeem dry Wood without

               <p>XVIII. The Archbiſhop <hi>Vanderburgh</hi> came about Three
Weeks after,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XVIII.</hi> The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> comes to ſee her.</note> and ſpoke with her, and was perſwaded that
ſhe was guided by the Spirit of God, but would not let
her go to the Deſart, but oblig'd her to live a Recluſe there
in a little Houſe which the Paſtour offer'd to make for
her in the Church-yard. But the ſame Day her Parents
came thither from <hi>Liſle</hi> to find her, and with great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
ſhe was prevail'd with to return with them, her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
faithfully promiſing to the Archbiſhop to allow her all
freedom to ſerve God in the Perfection ſhe deſired, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
engaging her in worldly Affairs, or urging her to
Marry; the Archbiſhop being ſurety he ſhould perform
it, and if not, he would take her into his own Care.</p>
               <p>XIX. But after ſome Months,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XIX.</hi> She returns home with her Parents.</note> her Father engag'd her
again into his Affairs, and on divers Occaſions ſpoke to
her of Marriage, contrary to his Promiſe, which greatly
troubled her. She beg'd leave to return to the Archbiſhop,
which he would not permit. She exercis'd her ſelf in
viſiting the Sick and Poor, in frequenting the Churches,
learn'd the Offices, and other vocal Prayers in which ſhe
found great Devotion, and confeſt and communicated
thrice a Week; but ſhe found at length that the Poor
were deceitful, and not thankful to God, but by what
they got, ſinn'd the more. She left off viſiting them, yet
gave for God all ſhe could. All Creatures became Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
to her, and ſhe gave her ſelf more to Solitude and
Silence, and went ſeldomer to Church, finding more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection
in her Chamber. She could not ſay her Office,
being ſtill interrupted with inward Converſation <q>She
beg'd of God to know if he had forſaken her,</q> or if ſhe
had become ſloathful. He ſaid, <hi>I am Spirit, ſpeak to me in
Spirit, I will operate now in Spirit and in Trtuh. Ceaſe,
and I will do all.</hi> She reſign'd her ſelf wholly to him,
baniſhing all Imaginations of her own. And ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
more clearly the Inſpirations of God.</p>
               <p>XX. The Religious of the ſeveral Orders came to her,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XX.</hi> Her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor.</note>
to warn her of her Danger of being deluded by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
for want of a Director, and each offered their Service.
She thank'd them, and was warn'd by God to apply to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94808:145"/>
her own Paſtor, and never had any other Confeſſor. She
continued in her Retirement and interiour Prayers with
great delight. The Devil fail'd not to diſturb her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
by Spectres and other Noiſes. She was greatly afraid,
but addreſſing to God and purſuing her Prayers; he ſaid,
<hi>Fear not; I am with thee.</hi> And thus ſhe acquired ſo much
firmneſs that ſhe fear'd nothing but Sin.</p>
               <p>XXI. Being ſtill warned to go from her Father's Houſe,<note place="margin">

Place and Perſons that were to follow her, that ſhe might
go ſeek them, tho' to the end of the World. It was ſaid
to her, <hi>Seek none, but cultivate what ſhall be delivered and
put into your Hands: Declare only my Deſigns.</hi> It trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
her to declare thoſe Deſigns out of fear of Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
and conceal'd the Graces of God to her, even
from her Confeſſor. She pray'd to God, that he would
deliver her from this Enterprize, and chooſe another; ſhe
being a ſimple Girl, void of all Force and Authority,
every way weak. He ſaid to her, <hi>I will be thy All; My
Power is not limited; Give thy Conſent.</hi> She ſaid, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
haſt thou not made me a Man? I would have had
more Advantage and Capacity that thou mighteſt ſerve

told him that his Malediction could not reach her, being
in the Grace of God, and they deſir'd her to go freely whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

She ſaid, <q>We will labour the Ground, and have
our Neceſſaries from the Fields, without asking Money
of thoſe who would come thither. Poor and Rich ſhall
be alike welcome. We aiming at no Commodity on

She went to the Archbiſhop, who being perſwaded ſhe
was guided by the Holy Spirit, thought ſhe ought not to
take the Direction of Men. <hi>Pere du Bois</hi> confirm'd the
ſame. She reſted upon this, yet begg'd leave of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
to read the New Teſtament, that ſhe might diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Goſpel. She no ſooner began to read attentively the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,

Writing, ſhe ſhould write ſuch a Book in Subſtance as

God would provide for the reſt. That he never fail'd
thoſe who ſerv'd him truly; and if they ſerv'd him ill,
far better that all be diſſolved than to deceive the World
by Hypocriſie. He ask'd, If ſhe would make Vows.
She ſaid, None. He ſaid, Each ones Love was not ſo
ſtrong as to make them perſevere freely. She ſaid, They
who have it not, will not come: And if they loſe the
Love of God when they are there, it is far better they
return to the World, than to diſorder others or make

to ſurprize <hi>Liſle.</hi> She retir'd into the Town in the Houſe
of a poor devout Maid, who gave her a Corner in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
where in the Winter ſhe ſuffered great Cold, being
oft covered with Snow in the Morning when ſhe awak'd.
The Counteſs of <hi>Willerwall</hi> wrote to her earneſtly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to her, which ſhe did, and ſtaid with her about a
Year, till ſhe was call'd to <hi>Liſle,</hi> her Father being a
dying.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. Having done the laſt Offices to her Father,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXXIII.</hi> Does the laſt Offices to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſucceeds to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Goods.</note>
and her Siſter being dead Childleſs, and ſhe remaining
the ſole Heireſs of her Mother, ſhe was doubtful whether
ſhe ſhould meddle with the Succeſſion. She conſidered
on the one hand, that after having forſaken all worldly
Goods to follow the Poverty of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe ought
not to take them up again; on the other ſide, ſhe knew
not to whom to leave it, fearing to do Evil, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in the Sins of thoſe who ſhould poſſeſs it. Her
Mother-in-Law had waſted thoſe Goods more than a half
for the Five Years ſhe had liv'd with him, and tho' at his
Marriage he had 20000 Florins in Caſh, yet ſhe had not
only ſpent that, but great Revenues of his own Goods,
and of his firſt Wife's; beſides the Revenues of his Office,
capable of maintaining honourably all his Family; ſo
that at his Death there was not wherewith to bury him.
She would not be guilty therefore of leaving them to one
who would make no other uſe of them but to offend
God: In this Perplexity ſhe advis'd with her Confeſſor,
who thought that ſhe ought to take what belong'd to
her, and diſpoſe of it in Alms; remitting her nevertheleſs
to be determined by God. After ſome Days of earneſt
Prayers to God, that he would direct her what to do in this
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:94808:148"/>
matter, he ſaid to her, <hi>Purſue your Right, take your Goods,
you ſhall have need of them for my Glory.</hi> She claim'd then
the half of the Goods, due to her by Law and Cuſtom,
as the ſole Heireſs of her Mother, leaving the other for
the Children of the ſecond Marriage; and was toſt with
many Troubles before that Proceſs was at an end.</p>
               <p>XXXIV. Some are ready to interpret this as a hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after the World,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXXIV.</hi> Nothing in this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of God, or Man.</note> as ſhe foreſaw they would, and that
her Declaration, that it was the Will of God that ſhe
ſhould poſſeſs her Rights, was purely her own Invention
to cover this. We are ſtill apt to meaſure others by our
ſelves, and to think tht their Actions cannot proceed from
another Spirit and Principle than what we are conſcious
ours would flow from in the ſame Circumſtances. But
they who conſider the whole tract of her Life, will not be
ſo raſh in their Judgment: Worldly Goods are not Evil
in themſelves, the only Evil is, that when we poſſeſs them,
we are not as tho' we poſſeſt them not, but our Hearts are
ſet on them; and therefore God commands either the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
or keeping of them, and we ought either to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
or poſſeſs them, according as our Hearts are apt to be
ſet upon them, or are wholly mortified to them. <hi>A. B.</hi>
had been habituated to a State of Mortification to the
World, and all earthly things, by an actual abandoning of
it in a courſe of many Years, God having thus tried her, as
he did <hi>Abraham</hi> in relation to his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and this was
become her Delight and Element. And when ſhe came to
poſſeſs them again, it appears through all her Life that
ſhe did it as tho' ſhe poſſeſt them not, looking on her ſelf
only as a Steward of them, to employ them for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
Uſe, and they as a weighty Charge to her, which ſhe
would gladly have been rid of, employing them wholly
for many Years in the bringing up of Orphans, and never
throughout all her Life taking to her ſelf but ſimple Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
no more than if ſhe had been in the greateſt
Poverty.</p>
               <p>XXXV. Being one Day in the Street about her Affairs,<note place="margin">

came to her Lodging, telling her there were multitudes
of poor Infants made Orphans by the Wars, in great
Want both as to Body and Soul, and that ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
this great Evil, God having given her Talents and
Commodities to undertake ſo good a Work, and pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:94808:148"/>
her to recommend this Propoſition to God, who would
make known his Will to her thereabout. The Man had
a great Appearance of Piety, and ſpoke ſo divinely of
ſpiritual Things, that ſhe thought he was taught by the
Holy Spirit. He told her, He was call'd <hi>John S. Saulieu,</hi>
born near <hi>Dorway,</hi> that he had never ſtudied Letters but
for his own Perfection; that he had ſtill convers'd with
Vertuous Perſons, and ſtaid ſome time with an Hermit,
and had now for his Director the Paſtor of St. <hi>Stephens,</hi>
at <hi>Liſle;</hi> (and a Character being ask'd of him, he ſaid he
was a Man of an Apoſtolick Zeal.) He walk'd on the
Streets with his Countenance ſtill bow'd down, without
Curioſity. In the Churches he was almoſt ſtill on his
Knees, as in a profound Devotion: He viſited the Poor and
Sick, giving them all he had; and if he had found any
without cloathing, in the Winter, on the Streets, he
would have gone aſide and taken off his own Garment
and given them; he gave many Appearances of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Piety, ſo that all judg'd him a Holy Perſon. Many
Prieſts and godly Perſons conſulted him in ſpiritual Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in which he was very Knowing, and gave Counſel
to every one. He told her he was dead to Nature, and
ſo diſengag'd from all worldly Goods that he could take
no Pleaſure in them, and that by Abſtinence he had loſt
the taſte of all Meats, ſo that all were alike to him.</p>
               <p>XXXVI. He continued to ſollicite her to this Employ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXXVI.</hi> She under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the Care of a Hoſpital of Orphans.</note>
for a Year and a half, as that whereby ſhe could beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Glory of God. In <hi>November,</hi> therefore, 1653.
about the 37th. Year of her Age ſhe undertakes the Care
of a Hoſpital of Orphan Maids, founded by one <hi>John
Stappart</hi> a Merchant in <hi>Liſle,</hi> ſome Twelve or Thirteen
Years before. She found all Filthy, and in Diſorder. She
made all Clean, and put all in Order, and made a Rule
by which all were alike as to Diet, Bed, Cloathing, and
all other Accommodations. She eat with them at the ſame
Table, and obſerv'd the ſame Rule. All went well out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
but her greateſt Compaſſion was for their Souls.
She found them as Rude and Ignorant as little Beaſts.
Girls receiv'd into the Houſe of Fourteen or Fifteen Years
of Age, knew not they had a Soul. This gave her ſuch
Compaſſion that ſhe wiſh'd ſhe could take them all into
her Houſe. It encreas'd to more than Fifty, though the
Fond was but for Ten or Twelve. And God gave her
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:94808:149"/>
ſpiritually and bodily all that ſhe had need of. And ſhe
employed her own Goods to maintain them, and her
Time to inſtruct them. They learn'd the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and ſome Calling to gain their Living, each accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Capacity. And ſhe brought all things into
ſuch Order, that there was almoſt no Trouble in gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this great Family. All was regulated from Morning
till Night without Intermiſſion. They roſe preciſely at
Five; and after having ſpent half an Hour in dreſſing
and Prayer, they learn'd to read and write till half after
Six: Then they went to Church: At Seven they were ſet
to work, with which they recited the common Prayers:
They breakfaſt at Eight, and read ſome pious Book: At
Nine they ſung ſpiritual Songs: The next Hour they paſt
in ſilence at work: At Eleven they repeated the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm:
And din'd at Noon: After which they took half
an Hours Recreation. And from One to Eight they paſt
over the ſame Exerciſes which they had done in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon:
When they had ſup'd, at Eight they went into the
Oratory to pray; and after that, lay down in ſilence, and
all the Lamps were put out at Nine. Thus the Houſe
was eſtabliſh'd in good Order and Diſcipline, and the
Citizens were deſirous to have Servant-Maids out of it,
when they had ſpent ſome time there, becauſe they were
Honeſt and Faithful.</p>
               <p>XXXVII. <hi>A. B.</hi> was much afflicted in this Hoſpital
with frequent Sickneſſes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXXVII.</hi> Her fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes there.</note> which would often ſeize her ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
and bring her to the Gates of Death; they ſeem'd
not to be natural, and afterwards the Children confeſt
they had endeavour'd to poyſon her by Diabolical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
<hi>Stappart</hi> and <hi>S. Saulieu</hi> came oft to viſit her, and
ſeem'd greatly pleas'd with the good Government of the
Houſe. <hi>S. Saulieu</hi> had had for ſome Years the Care of
another Houſe of Orphan Boys, which about this time
broke up, the Rent being exhauſted. He ſolicited <hi>A. B.</hi>
to contribute to the building of another. He and <hi>Stap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi>
told her one Day of a Project to take Farms of the
City, where he would gain 2000 Florins a Year in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, if ſhe would be Surety for him. And this
would begin a Fond for ſuch a Houſe. She conſented, ſo
he got the Profit of Three Years which came to 6000 Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins;
but no more Word of the Poor, he ſaid all was his,
and the Fruit of his Labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:94808:149"/>
XXXVIII. One Day he propos'd to <hi>A. B.</hi> that they
might marry together,<note place="margin">XXXVIII St. <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of her.</note> and yet live in Virginity, that he
might aſſiſt her in the Cares of the Houſe. She told him,
Marriage was not needful for that. He began from time
to time to give little Demonſtrations of Friendſhip, which
ſhe did not take notice of, becauſe of the good Opinion
ſhe had of him. But by degrees he diſcover'd entirely his
Paſſion, telling her this Love muſt be from God, for he
could never affect any Maid to eſpouſe her, and now
Night and Day he was enclin'd to marry her, and could
not reſiſt God. She ſhew'd great Diſpleaſure; and he beg'd
Pardon with Tears, offering to do Pennance, and ſaid it
was only a Tentation had ſurpriz'd him. Out of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Goodneſs ſhe believ'd it was ſo. But whereas he began
the ſame ſeveral times, ſhe would needs baniſh him the
Houſe. Then he told her, ſhe muſt be his Wife or he
would kill her. She endeavour'd to reaſon him out of his
Madneſs, repreſenting to him the Sanctity of his former
Diſcourſes, the Zeal of his Charity, the Honeſty of his
Converſation, and the Reputation he had acquir'd amongſt
good Men, asking the Reaſon of ſuch a Change. He told
her, <q>He was not what he had appear'd to be; that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
from his Youth a haughty Mind, he deſir'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
himſelf from the People, which ſince he could
not do by Birth or Wealth, he reſolv'd to put on the
Appearance of Vertue and Piety, as being more eſteem'd,
which made him practiſe outward Works of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Devotion; that he learn'd to ſpeak after ſo
ſublime a manner of inward things, by reading care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſpiritual Books, and obſerving her Words, Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and way of Behaviour: That the firſt time he
ſaw her on the Street he was ſtruck with Love of her,
and all he had done and ſaid ſince, was to inſinuate into
her Friendſhip, and to enjoy her by Love or Force;
which he was reſolv'd upon,</q> tho' he ſhould hang for it.
She threatning to ſend for the Three Paſtors, the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers
of the Houſe, he ſaid he would then proclaim ſhe
was his Wife, and that he had lain with her, and divers
Caſuiſts were in the Opinion one might do ſo, and ſo with
a good Conſcience he might follow this probable Opinion.</p>
               <p>XXXIX. <hi>A. B.</hi> reſolving rather to be expos'd to the
Perſecution of evil Tongues,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XXXIX.</hi> Her Deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>very from him, and his end.</note> than to the Brutality of
this Villain, ſhe acquaints the Paſtors, and he continuing
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94808:150"/>
notwithſtanding to moleſt her, knocking at the Gates,
and threatning to break up her Doors and Windows, ſhe
applies to the Magiſtrates, and after the Affair was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
he being afraid to be impriſon'd, or even hang'd
for offering to force the Houſe, he by the Jeſuits, among
whom he had a Brother, employs many Friends to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the Magiſtrates and <hi>A. B.</hi> to ceaſe the Proceſs, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make what Reparation ſhe pleas'd. So there was
an Authentick Accord made and ſeal'd with the great Seal
of the City, the 17th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1658. Wherein he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
the Slanders he had uttered againſt her, obliging
himſelf under a great Penalty never to come again into
her Preſence, and paying all the Expences of the Proceſs.
After this, he debauch'd, at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> one of the Maids who
had been with her, who with Difficulty got him to marry
her, both of them afterwards leading a profligate Life,
and he ſtirring up all the Miſchief he could againſt <hi>A. B.</hi>
But at the end of Three Years he became mad, and died
in rage, denying God, and calling on the Devils to help
him, crying out that he felt the Pains of Hell, and the
Torments of Devils. She afterwards often ask'd of God,
<q>Why he permitted her to remain ſo long in Blindneſs
as to that Man, while ſhe often knew the State of the
Souls of others whom ſhe never ſaw?</q> She was told,
<hi>It was to exerciſe her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XL. To prevent the like Dangers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XL.</hi> She turns her Houſe into a Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> 
                  <hi>A. B.</hi> would needs
have her Houſe ſhut up as a Cloyſter, that no Men might
have occaſion to come to her, which was done by Order
and under Protection of the Biſhop of <hi>Tournay.</hi> She was
now greatly comforted and in quiet, being out of the
Hazard of the Converſation of Men. The Children alſo
lived more ſatisfied, learning all things more perfectly.
She applied more cloſely to teach them, and to obſerve
their Faults. She endeavoured to her Power to perfect
their Souls, and to make them capable alſo to gain their
Living, they greatly lov'd and obey'd her, and liv'd in great
Concord, tho' of different Countries and Tempers, and
every one thought thoſe Children happy, and that they
were like little Angels, as they outwardly appear'd.</p>
               <p>XLI. About Three Years after,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>XLI.</hi> The Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Childrens Sorceries.</note> ſhe was thus ſhut up,
one of the Girls of Fifteen Years having done ſome Fault,
was ſhut cloſe up for a Pennance in the Priſon of the
Houſe. Within an Hour after ſhe came into the Work-Houſe
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:94808:150"/>
where all the reſt were, tho' the Proviſor had lock'd
her up within Three Gates, and was gone to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and had the Keys at her Girdle. <hi>A. B.</hi> upon enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
finding all this to be true, ask'd her <hi>How ſhe got out?</hi>
She ſaid, <q>A Man had taken her out.</q> And after Dinner
having call'd her to her, and ſhe giving the ſame Anſwer.
She ask'd <hi>If ſhe knew him.</hi> She ſaid, <q>Very well, it was
the Devil.</q> At this <hi>A. B.</hi> trembled, ſaying, <hi>The Devil
is a Spirit, not a Man.</hi> The Girl ſaid, <q>He comes to me
in the form of a Man, and I calling him to help me
when ſhut up,</q> he opened the Door and took me out.
<hi>A. B.</hi> ask'd <hi>if ſhe had known this Man of a long time.</hi> She
ſaid, <q>Yes, all her Life, that her Mother from her Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
had carried her to the Sabbath of the Witches,
which is kept in the Night, and that ſhe being a little
Child, this Devil Man was then alſo a Young Boy, and
grew up as ſhe did, being always her Lover, and careſs'd
her Day and Night.</q> 
                  <hi>A. B.</hi> could not conceive this, for
ſhe had never heard of ſuch things.</p>
               <p>She immediately wrote for the Three Paſtors, the
Overſeers of the Houſe, to whom the Maid declared that
ſhe had given her Soul to the Devil, and denied God,
and to confirm the Gift had received a Mark in her Foot,
which ſhe did freely when Twelve Years of Age, though
long before this Lover had ſtill entertain'd her and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
her to the Sabbaths of Sorcerers in great Caſtles,
where they met to eat, drink, dance, ſing, and do a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
other Inſolencies. She put her out of the Houſe the
ſame Day, fearing leaſt the other Girls ſhould be corrupted.
It grieved her to ſee the Devil had ſuch Power, and yet
ſhe could not believe that this <hi>Bellotte</hi> (for the Girl was
ſo call'd) was a Witch, for ſhe ſtill thought they were
filthy and deform'd Creatures, as ſhe had heard they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
themſelves into Cats or other Animals. She pray'd
to God to diſcover her unknown Sins, and continued in
her pious Exerciſes, believing ſhe had purg'd the Houſe
of ſuch Perſons.</p>
               <p>About Three Months after, another Girl of Fifteen
Years was going to be impriſon'd for Stealing, ſhe ſaid the
Devil made her do it; and ſhe was immediately put out
of the Houſe that it might be purg'd of ſuch. But Three
Months after, another of Eleven Years was going to be
whip'd for the ſame Fault, and ſhe ſaid do it not, and I
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:94808:151"/>
will tell who made me do this Evil. And <hi>A. B.</hi> taking
her to her Chamber, ſhe ſaid it was the Devil; that
being Young and playing with the Girls of the Town,
they ask'd her if ſhe would go with them to the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that ſhe ſhould have good Cheer and a Lover, how
ſoon ſhe was Content, the Lover came on a little Horſe,
and took her by the Hand, asking if ſhe would be his
Miſtreſs; ſhe conſenting, was carried through the Air with
him, and the other Girls, into a great Caſtle, where they
had all ſort of Feaſting and Mirth, that ſhe has been
there ever ſince, Three or Four times a Week: That at
the Age of Ten Years ſhe gave her Soul to the Devil, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
God and her Baptiſm, and receiv'd a Mark in her
Head, which was afterwards found to be inſenſible; for
they put a Pin the length of ones Finger into her Head
without her feeling any Pain.</p>
               <p>The Paſtors having examined this Girl, thought not fit
to put her out of the Houſe, till it were diſcovered from
whence his Evil might ariſe. She was kept in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
apart, and <hi>Peter Salmon,</hi> Paſtor of St. <hi>Sauvear,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to examine her daily, and to endeavour her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and asking her one Day, if there were any other in
the Houſe like to her, ſhe ſaid there were Two who went
with her daily to the Sabbath. They being call'd, and
ſpoke with ſeparately in private, confeſt ingenuouſly that
they were in Covenant with the Devil. Theſe Two ſaid,
there were yet other Two in the Houſe, and being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to name them, each of them nam'd Two different
Perſons, who being call'd, confeſt, each of theſe naming
yet Two different Perſons who were of the ſame Crew:
So that from Two to Four, from Four to Eight, it was
diſcovered that all the Two and Thirty Girls which were
then in the Houſe, were all in general, and each one in
particular bound to the Devil, of their own Free-will, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
contracted it diverſly; ſome from their Fathers, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
from their Mothers, ſome had learn'd it by little
Girls in playing together, as they declared both to <hi>A. B.</hi>
and to the ſaid Paſtor, who put in Writing all they ſaid
to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. B.</hi> was in no little Perplexit to be ſhut up in a
Houſe, from whence ſhe could not get out, with Thirty
Two Perſons who declar'd they had given their Souls to
the Devil, and that ſhe muſt eat and drink with them, or
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:94808:151"/>
what they made ready. She propos'd to diſmiſs them by
degrees, but then fear'd to be guilty of the Miſchiefs they
would do to others, for they confeſt they had made both
Men and Beaſts die. The Paſtors thought it fitteſt to
keep them; ſaid there were Hopes they might be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God, having been engag'd to the Devil before the
Uſe of their Reaſon, and promiſed to come every Day to
admoniſh and exerciſe them, and pray for their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
This was done for the ſpace of Eight Months, in
which the Girls made great ſhews of Converſion, by Tears,
repeated Confeſſions, Prayers, and attending to the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
given them, but without Sincerity. Their Hearts
were wedded to the ſenſual Pleaſures which the Devil gave
them. So that they had not the Deſire to change or leave
thoſe wretched Pleaſures; as one of them, of Twenty
Two Years, ſaid one Day to <hi>A. B.</hi> No ſays ſhe, <q>I would
not be otherwiſe, I find too much Contentment in it
to leave it, I am always careſs'd: I have been ſo from
Eight Years to Two and Twenty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>XLII.<note place="margin">XLII. Their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations.</note> Paſtor <hi>Salmon</hi> wrote down their Confeſſions, they
declar'd plainly they had daily carnal Converſation with
the Devil, that they went to the Sabbath, where they eat,
drank, danc'd, and committed other Senſualities. Each
had their Devil in form of a Man, and the Men theirs in
form of a Woman; that they never ſaw more numerous
Meetings in the City than at their Sabbaths, of People of
all Ranks, Young and Old, Rich and Poor, Noble and
Ignoble, but above all, of all ſorts of Monks and Nuns,
Prieſts and Prelates, and that every one kept their Rank
there, as they are in the World. Many of them ſhed
plenty of Tears when <hi>A. B.</hi> ſpoke to them of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, of the Joys of Paradiſe, and the Pains of
Hell; and when ſhe ask'd ſome of the moſt ſenſible of
them, <hi>If thoſe Tears were ſincere;</hi> they ſaid, <q>They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from a Grief of having denied God, and given
up themſelves to the Devils; but this laſted no longer
than they were ſpoke to, or thought upon their
miſerable State, and then preſently the Devil came and
ask'd them if they would leave him, and the Pleaſures
they had together, and ſo careſs'd them, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
their Covenant with him, forgetting all their
former good Purpoſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:94808:152"/>
She ask'd, <hi>If the Admonitions, Exorciſms, and Prayers
of the Paſtors did not deprive the Devil of Power to keep
them ſubject to him.</hi> They ſaid, <q>The Devil mock'd at
theſe things, and did ape the Paſtors: When they kneeled
to pray, he did ſo behind them, and with a Book mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the ſame Words. When they preach'd, he us'd the
ſame Geſtures, and alſo threw Holy Water, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd

               <p>She ask'd, <hi>How they could pray or ſing ſo many good
Prayers all Day, being in Covenant with the Devil.</hi> They
ſaid, <q>He prayed and ſang with them, becauſe their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were without Attention; and inſtead of ſinging Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to God, their Intentions were to ſing Praiſes to the
Devil, in which he gloried and valued himſelf. She</q>
ask'd, <hi>How they could approach the Table of the Lord, and
receive the Sacrament.</hi> They ſaid, <q>The Devil incited
them to do it as often as they could, and the greateſt
Pennance ſhe could ordain them was to make them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from the Sacrament, which cover'd their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and made them paſs for good Perſons before Men:
Beſides, the Devil did his moſt miſchievous Deeds with
the Conſecrated Bread. She ſaid, <hi>All this would aſſuredly</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>lead them to Hell.</hi> They ſaid, <q>They knew it very well;
but the Devil promiſed them the ſame carnal and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
Pleaſures there, that they had with him in this
World.</q>
               </p>
               <p>She ask'd, <hi>If they knew indeed that it was the Devil that
entertain'd them ſo, and if they knew there was a Hell, and
a Paradiſe before they came into her Houſe.</hi> They ſaid,
<q>Yes; for the Devil taught them that, and had often
catechis'd them, and taught them there was a God, a
Paradiſe, a Hell, and a Devil; that they who did his
Will, could never ſee God, but ſhould be his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Hell to all Eternity.</q> She ask'd, <hi>How they could
belong to the Devil from their Infancy.</hi> They ſaid, <q>This
came from their Parents. When Fathers or Mothers
give themſelves to the Devil, they give all that is theirs,
and it is rare to ſee, when they have been offered by
their Parents to the Devil, even before they are born,
that they withdraw after they are come to Age, for the
Habit in Evil becomes natural to them; and the Devil
entertaining them from their Infancy with Careſſes and
ſenſual Pleaſures, he ſo gains upon them, that they
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:94808:152"/>
would not quit him for any thing, after they have been
ſo allur'd by his Senſualities, ſuch as all Men could not
give them: For he contrives to make them eat all ſort
of Meats ſavoury to their Taſte, all ſort of Liquors plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to their Throat, all ſort of Muſick to their Ears, of
Odour to their Smell, of Ticklings to their Fleſh, ſo
that being brought up thus, it is almoſt impoſſible to
deſire to leave them; and therefore, ſay they, we would
not change our Condition, for we find more Pleaſure
in it than Men can give us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>She bewail'd their Miſery, and ſhew'd them <hi>all was but
Deceit and Illuſion: For Inſtance, that they had not eaten
nor drunken at their Sabbaths, they would have been very
hungry in the Morning, and eaten with good Appetite great
Lumps of Butter, yea, dry Bread when given them. And
if they had been eating ſuch dainty Meat, they would have
diſreliſh'd ſuch groſs Food.</hi> They ſaid, <q>They had never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
the taſte and pleaſure of all theſe, and therefore
would not leave them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>She ask'd, <hi>How it was poſſible that Parents ſhould thus
offer their Children to the Devil, and not to God who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them.</hi> They ſaid <q>Thoſe who are thus bound to the
Devil, will have no other God but him, and therefore
offer him all they have that is moſt dear, and even are
conſtran'd to offer their Children, elſe he would beat
them, and hinder them from being married or having
Children; both which he can hinder by his Adheren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

That when a Child thus offered comes to the Uſe of
Reaſon, he then asks their Soul, makes them deny
God, renounce their Baptiſm and Faith, and promiſe
Faith and Fidelity to the Devil, after the manner of an
Eſpouſal. And inſtead of a Ring, gives them ſome
Mark, as with an Awl of Iron, in ſome part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which Marks he renews as oft as they have a deſire
to leave him, and binds them more ſtrongly by new
Promiſes, giving them thoſe new Marks for a Pledge
that they ſhall continue faithful to him: And how ſoon
they come to Age capable of having Children, he makes
them offer the Will they have of marrying to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and therewith all the Fruit that can proceed from
their Marriage, which they promiſe willingly, that they
may attain their Deſigns; otherwiſe the Devil threatens
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94808:153"/>
to hinder them, by all ſort of means from marrying or
bringing forth Children.</q>

devoted to him, being once habituated to all manner of

under modeſt and humble Words, Cloaths, and Geſtures,
did conceal proud, worldly, and unregenerate Hearts. Of
them ſhe writes in <hi>La Lum. neé en tenebres,</hi> Part 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serrarius,</hi> Famous enough for his Writings and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence,
at firſt highly eſteem'd her, proclaim'd her as
a living Goſpel: And all the time he found her Thoughts
agree with his, as to the laſt Plagues, the Converſion of
the Jews, Re-eſtabliſhment of the Church, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth, all went well; but
when he found that ſhe was not for the Re-eſtabliſhment
of a certain Levitical Worſhip which he fancied, nor made
any reckoning of an Impoſtor among the Jews, who was
riſen up in the Eaſt, he declared againſt her, and ſtudied
to effice every where the good Impreſſions he had given
of her. She clears her ſelf by a publick Print, <hi>Tomb. de
la fauſſe Theol.</hi> Part 2. Letter 14.</p>
               <p>At that time <hi>Labadie</hi> and his Diſciples, had as much
Eſteem for her and her Writings, as afterwards they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
an Averſion for both: They endeavour'd to bring
her over to them by M. <hi>de Cort,</hi> offering great Summs
of Money to buy <hi>Noordſtradt,</hi> and to go with them, but
to no purpoſe. She found he had no other Light but
what Reading, barren Speculations, and ſome Acts of his
own Underſtanding gave him; and for a Motive of his
Conduct, ſome ſtrong Conceits and Motions of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Paſſions, without being any ways enlightned by the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:94808:156"/>
Spirit of God, or govern'd by the calm Motions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inſpiration. Therefore he and his, fail'd not to blacken
her on all Occaſions, the moſt piouſly and cunningly they
could, that the People might reckon her to be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Satan, and abhor her as the Devil himſelf.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Commenius,</hi> ſo Famous among the Learned, being
then acquainted with her, had quite other Thoughts.
But his Knowledge had not puff'd him up, tho' it gave
him ſome Prejudices, which made him propoſe ſome
Difficulties, in which ſhe ſatisfied him. On his Death-Bed
he bid tell her to give him the laſt Viſit, ſaying, <hi>O
the Holy Maid! Where is ſhe? May I have the Happineſs
to ſee her yet once before I die! All the Knowledge and
Sciences I have had, are nothing but Productions of Reaſon,
and of the Mind of Man; but ſhe has a Wiſdom and Light
that comes from none but God alone, immediately by the
Holy Spirit. A. B.</hi> ſaid often of him, that ſhe never knew
a Learned Man who had a better and more humble Heart
than he.<note place="margin">Tomb. de la fauſſe Theol. Part 2. Letter 1.</note> 
                  <q>I was viſited alſo, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> by the Socinians,
who do altogether deſpiſe Jeſus Chriſt, ſaying, that it
is Idolatry to worſhip him: And they ask'd me one
Day, If I believed alſo in a created God, as Jeſus Chriſt
was? I did not much reaſon with them, becauſe ſuch
impertinent Queſtions deſerv'd no Anſwer, telling them
only, that they ought not to come to me with ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Diſcourſe, ſo they withdrew themſelves. Yet
ſome affirm, that I am of their Sentiments, from which
I pray God preſerve me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many falſe Prophets and Propheteſſes</hi> came to viſit her:
One ſhewing her his Sword half drawn, ſaid he was going
to behead all the Kings of the Earth, and would begin
at <hi>England;</hi> and ſo entring into a little Bark, it is not
known what became of him. Another, <hi>John Roth,</hi> had made
ready Standards for the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom
he was to re eſtabliſh, and ſome well-meaning People
followed him. In ſome Viſits he made her, ſhe eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereded
the Illuſion, and warn'd her Friends to beware
of him, being expreſly told by God, that <hi>he was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
Man over whom the Devil had much Power.</hi>
God gave her the ſame Sentiments of thoſe of his Cabal,
particularly of one <hi>Quirin Kuhlman.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> alſo
would try if they could draw her over to their Sect, but
they ſoon gave over their Hopes, and one wrote againſt
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:94808:157"/>
her, upon which afterwards when in <hi>Holſtein,</hi> ſhe wrote
the <hi>Advertiſement contre les Trembleurs.</hi> Thus it ſeems
the Devil deſign'd to diſtract or ſeduce her by all theſe
ſorts of Perſons. But God would thereby exerciſe her,
and make her know by experience to what height the
Folly and Preſumption of Man can go, when joyn'd with
the Illuſions of the Devil, never letting her be deceived
by them. He deſign'd alſo thereby to let the World ſee
the vaſt difference between the falſe Lights of the Devil or
the Imagination, and the true Light that God ſends in
a way ſo ſolid, ſo clear, and ſo little capable of being
ſuſpected, ſince ſhe, by whom he communicates it, ſeeks
to draw no body after her, aiming at nothing but a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
retir'd, ſolitary Life, diſengag'd from all Pleaſures,
Riches, and Honours, imitating Jeſus Chriſt, without
obliging any body to believe any other thing, as neceſſary
for Salvation, but the Love of God, and the denying of
ones ſelf; looking on all other Knowledge, and even
things of Revelation, as not neceſſary for thoſe who have
not yet Light and Grace enough neceſſary to receive
them. In which it is abſolutely impoſſible that Seduction
ſhould mingle it ſelf. God made her alſo ſee how far the
beſt cultivated humane Spirits are blinded and remov'd
from the Kingdom of God, by ſome Converſations ſhe
had with the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> both <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi>
particularly with the Profeſſors, <hi>Heydanus</hi> and <hi>Burman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi>
upon which occaſion ſhe wrote the Twelfth Letter
of the Firſt Part of <hi>Tomb. de la fauſſe Theol.</hi> The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
would perſwade her, that in ſpiritual things ſhe
came near their Principles. She told them their Malady
was, that they would needs comprehend all by the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of Humane Reaſon, without giving place to the
Light of Divine Faith, which requires a Ceſſation of the
activity of our Reaſon; that God may ſhed or revive
therein that Divine Light, without which not only God
is not well known, but even he and the true Knowledge of
him are baniſh'd out of the Soul by this activity of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Mind and Reaſon; which is a real kind of Atheiſm,
and rejecting of God. They were ſo full of their Idea's,
that they mock'd at her Remonſtrances: But one of
them being a little after ſeiz'd with a mortal Sickneſs, in
the Flower of his Age, and God opening his Eyes to let
him ſee his Error, he began to lament and cry, Night and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:94808:157"/>
Day, <hi>My <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding! my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, to what haſt
thou brought me! Alas, my Reaſon, in which I ſo much
truſted! what aſſiſtance canſt thou give me now! Now thou
canſt give me neither Salvation, nor the hope of it! I muſt
be damned! There can be no Mercy for me.</hi> A Friend of
<hi>A. B.</hi> going to ſee him in that State, endeavour'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him; but the other finding no Quiet, ask'd him ſtill,
If he thought there was yet any Mercy to be hop'd for
his Soul. And then, caſting again his Eyes and Arms
from one ſide to another, began again his Complaints;
<hi>My <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding! my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding! Whether haſt thou
guided me?</hi> Some of his Friends, amongſt others, <hi>Steno</hi>
and <hi>Swammerdam,</hi> came often to viſit and comfort him;
but nothing could calm him. At laſt he turns to the Friend
of <hi>A. B.</hi> ſaying, <q>Go tell that good Soul (meaning <hi>A. B.</hi>)
to pray to God for me, that I may obtain the Pardon of
this Sin, otherwiſe I am damned or muſt ſuffer a very long
Purgatory. O, if I could recover of this Sickneſs, I
would turn wholly unto God, and would follow quite
another Way.</q> But when this was told to <hi>A. B.</hi> She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>He ſhall not riſe again, but he will die; for if he
ſhould recover, he would fall again more profoundly into
this pernicious Errour.</hi> He died, his Judgment being
ſound and good, but with Great Repentance and Contrition,
adoring, with great Fervency, Jeſus Chriſt crucified, to the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and to the Philoſophers, Fooliſhneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. B.</hi> had ſuch an Horrour for this wicked Diſpoſition of
the Philoſophers, that ſhe could not ſuffer it, affirming that
God had declared <hi>to her expreſly, That this Errour of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſianiſm
was the worſt and moſt curſed of all the Hereſies
in the World, and a formal Atheiſm or a rejecting of God, in
whoſe Place corrupt Reaſon did ſet up it ſelf.</hi> Not that
this Idol of corrupt Reaſon is not a thing common to all
the Learned, and to all ſorts of Philoſophers, as well as the
<hi>Carteſians;</hi> but theſe are incomparably more wedded to it;
they think they are in Poſſeſſion of it above all, and they
will admit of nothing but by this Way.</p>
               <p>After ſhe had been viſited by all ſorts of Perſons who
reaped not that Profit they might have done, God ſent her
two or three ſincere and well diſpoſed Men, who finding in
her Life and Converſation the Means to approach unto God,
and to advance the Perfection of their Souls, left the
World, their Buſineſs and Friends, and continued with her
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:94808:158"/>
all the time of her Life and theirs. All others withdrew
to her great Satisfaction. She ſaid, <q>God had made her
ſee by this Converſe with People of all Sorts whom ſhe
had admitted indifferently by his Divine Order, how
few are to be gained in the World, even among the beſt,
and thoſe who ſeek the Truth; and that after theſe Viſits,
God would never more engage her to ſuch a Diſtraction,
and that ſhe ſhould lead a retir'd Life all the reſt of
her Days.</q> Which fell out, and ſhe begun it then in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi>
and did not give acceſs as formerly.</p>
               <p>LII.<note place="margin">LII. Wrote here ſome of her Books.</note> She employ'd moſt of this Time to compoſe many
Books, Of which theſe are the Principal; <hi>The Funeral of
Falſe Divinity,</hi> in 4 Parts. Upon Occaſion of ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
with the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Philoſophers, ſhe wrote the <hi>Holy
Perſpective.</hi> There ſhe wrote alſo her <hi>Outward Life,</hi> and
<hi>the New Heaven and the New Earth.</hi> In the writing of
which, ſhe was ſo raviſhed that ſhe often forgot her neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Food. She deſigned to have continued theſe Wonders:
But God ſaid unto her, <hi>Leave that Work; Men are not
worthy nor capable of it; they will imagine that they have
the Diſpoſitions requiſite for that glorious State, but they are
very far from them. Shew them rather the miſerable State
they are brought into by Sin, under the Dominion of corrupt
Nature, and under the Empire of Antichriſt who now rules
over them without their apprehending it. Write to them of
the Reign of Antichriſt.</hi> So ſhe laid by her Pen and that
Work, ſaying to God, <hi>I ſhall do it, Lord,</hi> and wrote
afterwards the Treatiſe of <hi>Antichriſt diſcovered,</hi> in Three
Parts. She began another Treatiſe, called <hi>The laſt Mercy
of God,</hi> but did not finiſh it, for the Reaſons told in the
Concluſion of it, and the Traverſes ſhe met with in the
Impriſonment of M. <hi>de Cort,</hi> and her own Perſecutions and
Flights kept her from the Purſuing that and other Works
which ſhe had begun.</p>

                  </note> Had M. <hi>de Cort</hi> followed her Counſel, he might
have avoided all the Miſchief he fell into; but the Sincerity
and Goodneſs of his Nature would not let him think that
he had ſuch cruel Enemies, eſpecially amongſt his Brethren
and Friends, the Prieſts, Churchmen, and his own Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
whom he had brought up, and to whom he had
hitherto left and given all; he could not believe that they
would ſeek to impriſon him, or endeavour to poiſon him,

               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:94808:158"/>
The true Cauſe of this Impriſonment was, that God
having touched his Heart to hearken to the Divine Truths
declared unto him by <hi>A. B.</hi> he reſolved not only to embrace
them, but to publiſh them alſo to others, deſigning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to the <hi>Iſle of Noordſtrand,</hi> of which he was Director,
and had the beſt Part of it at his Diſpoſal, and to invite
good Men thither, who deſir'd to lead a Chriſtian Life.
This ſeem'd to his Brethren an Apoſtacy, and the ſetting up
a new Hereſie; they reſolve therefore to ruin him. But this
Pretext would not do at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they muſt deviſe another.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Amſterdam</hi> there is a Dungeon, where at the Inſtance
of Creditors they arreſt and ſhut up Strangers who are in
Debt, till they have ſatisfied it. There are uſually ten or
twelve Priſoners there, living in Deſpair as mad, paſſing
the time in ſwearing, blaſpheming, and committing a
thouſand Impieties, and ſometimes killing one another,
having no Food but a piece of brown Bread and a little
ſmall Beer; and there ſome of them die in Miſery. They
thought this Place would do as well as one of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the <hi>Roman Inquiſition;</hi> and to get him there,
this Expedient was thought upon.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Gorin,</hi> who was truly Monſieur <hi>de Saint A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi>
who was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> in the Affair between the
<hi>Janſeniſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and on that Occaſion wrote the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Journal of <hi>St. Amour,</hi> having bought from Monſieur
<hi>de Cort</hi> ſome Lands in <hi>Noordſtrand,</hi> who had aſſured him
that he would have Eight <hi>per Cent.</hi> of yearly Revenue,
and if it did not yield that, promiſed to reſtore him his
Principal, and to take back the ſaid Lands, and by a Trick
he got him to ſign a Paper for this; in which Paper the
principal Summ was ſet at 12000 Florins <hi>French</hi> Money;
and when M. <hi>de Cort</hi> ſaid the Price of the Lands was only
8000 Florins, <hi>Gorin</hi> ſaid, it's true, but 8000 of <hi>Dutch</hi>
Money make 12000 of <hi>French;</hi> and ſo the good Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
he did not know the Value of the Exchange,
haſtily ſigned the Writing when he was taking Horſe
at <hi>Paris,</hi> whither he had gone to ſee his good Friends, the
<hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> who were then perſecuted, and to whom he
would have given all his Lands if they had ask'd them.
So <hi>Gorin</hi> being Procurator for the other French <hi>Janſeniſts</hi>
who had bought Intereſts in <hi>Noordſtrand,</hi> reſolves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Principal and more, as having got only 4 or 5 <hi>per
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:94808:159"/>
Cent.</hi> of yearly Revenue, and he knew M. <hi>de Cort</hi>
had not Money to re-imburſe him. The other Partners
conſent, and eſpecially the Fathers of the Oratory at
<hi>Mechlin,</hi> who had not yet deprived themſelves of the
Poſſeſſion of M. <hi>de Cort's</hi> Goods, and thought this would
be a Mean to perpetuate it. The Matter ſtood thus; M. <hi>de
Cort</hi> had purchaſed a conſiderable Intereſt in <hi>Noordſtrand,</hi>
beſides the Tythes, and the being the Director of it, he being
perſwaded that God would make that Iſland a Place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
for his Perſecuted Servants, and looking then on the
<hi>Janſeniſts</hi> as ſuch, he drew them out of <hi>France, Flanders,</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> into this Iſle, of which he ſold them Parcels:
And he himſelf having contracted Debts in making of
this Purchaſe, the Fathers of the Oratory at <hi>Mechlin</hi> urg'd
him to leave all his own Poſſeſſions and Rights there, to
their Congregation. He conſented, provided they would
pay his Debts which he had contracted in the Acquiſition.
This they promiſed to do; but, to authorize their Right,
they would have it by Way of Contract, as if they had
had given him ſuch Summs for his Poſſeſſions (tho' he
never received any) and made him leave out the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Paying his Debts, for that they would have him
truſt their World; alledging that otherwiſe his Creditors
might fall upon them all at once to their Ruin. Thus they
entred in Poſſeſſion; and when they would pay none of his
Creditors, he makes a Revocation of this Contract of Sale,
as fraudulent, to which the Grand Council at <hi>Mechlin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
provided he ſatisfie the Fathers within a Year and
a half, and the ſame is ratified by the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> the
Prince of the Iſland. Thus he was ready to free his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
of all their Pretenſions againſt them, and to retire
thither with'thoſe who loved the Truth. But their Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
and Hatred of him as a Deſerter, made them conſpire
his Ruin.</p>
               <p>The 7th of <hi>March,</hi> 1669. M. <hi>Gorin,</hi> or <hi>St. Amour,</hi> came
with two others to make a friendly Viſit to M. <hi>de Cort</hi> in
his Lodging. Within two Days he came again, and
M. <hi>de Cort</hi> being abſent, he ſpoke with <hi>A. B.</hi> who offered to
give him his principal Summ for the Lands he had of M. <hi>de
Cort,</hi> at which he ſeem'd well ſatisfied. The ſame Day he
obtained an Order for ſeizing his Perſon upon the Pretences
already ſaid. Within two Days he invites him friendly to

<hi>A. B.</hi> offered ſufficient Bail, ſolicited to have him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner

of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> to his oppoſite Party, to ſet him at Liberty,
that both might anſwer at his Courts, their proper Judge;
ſpar'd neither Procurators nor Advocates; wrote for his
Juſtification, to all concern'd, pleading with a force of
Reaſon and Equity, worthy of the greateſt Civilian; but
all in vain. They ſought to ſeize her as the only Perſon
that ſupplied him with Food and other things, and ſhe
was forc'd to leave her Lodgings and conceal her ſelf. She
wrote him many Letters for his Conduct and Conſolation;
and being ſpent with Labours and Afflictions, and praying
earneſtly to God to aſſiſt him whom no Creature would help,
it was told her, <hi>That he would be his Advocate and deliver
him;</hi> upon which ſhe left off to ſolicite any. When Bail
was offered, they got ſtill ſome new Pretenſions to arreſt

with to take it, and at the ſecond time was ſtruck
next Morning with an univerſal Palſie, making Signs
that he was poyſon'd by the Stranger, who had got away
early in the Morning, and paſt over in the firſt Boat; he
died ſome Days after, <hi>November,</hi> 1669.</p>
               <p>LVI.<note place="margin">LVI. Her long Sickneſs.</note> About this time <hi>A. B.</hi> was ſeiz'd with a long and
grievous Sickneſs, which brought her often to the Gates
of Death. She could not move her ſelf, nor often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
her Needs. Her Friends, who were but one or two,
durſt not go ſee her in the Day-time, leaſt ſhe ſhould be
diſcovered. There was none to aſſiſt her but a ſloathful
Maid, who let her ſuffer a Thouſand Neceſſities. About
this time the Murtherer came to ask for her, and bad tell
her he was come from her Friend from <hi>Noordſtrand,</hi> with
Letters from him, and ſomething to tell her by word of
Mouth. No ſooner did one of her Friends break it off
to her, than ſhe was ſeiz'd with an Averſion and a Divine
Warning, and bid them beware to let him come into her
Chamber, but remove him preſently out of the Houſe.
Some Weeks after, ſhe got the ſad News of M. <hi>de Cort's</hi>
Death, the only Aſſiſtance ſhe had in the World. This

he was formerly in <hi>Noordſtrand, Anno.</hi> 1668. When
walking one Day ſolitary in the Fields, as he was wont,
and offering up his Prayers to God, and asking what he
ſhould do with that Iſle, it was anſwer'd him thrice, as
with an intelligible Voice, <hi>Give this Iſle to</hi> Anthoinette
Bourignon. He believ'd at firſt ſome Body near him
might have ſpoke ſo, but looking round about him on
the Plain, he was certain that no Body was near him.
Then going quickly into his Lodging, he wrote the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with his own Hand, laying up one Copy of it ſeal'd
among the Regiſters of the Iſle, and ſending another by
Poſt to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in a Letter to <hi>A. B.</hi> praying her to
examine it, and alter it as ſhe pleas'd. She threw it on the

nothing to do with a Teſtament, for my own Goods are a

Piety, and the Fear of God, that hinder him from
yielding to the Solicitations of my Enemies: this was

any of them were capable of doing it, neither did they
deſire to meddle with it, ſo that ſhe was obliged to do
it for the Honour of his Memory, and for the Payment
of his Creditors, which ſhe ſtill offered to do, if they

they thought was to take in one worſe than the Devil,
and they would not have fail'd to turn her out to the Streets
again. The People were eaneſt to enquire for her every

they would be enclin'd to think that it was <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

tho they had never ſeen her, and knew only that ſhe
was a French Woman, and unmarried, and ſo nimble
a Fugitive that ſhe would be whiles here whiles there, as
it were by a Charm, without knowing how. She was
for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no ſooner come into any, but they would preſently think,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:94808:164"/>
perhaps this was <hi>Anthoinette,</hi> and became ſo prying and
inquiſitive, that ſhe was ſtill neceſſitated to ſeek out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
At laſt a Friend hired for her in his own Name, a
little Chamber being but the half of a Room, divided in
two by ſo thin a Wall, that all that was done or ſpoken
was heard in the other, where lived Perſons pre-occupied
with the common Fame and Animoſity. There ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
under the Protection of God alone, lying, during
the Nights of a cold Winter, on the Floor, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off her Cloaths, without Bed, Straw or Covering.
Nevertheleſs, the Peace of God fill'd her Heart with Joy
to ſee that her State and Treatment was a Copy taken from
the Original of the Life of her Suffering and perſecuted
Saviour, who becauſe he declared the Truth, was ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
by the Prieſts and Phariſees, as to be obliged to flee
here and there, ſo that he could not enjoy the Advantage
which the moſt miſerable Beaſts have, who have ſafe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats,
Holes, and Neſts, while he had not where to lay
his Head. Here ſhe wrote the Treatiſe called <hi>The Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone:</hi>
She was then in an extream want of all things.
Her Friends were all diſperſs'd in <hi>Holland, Huſum, Noord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrand,</hi>
and elſewhere. Her Mother-in-Law cauſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate

which was falſe, ſhe having left <hi>Holland</hi> before the War
was proclaim'd. She gave them to the Hoſpital of <hi>Liſle,</hi>
which ſhe had govern'd to free them from this unjuſt
Confiſcation.</p>

have been pre-occupied, yet at laſt they deſire to be rightly
informed, and ſo it fell out here. Thoſe of Judgment
and Underſtanding were deſirous to know at the bottom
what the Doctrine of that Maid was, againſt whom the
Paſtors were ſo enrag'd. The pillaging of the Books, and
the ſcattering Sheets of them here and there, contributed
much to this. Both great and ſmall found thereby, that
ſhe had been greatly wrong'd. The Inns and Private
Houſes were full of theſe Leaves, wrapping up their To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco
and other ſmall Wares, ſo that many who had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to read them, were ſo convinc'd of the Truth, as to
pronounce her Innocent, and the Paſtors Guilty of wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her by their Calumnies. At the Court they began
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:94808:165"/>
to ſpeak well of them, and to read them. The General
declar'd openly for them, the Grand Preſident, M. <hi>Kiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and others began to eſteem them. Some in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
at Court having ſaid that if the Accuſations of
the Paſtours were Falſhoods, ſhe ought to have anſwered
them: Another anſwered, that nothing ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from her Silence, ſhe being forbid to write againſt
them, and that if his Highneſs ſhould permit her to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
ſhe would do it very quickly. The Duke ſaid, if it
depended upon his Permiſſion, he gave it willingly. The
Preſident cauſed her to be acquainted with this; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſhe cauſed to be delivered to him a fair Copy of
her Anſwer, <hi>The Touchſtone.</hi> He read it with great Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and gave it to many of the Court. They were
thereupon perſwaded of her Innocence. The Preſident
offered to cauſe her Preſs and Books to be reſtored. She
ſaid, all this would ſerve her for nothing, ſo long as they
kept her out of her Inheritance at <hi>Noordſtrand,</hi> which the
Fathers of the Oratory unjuſtly occupied; alſo ſhe offer'd
to ſatisfie all the Creditors as it ſhould be found juſt. The
Preſident promiſed to aſſiſt her in it.</p>
               <p>LXXI.<note place="margin">LXXI. The Court gives her Protection.</note> Thus ſhe breathed a little more freely; the
Prince took her again into his Protection, her Friends who
were ſcattered, return'd to her again. She ſtaid in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Lodging with four of them peaceably from the
Year 1675. to the next. The Churchmen of <hi>Holſtein</hi> were
not a little enraged to hear of giving her Poſſeſſion of
<hi>Noordſtrand.</hi> They renewed their Clamours at Court,
and when they could not get it ſtopp'd, they ſuggeſted
to clog it with a thouſand Reſtrictions; ſometimes, that
ſhe ſhould poſſeſs it upon Condition of printing nothing;
ſometimes that ſhe ſhould not publiſh her Doctrine; her
People ſhould not ſpeak of it to any Body; ſhe ſhould be
anſwerable for all the Words and Actions of her Friends,
and ſuch like, under Pain of loſing all her Goods. When
ſhe ſhewed the Invalidity of theſe Projects, they propoſed
others, the Nullity of which ſhe as evidently made appear.
So that at laſt the Preſident ſaid he was weary of theſe
Prieſts and their Abſurdities, ſtill renewing their old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
without being willing to hear Reaſon. On this
Occaſion there paſſed ſeveral Letters between <hi>A. B.</hi> and

ſhort Confeſſion of her Faith, becauſe Great Men are not
taken up in the Reading of Controverſies, and ſo her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies

But a ſhort Confeſſion of Faith would confound their Lies
and convince the Prince. She did ſo; and it is already ſet
down in the Firſt Part of this Apology. After this, People
were entirely perſwaded of her Innocence, and that the
Paſtours Accuſations were Slanders, tho' they ceaſed not to
ſay that her Profeſſion was contrary to her Sentiments; and
would catch at, and tear out Pieces of Sentences in her Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
to prove it; but it is evident that what they do or can
cite out of her Writings, contrary to the Articles of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
is fundamentally diſmembred and falſly interpreted;
and the Conſequences they may draw from her Writings,
contrary to this Confeſſion, are falſe Conſequences, which
ſhe wholly diſclaims; and if there be any thing obſcure
and ambiguous in her Writings, it may and ought to be
taken in a Sence and Signification agreeable to this Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

pleaſed; that while they gave Offence to no body, but liv'd
honeſtly and juſtly, and even brought temporal Advantage to
the Inhabitants of the Country, and had nothing but just
Deſigns, they ought not to oppoſe them, fearing thereby to
oppoſe God: That otherwiſe God would take Vengeance on
them; and that ſhe was much afraid that he might puniſh
the Country and the Inhabitants in the ſame Manner that
ſhe had been and might yet be treated by them. <hi>It is like
the Diſcourſes of the Paſtours made all this vaniſh, but
they could not put off what follow'd ſome Months after.

               <p>She applied herſelf to take a particular Care of forming
the Souls of thoſe who were with her according to the Will

for their ſpiritual Direction, beſides many particular Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
one common to them all, which is the Second Part
of <hi>The Renovation of the Evangelical Spirit;</hi> and for their
outward Behaviour, began to write the Treatiſe called

               <p>Shortly after this, the Court was forc'd to remove, the

1676. where there was Appearance ſhe might live long
enough retiredly, in a Place whoſe Freedom, Greatneſs,
and Trade, keeps them from taking exact Notice of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:94808:166"/>
Strangers and private Perſons that live there. The firſt
Traverſe ſhe met with, was that ſhe could find no where
a free Chamber, where ſhe might live retir'd; ſo that after
having waited all Day, ſhe was forc'd to go lodge in a
Soldier's Houſe, who offer'd her a little Chamber, where
ſhe ſtaid fifteen Months for want of a Retreat elſewhere.
In the Spring time ſhe applied herſelf to make a little Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of a Court which was uſeleſs to the Lodging, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
it very well and profitably. She repaired and
whiten'd her Chamber and a Part of the Lodging, waſh'd her
own Linen, and ſerv'd herſelf in every thing except the
Buying of Proviſions, not daring to go abroad leſt ſhe
ſhould meet with ſome of her Acquaintaince. She was
moſt exact in all the outward things which Neceſſity and
good Order required, and ſaid, this pleaſed God more than
the moſt ſublime Contemplations, which often gratifies
Self-love, and thereafter gives Occaſion of Diſorder and
Diſpleaſure to the Soul, by the Confuſion that Negligence
has brought in outward things. Whereas outward Labour
even in the meaneſt things, humbles the Heart, ſimplifies
it, begets an entire and exact Submiſſion to God, a laudable
Charity and Care for our Neighbour, and a certain Repoſe
and Contentment of Soul, which did more ſatisfie S. <hi>Joſeph</hi>
in being a Carpenter, than were the Doctors of the Law,
in preaching in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair. She told how S. <hi>Tereſe</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

that ſuch was his Will; <hi>for by them the Goſpel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

Perſons who came to her at this time from ſeveral
Parts, and being convinced of the Truth, offered her all the
Services they were capable of. And ſhe offered them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
unto God, that ſhe might know how to behave with
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:94808:167"/>
them. She was again ſurrounded with Afflictions on all
ſides. In <hi>Sleſwick</hi> her Friends were robb'd, beaten and
wounded by the Soldiers and Rabble, and forc'd to leave
the Lodging and flee into the Woods, and from thence
thro the Snow into the Town of <hi>Kiel.</hi> In <hi>Noordſtrand</hi>
the Peaſants ſtole the Beaſt and other Goods ſhe had bought
with her Money, her Friends there neglecting to ſue after
them. She herſelf at <hi>Hambourg</hi> was ſeized with ſome Fits
of Sickneſs which brought her very low. And perceiving
that ſome Friends who were then with her, were troubled
with the Thoughts of her being to be taken from them
ſhortly by Death; ſhe ſaid, <hi>Why do you make ſuch Reckoning
of me? I am nothing but a human Creature. Fix upon
God, and cleave to him. From him you must call for Help,
him you muſt ſtrive to pleaſe. You are to have no Concern at
all for me as to my Perſon: It is to God only and to his Spirit
that you must cleave. If I come to die, what matters it? You
muſt not for this leave off in the least to cleave unto God
and continue faithful unto him. If you truſt in me, you will
deceive your ſelves. I may die as any other Perſon. And
if God did not ſtill preſerve my Life, as by a Miracle,
amidſt ſo much Weakneſs and Perils, I ſhould have been
dead already a thouſand times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were ſo perſwaded of this particular Protection of
God, that it made them too confident that God would yet
preſerve her Life for a long time One of them ſaid to
her, <q>I do not believe that you can die ſo ſoon, whatever
Evil befall you.</q> 
                  <hi>And I,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>do certainly believe I
may die even at this Moment. What reaſon have you to
believe the contrary?</hi> 
                  <q>Becauſe, <hi>replied he,</hi> God has given
you Promiſes which are not yet fulfilled, and we are
ſure that God will not be wanting in his Word. He has
promiſed, that you ſhall have Children who ſhall imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
you; that you ſhall re-eſtabliſh his Goſpel-Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth among Men and Women; that a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſhall follow you to the Deſart, and out of the
Hurry of the World, and ſuch like Promiſes, which
not being yet fulfilled, it follows you cannot die yet,
ſince the Work for which God raiſed you up is not yet
done; and God will not forſake his Work.</q> She anſwer'd,
<hi>God will not give over his Work, neither will he fail in his
Promiſe, but I have already ſeen enough that may ſave
the Truth of his Promiſe tho' I die; I have ſeen the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment</hi>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:94808:167"/>
                  <hi>of it in part, by the firſt Fruits, tho' not ſo perfectly.
God has already given me ſeveral Children, I have ſome
of them who are gone to him. I have ſeen ſome of them
follow me in Retiring from the World, and hear me with all
their Heart, and that of all ſorts; tho' they have neither
been in ſo great Numbers nor ſo perfect. Nevertheleſs this is
enough, to have ſeen by the firſt Fruits the Truth of the
Promiſes of God, which on his Part he never fails to fulfil
entirely: But when Men do not correſpond thereto, God
leaves them, retakes from them his Gifts, and ſeeks out
other Subjects fitter to receive the Accompliſhment of
what he promiſes: Whereas Men at preſent do render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unworthy of it, and will not acknowledge nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the remarkable Graces that God offers them. I greatly
fear leſt God withdraw his Gifts from them, and turn
himſelf to others; ſo I cannot aſſure you that I ſhall not
die ſhortly. On the contrary, when I conſider the Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthankfulneſs which Men ſhew for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of God, I doubt if God will not ſhortly take me out
of the World. But <hi>added ſhe,</hi> ſuppoſe God withdraw me,
what is your Concern with my Perſon? You ought not for
this, to leave off to ſeek God, to cleave to him, to do the
best that is poſſible for you, to enjoy his Spirit, and then
you ſhall have no more need of my Perſon, for there is
nothing in me to be eſteemed, nor ſought after, nor followed,
but the Spirit that guides me.</hi>

Satisfaction ſhe was freed of this Charge by a Letter from
the Baron, after having born it about two Years with
Trouble, and without any Fruit for the Glory of God.
There came thither ſome Strangers from <hi>Holland, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
and elſewhere, to lead, as they ſaid, a Chriſtian
Life with her; but really they gave her only much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by bringing Diſpoſitions quite contrary to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
So they return'd whither they pleas'd. While ſhe

the care of Houſhold Affairs, to a Country Life, to Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,

and others to tranſlate her Writings; or put them in a
Condition of being printed. She was viſited by many
Perſons, even of Quality, who came more than once,
and from ſeveral Places to converſe with her. She wrote
here the Letter which makes the Body of the Firſt Part

were watching an Occaſion, and for three Nights came to
the Door of the Apartment where ſhe was, arm'd with
Swords and Hatchets to execute the Deſign. That they
gave it over one of the Nights, becauſe they could not

agree whether to begin at her, or her two Friends; and
the two other Nights they found the Door ſhut which
they had left open; and thereafter ſome Friends came,
they confeſt they had tried often before to poyſon her with

was this: She had cauſed to be brought from <hi>Holland</hi>
of the Effects that belong'd to her Friends to the Value
of many thouſands, which were lent in this Country
under her Name, thinking, it may be, that this would
ſerve to make them protect her, that they might the
longer enjoy theſe Advantages; and ſhe could not credit
the Suggeſtions made to her, that perhaps they would
endeavour to pick a Quarrel with her, that they might
have a Pretext to keep her Goods, after they had treated
her ill and chas'd her away. This ſeem'd the quieteſt
Time ſhe had yet enjoyed; the Fever had left her, tho'
Weakneſs confined her for the moſt part to her Bed,

LXXXV.<note place="margin">LXXXV. Her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> 1. <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> was of a middle Stature,
and Slender; her Countenance was agreeable, her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
brown, her Forehead without Wrinkles, her
Looks full of Ingenuity; her Mien, her Speech, her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
without Affectation and agreeable. She had a lively
Spirit, a quick Ear, a ſtrong Sight, a good Memory, a
clear Judgment.</p>
               <p>2. Tho' ſhe was of a healthful Body and a cheerful
Mind, of an agreeable Temper and lively Spirit, had
abundance of temporal Goods, and all the Advantages
that could be deſired to lead a pleaſant and honourable
Life in the World; yet in the flower of her Age ſhe deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all theſe to follow Jeſus Chriſt in a Life of Poverty,
Contempt, and Trouble, and perſevered in it till Death;
maugre all the Scorn, Oppoſitions, Hardſhips, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
ſhe met with.</p>
               <p>3. In all things ſhe ſtudied to be poor in Spirit, and
ſtill choſe for her ſelf the meaneſt and the leaſt things,
when ſhe might have had the beſt, and in the greateſt
Abundance. Her Diet was ſober, without Abundance or
Delicacies: She made no difference of Meats, except that
ſhe ſhunn'd thoſe which were too dear, or which were
more for gratifying the Palate than for neceſſary Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.
She was modeſt in Apparel, without affecting
Singularity, accommodating her ſelf to the Cuſtom of the
Place where ſhe was, only ſhe took care to imitate the
Lowlineſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore never choſe the
fineſt Stuffs, Linens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the courſeſt and cheapeſt.
To theſe, her Lodging and Accommodation were ſutable,
a little Chamber, a few old Chairs, a little Table, and
ſometimes a piece of Board upon her Knees to write up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
her Bed and its Furnituee of the ſame kind, yet all
neat and cleanly. She always ſerved her ſelf, and was
never ſerved by others, but in caſe of neceſſity; but moſt
ready to ſerve others whether Poor or Rich indifferently,
if this only could be of any Profit to the Soul, or if any
urgent Neceſſity called for Help, no Service was then too
mean for her, and to ſpare others ſhe would readily go
and do the meaneſt Offices, even to waſh the Diſhes,
ſcour the Pots, take off the Aſhes, waſh the Linen, ſweep
and clean the Houſe, not excepting any Employ how low
ſoever, provided Health, good Order, or other Reaſons
did permit it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:94808:170"/>
4. Yet, in all theſe, ſhe never ſet to her ſelf any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Rules, and adviſed her Friends never to amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with particular Rules of ſome outward Cuſtoms
of humble Habits and pious Countenances, which ſome
Perſons and Sects do obſerve to ſhew they are Devout
and Spiritual, as to wear their Apparel only of ſuch a
Faſhion, or ſuch a Colour, or ſuch a Stuff, or to chooſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Meats, or the like, whereby they diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the reſt of the World, as being more Holy and
more Vertuous than they. This, ſhe ſaid, begets in ſuch
an Eſteem of themſelves and a Contempt of others,<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 48. 73.</note> is
real Hypocriſie and the greateſt Pride, and far from the
Doctrine and Practice of Jeſus Chriſt, who could not be
diſtinguiſh'd from his Diſciples by his Enemies when they
came to apprehend him, without a Sign from <hi>Judas</hi> of his
kiſſing him; nor his Diſciples from the reſt of the People,
but when their Speech bewrayed them.</p>
               <p>5. She was moſt diligent in her Affairs, did all things
both for the Body and Soul, with Foreſight and good
Order, without letting any thing be ſpoiled, but put all
to ſome good uſe, being always well employed in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and acting in all things with as much care as a
faithful Steward; and that in little things as well as
great. She would never undertake a thing haſtily, nor
go about with it Precipitation, not to have it ſoon done but
to have it well done. She took time firſt to recommend
it to God, and being once perſwaded that it was agreeable
to his Will, ſhe did it leiſurely, but with Perſeverance, as
God, ſhe ſaid, did all his Works, <hi>Doucement &amp; Fortement,</hi>
this, ſhe ſaid, was good both for Body and Soul, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
any Affair better than too much Vehemence.</p>
               <p>6. She was ſo little concern'd for to be eſteem'd and
honoured by Men, that their Praiſes and Reproaches did
equally touch her as little as if ſhe had never heard of
them, ſeeking nothing in the World but that God might
be honoured, and the Souls of Men ſaved. Her Buſineſs
and her Thoughts never aimed to procure Honour, Eaſe,
Wealth, or Pleaſures for her ſelf or others. All her
Pleaſure was to delight in God in her Solitude, out of the
Converſation of Men, and to bring to light what he gave
her for the Salvatian of Souls: This made her ſtay, for the
moſt part Solitary, in her Chamber, and even when ſhe
was taken up in ſowing or any other Work, ſhe lov'd ſtill
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94808:171"/>
to be alone to keep her Spirit always united to God, and
if the Salvation of her Neighbour had not required it,
ſhe would certainly have broken off from all Society.</p>
               <p>7. Tho' Solitude was a thouſand times more agreeable
to her than any Company, yet ſhe would part with it,
and make her ſelf as it were a State of continual Labours
and Cares for the good of others, purely for the Love of
God, and the Salvation of Souls. So entire was her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
unto God, that what ſhe once knew to be his
Will, tho' contrary to her Inclinations and Quiet, tho'
ſhe ſaw ſhe would meet with nothing but Contempt,
Reproach, and Perſecution in it, yet ſhe made a Sacrifice
of all to follow it.</p>
               <p>8. Her conſtant Rule was Righteouſneſs, not only to
render to every one in outward things what appertain'd to
them, but it extended to all things, to thoſe of the Soul as
well as of the Body. She did not deſpiſe the Good that was
in her Enemies, nor excuſe the Evil that was in her Friends.
She never judged according to Paſſions, but according to
Equity. She would not be Partaker of other Mens Sins.</p>
               <p>9. Truth was the Rock on which ſhe ſtood firm, and
to which ſhe did adhere and cleave without Reſpect of
Parties or Perſons; ſo that they who oppoſed it, might
well hurt themſelves, they could not ſhake her, and tho'
all the Learned in the World would have ſet themſelves
againſt her, ſhe would have regarded it no more than if
they had been Children, being ſo eſtabliſh'd in the Truth.
So free was ſhe from all humane and worldly Reſpects,
that ſhe would not for all the Wealth, Friendſhip, or
Terrors of the World omit to declare the Truth, if the
Glory of God required it.</p>
               <p>10. The Love of God was the Element in which ſhe
lived: She delighted in him only, deſpiſed all earthly
things for him, and adhered to him ſo ſtrongly, that ſhe
would do nothing without his Divine Will.</p>
               <p>11. All her Life was a conſtant Proof of her Charity
to Men. From this Spirit ſhe employed her Time, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and Goods, for many Years, for the Good of the Souls
and Bodies of a multitude of Orphans. She took all care
to communicate to the World, even againſt Mens Will,
and endeavours to the contrary, the Light that God gave
her for the Good of their Souls, denuding her ſelf of all
Accommodations, and ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fering all manner of Reproaches,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:94808:171"/>
and Har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhips, that ſhe might do them the greateſt Good,
and bring them to God.</p>
               <p>12. And ſuch was her Perſeverance and Fortitude in this,
that all the Scorn, and Contempt, and Hardſhips, and
Perſecutions that ſhe met with in a Courſe of many Years,
did not ſhake nor alter her.</p>
               <p>13. She was ſo diſintereſs'd, ſo far from ſeeking her ſelf,
that ſhe would never ſeek for any, nor draw any Body
over unto her Sentiments, and would not let thoſe who
were with her, ſtrive any ways to draw in others, even
tho' they by this way had been able to bring over the moſt
Powerful and the moſt Learned in the World, and from
whom ſhe and hers might have received <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore of outward
Advantages and Support. Her Rules for her ſelf and
Friends were; <hi>Seek none, let God operate in Souls, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
all will be nothing but the Works of Mens hands, which
will periſh.</hi> As ſhe had no other <hi>Butt,</hi> but to ſend all to
God, ſo ſhe would have no other thing for the Motive and
Principle, but the being moved by God.</p>
               <p>14. She had always a ſerenity and cheerfulneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
a tranquility of Mind, and Joy that even appeared out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.
And whatever Emotion ſhe might be ſeiz'd with
upon ſome extraordinary Accident, or ſome great Fault
committed by others, yet it was ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver; and ſhe no
ſooner entred into her Chamber, or her Solitude, but ſhe
returned again with great Tranquility. She uſually ſaid,
That ſhe hated nothing but, Honour and Sin.</p>
               <p>15. Her Patience and Reſignation was ſingular in the
Sickneſſes, Pains, and other Adverſities which be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>el her,
and her bearing with the Faults and Infirmities of thoſe
who were with her; tho' upon Occaſions her Zeal and
Fervour made her rebuke them earneſtly, eſpecially when
they ſinned wilfully and maliciouſly: For they who were
of good Inclinations, and ſinned through Infirmity or
Ignorance, ſhe bear with them, or corrected them with
great Mildneſs and Lenity; but if any who had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
admoniſhed, did ſin wilfully and maliciouſly, ſhe did
rebuke them vehemently, and being moved with a lively
Zeal, ſet her ſelf againſt their Iniquity: and we ſee it was
uſual for the moſt Holy to do ſo, <hi>Moſes, Paul,</hi> and others,
yea, and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>16. Her Faith in God did uphold her on all Occaſions,
never doubting of the Truth of his Word, waiting his
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:94808:172"/>
Time for the fulfilling of it, and looking ſtill to the things
which are not ſeen, and which are eternal.</p>
               <p>17. Her admirable Knowledge in Divine Things, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by all her Writings, and the manner of acquiring
it, was no leſs Admirable, not by the means of Books,
Schools, or Men; (as was evident to all who convers'd
with her,<note place="margin">Temoign de Vertie, Part 1. p. 146.</note> and appears from all her Writings) <q>But all my
Books, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> and Library conſiſt in the Converſation
of my Spirit with God, and my School is to learn to
purge my Soul from Sin, and to withdraw its Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from all earthly things, that it may love only thoſe
which are Eternal.</q> The manner alſo of compoſing her
Writings, as has been already mentioned, was no leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and extraordinary. Her Knowledge was ſingular
alſo in other things, as there was occaſion for it; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in the Law, in the Matters of Right and Juſtice,
ſo that the greateſt Lawyer could not have more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deduced an Affair, nor urged it with ſtronger Reaſons,
as appears in the Affairs of M. <hi>de Cort,</hi> and of <hi>Noord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. Her Humility and Lowlineſs did ſhine forth in her
Actions, ſo that they who converſed with her do declare,
they could not obſerve in her any thing of Pride or Self-eſteem.
Yet this was not expreſs'd by artificial humble
Words and Geſtures, which affect the Reputation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thought ſo, and cover the greateſt Pride, but by an
unaffected Poverty of Spirit, and giving the Glory of all
Good to God: And the very things which her Enemies
adduce as Inſtances of Pride, were great Evidences of the
contrary.</p>
               <p>19. Simplicity and Sincerity of Heart were her nature;
there was no Guile in her Spirit; ſhe not only would
not deceive Men, but alſo would not deceive her ſelf; and
becauſe of this ſingle Eye, her whole Body was full of
Light; for God makes wiſe the Simple.</p>
               <p>20. She often bleſs'd God for three Things: 1. That he
never let her drink in the Doctrine of Men; for this, ſhe
ſaid, would have made her uncapable of receiving that of
the Holy Spirit. 2. That he had not engaged her in a
married State; for then ſhe would have loſt the Liberty of
cleaving to God only. 3. That he gave her Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
of Mind in all Rencounters; for otherwiſe ſhe
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:94808:172"/>
would have oft times ſtumbled or fallen in the ſo many
different Accidents and Miſeries to which ſhe was expoſed.</p>
               <p>21. Her Life was a continual Prayer,<note place="margin">Tomb. de la fauſſe Theol. Part 3. Letter 1. nu. 17, 18.</note> her Spirit being
always turned towards God, whether ſhe was writing, or
working, or eating, or walking, or in her Chamber, or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling;
every thing gave her Occaſion of begging his
Help, or to bleſs him for his Favours, or to adore and
celebrate his Perfections.</p>
               <p>22. As ſhe heartily regrated the Diviſions of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
ſo ſhe adviſed thoſe of her Friends who had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
themſelves from the World to lead a Chriſtian Life,
not to make new ſpiritual Aſſemblies and Meetings. She
ſaid, Chriſtians ought always to entertain one another
with ſpiritual Things; and that all their Words and
Works ſhould be Sermons for edifying and animating one
another to Vertue, and to the Perfection of their Souls.
She bid them purge their Souls from Sin, and labour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
true Vertue, and to preach to themſelves and others
by their Life. Not but that ſhe thought publick Aſſemblies
were neceſſary for thoſe who were ſtill taken up about
Worldly Affairs, and who would apply the whole time of
their Life in temporal Affairs, if there were not ſome
Times appointed for Prayer, or ſome Places for hearing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
Nor did ſhe think publick Aſſemblies unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
when they ſincerely ſought the Glory of God: Nor
that they who were truly regenerated themſelves and endu'd
with Divine Light to inſtruct others, ought not to teach
them. But ſhe gave this Counſel to her Friends, both
that they might avoid the Scandal of Forming a new Sect,
and the drawing upon themſelves unneceſſary Perſecutions
and Hatred in Places where ſuch Aſſemblies were not tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and that they might not be tempted to Vain-glory,
Curioſity, and Deſtruction, by offering to teach others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were well taught themſelves for their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
or by deſiring to learn from others that which they
did not practice.</p>
               <p>23. Being ask'd concerning the Euchariſt, if ſhe held
Tranſubſtantiation, or Conſubſtantiation, or a figurative
Repreſentation only; She ſaid, Theſe were all unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Speculations, about which Men diſpute to no purpoſe,
and yet none of them can tell how this Myſtery is. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it neceſſary for Salvation, nor for the Fruit of true
Communicating. As for me, ſays ſhe, I never apply my
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:94808:173"/>
ſelf to theſe Formalities, but in Simplicity I lift up my Heart
and Spirit unto God, and place my ſelf always as in his
Preſence, and I communicate, uniting my Deſign, and
my Intention with that of Jeſus Chriſt, and in his Spirit,
without troubling my ſelf with other Particularities, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
my Spirit be united to his, and in a true Diſpoſition
of conforming my ſelf to him, and of following him.</p>

accuſtomed to ſee affected Geſtures and counterfeit
Vertues, that they cannot receive True Vertue, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi>

Hypocritical Geſtures which I abhor; for God will not
lead me by theſe Ways. He gives me a Tranquility of
Mind, and a Joy in my Soul, that even appears out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.
I have no inſolent Laughters, but a continual
Joy that oftentimes chears thoſe who converſe with me,
when they know that my Joy does not proceed from
any human Satisfaction, but from my Converſation
with God. But they who do not underſtand theſe things,
do imagine that one who has received the Holy Spirit
ſhould be ſtill melancholy, ſad and ſerious to the utmoſt
Degree, thinking that he ought not to do or ſpeak the
leaſt thing that Men ſee or know; painting out Vertue
like to a hideous Old Wife waſted with Penitence; tho'
all theſe things may be done in Hypocriſie and a Study
of Self-eſteem. But the Spirit of God gives Liberty to
thoſe whom he governs, (rendring them ſincere, affable,
and friendly, without any Diſſimulation,) to treat with
an open Heart with the Friends of God, without any
Reſerve or Windings, but freely and openly, tho' with
Prudence towards the Wicked: This is to be ſimple
as Doves and wiſe as Serpents, and to beware of Men, as
ſays the Scripture.</q>

CONCERNING
The Preface to the Snake in the Graſs, and

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I.<note place="margin">I. The Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Letter.</note> YOU tell me that you have ſeen a written
Apology for <hi>A. B.</hi> and that you thought
ſtrange to find no Mention there of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to the <hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> and <hi>Bourignia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm
detected.</hi> Sir, I am perſwaded that the Writer of the
Apology did that upon a good Deſign; he ſaw how hard
it was to reaſon with Men in Paſſion and not become angry
too, or inflame them the more: He thought it was beſt
not to anſwer, and yet to anſwer them; and by this Means
to preſerve the Quiet of his own Mind, and yet give them a
fair Occaſion to reflect upon their own Miſtakes. Yet
ſince you ſay, that Zeal for the Truths of the Goſpel of
Jeſus Chriſt, and Charity to Mens Souls, eſpecially thoſe
who may have conceived Prejudices from their Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations,
and to the Authors themſelves in particular,
do require a more particular Application to theſe Writings.
I ſhall therefore freely and plainly tell my Sentiments of
them, with that Candour and Charity to the Perſons
concern'd, that, I hope, they will take them for the
Reproofs of a Friend, and ſo count them better than the
deceitful Kiſſes of Flatterers, or the groundleſs Plaudites
of unthinking Perſons, who are more taken with an Air
of Confidence, and a bold Way of Repreſenting things,
than with Truth and Reality.</p>
               <p>II.<note place="margin">II. Neceſſary Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Writers of Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives und Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.</note> They who take upon them to write <hi>Narratives,</hi> and
to give the World <hi>Characters</hi> of the Sentiments, Spirit,
and Writings of any Perſon (as thoſe two Authours do of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:94808:174"/>
                  <hi>A. B.</hi> the one in ſome Inſtances only, the other more
fully) ought to have theſe Qualifications, if they would do it
aright. 1. They ought throughly to be acquainted with
the Writings and Sentiments, before they can give a juſt
and true Account of them, things being cleared, expreſs'd
and owned in one Place that are not ſo in another.
2. They ought to conſider the great Scope and Deſign of
the Writer, and the Means by which he proſecutes it, and
(it both the one and the other be good and excellent) to
give his Words and Sentiments in other things as favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
an Interpretation as they will bear, ſutable to the
main Scope and Subſtance of the Writings: If they be
Things wherein they have no Knowledge nor Experience,
they ought neither to judge nor cenſure them; and if there
be even Miſtakes in leſſer Things, they ought not to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
nor ridicule them, but to extenuate and cover them
for the ſake of the main things that are ſo excellent and
praiſe-worthy. This ſame Rule alſo is to be obſerved in

                  </gap>udging of the Lives of Perſons, to conſider the main Scope
of them, whether it be Time or Eternity; and the Means
by which they proſecute that great End, and not raſhly
to judge or give a Character of them, from ſome outward
Actions which may be good or evil according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Principle they proceed from. 3. They ought to
look upon the Sentiments and Actions they would judge of,
with a ſimple, unprejudiced Eye, otherwiſe they cannot
judge aright, they look in coloured Glaſſes, and ſo deceive
both themſelves and others who liſten to them. 4. <hi>Narrators</hi>
ought to be faithful and ſincere, not falſifying in the leaſt,
nor ſingling out Pieces of Sentences or Purpoſes, or ſome
Circumſtances of Actions, ſtudying thereby to blacken
them, and deſignedly concealing what would ſerve to clear
and juſtifie them, but faithfully and honeſtly narrating the
whole.</p>

                  </note> Now, I am ſorry, I muſt ſay that in this Affair
thoſe Authors have been greatly wanting as to theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites,
and ſo were very unfit for ſuch an Undertaking.
1. They were Strangers to the Life or Sentiments of <hi>A. B.</hi>
the one neither knew nor had read any of her Writings,
but ſuch as were done in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and the other had read
few or none of them, till he applied himſelf to confute
them; and tho' he never knew her himſelf, will now,
Eighteen Years after her Death, eſſay to blacken her by
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:94808:174"/>
moſt horrid Imputations; tho' her Innocence and Purity
be ſufficiently atteſted by Perſons of unqueſtionable
Credit and Integrity. 2. In their <hi>Narratives</hi> they have
neither regarded nor mentioned the great Scope of all her
Writings, which is <hi>to perſwade Men to the Love of God, and to
convince them that they are eſtranged from it:</hi> Nor the Means
by which ſhe proſecutes this End; <hi>the leading Men to the
Imitation of the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, in Mortifying their
corrupt Nature, and living a Life of Penitence.</hi> And how
ſhe makes it appear they do it not. Nor does the Doctor
in the Character of her Life of repreſent the great Scope
thereof, <hi>the Travelling towards Eternity;</hi> nor the Means
ſhe uſed in order thereto. 3. It is viſible, That what they
have read of her Writings, has been with an evil Eye,
with a Deſign to carp at them, to pick out ſuch Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as might ſerve them to render her and her Writings
hateful and ridiculous to the World. They who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
their Narratives with her Writings, will eaſily be
convinc'd of this, when they find them skipping over the
moſt excellent Matters, and fixing only upon ſuch Things
as they thought capable of being perverted and empoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
by their falſe Turns and malicious Gloſſes; while
hundreds of indifferent Perſons have acknowledged that
they could not read any of her Writings without being
touch'd with a ſerious Senſe of Divine Things; and that
they ſee the practical Part of Chriſtianity repreſented in
them with a Clearneſs beyond any that is to be ſeen in
moſt practical Writers. And, 4. It is no leſs evident, that
they have not been faithful and ingenuous, but have either
ſingled out ſome mangled Sentences, concealing the Context
that might clear them, or tack'd together a Number
of Paſſages of different Places, to make them ridiculous,
or moſt untruly tranſlated them; of which I ſhall hereafter
give ſome Inſtances.</p>

contrary to the whole Tenour of them, and to a Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning the Summary of her Sentiments, with
Reſpect to the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity there inſerted;
for thus the beſt Authors may be traduced, by the moſt
ſhameful Manglings, malicious Interpretations, deceitful
Calumnies, injurious Conſequences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One would have
thought that after all this, he ſhould not have followed
theſe Meaſures himſelf; and yet we find him palpably
forming the high Charge of: 1. <hi>Blaſphemous Pride:
2. Overturning all Prieſt hood and Ordinances of the Goſpel:
3. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs and damning all the World: 4. The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſenting

and not abſtaining from the Furious and Spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Words, <hi>Cloven Foot, the Devil of a Saint, Mad, Craz'd,
Bigotted.</hi> How falſe this Charge is, how ill founded, how
contrary to the Temper of her Spirit, and the ſtrain of her
Writings, the Author might have obſerved from her own
Writings, if he had conſidered without Prejudice or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and may now further ſee in the <hi>Apology:</hi> I need
not fully reſume the Particulars, but only touch upon

in the Second Part of the <hi>Apology,</hi> p. 166, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where it
appears, that ſhe is far from exalting her ſelf above the
Prophets, or Apoſtles, or Fathers, far leſs above Jeſus
Chriſt himſelf; that ſhe acknowledges her ſelf a poor, frail
Creature of the corrupt maſs of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſubject to Sins and
Infirmities, who greatly ſtraied from God in her younger
Years, that of her ſelf ſhe has nothing but Evil, and that
all Good comes from God; and that ſince it may pleaſe
God in the latter Ages of the World, by ſome of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
more clearly to explain and unfold the hidden Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
and Parables of the Old and New Teſtament when
the time of their Accompliſhment draws near; it will not
be found, that thoſe, to whom God ſhall pleaſe to make
ſuch Diſcoveries, are thereby exalted above the Prophets,
or Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; or that they, by owning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
them, do exalt themſelves: Thus <hi>A. B.</hi> when ſhe
ſpeaks of God's Graces to her, does it with the greateſt
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:94808:175"/>
Humility as is evident from theſe very Places cited by the
Author, whence he culls his half Sentences, where ſhe
aſſumes to her ſelf no Prerogative above the moſt Wicked
of all Creatures, or even a Stone or Wood, wherewith, ſhe
declares God might have ſerved himſelf in declaring of his
Marvels, if it had been his Pleaſure, whom yet ſhe cannot
reſiſt, ſince he pleaſes to declare his Marvels by her, and
that he may damn her (if ſhe has merited it) in the End,
being abſolute Lord of all things; to this Purpoſe her
own Words in the 136, and 137 p. of the <hi>Light of the
World,</hi> are fully cited in the 169 p. of the <hi>Apology:</hi> And
thus alſo p. 132 of the <hi>Light of the World.</hi> 
                  <q>I would
be very preſumptuous, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> to believe that theſe ſo
clear Interpretations come from my ſelf.</q> Yea, on the
other hand it ſhould paſs for an Inſtance of great Self-denial,
and humble Reſignation unto the Will of God,
in any who will, even by the Command of God, declare
themſelves to be the Organ of his Spirit for more clear
Explications of thoſe things that have been formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
in dark Similitudes and Parables, when they know
aſſuredly that they will meet with nothing but Scorn and
Reproach from Men upon that Account. And if this be
the Caſe of <hi>A. B.</hi> as the Thrid Part of the <hi>Apology</hi> gives
ſtrong Preſumptions for it, and many are perſwaded it is,
then her Declaration of the Truth of this is no Inſtance
of Pride, or that ſhe exalts her ſelf above others, but a
great Inſtance of Self-denial and humble Reſignation.
To this,<note place="margin">Parole de Dieu. p. 127.</note> Purpoſe ſhe expreſſeth her ſelf: <q>I muſt not, <hi>ſays
ſhe,</hi> becauſe of the Reproach and Confuſion I may
meet with, conceal that which God will have publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
and obſerved. It does not become a poor Worm
of the Earth to give Laws of God. He knows by whom
and how he will operate, without regard to out Meanneſs
and Unworthineſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to that other Proof of her Blaſphemous Pride, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the high Characters given her by others whom
he calls her Bigotted Diſciples, ſome of them twenty
Years after her Death, (as that in the Engliſh Preface to
the <hi>Light of the World</hi>) it is a new way of Reaſoning,
owing, I think, purely to the Author: Yet there, ſhe is
not preferred to the Bleſſed Virgin; for tho' to be the
Organ of the Light and Spirit of God is more than to
be the Organ or Mother of his humane Body; yet to be
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:94808:176"/>
the Organ both of Spirit and Body, is more than to be the
Organ of any one of them; and this is not denied to the
Bleſſed Virgin. When, becauſe of the high Characters
given her by ſome while ſhe lived, it was objected to her,
that ſhe affected the Praiſe of Men, and ſuffered M. <hi>de
Cort,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Temoig. de verite. Part 2. p. 47.</note> and others, highly to extol the inward Graces that
God imparted to her: She ſaid, <q>That if ſuch had felt
the Operations of God in their Souls by her means, as
M. <hi>de Cort,</hi> and ſome others had done, they would have
ſaid the ſame; that they did not praiſe her Perſon (in which
there was nothing praiſe worthy) but the Light and
Truth of God, which they ſaw and heard by her means.
This, ſhe ſaid, did not puff her up, ſince the Works of
God, which ſhe remarked, did humble her Heart, the
more ſhe diſcovered them; for I diſcern, ſays ſhe, the
Spirit of God from that of Nature, and ſee clearly that
all that comes from God is Good, and all that comes
from my ſelf is Evil, ſo that I have no Ground to glory
in my Evil, and I know no Good out of God, this Rule
keeps me ſteady from fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no wonder that ſome judge, that I pleaſe my ſelf with
the Praiſes of Men, in ſuffering that Preface to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed;
when they will needs meaſure me by themſelves,
they cannot judge otherways but that I take Pleaſure to
hear my own Praiſes, feeling in themſelves, that they could
not hear their own Praiſes without vain Complacency;
and meaſuring every one by themſelves, every one thinks,
another is as he himſelf is: A Thief truſts no Body,
thinking that another is as much Thief as himſelf: A
lewd Perſon cannot believe that another would live in
Continence, when he has a fair Occaſion to ſatisfie his
Luſt; and ſo a proud Perſon cannot believe that one
would hear their own Praiſes without having their Heart
puff'd up with Pride, becauſe he himſelf cannot hear his
Praiſes, without deriving Vain glory from them. This
befals all thoſe who live ſtill in the Sentiments of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Nature.—But I am, ſays ſhe, by the Grace of God,
arrived at that State, that the Praiſes and Reproaches of
Men are all one to me, and I make no more reckoning
of the one than of the other, becauſe of the ſmall
Eſteem I have of the Judgment of Men, who often
praiſe that which they ought to deſpiſe, and deſpiſe
that which they ought truly to eſteem.</q>

have more Light than all the Authors that he had ever

alledge) but he would only declare that he received
more Light by my Diſcourſes, than by reading of all
the Authors he had ever ſeen, yea, even the Scripture
it ſelf, ſince it is obſcure in ſome places; whereas our
daily Conferences gave him more Clearneſs, and my
Practice made him penetrate the true Sence of the
Scriptures, in which he had read many things, whereof
he underſtood nothing at all.</q> If the Author had not

their Diſeaſe, and could hardly be perſwaded that they
were ſick; if notwithſtanding it ſhould pleaſe God to
raiſe up a skilful and infallible Phyſician, who had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
certain and undoubted Remedies, taken them firſt
himſelf, and left plain Directions how to uſe them, and
great numbers at firſt by following his Rules and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had fully recovered their Health: If yet in proceſs of
Time the generality of Men, few or none excepted, left
off to follow the Precepts, would not be confined to ſuch
ſtrict Rules of Phyſick, (as to Air, Diet, Company, Self-will,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if they were all contagious) and thought the
Phyſician's Rules and Example unpracticable; but yet
made a Faſhion of honouring him, and proceeded ſo far
as to reſtrain the groſſeſt outward Eruptions, which would
make them loathſome to their Neighbours, tho inwardly
they ſtill laboured under mortal Diſeaſes, and could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be convinced of it. Would it be thought want of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in any to give loud Warning of this to the World? If
any had recovered, or were upon the recovering Hand, would
they think themſelves greatly injured by any who ſhould
ſay, that now there were none in Health, and they did not
ſee how any could recover after the manner the, lived

the Number being ſo few, that they might be called none
at all, and this might perhaps excite and awaken ſome of
thoſe who remained ſtill inſenſible of their State, to take
the true Meaſures for their Recovery: That this is a true
Figure of the Spiritual State of the World at preſent, is
but too evident. If God has declared in different Ages of

could have formed his fourth Accuſation, of her <hi>miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
the Deſign and Import of the Goſpel,</hi> and founded it
upon the Paſſages he cites. She ſays, the Deſign of the
Goſpel is, to recover Men to the Love of God; and that
the Laws and the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, are the neceſſary
means to that End. She never underſtood it, that all uſe
of Riches was forbidden; or that Riches without any
more were an infallible Sign of not being a Chriſtian; but
that we ought to be poor in Spirit, even when we have
Riches, and if they prove an Impediment to that, rather
to abandon them, than not to aſpire to the other. The
firſt Paſſage the Author cites to prove his Charge, is a
Saying of hers, when a Child of Four Years, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by the difference ſhe then obſerved betwixt the Lives
of them about her, and the Character ſhe had then lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of Jeſus Chriſt, which, taking her own Sence of them,
do not in the leaſt differ from the true Deſign and Import
of the Goſpel. This, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> is an Eternal Truth, that
<q>the Spirit of God, loves and deſires nothing but things
<hi>Eternal,</hi> and the natural Spirit only loves and ſeeks after
things <hi>Temporal:</hi> This was clearly ſhewn me from my
Childhood, and therefore at the Age of Four Years, I
was deſirous to go and find out the Country, where the
Chriſtians lived; reaſoning with my little Judgment,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:94808:178"/>
that thoſe could not be True Chriſtians, who ſeek after, or
deſire the Honours, Pleaſures, and Riches of this World;
but that they ought only to ſeek after things <hi>Eternal.</hi>
                  </q> In

of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 
                  <q>The Practice of thoſe, ſays
ſhe, who are Members of <hi>Rome,</hi> does ſufficiently evidence
to me, That the Holy Spirit cannot be the Author of
thoſe things which are contrary to the Practice of Jeſus
Chriſt: We ſee the Prelates attended with Servants, and
Coaches, and Trains, <hi>like to Secular Princes, their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Furniture do ſurpaſs them;</hi> (this the Author
leaves out) if they had Faith to believe that God being
Man, was poor and deſpiſed, they would bluſh for
Shame, (as all other Chriſtians) to make themſelves thus
to be honoured.</q> All which might have been ſaid, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſo harſh a Cenſure, from a Proteſtant Miniſter, as
that ſhe had <hi>miſtaken the whole Deſign and Import of the
Goſpel.</hi> I thought ſtill that to deſire, and love, and make
one ſelf to be honoured, had been Pride and Ambition;
as well, as to deſire Riches, is Covetouſneſs; and that it
had been inconſiſtent with the Spirit of the Goſpel in
Churchmen as well as in others. Our Author in the next
Impreſſion of his Preface, by his way of Reaſoning, may
bring in our Saviour, miſtaking the Deſign of his own
Goſpel, when he ſays, <hi>Woe to you that are Rich, how hard
it is for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:
Woe to you that are full: Woe to you that laugh: Woe to you
Phariſees, for you love the uppermoſt Seats in the Synagogues,
and greetings in the Markets, and to go in long Cloathing,
and to have the uppermoſt Rooms at Feaſts;</hi> he may as
conſequentially infer, that the Rich, and ſuch as live Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
and make themſelves to be honoured, are acccor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Chriſt's Doctrine, in a State of Damnation; as that
according to <hi>A. B</hi>'s Doctrine, all Prelates, and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
who have Servants or Coaches, or make themſelves
to be honoured, do all run blindly to Damnation: But
if he can put ſuch a Sence upon our Saviour's Words, as
is conſiſtent with the Uſe of Riches, and giving honour
to whom it is due; why may not he candidly conſtruct
her Words, without inferring that ſhe deſtroys all Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

The <hi>Socinians</hi> its known, deny the Foundation of all Merit
in Jeſus Chriſt, his Divinity and Perſonal Union with the
Godhead; they deny the very ſaving Means and Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that flow from his Merits, <hi>viz.</hi> the inward renewing
and ſanctifying Grace and Operations of Jeſus Chriſt puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Soul; they deny the Diſeaſe it ſelf that needs
theſe Remedies, <hi>viz.</hi> the vaſt and unſpeakable Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our whole Natures both inward and outward,
derived upon us by <hi>Adam,</hi> and greatly encreas'd by us.
All this <hi>A. B.</hi> utterly abhors, and declares on the Contrary,
that Jeſus Chriſt is true Eternal God, and true Man; that
he is the Mediator between God and Man, the Saviour
and Redeemer of Mankind, that none ever was or ſhall
be ſaved, but by his Interceſſion and Merits; that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
their Pledge and Surety, and effectively paid the
Penalty; that he cloathed himſelf with our Mortality, and
gave himſelf in Sacrifice for the Redemption of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
that from his Life, his Actions, his Sufferings, and
Death, do flow all the ſaving Means both outward and
inward, that are neceſſary for removing the horrid Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Mankind, both as to Body and Soul; for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
in us all Evil, all Wickedneſs, and the Image of
the Devil; and for recovering us unto and perfecting us in
Holineſs; and in the Love and Image of God. This is the
Eſſence of the true Orthodox Chriſtian Doctrine, as to the
Merits and Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt; and the Reaſon why
many of her Expreſſions are ſo miſunderſtood upon this
Subject, ſeems to be, that ſhe endeavoured to undeceive
ſuch as ſoothed and flattered themſelves in the looſeneſs
and irregularity of their Lives, (from the Pretence of the
utter Impoſſibility to keep the Commandments of God,
and the full Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Penalties
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:94808:179"/>
paid by him) by declaring diſtinctly, that as Jeſus Chriſt
had done enough on his Part for their Salvation, procuring
them Pardon and Time to repent, and Grace to return to
the Love of God; ſo they muſt do what is required on
their Parts, <hi>repent and return to the Love of God,</hi> and the
Inſtructions and Commands Jeſus Chriſt left with them,
are the <hi>neceſſary Means</hi> to bring them to it. <hi>If we would
reign with Chriſt, we muſt ſuffer with him.</hi> It is well
known that the vulgar way of explaining this Doctrine,
had too great a tendency to the Flattering of corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the Doctrine of the Antinomians is now
owned by many, and as to Mens Practices, it ſeems to be
the Principle of all: What need is there then to caution
againſt ſo damnable a Principle? And grant once that none
can be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, but they who follow his Life
and Doctrine, and the Sentiments of <hi>A. B.</hi> will allow,
the Doctrine of the Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the higheſt Senſe, that may ſhew God's Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
againſt Sin, his Compaſſion to Sinners, his Regard
to the Holineſs and Authority of his Laws, and may lay
a powerful Obligation upon Men not to trample upon
them. In this manner the Doctrine of the Satisfaction
has been explained and cleared by the Reverend Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Outram,</hi> Dr. <hi>Scot,</hi> and others, and I know
none who Eſteem the Sentiments of <hi>A. B.</hi> who would not
thus cordially embrace it. How unjuſt and injurious the
Author is in this Matter to <hi>A. B.</hi> evidently appears by the
6th. and 8th. Letters, of the Third Part of <hi>Lum. en tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi>
the laſt whereof is ſubjoined to this <hi>Apology</hi> among
ſome others tranſlated into Engliſh.</p>
               <p>The Occaſions of theſe Expreſſions cited by the Author,
upon which he grounds this Accuſation, is a peculiar Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
of <hi>A. B.</hi> That ſuch is God's Love to Mankind,
and his Delight with the Children of Men, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to become like to Man, as he had made Man like

after that Man had plunged himſelf into Sin and Miſery,
he became in all things like to him, yet without Sin, that
he might redeem and ſave them. Now the only difference
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:94808:180"/>
between this and the generally received Doctrine, lying
in theſe two, that God would have become Man though
<hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, and that he united himſelf to Man's
Nature even in the Beginning, (which the Author if he
pleaſes may look upon as Dreams, ſince no Body ſays
they are neceſſary to Salvation) ſhe might well have uſed
theſe Expreſſions cited by the Author, without denying
thereby any Satisfaction by Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Light of the World p. 139.</note> She gives good
Reaſons, for ſaying, that God had no need to become Man
to redeem us; he is not ſubject to any Neceſſity; that he
might have ſuffered Man to periſh eternally, and created
a Thouſand <hi>Adams,</hi> and a Thouſand earthly Paradices,
with the ſame Perfections in which he created the firſt,
out of Nothing: She does not deny that Jeſus Chriſt,
coming to redeem Man, muſt ſuffer, (and ſo the Texts the
Author brings to prove this are needleſs) but affirms, that
God would have become Man, tho' <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned:
And the Reaſon why ſhe ſays he would needs ſuffer and
die by Accident, for the Inſtruction and Relief of Men,
is becauſe ſhe was perſwaded that Sin came into the World
by Accident; by Man's abuſe of his free Will, againſt the
Will of God, and contrary to the firſt and eſſential De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
that he had in creating Man, which was, that he
might take his Delight with him, and not that Man might
ſin, and thereby give him an Occaſion to magnifie his

                  </gap>s falling into Sin, gave Occaſion to
his proſecuting his firſt Deſign by a State of Humiliation
and Suffering, that ſo he might recover Fallen Man.</p>
               <p>Altho' Jeſus Chriſt did highly glorifie God, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Vertues of Meekneſs, Patience, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
by him in his Sufferings, yet certainly the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Treatment he met with in the World, from thoſe

Grief and Sorrow to thoſe pious Souls that beheld it,

tho' that Day, in the beholding whereof, the Fathers

the Day of his ſecond Coming in Glory, and not of his

               <p>The Author is greatly miſtaken in what he calls her

of Sin and Hereſie, <hi>p.</hi> 33. he repeats over the ſame
Charge, with all the hard Words that Spite and Fury could
invent, and inſinuates his Fears of a Growing Sect and
Party. It is ſtrange to ſee Men more alarm'd and enrag'd
againſt Enemies created by their own Fancy, than they are
againſt real ones. If the Author of the Preface were once
out of the Heat that his Imagination has put him in, it
were eaſie, I ſhould think, to convince him that theſe he
calls <hi>Bourignianiſts</hi> are no ſuch Enemies as he has fanſied
to himſelf. I can aſſure him, they do heartily own that
our Reconciliation with God is obtain'd only by the Merits
and Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt; That the Word of God
contained in the Holy Scriptures is the Standard by which
we are to try and examine all Doctrines; That no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
can come from God that does not fill the Soul
with Humility, and Charity; or, That inſtills, under the
Sheeps Clothing of Devotion and Piety, any Hereſie, or
any thing that tends to Schiſm, or to withdraw Obedience
from their lawful Biſhop, or to ſet up new Sects; and that
Corruptions in the Church are better amended by living in
the Communion of it, and there, by good Example, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
than by open Deſertion, to ſet up oppoſite Factions,
which heightens Animoſities, embitters Spirits, renders
them deaf to one anothers Advices, and often proceeds to

Blood and Slaughter, as the Author of the Preface does
ſo rationally conclude it, in the Marks he gives to diſtinguiſh
between Inſpirations from God, and Diabolical Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm.
And if there be any thing in the Writings of <hi>A. B.</hi>
contrary to theſe, or to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, they
do openly diſown and diſclaim the ſame, and ſtand up for
them no farther than they tend to promote the great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts

of <hi>A. B.</hi> to be put in Engliſh, and recommended as
uſeful to advance the Intereſt of true Chriſtianity, without
making ſuch a Noiſe about it; yet it no ſooner comes to
his Hands, but he preſently raiſes the Hue and-Cry, Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Errours, and magnifies it into a new and growing
Sect, that he might get himſelf a Name, and have the
Glory to encounter, and, as he hop'd, to defeat it. But
the Doctor is not ſo dreadful an Enemy as he would ſeem
at firſt On-ſet; they who bluſter moſt are not always the
moſt dangerous. They who have read the Writings of
<hi>A. B.</hi> and find that the Marrow and Subſtance of them
are the Eſſential Truths of Chriſtianity, and that her ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Sentiments (which ſhe ſays are not neceſſary to be
believed) do not contradict thoſe Eſſential Truths, do juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wonder what has moved the Doctor to raiſe all this
Duſt and Clamour. I know he once profeſs'd a great
Veneration for <hi>Thomas à Kempis</hi> his Book <hi>de Imitatione
Chriſti;</hi> (but he being a Myſtick, and one who ſeems to
own his being immediately enlightned by the Spirit of
God; it may be the Doctor deſpiſes him now, as in his
late Letter he declares he has long ſince turn'd off ſuch
Converſation) and a deceas'd Friend of his had not only
a great Eſteem for that Book, but alſo for others of the
ſame Nature, ſuch as the Life of M. <hi>de Renti,</hi> &amp;c. The
Perſon I mean, was the moſt pious and learn'd <hi>H. Scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi>
of whom the Reverend Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> now Biſhop of
<hi>Sarum,</hi> gave ſo deſerv'd a Character, in his Preface to
Biſhop <hi>Bedal's</hi> Life, and with whom he prevail'd to let
him publiſh his Devout Treatiſe of the <hi>Life of God in
the Soul of Man</hi> (to which he was pleas'd to prefix a
Preface, and to ſubjoin a Diſcourſe of his own, <hi>of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Life</hi>) which little Book alſo contains an excellent
Idea of the Divine Life in the Soul, and particularly a
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:94808:182"/>
Notion of Faith far above the Common, and approaching
as near as any I know to that of <hi>A. B. viz.</hi> that it is
<hi>a kind of Senſe, and feeling Perſwaſion of Spiritual Things,</hi>
and has the ſame Place in the Divine Life, that Senſe hath
in the Natural. Now the Doctor profeſſing a great Eſteem
for theſe Writings, and acknowledging that they contain
the Marrow and Subſtance of Chriſtianity; and the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>A. B.</hi> being the ſame in Subſtance, and ſhe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
no Regard to be had to her acceſſory Sentiments,
but in ſo far as any ſhould find them uſeful for increaſing
in them the Love of God; ſome think it unaccountable,
why the Doctor ſhould fall ſo foul upon her for her acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory
Opinions, and does not rather honour her for the ſake
of the main Truths, and more favourably and candidly
conſtruct the others.</p>

ſhould he therefore cry out, There is Death in the Pot,
and frighten all others from taſting of it, as far as his
Teſtimony can have Influence? We do not uſe to drive

Truths contained therein, as they would quite paſs over
the acceſſory Opinions, they would run to the Pearls and
gather the wholſom Food, and apply themſelves only to
Things which direct them to the Love of God and the
mortifying of their corrupt Natures. The Doctor ſhould
have conſidered the Woe pronounced againſt all them <hi>by

the Doctor would think it a crying Sin to proclaim
thoſe Perſons to be Thieves, Robbers and Murtherers, tho'
I think his ſaying ſo, would do them no great Hurt; and
if he would conſider things calmly, he would find it no leſs,
and perhaps a greater injuſtice to tell the World they are

Cort,</hi> M. <hi>Poiret</hi> and others give of the Perſon and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of <hi>A. B.</hi> upon their bare Word; and the ſecond,
that we are not to believe the Characters ſhe gives of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and her own Sentiments, upon her own Teſtimony,
without ſufficient Enquiry and Evidence: And in both
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:94808:183"/>
theſe, I know none will contend with him. In the Firſt,
he would make Men believe, that the great Buſineſs of her
Friends is to recommend her to all the World, by a great
many Elogies of all Sorts, that Men all might extol her and
adhere to her for the Making up of a New Sect. In the
Second, he gives this Idea of herſelf, as if her great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was to boaſt that ſhe was endued with all Sort of
Prerogatives, that ſhe might draw Souls to follow her, as
if ſhe aim'd to be the Head of a Party in Religion, and
to draw Diſciples after her. Now there is nothing more
falſe than all this, for the Friends of <hi>A. B.</hi> had no other
Aim, but to ſeek after the Truth as it is in Chriſt Jeſus.

and diſmember it all in Pieces, and quite invert the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of its Parts, and take withal only ſome Bits of it to
ſet them together, and at laſt beſpatter all with Filth and
Spittle, crying, <hi>Here is the Woman.</hi> And ſuch is the
Doctor's ſingular Way of making Characters. They who
have reaped great ſpiritual Advantages from the Writings
and Converſation of any Perſon, do ſpeak of ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with more Eſteem and Admiration, than others who
not having had ſuch Experiences will think their Expreſſions
extravagant, eſpecially when half Sentences are taken out

from them; and yet this is the Doctor's Way of making up
the Character of <hi>A. B.</hi> skipping from one Book to another,
from one Chapter to another, to pick out the half Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
that might be ſerviceable to his evil Deſign. In the
reſt of his <hi>Narrative,</hi> he takes out little Paſſages of her
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:94808:184"/>
Life, here and there, without narrating ingenuouſly the
true Circumſtances of them, he dreſſes them up with his
fine Reflexions, and ſo expoſes them to the World as a
Character of her Life. The Anſwer he gives to this in his
Letter to his Friend at <hi>London,</hi> Art. XIV. is frivolous, and
needs no Reply; it ſhews only how willing he is to ſay
any thing rather than ingenuouſly confeſs a real and a
heinous Sin.</p>

up this Character by borrowing Pieces of it, not from her
own or her Friends Writings, but from thoſe of hers and their
avowed Enemies; (as the next Day ſome of the Doctor's
Temper and Acquaintance will, it may be, take her
Character as given by her Friends upon his Word, and ſo
fill it with horrid Untruths). Thus he takes<note n="*" place="margin">Nar. 1. p. 75.</note> a Part of their
Character of her from the Author of the <hi>Leipſick Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which Part is ſhewn to be a moſt abominable Falſhood
in the <hi>Monitum ad Acta Erudit. Leipſ.</hi> and what Regard is
to be had to the Teſtimony and Judgment of the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of the <hi>Leipſick</hi> Acts in this Matter, appears by the
Account of a Friend of his, who ſpeaks thus of that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
<hi>Firmiter perſuaſus ſum fuiſſe</hi> Bourignoniam <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
puſſimam, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>I am firmly perſwaded that the
Virgin <hi>A. Bourignon</hi> was moſt pious, and her Heart the
Temple of the Holy Spirit; her Doctrine, as to the
main, is holy and ſound, and her Books moſt worthy to
be peruſed by the Serious. As to her Sentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſome Myſteries, ſhe wrote, no doubt, according
to her Perſwaſion, and it ſavours nothing of Folly or
Enthuſiaſm, if you ſhall read her Writings without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and a ſectarian Infallibility, even tho' you be of
another Opinion your ſelf. I impute it to human Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
if ſhe thought that no Body would be ſaved but
they who embraced her Sentiments; yet ſhe herſelf uſes
to diſtinguiſh between the Sentiments about the Myſteries
of Religion, and the Doctrine of Godlineſs. The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
of the <hi>Leipſick</hi> Acts have paſs'd a ſevere Cenſure
againſt her and our Author (M. <hi>Poiret</hi>). Yet I knew
the Author of that ſevere Cenſure wrote according to his
Perſwaſion. I got, at a <hi>publick Auction,</hi> that Copy of
the Works of <hi>A. B.</hi> which the Author of the Cenſure
made uſe of; and, with great wonder, I obſerved the
Weakneſs of Man. The Author was a wiſe Man, of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:94808:185"/>
great Judgment and Sincerity; but what cannot Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
do, that grow up with us? I found many Places
marked with a little Line on the Margent, which if you
conſider them alone, cannot but make the Doctrine of
<hi>A. B.</hi> look ſuſpicious, yea blaſphemous; but if you join
them with what goes before and follows after in her Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
they have an excellent and pious Sence. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
who while he liv'd was moſt dear to me, and whom
I am bound to honour now he is dead, had ſuch Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
Judgment and Sincerity, that he would never
have made ſuch Exceptions, if the preconceiv'd Opinion
of a Sect (as it daily happens t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> others) had not bewitch'd
him; nevertheleſs, I am perſwaded that if he had lived
till now, he would have come to ſee his Errour. This is</q>
the Judgment of Dr. <hi>Chriſtianus Thomaſius,</hi> Counſellor to
the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> and Profeſſor of the Law
in the Univerſity of <hi>Hale</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and is publiſhed in
one of his Diſcourſes before the Treatiſe <hi>De Eruditione
ſolida, &amp;c.</hi> which he cauſed to be reprinted in <hi>Germany,</hi>
and I wiſh with all my heart that Doctor <hi>Cockbourn</hi> and
his Friend may impartially conſider it, and it may pleaſe
God to open their Eyes, and let them ſee their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.</p>
               <p>3.<note place="margin">3. By ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding falſe Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</note> So zealous is the Doctor to blacken her, that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the Extravagancy of the Character, he ventures to
tranſlate their Words falſly, and even of thoſe Falſe
Tranſlations, will tack together two half Sentences that are
more than a Page diſtant in the Original, as if they had
been written in the blaſphemous Way that he repreſents
them in one Breath. Thus, <hi>Narr. 1. p. 4. lin.</hi> 7, 8, 9. he
makes the Author of the Continuation of her Life ſay of
her, <hi>She is the divine Sun of Righteouſneſs:</hi> (and with the
ſame Breath) <hi>She is pure Truth, and the only Truth that
can guide one to Heaven and eternal Life:</hi> As if he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
both of her, and both in one Period; whereas they
are in two different Paragraphs, and neither of them ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of her. The firſt is a Petition put up to Almighty
God, by the Author of the <hi>Vie Continuée,</hi> p. 599. <q>That
he would pleaſe to fix him in the <hi>Heaven of his Truth,</hi>
that the Dragon might not be able to caſt him upon the
Earth by his Violence, nor by his Artifice; <hi>That,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>I may then always receive the Light of the Divine Sun of
Righteouſneſs, in which thou haſt placed thine Handmaid.</hi>
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:94808:185"/>
And then in the next Section, when he had appealed unto
God the Searcher of Hearts, concerning his Integrity in
ſeeking after Truth, and his Impartiality in examining
the Life and Writings of <hi>A. B.</hi> concerning his Readineſs
to diſprove, if he could, with all the Application of his
Mind have found any thing in them favouring Corruption
or Sin, or contrary to the Glory of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he continues his
Appeal in theſe Words; <q>Is it not with the utmoſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of my Heart, that I proteſt openly, that the
Words of eternal Life have been with an incomparable
Purity, Clearneſs and Solidity in this Soul which thou
haſt ſanctified, and are yet in her Writings: <hi>Certainly the
Way that is recommended there, as neceſſary to Salvation,
is the only and true Way</hi> (this is the Life and Doctrine of
Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>and there is no Danger to give up our ſelves
to it entirely; for this is Truth it ſelf, This is the Truth, This
is the pure Truth</hi>
                     </q> Thus we ſee there cannot be a more

is, which can bear no Apology, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is (<hi>ni la point faire prier</hi>) and the true Tranſlation is,
<hi>they do not deſire her to pray.</hi> I ſhall not enquire what
Sence the Doctor would have the Reader put upon his
Tranſlation, but muſt ſay, that he himſelf ſhould not
have aggravated his Guilt by calling that a cloſe and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Tranſlation (Art. XIII. of his Letter) when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ignorant, that it is both a falſe and a foul one.
Again, <hi>Nar. 1. p.</hi> 17. he makes the Author of the <hi>Preface

Words in the Original are, <q>Or je puis dire avec

                  <q>That if ſhe may be believed, Chriſt

her, and not him but her, the laſt and higheſt Expreſſion

were perſwaded that all who would peruſe them with

with much concern to others, but were far from inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

their Words;<note place="margin">Nar. 1. p. 18. §. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> or the odious Conſequences which he wide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
draws from them: <q>As, that <hi>A. B.</hi> is the greateſt that
ever was born of a Woman, above all the ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,
to be preferred to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, to
<hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and the Apoſtles, and at leaſt ought
to be honoured equally with Jeſus Chriſt, who is ſaid
to be God Bleſſed for ever; that ſhe was as much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sin as he, and her Body of a better Frame:—That
it is a clear Conſequence from what they ſay, That
ſhe muſt either have always been perſonally united to
the Deity, and ſo to be eſteemed God-Woman, or elſe that
her Body and humane Nature were not real, but a meer
Phantome, by which God was pleaſed to declare his
Will to Man: That all her Words and Writings, are of
the ſame Authority with the Sacred Scriptures.—That
there ought to be a Commemoration of her in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Liturgies, as well as of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and
inſtead of the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
now we ſhould ſay the God of <hi>A. B.</hi> and the Spirit that
ſpoke by her.</q> The Perſons cited by the Doctor, do
abhor ſuch Conſequences; their Words compared with the
reſt of their Writings will not bear them: And in the
Sence he puts on them, they diſclaim them as none of
theirs. Every Body can beſt explain their own Senſe and
Meaning, and what is apt to be miſunderſtood in one
Place, Equity requires that we interpret it by another,
where a Man does more diſtinctly expreſs and explain his
Mind in relation to that very thing. The Doctor knows

they were deſigned in ſome meaſure to ballance the bold

things before they know them. So the Doctor might have
ſpared this Narrative, and it may be all that is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
for his only Buſineſs ought to have been to let the
World ſee, that what ſhe calls the Doctrine of the Goſpel,
and neceſſary to Salvation, really i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other Sentiments do deſtroy it; for, provided that Men
be perſwaded of the Truth of this, that none can be
ſaved without the Love of God, and will follow the only
way to come at this, the mortifying corrupt Nature, and
following the Life and Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe is
content to undergo all reproach her ſelf, and that all her
other Sentiments and Doctrines paſs for Dreams and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.
If the Doctor ſay, as he does in his Letter <hi>Art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>
XV. that he finds nothing good in her Writings, but
what is common and handled in every Practical Treatiſe,
and the Subject of daily Sermons. Well, might not the
Doctor have ſuffered her Books to paſs among Practical
Treatiſes, and even to be preferred to moſt of them, by
ſuch who ſee the Doctrine of Chriſt more clearly and
purely repreſented in them, than in others, without the
Gloſſes of corrupt Nature; and feel a Divine Force,
Power, and Spirit accompanying them; who ſee in them
the horrid Corruption of our Nature, and of our Wills,
clearly laid before them, the Chriſtian Vertues moſt
lively repreſented, and moſt excellent Directions how
to copy them out according to the great Original, Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>XXII.<note place="margin">XXII. The true Reaſons why <hi>A. B.</hi> was highly eſteemed, not addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Doctor. Nor thoſe adduced, ſufficiently diſproved: As 1. her Sanctity.</note> The other Part of the Doctor's Narrative, is
ſpent in diſproving the Reaſons why <hi>A. B.</hi> is ſo much

ſorry that his Paſſions or Prejudices do as much darken
his Reaſon, and with-hold him from candour and fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here, as in the former. The Reaſons which they bring,
are to be had more truly from her and their Writings, and
are ſet down in the Thrid Part of the <hi>Apology;</hi> and ſome
of thoſe mentioned by the Doctor, were never brought
by them as Reaſons why they thought her divinely inſpir'd,
but upon other Grounds; of which afterwards.</p>
               <p>The firſt he conſiders is her <hi>Sanctity,</hi> which he ſays, is
nor always attended with extraordinary Illuminations;
and then inferrs, that ſuppoſe her to be truly and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
Holy, ſhe is not therefore to be reckon'd to know
the Mind of God in all things, by immediate Revelation;
all which is readily granted: But make once the Doctor's
Suppoſition, and then add, that the Perſon ſo truly Holy
declares, that God is pleas'd to communicate his Light
immediately unto her, and that without all humane
Helps; and that upon trial it be found, that what ſhe
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:94808:189"/>
declares is the ſame with the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and
what God has already revealed by his Spirit, this I think
may be reckoned a weighty Evidence of Divine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
for a Perſon ſo truly Holy would not lye, nor
would God ſuffer ſuch a one to be ſo deluded. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
ſingles out every Reaſon by it ſelf, and would prove,
that ſuppoſe it were true, the Conſequence is not juſt, and
ſo rejects the Conſequence drawn from them altogether;
which is juſt as if one ſhould reaſon that 2 and 4 and 6 do
not make 12, becauſe 2 makes not 12, and 4 makes it not,
nor yet 6, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the reſt of this <hi>Article,</hi> he has a long Diſcourſe to
ſhew, <q>How far Saints ſhould keep their Diſtance, and be
cloathed with Humility, and how others ſhould beware
of running into exceſs when they honour them, not to
exalt them to an equality with God, nor near it; we
ought to honour thoſe whom God hath honoured, yet
only ſo as to make them the ſubject Matter of honouring
God.</q> 
                  <hi>A. B.</hi> and her Friends, do perfectly join with the
Doſtor, what goes beyond this, they abhor it. Where there
is no Humility, there is no Sanctity; for that is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of this; but we may be greatly miſtaken, to call
that <hi>Humility</hi> which is the <hi>greateſt Pride,</hi> to ſpeak meanly
of our ſelves, when it appears by all our Actions that we
are not ſo in our Hearts: the Saints may declare the Grace
of God to themſelves with the greateſt Humility, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
all to God, and ſeeing the more their own Nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
As <hi>David, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. and what <hi>A. B.</hi> ſays of her
ſelf, may proceed from the ſame Spirit, notwithſtanding
of all the Doctor's Reaſons. That her Friends publiſh
blaſphemous Encomiums of her, and are guilty of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
as to her, is a bold, unjuſt, and malicious Calumny,
which they utterly deny.</p>
               <p>In the XV. <hi>Article,</hi> he juſtifies his Zeal againſt her
and them, for exalting her above the preſent State and
Capacity of humane Nature, only, that all her metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Whimſies, which M. <hi>Poiret</hi> is paſſionately fond of,
might be received for Divine Truths. I have already
replied to this, that neither <hi>A. B.</hi> nor M. <hi>Poiret,</hi> do bid
any believe what he calls Whimſies to be Divine Truths,
but only entreat Men to be True Chriſtians, and if they
pleaſe, they may look upon all her other Thoughts, that
have no immediate relation to this, to be really metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:94808:190"/>
Whimſies. It is a wrong Imagination of his, that
that make her impeccable, or at leaſt never to have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

believed no ſuch thing, as I have already ſhewn. M. <hi>de
Cort's</hi> Expreſſion, (As if <hi>Adam</hi> had never ſinned in her)
implies no ſuch thing as the Doctor inferrs from it, but
that during the time he converſed with her, he obſerved
in her ſuch a compleat and ſolid Vertue, that he thinks,
ſhe could not have been in a purer State, tho' ſhe had not
been born of the corrupt maſs of <hi>Adam,</hi> as indeed ſhe
was. So this is the Subject of another Conſideration,
whether by the Grace of God, a Perſon may be advanced
to ſuch a State of Vertue, as not actually to commit any
Sin, neither in Heart nor Life, tho' they be born of the
corrupt maſs of <hi>Adam,</hi> are not impeccable, and have
been guilty of many Sins.</p>

In the Eighteenth <hi>Article,</hi> he ſpeaks as if <hi>A. B.</hi> and
others, in comparing her Life with that of Jeſus Chriſt,
thought that there were an Equality, without giving
any Evidence for it; the thing is utterly falſe, both ſhe
and they affirm only, that ſhe was a Follower of Jeſus
Chriſt, ſhe makes the Eſſence of Chriſtianity to conſiſt
in the Imitation of Jeſus Chriſt, and in all her Writings
lays before us his Life and Spirit for our Imitation, in a
way more divine and forcible, than the general way of
ſermonizing: And if her Vertues were truly Tranſcripts
of the Life of Jeſus, it is very Juſt that they be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the World as ſuch, that ſo it may appear, that
it is the Devil and our corrupt Nature only that makes
us believe that he is not imitable, and that by ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
we may be ſtirred up to be true Followers of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the next <hi>Article,</hi> he hath a long Diſcourſe upon <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:</hi>
                  <q>Becauſe, he ſays, it is recommended as a ſpecial
Act of Sanctity by the Example and Sentiments of
<hi>A. B.</hi> and becauſe it has been much debated by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
and Chriſtians, by Ancients and Modern, yet few,
ſays he, have offered a juſt Deciſion of the Matter: I</q>
was in good Hopes this ſhould have been done by him,
yet at laſt he will not determine which of the States, the
Active, or the Contemplative is fitteſt: but then he thinks,
<q>A mixt State the happieſt, (which is plainly every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
State) and gives his Reaſons for it, and corrects a
vulgar Error concerning the Clergy, as if they all ought
to be Men of Study and Retirement, which, he ſays, is
a great Miſtake, ſince they are to ſhew the Poſſibility of
the Divine Laws, by their Practice, and he who can
hear himſelf prais'd without Vanity, and accuſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Wrath, can accept of good things when they are
offered, without a brutal Joy, and yet never be out of
Humour when are they wanting.—Such a one proſecutes

more good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. B.</hi> conſiders and determines this Matter upon other
Principles, and by another Spirit. <q>It is not which of
the States makes a Man a Drone or a Drudge, in which
a Man may enjoy himſelf beſt, or do moſt good; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
Knowledge and Experience; give himſelf to Study
or to Buſineſs:</q> Which are the Meaſures by which the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:94808:191"/>
Doctor determines. But, ſhe ſays, we are all travelling
to Eternity, and our great Buſineſs, both as Men and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
is to give our whole Love to God; and to keep
our ſelves unſpotted from the World; that every one is
obliged ſincerely to examine their own Hearts and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and whatever they find to be a Hindrance to the
Love of God, by all means to avoid it, and whatever they
find to be to them a neceſſary Help to it, to embrace it;
that the Corruptions abounding in the World make it very
hard for ſome to converſe with it, and not become Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of their Sin; that many are ſo weak or ſo eaſie to be
ſurprized by the Temptations it offers, that they find it
for their Safety as much as they can to avoid them by <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
and <hi>Retirement;</hi> that <hi>Babylon</hi> is preſently over all,
and God calls to all his Children to come out of her, leaſt
they be Partakers of her Sins, and ſo of her Plagues alſo.
That nevertheleſs, God has different Ways of bringing
Souls unto himſelf; and therefore what Method one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and finds for his Eternal good, he is not to impoſe
upon others, nor are others to deſpiſe him.</p>

That of a light and vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</note> In the 20th. <hi>Article,</hi> the Doctor brings, as he
thinks, certain Proofs, that ſhe had no Sactnity.</p>
               <p>1. That till the 18th Year of her Age, ſhe ran into a
vain and light Converſation, by which ſhe loſt her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
with God; where, in his Judgement, he ſhews a flat
Contradiction in the Preface to the Engliſh Reader, of
the <hi>Light of the World;</hi> becauſe a few Lines before he had
affirmed this, he had ſaid, that from her Childhood ſhe had
inward Converſation with God, as if any could loſe a thing
they never had, or never loſe it becauſe they had it from their
Childhood: However, this he thinks proves, <q>That ſhe
could not be anointed by the Spirit of God to declare
his Will; for if it had been ſo, it is no ways likely he
would have left her ſo ſoon to her ſelf, or ſuffered her
to be corrupted, whom he had appointed to be ſo great
a Light, eſpecially when that which tempted her was
but the Cenſures and Miſconſtructions of other Men:
What, could not the Spirit of God break through this
Temptation? Was her Grace too weak to reſiſt it? Muſt
ſo Holy a Perſon do Evil,</q> merely to paſs for a Wit?
The Doctor reaſons upon other Principles different from
thoſe of the reſt of Mankind, when he comes to ſpeak
of <hi>A. B.</hi> Were not <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeparated from
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:94808:191"/>
the Womb? Did not their Graces and Sanctity appear
early? Did they not fall into grievous Sins? Is this a
Proof that God did not anoint them to declare his Will?
Could not the Spirit of God break through their Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But moreover, it is to be conſidered, that
it was no groſs and ſcandalous Sin, by which ſhe loſt her
Converſation with God, and yet notwithſtanding ſhe lived
a Life of great Mortification for it, for ſeveral Years.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">2. From fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her own Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Principles of Religion.</note> His next Proof is, that even after this, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be the Time of her Converſation, <q>She did not
determine the great State of her Life, by Motives and
Principles of Religion, but by her own Humour; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
upon a Celibate Life, only becauſe ſhe would not
be croſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> But the Doctor ſets this in a falſe Light,
as he does every thing elſe that concerns her. The true
Caſe is this, when ſhe was a Child, it troubled her to ſee
her Father ſometimes ſo rough to her Mother, and when
he was in Wrath, ſhe would run and embrace his Knees
to appeaſe him, and then would retire and pray, that God
would never ſuffer her to marry, but that he would take
her for his Spouſe. This was before her turning aſide
from God, to divert her ſelf with the Vanities of the
World. In the 18th Year of her Age, ſhe was ſtruck with
a deep Remorſe for her ſtraying from God, and led a Life
of moſt ſevere Penitence for Seven Years; ſo that other
Conſiderations did then affect her, and draw her to a
State of Celibacy. As for the Doctor's immodeſt Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
upon this Occaſion, I ſhall leave it to his own
Conſcience to check him for them; but for the other
Reaſon he gives for her Celibacy, <hi>That ſhe undervalued
all ſhe ſaw, and could find none of Merit enough to deſerve
her,</hi> &amp;c. its purely his own Invention, without the leaſt
Ground given for it, in her Life or Writings, or any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of way, and will be judged by every enquiring Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to be a malicious and wilful Calumny.</p>

<hi>her Diſobedience to her Parents;</hi> contrary to whoſe expreſs
Commands, ſhe was importunate to go into a Cloyſter,
and when that would not do, ſtole away from her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's

but is not aware of one Reaſon he brings, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
the Caſe clearly on her ſide; <q>If the Caſe had
been, ſays he, about turning Chriſtian, ſhe ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have done it, even without a particular Revelation,
whether her Father would or not.</q> The Caſe was the very
ſame with her, and a particular Command from God to
ſtrengthen it: She ſaw ſhe could not become a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
without abandoning the World, and that while ſhe
was in her Father's Houſe, ſhe could not ſufficiently diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
her ſelf from it, and therefore reſolved to obey Jeſus
Chriſt, who bids us forſake Father and Mother and all
that we have, for his ſake. Our Lord called <hi>James</hi> and
<hi>John,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> from waiting on their Father,
<hi>and they forſook all and followed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4.<note place="margin">4. From Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe of her Law Suits.</note> The Doctor triumphs greatly in his Fourth Inſtance,
her ſuing her Father at Law, to divide his Goods with
her after his Second Marriage; which does not agree, he
ſays, with common Meaſures of Grace and good Nature,
becauſe it proceeded from an inordinate Love of the
World, and could not be managed without great diſreſpect
to her Father. The Doctor's Paſſions make him ſo diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
in every thing that relates to this Virgin, that it
will nor be thought ſtrange to tell that he is manifeſtly
ſo in this Inſtance. Mr. <hi>Poiret</hi>'s Reply to this being ſo full
in the fore-mentioned Letter to a Friend, I need only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it for her Vindication, and this the rather, becauſe
the Doctor thinks that the Reaſon why he who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
her Life, takes no Notice of this Paſſage, (tho' ſhe
gives an Account of it herſelf) was, becauſe he knew not
how to juſtifie it. <q>It is not true, ſays he, (M. <hi>Poiret</hi>) that
I had any Intereſt to defend the Life and Actions of
Mrs. <hi>A. B.</hi> by a Legacy which ſhe left me, (as the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
ſays) ſhe did not leave me in Legacy to the Value
of a Penny. But there is nothing more contrary to
Truth, as well as to Juſtice and Charity, than what he
ſays of the Law-Suits of Mrs. <hi>A. B.</hi> with her Father,
and Step Mother; I pray God he may not have acted
maliciouſly, againſt his Knowledge, in the Judgment
that he would have the Engliſh and Scots to make of
her Civil Actions, whoſe Civil Laws are different from
thoſe of her Country. It may be, it would be a Crime
in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> for a younger Daughter, after her
Mother's Death, to require by Law, of her Father, the
Goods of her deceas'd Mother. But in <hi>France,</hi> where

Diſtinction between Son or Daughter, elder or younger,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:94808:192"/>

is touched upon already, and is miſtaken by the Doctor:
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:94808:195"/>
Beſides, we are to conſider, that thoſe inſpired by God,
have their Minds ſo filled with the Repreſentations of
Divine and Future Things, that they appear to them
near even at the Door. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the laſt
Judgments, and of Chriſt's Coming in the Clouds, and of
their being to be changed, who were then upon the Earth
at his Coming, as if all were to be accompliſhed in his

               <p>It is much that has obliged the Doctor to ſay one good
Word of her, ſure the Matter muſt be very notorious,
that he had not the Confidence to paſs it by, and conceal

that ſhe ſpeaks and writes more plainly and intelligibly
than any of the Myſtick Sect, and is ſomewhat more on
the Moral than others of that Gang.</q> But as if it were
againſt the grain to ſay any thing that might ſeem in the
leaſt to commend her, he daſhes all again, by telling,
<q>That her high Flights were effects of Fancy rather than
Judgment, as not having much Reaſon and Meditation.
That her Notions are Sublime, but ſo are a Bedlamites.</q>
Well <hi>A. B.</hi> will not quarrel with any, who diſtinguiſhing
the Acceſſories from the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity in her
Writings, do firmly adhere to, and practice the firſt, tho'
they look upon the laſt as Dreams or metaphyſical Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies:

Fear of theſe <hi>Threatnings of God,</hi> ſent as the Fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

Natural Rain, and the laſt Plagues will be made by

the Devil to divert us from believing that theſe things

all Vertues; but this is not perceptible but only by them
who are rightly diſpoſed, and who truly ſeek God: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they who love Falſhood and Impurity, are ſo far from
feeling thoſe Impreſſons, that their Paſſions are rather
excited to the contrary; as appears by the Enemies of
the Goſpel. So the Writings and Converſation of <hi>A. B.</hi>
might make Divine Impreſſions of Charity and Purity
upon ſome, and yet the Spite, and Malice, and evil Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

that this is neither a Falſhood nor a Contradiction, daily
Experience does teſtifie.</p>

                  <hi>Poiret</hi>'s
<hi>Divine Aeconomie,</hi> whoſoever ſhall read it at length, as
it is in the Preface it ſelf, will find the Thought ſo juſt
and ſo excellent, that he will ſee the Doctor has bewrayed
only the Weakneſs of his own Underſtanding in cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

for finding out the Truth, and upon which the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians

the Metaphyſicks,) is that of <hi>ſhutting out all Idea's foraign

the Truth, without Reſpect to its former Conceptions of

               <p>If there be unqueſtionable and ſufficient Evidences of

Ground to deſpiſe them, or to diſparage the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others who think well of them, that there are
many things in them which appear unto us wild and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relligible.
God may reveal things under moſt myſterious
Figures, altogether dark and hidden from us, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

her. It is not true, that ſhe pretends to a Sanctity above
the Prophets or the Apoſtoles, a Sanctity next to that of
God; nor to a comprehenſive Knowledge Natural and
Divine, and all manner of ſpeculative Truths, nor to the
Knowledge <hi>of all matters of Fact,</hi> at what diſtance of
Time and Place, or how ſecret ſover; nor that ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
her ſelf, as if ſhe aſſerted ſometimes, that both
the Divine Truths which ſhe declares, and all the Words
by which ſhe utters them, were inſpired by the Spirit of
God, and ſometimes the firſt only; nor that ſhe makes
Jeſus Chriſt a Type of her; nor that ſhe is the Mother
of all that ſhall be converted unto God; her Sayings im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
no ſuch thing, when they are conſidered without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
in her own Writings, as is made appear already.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">2. In his Curtailings and Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</note> Notwithſtanding of the Narrator's great Sincerity,
and that he intends to ſet down her own Pretences in her
own Words, without adding to, or diminiſhing from, or
curtailing any Paſſage which may be neceſſary to qualifie
the Meaning of them; yet ſo earneſt is he to make her
odious, that he forgets himſelfe, and either by truly curtailing
the Paſſages, or by his Comments on them, he makes her
ſpeak quite otherwiſe than ſhe intended: So that they
who would not judge raſhly, may pleaſe to read them in
her own Writings without the Doctor's Curtailings and
Gloſſes.<note place="margin">Nar. 2. p 4. Light of the World. Part 2. p. 84.</note> Thus as to his falſe Gloſſes, when he ſays, <hi>My
Thoughts, Words, and Actions, muſt have the Three Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth, elſe I ſhould
be as a ſounding Braſs,</hi> &amp;c. Does this infer that ſhe arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
to her ſelf a Sanctity above the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and next to God himſelf? Souls truly regenerate,
are Partakers of the Divine Nature, Chriſt lives in them;
Piety cannot be true, as he himſelf grants, without a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Parts, tho' not of Degrees, without an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Conformity to the Will of God, ſo that their
Thoughts, Words, and Actions, muſt be both Juſt,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:94808:198"/>
Good, and True; now as one Star differs from another
in Glory ſo do regenerate Souls. Her Words then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
no more, but that God had truly renewed and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
her by his Holy Spirit, and not that ſhe exceeded
all others in Sanctity, as his malicious Gloſs would have
it.<note place="margin">Light of the World, Part 1. p. 92. Nar. 2. p. 5.</note> Thus when ſhe ſays, <hi>I do not remember I ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any Faults, but when I believed the Counſel of Men.</hi>
It is far from her Meaning that ſhe was born without
Sin, or that Original Corruption was perfectly cured
in her, as appears by all her Writings, and by that very
Place cited: but that as Plants and Trees ſeem all Dead
and without Life, in the Winter-Seaſon, till the warm
Spring make them all bud anew, and diſcover the Life
and Spirit that was in the Root, ſo Mens natural Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which ſeems dead and mortified, is awakened and
exerts it ſelf, according to the diffirent outward Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
conformable to the Variety and Difference of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's
Inclinations, and that this was her weak ſide, by
which her Self-love and Vanity did exert it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Again, when ſhe gives a convincing Reaſon for what
ſhe ſays, or ſpeaks of her ſelf with the greateſt Humility,
or limits general Sayings, ſo as to confine them to her
true Senſe and Meaning, all this he very cautiouſly keeps
out, and conceals, as appears in the Citations, out of the
<hi>Light of the World</hi> in the 9, 11, 17, 20, and 21ſt. p. of
the <hi>Narrative.</hi> Thus where ſhe wonderfully Illuſtrates
how the Holy Spirit communicates to pure Souls ſuch a
comprehenſive Divine Light and Knowledge, as cannot
be expreſs'd by many Words; the Doctor induſtriouſly
skips it over, and joins the foregoing and following Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ences
together. <q>I have need, ſays ſhe, to expreſs my
ſelf by humane Reaſons and Compariſons, becauſe
otherwiſe they could not underſtand me; for the Holy
Spirit ſpeaks ſo ſuccinctly, that one Word makes me
comprehend many things. He gives Subtility to
the Underſtanding to conceive great things, by one of
his ſmall Motions. It is juſt as if one were in a fine
Room well adorned with Variety of Furniture and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
but there were no Light in it whereby to ſee all
theſe things: In ſuch a Caſe it would need a great many
Words, to make him who had never ſeen them, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
in particular all the fine Things and Furniture
that were in the Room, telling him here be ſuch and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:94808:198"/>
ſuch Pictures, ſuch Tables, ſuch Seats, and ſuch like
things; and yet we could not make him comprehend
well the Beauty of this Furniture and Rarities: But
if a Light were brought into the Room, tho' it were
but that of a Candle, in a Moment, it would give more
Knowledge of all the things that are in the Room, than
all the Diſcourſes that were uttered to make them known.
So it is with the Light of the Holy Spirit, when it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into a Soul, it makes it know and comprehend all
things, very clearly. Nevertheleſs, theſe things cannot
be ſeen by Souls, who are yet in the Darkneſs and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
of their own Paſſions; many Words and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
muſt be uſed, to make them underſtand the
Rarities that are in the Works of God.</q> So far <hi>A. B.</hi>
All this is left out by the Doctor, except only the firſt
and laſt two Lines the reſt did not ſerve his turn; he
deſign'd to confound and darken all, and they gave too di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
and convincing a Light. They who ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to peruſe that whole Conference, will ſee how little
Ground there is for his ſcurrilous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſts, if we conſider the
thing in <hi>Theſi,</hi> without relation to <hi>A. B.</hi> that when the
Spirit of God does immediately enlighten a Soul, he does
not endite all the preciſe Words that it ought to make uſe
of in explaining that Light and Truth to others, only
that he brings along with him the Gift of Wiſdom, to
expreſs it ſelf ſo as to make the Divine Truths to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.
It cannot be miſtaken then as to the Subſtance,
and Eſſence of the Truths, tho' it may be, as to Faults
of Speech through its own Weakneſs and Ignorance, which
Faults come from it ſelf, and not from the Holy Spirit:
And yet it is not the Will of God that it ſhould be taken
up about the Correcting of theſe Faults, both becauſe
this would divert its immediate Attention from God, and
make it loſe the Divine Light, and withal his immediate
Force and Power is ſeen in its Weakneſs.</p>

               <p>The Doctor wilfully miſtakes her Meaning in the other
Paſſage he cites,<note place="margin">D. C. Nar. p. 36, 37.</note> (<hi>Light of the World,</hi> Part 2. <hi>Conference,</hi>
17. p. 128, 129,) and keeps out of the midſt of it, that
which clears it moſt. She makes not a Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a Doctrine as from of a prophetical Spirit,
and as immediately from God, as he would inſinuate,
but that what God thought fit to declare more darkly
by the Prophets, now about the time of their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment,
he declares them more manifeſtly, with ſuch
Clearneſs and Reaſons, as bring along with them their
own Evidence: And that he communicates now a Light,
not of prophecying things to come, but of ſhewing the
approaching and preſent Accompliſhment of what has
been foretold already. <q>The Prophecies, ſays ſhe, of the
Antient Prophets will all of them very ſhortly be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled;
there is no need of any longer having obſcure
Prophecies, becauſe we are fallen into the laſt Times,
wherein all the Prophecies ſhall ceaſe, and we ſhall ſee
them all entirely accompliſhed, and we ſhall not receive
any more new ones; becauſe the King of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
will himſelf, govern his People, and will give an
entire Accompliſhment to all that has been propheſied
of him; ſo tho', Sir, you ſhall not need to ſay, that
you hold theſe Truths from a Prophet, becauſe the Work
does always bear witneſs who the Workman has been.</q>
Thus <hi>A. B.</hi> in the midſt of the Paſſage which the Doctor
has cited. No doubt when the Doctor began this <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
he reſolved to be Ingenuous, and to curtail no Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
that might qualifie her Meaning. But when he writes

He is a Proteſtant Miniſter whom Providence has diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:94808:200"/>
from the exerciſing of his Office, by the Diſſolution
of his Congregation, through the Miſeries of Wars; he
has a ſound Mind, a ſolid Head, a clear Underſtanding,
a penetrating Reaſon and Judgement, a cheerful Temper,
and a ſincere Mind: He is not wedded to any Party or
Perſon, farther than they are united to the Truth as it is
in Chriſt Jeſus; he values the Writings of <hi>A. B.</hi> becauſe
they contain the true Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt reſcued
from the falſe Gloſſes of corrupt Nature, and becauſe her
Life and Spirit were conformable to her Writings; he
moſt firmly believes and adheres to all the Articles of the
Chriſtian Faith, and labours to have them tranſcribed in
his Heart and Life, and values no other Sentiments nor
Reaſonings but as they tend to promote the Intereſts of
Chriſt's Goſpel. The unjuſt and unaccountable Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
given of him by the Narrator and his Friend,
have made me give you this Character of him, and that
this is a true one, his Writings are irrefragable Evidence;
which whoſoever diſparages, betrays only the wrong ſet
of his own Heart and Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>As for that Letter which has given Occaſion to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
haſty Excommunication of him, and made him
inconſiderately rank him with <hi>Mahomet, Ebion,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus;</hi>
it ought to be conſidered,</p>
               <p>1. That it was in a manner extorted from him, by one
who ſome time before, had gone over to the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and becauſe his Change was diſaproved by <hi>A. B.</hi>
being enraged at her, endeavour'd to divert well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Perſons from hearkning to the Truths of the Goſpel
contain'd in her Writings, becauſe it was not foretold in
the Holy Scriptures, that God would communicate his
Graces to a Woman, for the <hi>Renovation of his Goſpel Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
M. <hi>Poiret</hi> upon this Occaſion applied himſelf to ſhew
both the Abſurdity and Falſeneſs of the Exception, which
otherways, it may be, would never have entered into his
Mind.</p>
               <p>2. That the Doctor here again falls into his ordinary
Method, of connecting very diſtinct Paſſages together,
and leaving out that which would put them into a right
Light, as is evident from the Letter it ſelf, and falſly
tranſlating ſome part of it, as that <hi>Adam ſome time after
his Creation, had brutal Inclinations;</hi> for there is no ſuch
Expreſſion there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:94808:200"/>
3. That M. <hi>P.</hi> conſiders the thing only in, <hi>Theſi,</hi> what
Evidences the Scriptures give of God's purpoſe and deſign
to make Womankind the Inſtrument of his Light and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to the World, when the other Sex, Man, through his
Pride and Wiſdom, had rendred himſelf uncapable of it.</p>
               <p>4. That if the Narrator had been ſo juſt as to have ſhewn
the Principles upon which M. <hi>Poiret</hi> proceeded, I am ſure
no candid Reader would have ſubſcribed the Doctor's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.

Prophecy, by making a Woman his Organ or Inſtrument

that deſerves Excommunication, as a Blaſphemer, and a

turns away from the Love of God: and this is very far from
either.</p>
               <p>5. The Doctor ought to treat others with Meekneſs and
Charity, and Equity, leſt he himſelf be tempted, and fall
into the ſame Condemnation with which he unjuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches

others.<note place="margin">D. C's Eſſays, <hi>part 2. pag.</hi> 163, 164, 165.</note> When he conſiders the Reaſons why God
was pleaſed to permit Sin, which is ſo diſagreeable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſo pernicious to his Creatures, he tells us, <q>God
has not concealed from us the Reaſon of this Conduct;
his own Glory is the End of all, and by Sin his Glory is
exceedingly manifeſted. As he manifeſted the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of his Power by creating many things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
ſo he demonſtrates the infinity and vaſt wonderful
reach of his Wiſdom, in that he can bring Good out of
Evil. How could we have known God's wonderful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
his Meekneſs, Long ſuffering and Forbearance,
and his ſtrict and ſevere Juſtice, in diſtinguiſhing the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Perſons and Things, if Sin had not entred into the
World? What adorable Inſtances of Love, Mercy, and
Goodneſs, would have been wanting, if Sin had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
occaſion for them? If Sin had not happened, where
would there have been place for the Mercy of God? Who
would have dream'd of the ſtupendious Love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Mankind? It might have been ſuſpected, without
Sin, that God, and all other things, were under ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable
Fate; but now it appears that he is free, that he
can do what he pleaſes, and that all things are managed
by his Wiſdom. If the Revelation of the Goſpel be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,</q>
God has had more Honour, and been more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by the Fall of Angels, and the Sin of Man, than by
the Creation of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have ſtaid long, ſays he, upon this; but it is pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
ſeeing the importance and intricacy of the Subject
required it; and ſeeing ſome have written Volumes upon
this alone, which very few have cleared to Satisfaction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſum, you ſee, of the Doctor's Reſolution is,
That God decreed and reſolved to permit Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the World, becauſe by his way of managing it, it
would tend moſt to his Glory, and his Perfections and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
would not have been ſo conſpicuous without it.
<hi>Father, forgive him, for he knows not what he ſays.</hi> I doubt
not but the Doctor has written all this with a good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but upon the matter it is Blaſphemy with a Witneſs,
and a very unfit Reſolution for convincing of the Atheiſts
and Deiſts. <hi>Non ipſa peccata</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin) vel ipſa

deſpiſes, do clear the Myſteries of Providence far more to
the Honour and Glory of all the divine Attributes, and to

a Parallel drawn up by <hi>A. B.</hi> betwixt her and Jeſus Chriſt.
his Miſrepreſentations and Miſtakes lie in this, That ſhe calls
it a Compariſon not a Parallel, there being a great difference
between theſe two. In how many publick Sermons have
the Sufferings and Virtues of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr been
compared with thoſe of his Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Will it be
ſaid that the Preachers intended to make a Parallel betwixt
them, or to make Jeſus Chriſt the Type of him? 2. The
Compariſon is between the <hi>ſecond</hi> Birth of Jeſus Chriſt, or
the renewing of the Church, and his <hi>firſt</hi> Birth; and not
betwixt him and <hi>A. B.</hi> He may ſpeak, as ſhe ſays, out of a
Buſh, or out of an Aſs, but his Spirit is ſtill to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through all; ſhe is but the Organ, the Inſtrument, and
the Conduit; but the Spirit, Life, and Power, the living
Waters, and the pure Truth, come from Jeſus Chriſt.
3. Tho' there were no more but this one Expreſſion in the
Compariſon, it were enough to ſhew how far ſhe is from
making a Parallel as to what relates to her ſelf: <hi>The Child
Jeſus,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>gathered Diſciples after him: the ſecond alſo
will draw a great number of perſons to be Diſciples of the firſt.</hi>
4. There are few ſerious Chriſtians, who do not believe
that there will be a renewing of the Church of God before
the End of the World, and that Jeſus Chriſt will live in her
by his Light and Spirit. Now there being a great Analogy
in the Works of God through the ſeveral Ages of the World,
a prudent ſerious Chriſtian will not ſcoff at the making a
Compariſon betwixt the <hi>Renovation</hi> of his Goſpel Spirit in
the World, and the firſt eſtabliſhing of it.</p>

it as much the ſubject of his Scorn and Raillery, that it

when he is in his Majeſty, for then he lays furiouſly
about him. The Author of <hi>The State of the Philadelphian

and Scorn, tho' what he ſaid ſtands good after all that the
Doctor hath yet replied. The Doctor ſays, that the <hi>Church

ſame Foundation, nor reſolve their Faith by the ſame Rule,
yet themſelves ſay they do it; <hi>viz.</hi> by the divine Authority
of the Scriptures, and the Practice of the pureſt Ages of the
Church: which was all the Poſtſcript affirmed. What that
Author ſaid of the internal Light of the Spirit of God, being

Enthuſiaſtical Deluſion and Impoſture, and made appear
to be ownd by all the Reformed Churches, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I am ſorry that the Doctor
ſhews himſelf ſuch an Enemy to the Grace and Spirit of
God, as to flout at it, and to ſcoff at Authors and Writings
which he does not know. There are many who look upon
the Writings of <hi>A. B.</hi> as excellently repreſenting the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
of Chriſtianity, yet they do not believe her other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

many ſerious Perſons, to turn them away from that
by which they might reap unſpeakable ſpiritual profit to

gave me Ground to make the following Reflections,
which I ſhall impart to you with all the Succinctneſs that
is poſſible for me, and you may judge of the Juſtice and
Reaſonableneſs of them: 1.<note place="margin">1. H. judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, condemns himſelf.</note> Whatever Comments Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts

to interpret the Language of theſe Diſpenſations.
However, I find, the Doctor<note n="*" place="margin">Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 2.</note> himſelf, notwithſtanding
the Cenſure he paſſes on the bold and temerarious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of Enthuſiaſts, to know the ſecret Reaſons of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videncial
Occurrences, ſcruples not to fall a gueſſing and
even determining of the Intent and Meaning of that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
which hath lately befallen himſelf. He is very
ſuſpicious that <hi>A. B.'s.</hi> Diſciples may have entertain'd ſome
ſecret Triumphs in their Boſoms on the Account of his
being forced to retreat to <hi>Holland,</hi> and is at ſome pains to
abate the Joy of theſe imaginary <hi>Jo Poeans.</hi> But for any
thing I know, he is out in his Conjecture, and might have
ſpared himſelf the Trouble of what he wrote on that
head. I very much doubt, if our being put in more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious

Such generals go well away with every Party. It
is the Juſtice of their Application that will be diſputed.
Yet I queſtion the Truth of ſome of his general Maxims;
ſuch as, for Inſtance, that true Piety, like Gold, is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
every where, and at all times. I am ſure it was not
ſo in the Days of our Saviour and his Apoſtles. The great
thing that hath engaged his Zeal in this Attack, is his
ſuppoſed Diſcovery of <hi>Errors, Hereſies,</hi> and <hi>Deluſions.</hi>
The mutual Charge of pernicious Doctrines, is what hath
ſet the ſeveral Sects by the Ears. The Doctor indeed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
his Charge againſt <hi>A. B.</hi> to a very great height,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:94808:204"/>
affirming that the whole Scheme of her Principles hath a
Tendency contrary to the Chriſtian Conſtitution. This
Aſſertion, I know, will oblige ſome to tell him, that it
would ſeem he had not yet well digeſted his Thoughts on
that Matter. However, if he ſolidly evince this, he will
do a great Kindneſs to many, who for the Preſent think
that they are not wholly ignorant of the Deſigns and
Tendency of the Chriſtian Conſtitution. In the mean
time, the Doctor modeſtly acknowledges that he is not
infallible.</p>

that neither the Virgin, nor any other Saint, was
ſo much honoured by the Roman Church, as <hi>A. B.</hi> is by
her Followers. Now I preſume that one of the greateſt
Inſtances of Honour, paid by that Church to the Virgin,
is their making Addreſſes t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> her frequently, and in
theſe ſame Terms that they do to God himſelf. And ſince
the Doctor tranſlated that Paſſage in M. <hi>de Cort</hi>'s Letter
concerning <hi>A. B.</hi> thus, <hi>No Body makes Prayers to her,</hi>
was it not reaſonable to infer, that he intended his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſhould believe that <hi>A. B.'s</hi> Friends paid the like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to her? I am ſure a great many Readers took
it in that View: However, now he retracts it, yet I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how he comes to call his Tranſlation of the Paſſage,
a literal and cloſe one, which indeed is none at all. The
Words are theſe—<hi>Et maintenant, dans les Affairres pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,

               <p>4.<note place="margin">4. Not juſt in making of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</note> I think the Doctor doth not ſufficiently diſcharge
the Cenſure that the brings in <hi>Num.</hi> XIV. It ſuppoſes
that there are a great many good things in <hi>A. B</hi>'s Life
and Writings, and certainly there are, and to a far greater
number than the things that are more ſingular, and not ſo
agreeable to all. And why might not theſe have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to make up, at leaſt, ſome Strokes of her Picture? But
the Doctor will needs have her to be abſolutely Black and
Deformed, and is very angry that all others do not think
of her as he does. There are ſome Faces and Shapes, that
to ſome, appear very agreeable, which others imagine to
be full of Deformities and Unhandſomneſs, and they will
pick Quarrels at every Part and Lineament, tho' really
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:94808:205"/>
there may be no juſt Ground for ſo doing, and the true
Reaſon of the Diſlike may be the falſe Meaſures which
Men have ſet up in their own Fancies, whereby to judge
of either Natural or Moral Beauties.</p>
               <p>5.<note place="margin">5. Makes a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie where there is none.</note> The Doctor, in my Opinion, ſtates the Controverſie
very invidiouſly, <hi>p.</hi> 14. <q>There is a Debate, ſaith he, whether
<hi>A. B.</hi> is to be preferred before Fathers, Prophets, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles?
<hi>A. B.</hi> never claim'd to any ſuch Preference,</q> ſhe
owns and honours theſe Holy and Eminent Perſons, as
the Meſſengers of God, and the Organs of his Spirit. She
acknowledges the Doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets
to be the Standard of all other Doctrines, and of her own
too. All which might be verified from an Hundred and an
Hundred Paſſages of her Books; And why ſhould the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
be peremptorily aſſerted?</p>
               <p>6. I wiſh from my very Soul that the Doctor's <hi>Remarks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A. B</hi>'s Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable for their Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and Diſintereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs.</note>
p. 15. were true, namely, that what is good in <hi>A. B</hi>'s Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
is handled and recommended in every Practical
Treatiſe, and is the Subject of almoſt daily Sermons. But
I am afraid, it will be found not with that Plainneſs,
Simplicity, and Diſintereſtedneſs; for we have the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Graces and Vertues, ordinarily ſo cruſted over with
the fulſome Varniſh of a gaudy Eloquence, or ſo blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and diſpirited by the Flatterings, Conſtructions, and
Gloſſes put upon them, that we neither ſee them in their
true Beauty, nor feel the Divine Force and Vigour of them,
but have them with any Face our deceived Fancy pleaſes
to put upon them, and being almoſt brought into any
Compliance with our corrupt Natures, ſo as they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
bettered by them. The Doctor in my Opinion is
Injurious to <hi>A. B</hi>'s Friends, in repreſenting them to the
World, as egregious Undervaluers of Sermons. Such as
preſs and urge the great Deſign of our Religion, they dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
value, and I believe the Doctor himſelf will pay no
great regard to theſe Diſcourſes that are meerly calculated
to recommend the petty Intereſts and little Opinions of a
Party, as if they were the great things, the Cauſe of God,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or that are viſibly the Product of Vanity and Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Indeed the Names of <hi>Reſignation</hi> and <hi>Self-denial,</hi>
are not new, yet I believe the Import of them may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to not a few. And I doubt not but vaſt numbers,
who pretend to look into the Scriptures ſeriouſly enough,
are ſtill ignorant of the Nature of them, and inſenſible of
their Obligations to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:94808:205"/>
I wonder extreamly how the Doctor could forget that
falſe Notions of Religion do oftentimes draw ſuch a vail
over the Underſtandings of Men as hinders them from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Import of the Duties of the Goſpel. The
frightful and tragical Expoſtulations that I meet with in
this and the following Page, are, I muſt ſay, nothing but
calumnious Inſinuations, and go all upon the wild Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
that there is a new Name, a new Authority beſides,
and above that of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles obtruded
on the World, which they whom he here Levels at, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
abhor.</p>

                  </note> The Improvement that the Doctor makes of the
Twelve Apoſtles, as being the Twelve Foundations of the
<hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> bids fair to ſeclude St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was none
of the Twelve, and gives Ground to think, that if the
Doctor had been in thoſe Days he would have entered his
Proteſtation againſt him, and cry'd out, How comes a new
one to be added, are the other decayed? Or did not God
foreſee what is neceſſary? Will Men offer to mend the Work
of God? But St. <hi>Paul</hi> built on the ſame Foundations,

               <p>8.<note place="margin">8. His Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>A. b</hi>'s Friends.</note> I would fain know upon what Grounds the Doctor
affirms, p. 20, 21. That they who favour <hi>A. B.</hi> do it on
M. <hi>de Cort</hi>'s, and M. <hi>Poiret</hi>'s ſimple Authority, and why he
accuſes them of a lazy, unreaſonable, and overhaſty Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity?
Does he think that they either wanted the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of, or did not imploy their rational Faculties and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
in this Matter, or that they were not at the Pains
of any mature and ſerious Deliberations about it? Theſe
and a great many more of the Doctor's Complements
ſeem, in my Opinion, to be pretty Rude, and to ſavour
too little of good Breeding or Charity.</p>
               <p>9.<note place="margin">9. His Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian.</note> The Doctor makes good Company with the Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian.
Yet, I think, he ought to have returned him
the Civility of the Two Illuſtrious Epithet of <hi>Ingenious</hi>
and <hi>Learned,</hi> wherewith he adorned him in his Poſtſcript,
and not to have treated him ſo coarſly as he doth. I am
of the Mind that the Philadelphian by the ſame Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on which all the Parties he mention'd pretend to ſtand,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:94808:206"/>
and by the ſame Rule according to which they reſolve the
Principles of their Faith, underſtands the Holy Scriptures.
And it is evident, I think, that theſe he inſtances in, do
pretend to reſolve their ſeveral Principles into the Word of
God, as their Foundation and Rule, whereas the Doctor,
as I take him, ſeems to mean by them, the Improvements
and Deductions which the ſeveral Parties make in their
own Favours, both from Scripture and Reaſon, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
againſt the Philadelphian in that View. I think
moreover, that when the Doctor in the heat of his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
againſt Pretences to Inſpiration, argues thus, as if
it were impoſſible or unheard of, for one to be deluded,
and yet not to be ſenſible of it, or to exclaim againſt a
thing, of which he himſelf is as guilty as any, puts a
Sword in the Hand of the Deiſts, whereof they may
very dexterouſly turn the Edge againſt ſuch as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
inſpired, ſince they who truly bore that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
did very much cry out againſt falſe Prophets, and
many of them I believe, did not juſtifie their Pretences to
Inſpiration by working Miracles. In fine, I think, the
Doctor needed not have made ſuch a Buſtle about the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of neither a Friend nor an Adverſary, ſince it ſeems
obvious, that the Philadelphian meant no more than one
who is neither a fond Friend nor a fierce Enemy.</p>

                  </note> I proceed next to glance at ſome things in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
Second <hi>Narrative:</hi> He introduces it with a very fair
Promiſe, aſſuring us that he will ſet down her own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
in her own Words, without adding to them, or
diminiſhing from them, or courtailing any Paſſages which
may be neceſſary to qualifie the Meaning of them. This,
if he keeps to it, is a very honeſt and candid Reſolution.
And indeed could he aſſure alſo, that he will put no other
Meaning on her Words but her own, nor diſtort them to
a Senſe that ſhe never intended, he might then very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
invite his Readers to depend on his Citations, without
needing to conſult her Writings. But I much doubt if
this can be expected from one who examines in the View,
and with the Deſign, that the Doctor doth: We know
that a great many, who pretend to make free and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Enquiries, gloſs or rather pervert the Holy Scriptures
themſelves in favour of their own Prejudices.</p>
               <p>That I be not uneaſie to you, I ſhall only touch on a
very few things, and by my Animadverſions on them, you
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:94808:206"/>

he pretends to be, or hath kept his Promiſe.</p>

humane Paſſions or Infirmities, a Sanctity which is next
to it, or rather the ſame with that of God himſelf. Now
let any free and diſintereſſed Spirit determine if the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
which the Doctor adduces, will amount to this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I would ask him, Is it not our Duty to have Truth,
Righteouſneſs, and Goodneſs, in all our Thoughts, Words,
and Actions? And if ſo, is it not attainable by the Grace
of God? And if <hi>A. B.</hi> by this Grace attained to ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Meaſures of them, ought that to have been made
her Crime and Reproach? Doth ſhe arrogate any Truth,
Righteouſneſs, or Goodneſs to her ſelf, as the Cauſe and
Author? Where doth ſhe ſay, That ſhe arrived at theſe
Heights of Sanctity that the Bleſſed are poſſeſſed of? For
I think that to pretend to theſe, were to aſſume to ones
ſelf a Sanctity without the Alloy of humane Paſſions or
Infirmities. But why doth the Doctor aſſert, That a
Sanctity without this Alloy, is the ſame with that of God?
Is not the Sanctity of Angels without it? Shall we then
ſay, that theirs is the ſame with that of God? Further, are
not the Actions of ſuch as are made Partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, in the Apoſtle's Phraſe, more than humane;
that is, Do they not come from a higher and more noble
Principle than what is meerly Natural?</p>
               <p>And when a Soul hath attain'd to this Bliſs, when Chriſt
is formed in him, when he is the Maſter, and Guide, and
Inſpirer of his inward Man, muſt it be accounted Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
or a Rivaling the Deity, to ſay that his Actions are
not Humane. This is certainly all that is meant by that
Paſſage which ſo ſcandalized the Doctor. <hi>A. B.</hi> owns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that by the Divine Grace ſhe arrived at great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Sanctity, but yet ſuch as others might attain to
by a faithful Dependance on that ſame Grace; and ſhe
encouraged all that converſed with her, generouſly to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
after it. What if ſhe had delivered her ſelf in the
Words of the Pſalmiſt? <hi>I am undefiled in the Way, I keep
God's Teſtimonies, I ſeek him with my whole Heart, I alſo
do no Iniquity, I walk in his Ways.</hi> Would the Doctor
have quarrelled it? Is not this the Character of every tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Righteous Perſon?</p>

The Doctor, p. 5. after a ſcornful Preamble,<note place="margin">She does not pretend to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin or Corruption.</note> brings an
injurious Aſperſion upon <hi>A. B.</hi> he will have it, that either ſhe
was born without Sin, or that Original Corruption was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured in her, and ſo that ſhe was not as others liable
to Sin, without external Temptations. How is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
Why, becauſe ſhe ſays, <q>For my part, I can ſay in
in Truth, that I do not remember I ever committed any
Faults, but when I believed the Counſel of Men: Now,</q>
if I have any Senſe, this Paſſage overturns what the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
would eſtabliſh by it; For does not our yielding to
outward Temptations, evidently ſuppoſe that there is
ſomething within us that complies with them, and what
is that but our Original Corruption? For, I think, it is
very plain, that if Original Corruption were perfectly
cured in us, there would be nothing within us on which
outward Temptations or evil Counſel could get hold. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi>'s
taking the goodly Babyloniſh Garment which he
ſaw among the Spoils, and <hi>Judas</hi>'s complying with the
Offer of Thirty Pieces of Silver, did diſcover the covetous
Diſpoſitions of their Hearts: When I believe and liſten to
the evil Counſels of another, and thereupon commit
Faults, this ſeems clearly to demonſtrate that there is
ſomething within me that likes, and agrees to the wicked
Suggeſtions that are made to me, which plainly implies
a Depravation. Very often it comes to paſs that outward
Temptations do awaken and diſcover ſome latent and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Corruption, or wicked Inclination that the Perſon
was not ſenſible of before. Doubtleſs St. <hi>Peter</hi> did not
know that latent Cowardice and Infidelity that were in
his Heart, till the outward Temptation gave him the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of them; ſo that tho' it were true that one did
never actually ſin but by means of outward Temptations,
yet it will not therefore follow that he hath no internal
Corruption, or that he is exempt from that Degeneracy of
Nature, that is common to all the fallen Poſterity of
<hi>Adam.</hi> The Doctor for all that he talks here, ſince he
reads <hi>A. B</hi>'s Books, could not be Ignorant, that ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
acknowledges the Degeneracy of her Nature, and
that ſhe was of the ſame Make and Frame with the reſt
of lapſed Mankind. Take this one Paſſage for the Proof of
it.<note place="margin">Solid Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Part 2. p. 71.</note> 
                  <q>If I had not known, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> that my own Will was Evil
and Corrupt, I ſhould never have learned to reſiſt it, ſince
there is not any thing more agreeable to our Natures than
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:94808:207"/>
accompliſhing their proper Wills.</q> To be perfectly cured
of Original Corruption, is the Privilege only of the Bleſſed.
Even they who were ſanctified from the Womb, did, while
they were in this Life, feel, and were obliged to reſiſt the
Importunities of corrupt Nature.</p>
               <p>The Doctor adds,<note place="margin">She owns her Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> That neither here nor any where
elſe, does <hi>A. B.</hi> give any Inſtances of her Faults, except
ſome Levities before ſhe was Sixteen years old; and, that
ſhe does not any where own the having Sin. I intreat that
it be remarked, That what the Doctor here diminiſhingly
calls ſome Levities, was by him egregiouſly aggravated in
his firſt Narrative, <hi>Sect.</hi> xx. Here he can find no Inſtances
of her Faults, and there he thought he diſcovered too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Here he repreſents her as no where owning that ſhe
had Sin; there he introduces her confeſſing, that ſhe had
run into a vain, light, and idle Converſation, following
the Pleaſures, Recreations, and Divertiſements of the
World. And this Scene of her Life, when he thought it
ſeaſonable for him ſo to do, he delineates in all the ſhapes of
Horror, telling us<note n="*" place="margin">1 Narrat. <hi>p.</hi> 49.</note>, <q>That ſhe ſuffered an Eclipſe for ſome
years—Pride and Ambition, Senſuality and Covetouſneſs,
prevail'd on her, that ſhe reſiſted the Spirit of God, and
walked contrary to the Dictates of her Conſcience, <hi>video
meliora</hi>—In effect, he turns her into what Forms he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</q>
ſometimes ſhe muſt be a Goddeſs, and at other times
a very Devil.</p>
               <p>I judge that it will be evident to any impartial Perſon,<note place="margin">In that very paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage cited by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> that
the Doctor hath dealt very unfairly by that Paſſage which
he cites at the cloſe of <hi>pag.</hi> 5. I ſhall ſet it down entire. <q>I
ſpent, ſays ſhe, moſt of my time all alone in my Chamber
in Prayer, and Tears, and great Grief, for my having
thus followed the [<hi>ways of the</hi>] World;<note place="margin">Vie exter. <hi>p.</hi> 150.</note> I entred upon
a very auſtere Life, uſing hard Beds, Faſting, Watching,
and wearing Sackcloth, that ſo I might chaſtiſe my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
I viſited the Poor and Sick, I frequented the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Sacraments, not knowing by what means I might
be reſtored to the Favour of God, which I had loſt by my
own Fault. I could not ſleep at night, fearing leſt I
ſhould go down to Hell, for I was afraid of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, that I dared not ſhut my eyes becauſe of
my Sins, which appeared to me ſo great, as none had ever
committed the like: not becauſe I had done any [<hi>wicked
or</hi>] evil Actions, for all Men eſteemed and honoured me;
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:94808:208"/>
but becauſe I had parted with the raviſhing Intercourſes
which my Soul had with God, that I might take my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in the Divertiſements of the World, after I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſo many Favours from God as merited my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
throughout all my Life. This Sin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to me ſo great, as Hell had no Puniſhment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to it.</q> I ſhould think it had been impoſſible for
any body, after having peruſed this Paſſage, to write at the
rate the Doctor does, without firmly reſolving to croſs all
the Dictates of Ingenuity and Candor: Is this then no where
to own that ſhe had Sin? and to juſtifie every thing that ſhe
ſaid or did? Are there no Inſtances of Faults given here?
or does the Doctor think, that following the World, or
turning the heart from God, tho' but for ſome time, and
not in the higheſt degrees, are but little veniai Levities? Are
there here no penitential Acknowledgments made neither
general nor particular? What would the Doctor have?
Are there not here ingenuous Confeſſions of very great
Faults? and a very deep and ſenſible Sorrow for them?
Doth ſhe not highly aggravate them, both as to the Guilt
they included, and the Puniſhment they deſerved? And
doth ſhe not, on the account of them, put in Practice the
Severities of Mortification and Self-denial? Is the Doctor
angry becauſe ſhe was not a greater Sinner, or would her
being ſo have recommended her the more to him?</p>
               <p>The Doctor tranſlates<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> that period,<note place="margin">He most injuriouſly miſtakes and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates ſome of <hi>A. B</hi>'s words.</note> 
                  <hi>point que J'euſſe fait
aucunes manuvaiſes actions,</hi> very diſingenouſly thus, <hi>That
ſhe had never done Evil;</hi> whereas he ſhould have turned it,
you ſee, <q>Not that ſhe had done any wicked or evil Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q>
It is manifeſt, that there is a vaſt Difference between
Never having done evil, and Not having done any wicked
Actions. The Doctor's Tranſlation, which is neither lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
nor true, though it ſerves his preſent turn, makes <hi>A. B.</hi>
pretend to an abſolute Innocence and Guiltleſſneſs; but by
the other, which is a juſt one, the Reader eaſily ſees, that
her Words import only, That ſhe had not done any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Actions that were groſs and ſcandalous. But then it
is very poſſible that one may be guilty of having done a great
deal of Evil inwardly, and in his heart, tho' he had never
committed any groſs and viſible Immoralities. And that
this is the true Senſe of the Paſſage, is evident not only
from the ſcope of this whole Paragraph, but particularly
from the Reaſon that ſhe there aſſigns, namely, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:94808:208"/>
one eſteem'd and honour'd her: they did ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they diſcovered nothing in her outward Carriage but
what was modeſt, ſober, and agreeable. And I think none
that conſider well what they read, will make any Scruple
to admit this as a ſufficient Reaſon for what ſhe aſſerted,
tho' the Doctor inſinuates ſome will. And thus tho' <hi>A. B.</hi>
refuſes that, in the Circumſtances in which ſhe then was,
ſhe had not done any Actions that were viſibly ſcandalous,
yet with the ſame breath ſhe acknowledges very penitently,
that ſhe was guilty of very great Evils in ſuffering the
World to gain Ground on her Heart. Now tho' the Doctor
promiſed his Readers at the beginning of his Narrative, that
he would give them <hi>A. B</hi>'s Pretences in her own Words,
and not curtail Paſſages; yet let any that is unbyaſs'd, judge
if he hath done ſo here, and whether the Nice and Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
have not need to conſult her Writings, and rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their own Eyes than his partial Accounts: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in fine, tho' he engages in his Letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 28. that he
will be as faithful in relating matters of fact, according to
his Knowledge, as if he were a Witneſs upon Oath; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I ſay, this Promiſe of his can be a ſufficient Security
for relying on his Teſtimony, if it be found that he falls
frequently into ſuch Inadvertencies or Miſrepreſentations as
theſe?</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſets down the Return which ſhe made to the
Charge of M. <hi>Serarius</hi> very faintly.<note place="margin">Put mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon others.</note> I will impart to you
ſome Periods of it.<note n="*" place="margin">Tomb. dela Fauſ. Theol. part 2. let. 14. p. 115.</note> 
                  <q>In effect, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> my only Fear is, leſt
I ſhould not continue faithful to my God, and I cannot
bear with them who ſay or believe, That there is a ſtate
of Perfection in this World, wherein Men are impeccable.
I look upon this as a great Error, and Self-preſumption
in them.</q> And then he tells M. <hi>Serarius</hi> how he was
preſent when ſhe rehearſed before ſeveral Perſons the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the great defection of her Youth, which ſhe here
relates again with a freſh Sorrow, and in very exaggerating
Terms, tho' the Doctor affirms that in all this Paſſage there
are no penitential Acknowledgments, neither general nor
particular. And afterwards ſhe adds, <q>
                     <hi>Or ſi je raccount ſi li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brement
comment,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Now if I ſo freely relate, how groſly
I fell from ſo exalted a State of Grace as that wherein
God had placed me from my Infancy, how can I [<hi>be
ſuppoſed to</hi>] ſay or believe that I can no more fall, ſince
what one hath once done, he may do many times?</q> And
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:94808:209"/>
after having aſſerted that no Creature can be impeccable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this miſerable Life, where there are ſo many ſtones
of ſtumbling, and inſtanced in <hi>Peter, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi>
ſhe ſays,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <q>Can I be ſo ignorant, as to believe that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> can
no more fall, or decline from the Grace of God? I am
certain I may do it every moment, if I would retire my
ſelf from my Intercourſe with God, and entertain my ſelf
with my Senſes. I know, ſo long as I remain united with
him, I cannot fall; but if I ſhould break off this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I ſhould fall the firſt ſtep I made thereafter, as a
young Child that cannot go.</q> Doth ſhe not here plainly
own her Lability, Weakneſs, and Inſufficiency, that of her
ſelf ſhe could not be without ſinning, no, not for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
that ſhe, as well as all others during this Life of
Temptations, is continually liable to Falls; and that her
only fear was, leſt ſhe ſhould diſcontinue her Fidelity to
God? But is this to arrogate to her ſelf a Sanctity without
the Alloy of humane Paſſions or Infirmities, and which, as
the Doctor afterwards hath it,<note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> is not exceeded, but only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall'd
by that of Jeſus Chriſt? It is his ordinary courſe, all
along in the Commentaries that he makes on <hi>A. B</hi>'s words,
to run into intolerable Exceſſes. In effect, the Gloſſes he
puts on them do in a great many places palpably deſtroy
the Text, and gives them a Meaning that ſhe never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
I believe the Doctor would take it very ill to have his
own Words ſo dealt by. I muſt here take notice of a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of his Letter,<note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> which ſounds as highly at leaſt, as any
that he quotes out of <hi>A. B.</hi> on the Head we are now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering.
Indeed, ſaith he, I was never ſo profane as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
my Dependance on God. Now it is certain, that one
never ſins, but when he forgets this Dependence; and to
ſay, that Sin is the forgeting of our Dependance on God, is
a very proper Definition of it. Here then the Doctor arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
to himſelf an abſolute Innocence. I know he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no ſuch thing; but yet you ſee, the words very eaſily
bear this Meaning.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now enter upon the Enquiry, into what
heights of Purity and Holineſs God may by his Grace ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
ſuch as are truly regenerate, and who continue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to him. This, I know, will fall under the Doctor's
Diſquiſition more properly afterwards: But whatever theſe
heights may be, they do not contradict that Paſſage of Holy
Scripture he mentions, nor ſuperſede the uſe of the Lord's
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:94808:209"/>
Prayer. I thought fit to diſcuſs this Section of the Doctor's
<hi>Second Narrative</hi> at ſome length, becauſe he frequently
raiſes a great deal of Duſt about what he inſiſts on in it. I
ſhall touch on a few other Paſſages more paſſingly.</p>

                  <hi>A. B.</hi> does not pretend to have made by her Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
any Additions to the Eſſentials of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
this ſhe every where diſclaims, and affirms that the
Holy Scriptures contain a full and perfect Syſtem of them:
She ſays indeed, that the things which were revealed to the
Authors of the Sacred Books more generally and more
darkly, are diſcovered to her more fully, more clearly, and
more particularly, but that they are ſuch as do not ſtrictly
concern the Eſſence of Chriſtianity; tho' alſo ſhe pretends
to reſcue even theſe things from the falſe and deluding
Gloſſes which the ſelf-flattery of Men hath put on them.
Now <hi>dato ſed non conceſſo</hi> that this were ſo, I do not ſee
that her owning of it is, as the Doctor alledges<note n="*" place="margin">a Nar. p. 11.</note>, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
her ſelf unto, or ſetting her ſelf above the Prophets
and Apoſtles; for it is certain that the Apoſtles had more
clear and more full Revelations of the Chriſtian Oeconomy
made to them than were made to the old Prophets: but I
hope by their owning this, they did not claim a preference
to them. This is an invidious ſtating of the matter: all
that can be juſtly inſerred from ſuch a Pretence is, that it
hath pleaſed God, for great and wiſe Reaſons, to manifeſt
himſelf more to one than to another; but then the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he makes uſe of hath no ground of boaſting or ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exaltation,

hath given her the favour to ſit in <hi>Moſes's</hi> Chair; and that
ſhe has more right to it than any of the Doctors or Paſtors
who now pretend to it. Had the Doctor ſet down the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to which he here refers wholly as it is, it would have
look'd with a more acceptable Aſpect than in the tour that
he gives it. In number 288 of the Book that he cites, the
Spirit of <hi>Burchardus</hi> is compared with that of <hi>Moſes. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
ſaith ſhe, exhorted and taught the People to obſerve all
the Commandments of God, whereas <hi>Burchardus</hi> affirms
that Men are too infirm to keep theſe Commandments; and
becauſe I teach that we muſt keep them if we would be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he is moved with Anger againſt me: then follows the
Paſſage which the Doctor notices,—<q>By which it appears<note place="margin">Pierre d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all his Promotion, ſeeing he teaches the contrary to what
<hi>Moſes</hi> taught, and I teach the ſame things <hi>Moſes</hi> taught,
—And all theſe Graces which God has imparted to me,
ſufficiently evince that I am by him ſet in <hi>Moſes's</hi> Chair,
by being in his Doctrine and Sentiments.</q> Where it is, I
think, very evident, that the Reaſon why ſhe aſſerts her
being in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair is not a vain-glorious Affectation of,
or pretending to a Magiſterial Superiority over others, but
becauſe ſhe taught <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Doctrine as to keeping the
Commands of God: And, in effect, all that ſhe means by
being in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair, as the peruſal of the whole Section
will convince any candid Reader, is nothing elſe but having
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s Spirit and Sentiments. Nothing of all this appears

eye upon any thing I declare unto you as coming from
God, in caſe you find my Doctrine not entirely agreeing
with the Holy Scripture.</q> Whence it is plain, that she
would have her Sayings to be tried by the Holy Scriptures,
and that the value of what ſhe ſays is to be determined by
its Conformity to them. This, one would think, is not to
put the Scriptures and her Sayings in the ſame ballance, or
to require an equal reſpect to be paid to both. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
now that he peruſes <hi>A. B</hi>'s Writings, could not but
remark this and a great many more Paſſages to the ſame
purpoſe. How comes it then to paſs, that he brings not
in theſe into his Accounts of <hi>A. B.?</hi> Why this would ſpoil
the deſign that he hath conceived of expoſing her to the
World altogether in black and horrid ſhapes. But, ſays the
Doctor, what ſhe delivered muſt be of the ſame Authority
with the Holy Scriptures, becauſe God is the Author of it.
But tho' we ſhould ſuppoſe <hi>A. B.</hi> to be truly inſpired, yet
his Conſequence will not follow: and the Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
as one very pertinently expreſſes it, <hi>Quae à Deo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedunt,
ejuſdem ſunt veritatis,</hi> &amp;c. <q>Things that proceed
from God are of equal Truth, but not of equal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for tho' ſome things may be of God, yet if any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
do not know, or doubt if they be ſuch, they have not
the ſame Authority nor Right to ſuch a Perſons Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as thoſe things whoſe divine Origin is allowed by
univerſal Conſent: altho' when it is evident to any perſon
that any thing is revealed to them by God, they are bound
to pay the ſame Obedience to things thus revealed, as to
God himſelf.</q> Several Books that are now univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the Canon of Scripture were for ſome time
doubted of in the Primitive Church: it is certain that the
queſtioned Books, tho' really of Divine Original, were not
of the ſame Authority with theſe that were by unanimous
Conſent acknowledged to be Divine.</p>

that can give the leaſt Colour to an invidious Conſequence,
he is ſure to make it ſerve his turn, but without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to that Candor that might be expected from him. Of
this we have a remarkable Inſtance, pag. 32. n. 7. I ſhall
give you the whole Paſſage to which he refers, as it is,<note n="*" place="margin">Light of the World Part 2. p. 85.</note> If,
<q>
                     <hi>ſaith ſhe,</hi> I ſhould ſay any thing contrary to the Goſpel, do
not believe me; for you ought not to believe any thing
becauſe I ſay it to you, but becauſe it is really true. And
if you knew me, you ſhould alſo know God, becauſe he
is one and the ſame Spirit in all things, ſo far as you ſhall
diſcern Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth in any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſo far ſhall you diſcern God living in them, and no
farther. So that its never good to follow Perſons for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</q>
but to follow the Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and
Truth, which you ſhall diſcover to abide in them. Now
to diſcover the Vanity of that Improvement which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
makes of this Paſſage, let it be conſidered, that when
things which import Excellency are attributed both to Jeſus
Chriſt, and to Chriſtians his Followers, it is undeniable
that we muſt alter our Idea's of theſe things according as
we differently apply them either to him or them: Our
Lord calls himſelf the Light of the World, and he is ſo
in a Supernatural manner, becauſe he is the Divine Source
and Original of all ſpiritual Light, he <hi>in whom are hid all
the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 5. 14.</note> This ſame very
Title, he gives all his faithful Followers: But will any
Body imagine that it is applied to them in that ſame Sence
in which it is underſtood of him? No ſure, for we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of them only as ſubordinate Luminaries which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all their Light and Heat from the Son of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures <hi>Timothy.,</hi> that by doing
what he recommended to him,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 16.</note> he would ſave both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and thoſe that heard him, we muſt not entertain the
ſame Idea of <hi>Saving,</hi> when we apply it to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that we
have when we attribute it to Jeſus Chriſt. Juſt ſo, tho'
our Lord uſes, concerning himſelf, Words to the ſame
Purpoſe with theſe which <hi>A. B.</hi> hath in this Period, yet
we muſt not imagine that they are of the ſame Import,
or that ſhe intended they ſhould. Indeed the very Scope
of the Paſſage plainly enough determines that ſhe meant
no more but this; if you were acquainted with me, and
ſaw my Life and Practiſe, you would ſee that I imitate
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:94808:211"/>
and tranſcribe in my Converſation, the Divine Qualities
of Truth, Righteouſneſs, and Goodneſs; for God who
by his Holy Spirit, works uniformly in all his Children,
imprints theſe Characters of himſelf on them all, and as
much of theſe as you diſcern in me, ſo far do you diſcern
God in me, and your ſeeing me exemplifie them before
you in a lively manner, will be an Inducement to you to
imitate them, and ſo to know God truly; for then we tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know God when we imitate his Perfections. If the
Doctor had not been viſibly in a Diſpoſition to Cavil, he
would not have put a Gloſs on this Paſſagess that it cannot
bear, without doing it open Violence, nor omitted what was
ſo evidently neceſſary to qualifie the Meaning of it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I divine, what but this could have moved him
to imagine that the Paſſage which he here cites, do import
that <hi>A. B.</hi> aſſerted ſome kind of unaccountable Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and her. I can ſee no Union that ſhe can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, but to be taught, guided, and influenced by his
Spirit. And will he call this an uncouth thing? How can
he digeſt that Paſſage of St. <hi>Paul, He that is joined to the
Lord is one Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such an invidious Tour he gives<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> the Paſſage that
follows,<note place="margin">Second Inſtance.</note> as if <hi>A. B.</hi> diſdained that her Doctrines ſhould be
publiſhed as from one of a prophetical Spirit; that was
too mean, ſaith the Doctor. Now the Peruſal of the very
firſt Period of it, even as it is curtail'd by himſelf, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
diſcover the Fallacy:<note n="*" place="margin">Light of the World Part 2. Conf. 17. p. 128, 129</note>

as the Ancient Prophets were, who ſpoke of very
obſcure things.</q> Whence it is plain, that the Reaſon why
ſhe denies her ſelf to be Prophetical, was not, becauſe
ſhe declined that Character as too mean for her; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Prophets delivered themſelves in dark and obſcure
Terms, God, ſhe pretends, enabled her to ſpeak of Divine
Things more clearly and more diſtinctly, and that this is
her Meaning, the laſt Clauſe of the Paſſage abundantly
evinces. <q>There is no need, <hi>ſaith ſhe,</hi> to ſay that I have a

Decrees to have been made from all Eternity, neither is
the leaſt Ground given him from the Paſſages he here cites,

Subject. I intended indeed to have gone through the

Performance in brief, there are ſome things, that to the beſt
of my Thoughts, he exceſſively aggravates, ſome he pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably
miſrepreſents, and in other ſome he is down right
miſtaken. He charges <hi>A. B.</hi> with a great many ill things,
he imagines that he hath evinced the Truth of the Charge,
and upon this Suppoſition, which I muſt needs ſay is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious,
he heats himſelf into a Tranſport, and falls a pelt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her with the moſt opprobrious Language that an
angry Zeal is wont to inſpire. He ſatisfies himſelf that
to juſtifie the Rudeneſs of this Treatment, it is ſufficient
to tell his Readers briskly,<note place="margin">2 Nar. p 55.</note> 
                  <hi>Who ſhould hinder the thruſting
back with Contempt and Scorn, an overforward and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Arrogancy, one who without any Reaſon, without any
Warrant, Divine or Humane, demands a Place above Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
or Apoſtles, and all who were truly inſpired; nay, who
inſults over Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, aſſumes the Honour and
Power that he has been in Poſſeſſion of from the Beginning
of the World, and who pretends to be more competent to carry
on a Victory over the Devil and his Train?</hi> If the Grounds
on which the Doctor builds theſe Aſſertions be not yet
ſolidly eſtabliſhed, I think he begins his Triumph too ſoon,
and if he believes really that they are, then, in my Opinion,
he needs not be at the pains of writting any more <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;</hi>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:94808:212"/>
for enough is already done to beget in the Hearts
of all honeſt Chriſtians, an eternal Horror and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of <hi>A. B.</hi> It is beyond Contradiction plain, that no
Body can adopt theſe Poſitions without an open and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
Renounciation of Chriſtianity. The Doctor indeed
acts a very pretty Play, but it ends tragically enough to
ſome. <hi>A. B.</hi> and ſuch as favour her, are brought on the
Stage as formally diſclaiming the Redeemer of the World,
as diveſting him of his unqueſtionable Prerogatives, and
cloathing a mad Woman, a Viſionary, with them. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this is the moſt bloody and criminal Charge that can
be laid at the Door of ſuch as profeſs the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
this is to repreſent them as having turned downright
Apoſtates from it, as trampling under foot, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
afreſh, the Divine and Adorable Author of it. But
then if this dreadful Accuſation be falſe and illgrounded,
if they, againſt whom it is brought, do infinitely deteſt
ſuch an abominable Villany, if they ſet no Perſon on the
ſame Level with the Son of God, but would appear againſt
ſuch ſacrilegious Pretences with as much Zeal as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
himſelf, if they own that no Victories can be obtain'd
over the Devil and his Train but only by the Almighty
Grace and Power of Jeſus Chriſt, and that he alone, and
none other, is competent to triumph over the Powers of
Darkneſs; and in fine, if they adhere to the Foundations
of the Apoſtles and Prophets, and to Jeſus Chriſt the chief
Corner Stone, and diſclaim, as falſe and unſound, what is
not built thereupon and conform thereto, I ſay if theſe
things be ſo, as moſt certainly they are; How can the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and Spreader of ſuch injurious Calumnies, excuſe
himſelf from a Degree of Uncharitableneſs, that cannot
be well parallelled? To act the Scene in a Corner had not
look'd ſo very ill natur'd, but to act it publickly before
the Face of the whole World, and thereby to expoſe theſe
he levell'd at as much as in him lay, not only to Contempt
and Deriſion, but alſo to Hatred and Perſecution, is ſuch
a Flight of Zeal, as, in my Judgment, cannot pretend to
the Qualities of peaceable and gentle, eaſie and impartial.
But did not the Doctor engage to give us <hi>A. B</hi>'s Pretences
in her own Words? Where then doth ſhe pretend to be
more Competent to carry on a Victory over the Devil than
Chriſt himſelf?<note place="margin">Lette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Prophets, and all truly inſpired Perſons? Muſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Men irrecoverable, becauſe they will not be reduced
from their ſuppoſed Errors by Noiſe and Banter? All, to
the beſt of my Underſtanding, that <hi>A. B.</hi> pretends to, is
only to be an Inſtrument in Chriſt's Hands, and that no
otherwiſe than by publiſhing theſe Truths, that he by his
Spirit communicated to her, and which his Power and Grace
alone was afterwards to make effectual. Now let it be
ſuppoſed, but not granted that it was ſo, What Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is it to our Redeemer, to make uſe of a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Creature in order to accompliſh great Deſigns?
Was it any Diſhonour to him, that his Apoſtles in his
Name and Power, converted more to the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and wrought more Miracles than he did himſelf,

have been fortified from any proſpect of Reputation or
worldly Intereſt. But whatever my Prejudices may be,
I can ſincerely declare, that what determined me to have
an Eſteem for this Perſon's Writings, was a Conviction,
that they not only recommended the great and eſſential
Duties of the Goſpel, diſtinguiſhed them from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſories,
diſcovered the Miſchief of Sects and Parties, and
the Vanity of laying Streſs on nice and airy Speculations,

might ſerve as an Antidote againſt the Infuſions of
Atheiſts and Deiſts, Pelagians and Socinians, Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Fataliſts, and falſe Pretences to Inſpiration. And
tho' I met with ſome things in them that ſeem'd a little

become like to Man in Nature, to become his Equal in
Condition, not preferring himſelf to the meaneſt Men; to
converſe and be familiar with them as their Brother and
Companion; yea, he ſubjects himſelf unto, and obeys Man
that he might gain his Friendſhip, he ſerves him, even to
the waſhing of his Feet, and tho' Man offend him, he
prevents him always with Friendſhip; lets a <hi>Judas</hi> kiſs

And what ſhall we have after having ſatisfied all our

we cannot live without LOVE, Why do we not love

forſaking its Faithful BRIDEGROOM, who loves
it ſo perfectly, and who has done ſuch admirable things
to engage it to his Love, yea to conſent only to let it ſelf
be loved by him according as he deſires; but that it ſhould
thruſt away from him to love and cleave to the Earth,
Winds, Metals, Fleſh and Blood, how depraved is its
Judgment! Which makes me often ſigh, when I ſee this

Of PRAYER, wherein it conſiſts. Of ſet Prayers and
Exerciſes, and their Uſe. Of CONTINUAL
PRAYER, its Nature, the abſolute Nec ſſity of it for
overcoming our Enemies, both unvard and outward; for
obtaining the Grace of God, for attaining unto Perfection,
and how to perſiſt in it, without Interruption.</head>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>SInce you have reſolved to deny your ſelf, and no longer to
follow your Senſualities, you have need of <hi>Continual
Prayer,</hi> that you may be enabled to perform you good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.
For when the Devil has once had Power over a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and made him love and follow his Senſualities, he does
not eaſily depart from him, not being willing to quit the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
of which he has once been Governour; but he keeps it
by force, and againſt the Inclination of the Perſon who would
thruſt him out of it: ſo that he muſt oppoſe him by force.
It is of ſuch Devils that Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>That they go not forth
but by Faſting and Prayer:</hi> not that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
had not Grace from God powerful enough for caſting out
all ſorts of Devils; but when they have once gained a Power
over the Will of Man, and he has conſented to all the Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
of the Devil, he will not go out but by the force of <hi>Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Prayer,</hi> ſeeing he has gain'd the Man's Soul by <hi>Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities
and the Neglect of Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. He muſt of neceſſity be thruſt out by means directly
contrary to thoſe which he has made uſe of for getting entry
into Souls. When they have obeyed the Devil in following
the <hi>Senſualities</hi> of corrupt Nature, they muſt afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the ſame Senſualities by <hi>Faſting and Abſtinence;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they will never caſt out this ſort of Devils. And if they
have <hi>hearkned to the Temptations of the Devil</hi> inſtead of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations
of the Holy Spirit, there is a neceſſity of continual
Prayer to caſt forth this kind of Devil, ſeeing he has continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
entertained the Spirit with <hi>vain Thoughts,</hi> the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:94808:217"/>
muſt <hi>entertain</hi> it ſelf <hi>continually</hi> with God, otherwiſe it can
never thruſt out this kind of Devil.</p>
                  <p>3. And therefore I exhort you unto CONTINUAL
PRAYER, that you may overcome this Enemy of your
Soul, and chaſe him out by the help of Prayer, which is a
powerful Armour againſt all the Furies of Hell.</p>
                  <p>4. In the mean time I muſt ſhew you what PRAYER is,
before you can perform it aright; for we often take ſome fine
words that we have read, or heard of others, to be Prayer, as
in this Country they uſe to read or ſing Pſalms when they
would pray, and in other places they ſay ſo many <hi>Pater No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
Ave Maria</hi>'s, or ſome other Prayers written in ſome
Books, or they learn the words, that they may repeat them
when they would pray.</p>
                  <p>5. All this ought not to be termed Prayer, ſince theſe words
and theſe Pſalms may be ſaid without making any Prayer to
God: and that one may pray in ſaying Pſalms, he ought to
have the ſame DESIRES which they had who made them,
and to ſay the ſame words with the ſame Deſire that they had
in ſaying them; otherwiſe, this cannot be PRAYER, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
idle Words, which do not profit: yea, by theſe Words
Men do often reproach God, or they utter Lies or Mockings.
For to ſay a Pſalm of <hi>David</hi> which he uttered when he was
penitent, when he faſted and prayed waſhing his Couch with
his Tears, while they who ſing theſe things are very often fill'd
with Wine and delicious Fare, ſpending whole Nights in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot
and Luxury, is not this to mock God, and to lie in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?
So do they alſo who ſay the Lord's Prayer, or any other
Prayers, without having Deſires ſutable to the Words which
they pronounce.</p>
                  <p>6. They will ſay that God is <hi>their Father,</hi> without being
willing to obey him as Children. That <hi>his Name be hallowed,</hi>
while indeed they diſhonour and deſpiſe him, loving rather
their own Will and Honour than God's They ſay, <hi>Let his
Kingdom come,</hi> when they deſire nothing but to reign in this
World, where they would wiſh ſtill to live, if God would
give them Proſperity. And by word they ſay, <hi>His Will be done
on Earth, as it is in the Heavens,</hi> while they will not reſign
themſelves to the Will of God in any thing, but endeavour
to accompliſh their own as much as is poſſible for them. And
while they pray to <hi>have daily Bread,</hi> they labour and ſtudy to
have Abundance, and maugre God, they will needs have
more than the daily Bread for which they pray. They pray
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:94808:217"/>
likewiſe, <hi>That he would forgive them their Sins,</hi> while they
love them, and will needs go on to commit them more and
more every day. And, <hi>That he would deliver them from evil,</hi>
while they purſue and do the Evil from which they ſay they
would be delivered. And while they pray to God, <hi>That he
would deliver them from Temptation,</hi> they feed it, follow and
obey it.</p>
                  <p>7. Behold how Men do mock God by ſuch Prayers, and
lie in his Preſence! I do not therefore deſire that you pray
after this manner, for it avails nothing; and you cannot
thereby obtain the Grace of God, but rather a greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
for God will not be mocked, and he takes no
pleaſure in vain Diſcourſes. He only <hi>ſearches</hi> the Reins, and
tries the Conſciences, being the <hi>Searcher of hearts,</hi> and not
the Hearer of our feigned words. The Goſpel likewiſe tells
us, <hi>That we muſt not pray as the Phariſees, who thought to be
heard for their much ſpeaking,</hi> and adviſes <hi>to ſhut our door when
we would pray to our Father in ſecret,</hi> aſſuring us, that our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knows what we have need of, without our much ſpeaking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. It is not then theſe kinds of Prayers to which I export
you, my Child, but unto CONTINUAL PRAYER, which
muſt ARISE FROM THE HEART. Every moment you
have need of Strength and Aſſiſtance from God to reſiſt the
Devil, the World, and the Fleſh; and tho' you have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to overcome them, yet in effect you do it not, but you
are often overcome by them. You ſtand in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> then of <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Strength,</hi> which you cannot obtain but by Prayer,
which, if you underſtood it aright, would be very eaſie, and
would become habitual to you. And as you have <hi>continual</hi>
need of Aſſiſtance from God, ſo alſo you have need of <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual</hi>
Prayer.</p>
                  <p>9. You muſt therefore embrace it, and NEVER AGAIN
LEAVE IT OFF, if you would ſubdue your Enemies;
otherwiſe you can never overcome them, but they will alway<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
tyrannize over you againſt your Inclination and Will. I doubt
not but you have often prayed to God to be delivered from
your Enemies; but theſe <hi>Paſſing-Prayers</hi> are not ſufficient
for reſiſting an Enemy ſo common (or continual) as is the
Devil, who every moment aſſumes new Vigour, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wearied in tempting and ſurprizing us, ſeeing this Enemy
is never at reſt, and never ceaſes to do evil. He will indeed
ſometimes leave us in quiet in the time of Prayer; but no
ſooner is it finiſh'd than he returns, and off times with more
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:94808:218"/>
Vigour than before: and thus he regains what he had loſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Prayer.</p>
                  <p>10. This is the Reaſon that he is never affrighted with the
Prayers that we make <hi>Morning, Evening, Before</hi> and <hi>After
Meat,</hi> or at other expreſs times which we ſet apart for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
tho' theſe Prayers be performed with Attention. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
withdraws indeed for that little time: but, as when a
Friend abſents himſelf for ſome time from his Friend, he
returns to him, from his Voyage, with greater Expreſſions of
Friendſhip than he had before his Departure, and oft-times
makes ſome new Alliance; ſo does the Devil with the Man
who gives himſelf to Prayer by cuſtom: for he believes he has
pleaſed God, after having ſaid his <hi>ordinary Prayers;</hi> and when
they are over, he lets looſe his Spirit to the Cares after earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Goods, or to take his Pleaſures and Recreations, without
minding God.</p>
                  <p>11. This is not, that I would blame Morning and Evening
Prayers, or thoſe at Meat, or any other expreſs time which
Men ſet apart for Praying; for this is commendable for thoſe
who live in the World, who being ſo diſtracted and diverted
in their Affairs and Buſineſs, if they ſet not apart certain times
for Prayer, it is to be feared that they would never find any
leiſure to think upon God: they do therefore very well to ſet
to themſelves a Rule, and to appoint an expreſs time for
their Prayers, that they may ſometimes think upon God, and
may not forget themſelves amidſt their worldly Affairs.</p>
                  <p>12. But as for the Children of God, and thoſe who tend
to Chriſtian Perfection, they ought <hi>to pray continually, and
never to ceaſe,</hi> becauſe the Devil never ceaſes to tempt them:
and the more they deſire Perfection, the more are they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
with Temptations, and they have the more occaſion
for continual Prayer; ſometimes to beg Aſſiſtance from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
ſometimes to thank God for his Graces, ſometimes to
bleſs and honour him. So that there never paſſes one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the day wherein he who obſerves narrowly the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of his Soul, has not ſome occaſion to pray unto
God. He will find it ALWAYS NECESSARY TO PRAY
CONTINUALLY, becauſe he has continual matter for it,
by the occaſions which befall us, both inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
                  <p>13. For if we converſe with Men, they ſometimes will
praiſe us, ſo as to give us occaſion of Vain-glory; at other
times they will deſpiſe us, ſo as to make us angry, or ſullen,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:94808:218"/>
or to deſpiſe or hate them: and when we have any buſineſs
with them, Avarice ſlips in, or we ſeek our ſelves. A proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Event will make us rejoyce, or will puff us up: an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
will make us ſad and melancholly: and thus a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
other Accidents which do daily befall us outwardly, do
continually afford occaſion to have Recourſe unto God by
Prayer, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eg of him his Grace, and ſtrength to uphold us
that we fall not into Sin amidſt ſo many divers Rencounters,
which do outwardly befal us, and much more inwardly. For
if we did conſider well the divers Agitations and Motions of
the Paſſions of our Souls, we would there find infinite Evils
which we muſt reſiſt. This of bridling our vicious Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is a continual Employment for him who applies to the
Perfection of his Soul; and he will find ALWAYS MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER
FOR PRAYER TO GOD, and for begging his help
and aſſiſtance, without which we cannot fight againſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
viſible and inviſible Enemies. He muſt give himſelf to
<hi>Continual Prayer,</hi> or elſe live and die their Slave, and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
miſerable.</p>
                  <p>14. I do not deſire that you ſhould have your Spirit conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
bent unto Prayer after your ordinary way; for this
would wrong your Head, and would forge a thouſand Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
which would neither be neceſſary nor uſeful. But
I would have you to call upon God always when you have
need, and to bleſs him as often as you receive from him any
Grace and Aſſiſtance, ſeeing it is an Ingratitude not to thank
him for every particular Gift that he beſtows upon us; ſince
gratefulneſs for a Benefit obtains always new Favours from
God, and he deſires that we ſhould call upon him in our
Needs, promiſing to ſuccour and help us. If God deſires
that we pray unto him, why ſhould we not do it? He ſays,
<hi>Seek, and ye ſhall find; ask, and ye ſhall receive; knock at the
door of Mercy, and it ſhall be opened unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>15. How comes it then, my Child, that you cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
your Enemies, ſince God on his part has given you ſo
many Promiſes, which on his ſide will always be infallible?
It muſt needs be ſaid, that the Failing is on your ſide; and
I cannot ſee what it can be but that of <hi>Continual Prayer</hi> which
you do not ſufficiently underſtand; and you think to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
your Enemies with your own Strength, which you will
never do. You have indeed given them power to hurt you by
your own Will; but it is not ſtrong enough to chaſe out your
Enemies. There is needful now AN ALTOGETHER
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:94808:219"/>
PARTICULAR GRACE OF GOD, WHICH WILL
NOT BE GIVEN YOU BUT BY PRAYER, and that
CONTINUAL.</p>
                  <p>16. I will tell you what PRAYER is, that you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it, fearing leſt it ſeem to you too hard to be embraced,
tho' there is nothing more ſweet and agreeable: But Mens
Imaginations make it appear difficult, yea impoſſible, to
ſome, becauſe they have never diſcover'd what <hi>Prayer</hi> is. Some
attribute it to many <hi>vocal words;</hi> others to Speculations [or
Meditations] of the Spirit, which they call <hi>Mental Prayers.</hi>
But believe me, it is neither Words, nor Speculation, that
makes Prayer. But TRUE PRAYER conſiſts in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſition
of Spirit that Man has with his God, when his heart
ſpeaks to him, and asks the things that he has need of; or
bleſſes him and thanks him for, his Favours; or praiſes his
Greatneſs, Goodneſs, Love, and the other Qualities which
Man obſerves in his God. This <hi>Elevation of Spirit,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
that he has with God, makes up true Prayer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which there can be no true Prayer, tho' they call by this
Name many divers things, which it were impoſſible that Man
could do continually, as Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>that he muſt
always pray, and never faint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. He could not have appointed Man to do impoſſible
things, as continual Prayer would be after the manner that
they would underſtand it. For if to pray, a Man behov'd to
be always in Churches, all the other things neceſſary for
the ſupport of Life would periſh, and Man would die for
want of them. And if to pray he muſt be always on his
Knees, the Body could not ſuffer this continual Fatigue. And
if he behov'd always to <hi>meditate fine Speculations</hi> in his Spirit,
he would break his head: or if he muſt ſpeak Prayers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
he could neither ſleep, eat, nor drink. So that it is
not to be believ'd that God demands of Man any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Prayer but that of the <hi>Converſation of his Spirit with
God,</hi> which may be done continually, while working, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
eating, writing, yea, even while ſleeping; ſeeing he who
has entertain'd his Spirit with God all the day long, does cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
reſt with him while ſleeping, becauſe the Spirit having
walked with its God while awake, it repoſes it ſelf likewiſe
with him when ſleeping. And uſually the vital Spirits are
full of that which they love, and that which has been ſeen
and heard in the day time, is repreſented unto the Spirit in
Sleep. So that he who converſes <hi>with his Spirit elevated unto
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:94808:219"/>
God</hi> by day, loſes very little of the ſame Converſation during
the night; and even ſometimes God communicates himſelf
unto him by Dreams.</p>
                  <p>18. By which it appears, that it is very poſſible to <hi>pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,</hi>
as Jeſus Chriſt has taught us: yea, there is nothing
more eaſie and agreeable. For my part, I could not live
without this continual Prayer, and Death would be more
ſweet to me than to be one hour out of it, becauſe all ſorts
of Pleaſures, without this Converſation, are to me Vexations,
and mortal Afflictions. For this cauſe I abide always in it,
and I do not think that you have ſeen me go out of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
to delight in other things. By which you may ſee
that it is very poſſible <hi>to pray always, and never to ceaſe:</hi> and
that it is even good and pleaſant, ſeeing he who is in this
continual Prayer is never melancholy: which you may alſo
have obſerved as to me, amidſt ſo many different Events, and
occaſions of Grief.</p>
                  <p>19. Give your ſelf therefore to this Continual Prayer, and
by it you ſhall overcome both your inward and outward Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
You ſhall have Joy and Peace in your ſelf, and you
ſhall learn all that you have need to do and avoid Do not
apply your ſelf to contemlate the great Wonders of God, or
his Conduct towards Men, nor the other Myſteries of God or
of Religion; but <hi>practiſe this Continual Prayer</hi> according to
your need, <hi>ſpeaking to God continually.</hi> If you are in Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
beg his Aſſiſtance: if you are in Ignorance, beg Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from him to fulfil his Will: if you are weak, Strength:
and if you receive his Graces, bleſs him and thank him for this
Favour done to you a Sinner. And thus you ſhall have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
matter of having <hi>your Spirit lifted up to God,</hi> in which
TRUE, PRAYER conſiſts. By this, you ſhall habituate
your ſelf by degrees to ſpeak unto God, and to converſe with
him in Spirit; and at laſt he will ſpeak unto you, and you
ſhall be here united unto him, looking for a perfect Unity in
Eternity. Which ſhe wiſhes you, who remains,</p>

That the Spirit cannot rule where the Fleſh rules.</head>
                  <head type="sub">That to him, who has mortified the old Adam in himſelf,
it is moſt eaſie to imitate Jeſus Chriſt; and that it is

                  <head type="sub">This is the 7th Letter of the Third Part of
La lum. nee on tenebr.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My dear Child,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>1. I Do not wonder that your Friends ſay, <hi>It is impoſſible
to imitate Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo long as they live according
to their Natural Inclinations; for it is a certain Truth, that a
natural Man cannot live according to the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.
He muſt be regenerated, and the old <hi>Adam</hi> muſt die in him;
for the Spirit cannot reign where the Fleſh reigns; ſeeing
they are two ſworn Enemies, and cannot agree together, no
more than Heat and Cold: This it is that makes Thunders
and Lightnings in the Air when the Cold and Heat meet
together; the ſame befalls Souls cold in Charity, when they
feel themſelves touch'd by the Arrows of God's Love, or
the heat of his Anger.</p>
                  <p>2. If it be ſaid to a carnal Perſon, <hi>that he ought to love
God with all his Heart, with all his Soul, and with all his
Strength;</hi> you ſhall ſee him preſently break out in Words,
and throw out as it were fiery Flames of Anger to maintain
that he loves God; while in effect he loves nothing but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
And if it be told him that he cannot love God while
he loves himſelf and the tranſitory things of this World, he
well let fly like Claps of Thunder againſt him who lays
before him this Truth; becauſe he neither knows nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
it, and his natural Inclinations cannot take pleaſure
in loving that which they do not ſee nor feel, ſuch as God
and eternal Things, which are inviſible to his Carnal Eyes.</p>
                  <p>2. We muſt of neceſſity die to the Fleſh, that we may
live to the Spirit, otherwiſe we ſhall never comprehend Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things: There are two Natures in us, the one is
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:94808:220"/>
Divine, and other Humane: The Divine Nature loves things
Eternal; and the Humane Nature loves things Temporal:
The Divine reſpects nothing that is earthly, and the Humane
reſpects nothing that is heavenly; becauſe each of theſe tend
always to their Centre: The Divine part in Man, aims and
tends to Divine things; and endeavours to ſerve God, who
is its Principle from whence it comes; and the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
aims and tends always to Earth, from whence it takes
its Original, and cannot be pleaſed in any other thing. This
is the Reaſon why they who live according to their Nature
ſay, <hi>That it is impoſſible to imitate Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which is
moſt true as long as they will needs continue to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Nature: For it was corrupted by Sin, ſince
which time, it can produce nothing but all ſort of Evil, it
being impoſſible for it to do any Good, or <hi>to have</hi> one good
Thought. For this Cauſe, <hi>Job</hi> had good Reaſon to curſe the
Day of his Birth; for none of the Beaſts would be ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
in their Nature, as is Man, if he had not in him a
Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>4. All muſt grant this, and ſay with your Friends, <hi>that
it is impoſſible to imitate Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſeeing he lived ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally,
having ſubjected his Humane Part to his Divine,
and made his Fleſh die that he might live to his Spirit, and
deſpiſed Temporal things that he might embrace Eternal.
But I would gladly ask all thoſe Natural Perſons, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to do the ſame things? And if they have put to Death
the old <hi>Adam</hi> in them, that is, the Inclinations of corrupt
Fleſh? And if they have labour'd with all their Power to
revive in them the Spirit of the new <hi>Adam,</hi> which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
the Senſualities of the Fleſh? Which appears by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Jeſus Chriſt, who overcame all Natural Senſualities.</p>
                  <p>5. It may be, they will ſay, that it would be impoſſible
for them to attain to ſuch a Perfection as Jeſus Chriſt had;
while they will not part with ſo much as one of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which they have for their Pleaſures or Senſualities, that
they might follow him at a diſtance: For they do not
ſo much as deſire to imitate him, far leſ to tend to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
They believe indeed by an imaginary Speculation
that Jeſus Chriſt has ſatisfied all for them; and they will not
believe by a Divine Truth that he has merited for them by
his Sufferings, the Grace, and the Power to imitate him,
becauſe they do not deſire to do it; for they love rather to
remain in the Corruption of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> than to be
quickened into the new, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:94808:221"/>
6. Thus it is that thoſe poor Souls flatter themſelves to
their Ruine, while they ſay, that <hi>they cannot imitate Jeſus
Chriſt, nor live without Sin becauſe of their great Frailty.</hi>
This is as much as to ſay, that <hi>they reſolve not to be ſaved,
and they reſolve to die in their Sins;</hi> for there are only two
ways, the one of Salvation, the other of Damnation; and
Jeſus Chriſt is that which leads to Salvation. He who will
not walk in the ſame Way in which he walked, cannot find
Life, but without all doubt ſhall die for ever. Therefore,
my dear Child, do not give way to the Diſcourſes of thoſe
poor blinded ones, who have fill'd their Underſtanding with
Errors; but walk according to the Light that God has given
you, and labour to be born again in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt
our Saviour. Withdraw from the World, ſince he ſays, <hi>that
he prays not for the World, but for thoſe whom his Father has
given him out of the World.</hi> Thoſe who are of the World,
are they who love the tranſitory things of the World, and
will not part with them to imitate Jeſus Chriſt. They are
rich in Will, and proud in Heart, loving their fleſhly Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities,
while they flatter themſelves by ſaying, <hi>that it would
be impoſſible for them to imitate Jeſus Chriſt, and to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sin becauſe of their great Frailty;</hi> which if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
aright, they would uſe means to overcome it; and he
who felt his <hi>Heart cleave to Riches,</hi> would not poſſeſs them,
but would put them far away from him, as ſome of the
Heathens did, who threw all their Money into the Sea, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leaſt it ſhould deprive them of the Liberty of their Mind:
And if a Man found himſelf <hi>ſo frail as to fall into the Sin of
Pride,</hi> he would ſhun Offices, Greatneſs, and Honours, that
he might follow the Poverty and Lowlineſs of Jeſus Chriſt
and if h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> found himſelf <hi>ſo frail as that he could not eat and
drink delicate things,</hi> without falling into the Sin of Gluttony,
he would take the coarſeſt Meats and Drink proportionably,
to ſupport the Weakneſs and Frailty of Nature, weaning it
from all Senſuality or fleſhly Apperite. But Men do not feel
themſelves too <hi>frail to iudulge their Body in all its Appetites and
Pleaſures;</hi> and they will needs make themſelves believe that
they are too frail to abſtain from Sin, or to imitate Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>7. This Sentiment is ſo Erroneous, that I would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhun'd
to refute it, were it not that I ſee ſo many Souls poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
with it, eſpecially among thoſe of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Reformati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on,
who live and die in this Belief, that Jeſus Chriſt has ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:94808:221"/>
all for them, that it is impoſſible for them to do good or
to imitate Jeſus Chriſt. This it ſeems is inculcated unto
them from the Cradle, ſince in effect we ſee that all their
practice is founded upon it, while they live according to the
Motions of corrupt Nature, and with this believe that they
ſhall be ſaved by the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, without ſtriving
to imitate him; ſince they are taught, that it is impoſſible
to do this. And tho' this is a falſe Theology, yet every one
follows after it, leaning upon a broken Reed.</p>
                  <p>8. For that Man of whom I ſpoke to you formerly, ſaid,
that it was impoſſible for him to do any good Work, yea, to
ſay the Lord's Prayer with Attention, no more than they
with whom he convers'd, whom he had often ask'd, if they
could ſay it, with Attention; and they all anſwered, they
could not. It is to be remarked that they were Merchants of
great Trade and Spirit, who found out all ſort of Inventions
for gaining of Money with great Dexterity and Care, and
their Spirit was not diſingag'd for ſaying the Lord's Prayer
with Attention: For where their Treaſure was, there was
their Heart; and the Attention cannot be perfect in two ſo
contrary things at the ſame time; but if they had purg'd
their Souls from coveting earthly Goods, and as carefully
applied their Underſtanding to ſpeak unto God, and to hear
him, without doubt they might not only have ſaid the Lord's
Prayer with Attention, but might alſo have attention ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
upon continual Prayer, which Jeſus Chriſt has ſo much
recommended to us, ſaying, <hi>that we ought always to pray, and
never to ceaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. But thoſe poor Ignorants think to pleaſe God with fair
Words as they pleaſe Men, by ſaying, <hi>that they are too frail
to do any Good, far leſs can they imitate Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for theſe
Excuſes will condemn them: For if they were truly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of their Frailty, they would avoid the Occaſions of Sin,
and uſe the Means of Poverty, Humility, and Patience,
that they might imitate Jeſus Chriſt; for he did nothing
when he was upon Earth but that which another would do
that were animated with the ſame Spirit that he was: For
the ſame God has through all the ſame Power, and can do
by the Body and Spirit of other Men, that which he did by
that of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>10. For in as much as he is God, his Power is not limited,
provided that Man give no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>indrance to it by his Free-will:
So that if one at preſent did ſubmit his Will to that of God,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:94808:222"/>
as Jeſus Chriſt did; he would certainly feel the ſame Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Divine Vertues that he felt in his Soul, and would
likewiſe do the outward Miracles that he did, if there were
need for them; for the Spirit of God is not leſſened, and his
Power was not limited to the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt only,
ſeeing he ſays, <hi>that his Delight is to be with the Children of
Men.</hi> He does not ſpeak of one ſingular Man, but of all
Men who ſubmit their Wills to his, and renounce the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> to be cloathed with the new,
which is Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>11. Thoſe will find ſufficiently by Experience, that it is
very poſſible to imitate Jeſus Chriſt, yea, that it is eaſie and
agreeable when they are denuded of that old <hi>Adam:</hi> For
Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſays, <hi>that his Yoke is eaſie, and his Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
light.</hi> This Truth it ſelf cannot lye, that it ſhould be
true that it is impoſſible to bear this Yoke: But carnal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
do certainly lye, while they ſay, that it is impoſſible to
imitate him, ſince he did nothing as Man but that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Man may do, being poſſes'd with the Holy Spirit; for

Men, and promiſes <hi>to give his Holy Spirit to them that ask it.</hi>
His Promiſes are infallible, the Scripture aſſures us of this,
ſaying. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my Words ſhall
not paſs away,</hi> bringing the Compariſon <hi>of an evil Father,

                  </p>
                  <p>12. Truly, my dear Child, I can ſcarce reaſon more to
make appear thoſe Truths, which are ſo clear. I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of them ſeveral times, and they ſtill bring me new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to maintain the Corruption of our miſerable Times,
wherein Men have invented ſo much ſilly Stuff, whereby to
flatter ſuch as themſelves, and to make them live and die in
the Sentiments of corrupt Nature, falſly perſwading them
<hi>that they cannot attain to the Perfection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that
they may not uſe any Endeavours to attain to it; for it
would be in vain to endeavour that which is impoſſible.
Therefore we ſee Men to the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y of one another, give up
themſelves to Paſtimes take their Pleaſures, and heap up
Riches, as if they were created for this, looking for Salvation
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:94808:222"/>
as it were in Recompence for their Sins: Which is very ſad,
and will make many to be deceiv'd at Death, who in this Life
think that they are good Chriſtians, becauſe they have not
committed the groſs Sins of Theft, Whoredom, or Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,
and have frequented Churches and Sacraments,
prayer much, and given much Alms: All this will avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
before God, if we are not animated with the Spirit of
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>13. For God will know no Men but thoſe who at Death
ſhall be cloathed with the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, which is
Charitable, Humble, poor in Spirit; in ſhort, adorned with
all his Vertues; and to be a Chriſtian, one muſt imitate him,
as he himſelf has ſaid: For his Doctrine is not a Hiſtory to
be read or heard out of Curioſity; but is all Leſſons
which we muſt retain to put them in practice, elſe we ſhall
falſly bear the Name of Chriſtian, which ſignifies no other
thing but a Perſon dead to the Fleſh, to live unto the Spirit;
or one who has renounced the Corruption of the old <hi>Adam,</hi>
to live renewed into the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>14. It is far more ſafe to believe that Jeſus Chriſt, by his
Death and Sufferings, has merited for us the Grace of dying
to our ſelves, that we may live unto him, than to believe
that he has ſatisfied all for us, while we reſt upon this falſe
Pillow, abiding in the Sentiments of our Nature, eating,
drinking, and doing all other things according to our Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities.
This <hi>is the broad Way that leads to Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there are who walk in it;</hi> but you, my dear Child,
take the narrow Way that leads to Life, even tho' there be
few that walk in it. Every one will bear his own Burthen.
If your Friends will not walk in it, leave them rather than
follow them, ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>that we muſt can off the
Member, or pluck out the Eye that offends us;</hi> and that <hi>he
who leaves not Father, and Mother, Wife, and Children, for
his Names ſake, is not worthy of him.</hi> I do not require of you

That God does not pardon Sin without Penitence.</head>
                  <head type="sub">To the ſame: Wherein is declared that Men fall every Day
of new into Adam's Sin, turning away from God to
love the Creature, and that they can never be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <opener>
                     <salute>My dear Child,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>1. I Wonder how it is poſſible that your Friends ſhould
ſay, that I reject the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and that
I do not look upon them as the Means of our Salvation; ſeeing
that I do not look for Salvation for my ſelf but by the Merits
of Jeſus Chriſt, who came into the World to redeem us,
after that we had been all loſt by Sin, and by it ſold and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up into the Power of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>2. For Sin is no other thing but a turning away from God
to turn towards the Creature. The Angels did firſt thus turn
away, when they ſaw themſelves ſo Beautiful and ſo Perfect,
they were pleaſed in themſelves deſiring to be like unto God:
And thus they became Devils, Enemies of God, and of all
his Works, looking on them with Envy and Jealouſie, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
as much as was poſſible to deſtroy and corrupt them.
Therefore the Devil tempted Man as ſoon as he perceived his
Creation, that he might hinder the Deſigns which God had
of taking his Delight with him; and Man, by the Inſtinct
of the Devil, turn'd away from his God to regard the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in regarding of which he coveted and lov'd them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Prohibition of his God, thus withdrawing himſelf
by his Will to cleave to the Satisfaction of his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which we do yet daily.</p>
                  <p>3. And this turning away from God is call'd Sin, which
brought forth Death to the Soul of <hi>Adam,</hi> and to all Men
in him, ſeeing <hi>Adam</hi> had in his Loins all the Men that are
ſince, or ſhall be born by his Seed in Generation: And by this
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:94808:223"/>
means all Men have periſh'd in him, having contracted the
Corruption that we do yet feel in our Nature; for tho' God
did pardon <hi>Adam,</hi> and Men in him, his Sin as to the guilt;
yet he did not remove the Miſeries of Spirit, and the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Fleſh, which the ſame Sin had brought upon him; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
even to this Day we feel Inconſtancy, Ignorance, and
Wickedneſs in our Spirit, and Corruption, Pains, and Death
in our Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>4. God cannot have made all theſe things; ſince they are
Evil, and he can do nothing but Good, being himſelf the
perfect Goodneſs, from which no Evil can ever proceed; but
he has left to <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity, the Miſeries which
their Sin had brought forth, that thereby Penitence might be
done for it during this Life, which is our time of Trial: For
ſeeing the Juſtice of God could not promiſe the Pardon of
Sin without Satisfaction, it was needful by a ſtraight Juſtice
that the ſame Fleſh which had taken Pleaſure to turn away
from him, ſhould likewiſe ſuffer Pain that it might return
unto him.</p>
                  <p>5. But Men, ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> inſtead of accepting of this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,
and ſuffering willingly the Miſeries of this Life, to
ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, rebell'd againſt him, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to charm their Miſeries; by ſtriving to reject Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and to take their Delights inſtead of Penitence, and
thus they ſtraied more and more from God, ſo that at laſt
they quite forgot him to delight in themſelves. God of his
Goodneſs raiſed up Prophets from time to time, as <hi>Moſes</hi>
and others, to withdraw Men from theſe Errors: He gave
them Laws and Ordinances that they might diſcover their
Sins and amend them by returning unto him, and repenting
that they had forſaken him; but very few heard his Voice, and
many hardned their Hearts, choſing rather to adhere to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and follow their Senſualities, than willingly to take up
the Penitence ordain'd by God for this ſhort Life; ſo that all
Men in general have at laſt corrupted their Ways, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
according to the Concupiſcence of the Fleſh, in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs
of God, and thus have all merited Damnation, and
that incomparably more than <hi>Adam;</hi> ſince he fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d God,
and repented how ſoon he heard his Voice, not daring to
appear before him out of great Confuſion for his Sin.</p>
                  <p>6. But Men after him, have voluntarily damn'd themſelves,
and given the Devil Power to rule over their Souls, whom
they do inſenſibly obey more than God: for while they follow
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:94808:224"/>
their natural Will, they do indirectly follow that of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
ſeeing theſe two Wills of the fallen Angels and of Men
are equally rebellious againſt God: and thoſe Men who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Will of their corrupt Fleſh, may be well called <hi>the
Devil's Angels;</hi> for one is always his Angel whoſe Will he
does: if he ſubmit his Will to God's, <hi>he is the Angel of God;</hi>
for <hi>Angel</hi> imports Subject or Obedient. Thoſe Men who obey
the Law of the Goſpel, are the Angels of Jeſus Chriſt: for
this Cauſe the Scripture ſays, that <hi>the Son of Man will come
attended with his Angels,</hi> which are not pure Spirits, according
to the Angelical Nature, but Men who have followed the
Will of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>7. This being ſo, he may be well call'd our Saviour; for
if he had not come at laſt into the World, all Men had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.
He alone is the Foundation of our Salvation ſince
Sin; and I confeſs before all Men, that the Light of Faith
teaches me that I could not be ſaved without the Coming of
Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth; and I will always aſcribe my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Merits of his Sufferings. So far am I from reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, as your Friends do blindly believe. And I have
much more reaſon to ſay that they reject the Merits of Jeſus
Chriſt, ſince they ſay that they have not Grace to imitate Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, while they look only to the Power of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Nature, without making uſe of his Sufferings, which
have merited for us the Grace to be able to imitate him, yea
to obtain the Perfection of God himſelf, if we will apply his
Merits to our Soul, and let his Spirit fill it, ſince Truth it ſelf
ſays to us, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</hi>
Jeſus Chriſt will require nothing of us that's impoſſible, no
more than his Father; but he ſays, <hi>Seek, and ye ſhall find;
knock, and it ſhall be opened to you; ask, and ye ſhall receive.</hi>
This does not teach us that we cannot attain to the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Jeſus Chriſt, but even to aim at that of our heavenly
Father.</p>
                  <p>8. Remark well, <hi>my dear Child,</hi> the Sentiment of your
Friends, and you will find that it cannot come but from the
Devil; and this under a good Pretext of aſcribing their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt. For if they truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that his Sufferings have merited for them the Grace
of God, they could not in Truth ſay, that they are too weak
to imitate Jeſus Chriſt; ſince this Grace of God gives ſtrength
to the Weak to overcome the Corruption of our Nature,
from which we ought never to ask Advice if we may
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:94808:224"/>
imitate Jeſus Chriſt: For if his Apoſtles and Diſciples had
ask'd Advice from their Wives, their Children, Fathers, and
Mothers, Brethren and Siſters, undoubtedly they would not
have counfell'd them to forſake them that they might follow
Jeſus Chriſt; ſince no man hates his own Fleſh, which ſeeks
its own Advantages: ſo that if the Apoſtles, and Diſciples of
Jeſus Chriſt had ask'd Counſel of their Fleſh, and their Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
if they could follow Jeſus Chriſt, they would never have
been Apoſtles nor Diſciples, ſeeing without the Grace of God
we can do nothing but know our Frailty and Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>9. But ſince Jeſus Chriſt is come into the World to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
us unto his Father, and to bring us back to him by his
Grace, there is no longer any cauſe of Fear on God's part.
We may do what we will, by the aſſiſtance of this Grace,
which is never denied to him who ſeeks and asks it; ſo much
the more that Jeſus Chriſt is come to merit it for us by his
Sufferings, but not to merit Salvation for us while we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to cleave to our corrupt Nature: by which we may ſee
clearly the Falſhood of that Doctrine, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt has
ſatisfied all for us, after the manner that ſo many underſtand it;</hi>
for this makes them ſleep the ſleep of Death: ſince they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the Grace that Jeſus Chriſt has purchas'd for us of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to embrace the means by which we may overcome the
Fleſh and live unto the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and imitate his Virtues, that hereafter we may follow
him in Eternity, where none ſhall enter but he who ſhall be
cloathed with the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>10. This is that of which I was deſirous to warn you, for
fear that you let your ſelf be deceived by falſe Appearances,
hearing thoſe poor blinded ones ſo often repeat, that Jeſus
Chriſt has ſatisfied all for us, and ſay that I reject his Merits
by teaching that of neceſſity we muſt imitate him if we would
be ſaved. This might well ſurprize ſome weak Spirits, who
would think that they did Honour to Jeſus Chriſt in ſaying
that he had merited all for them, and that they are too weak
to endure any thing. But this cannot ſurprize one of ſound
Judgment, who will very clearly perceive that I eſteem the
Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, ſince to them I aſcribe my eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                  <p>11. For if Jeſus Chriſt had not interpoſed with God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for our Reconciliation, never any Man had been ſaved,
ſince every one of them would have turn'd away from God to
cleave to their natural Sentiments, of which they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:94808:225"/>
Idolaters, to love them with all their heart, as they were
obliged to love God, having chang'd the Love of God into
that of our fleſhly Senſualities. Of neceſſity there behov'd
to be a MEDIATOR between God and Man to make this
RECONCILIATION, and to obtain the PARDON of ſo
great a Fault.</p>
                  <p>12. We were all guilty of High Treaſon againſt God, and
juſtly condemn'd to eternal Puniſhment, unable to deliver
our ſelves from it, having loſt the Grace of God, and become
his Enemies: There was nothing to be hop'd for on our part
for obtaining <hi>Mercy;</hi> for we even knew not our Miſeries, ſo
far were we from having Strength to help them, or Aſſurance
to beg of God his Grace, whoſe Enemies we had made our
ſelves by our Sins. There was no ground of hoping for Mercy
by our ſelves; therefore JESUS CHRIST, as our Advocate,
undertook our Cauſe, and procur'd this <hi>Pardon,</hi> not as the
Ddvocates at the Tribunals of this World, who plead that
they may gain Money; but as a divine Advocate, who aims
at nothing but his Father's Glory. He offers to pay himſelf
the Penalties due to our Sins, that his Father might in juſtice
pardon the Guilt of them, and take us again into his Favour,
which he has aſſuredly obtain'd; for Light and Grace have
been given us by Jeſus Chriſt, otherwiſe no body would ſee
from whence he had ſtrayed by Sin, nor whether he had gone
by the forgetting of God.</p>
                  <p>13. It is the Light only which Jeſus Chriſt brought upon
Earth that has made us ſee both the one and the other: for
after that he had obtain'd the PARDON of our Sins as to
the Guilt, by his Merits only, who was innocent, and ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf to Sufferings and to Death, that he might recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
us with God, and deliver us from the Power of the Devil,
to which we had voluntarily ſubjected our ſelves; this bowed
the heart of God, to ſpeak after our way, and forc'd his Will
unto Mercy towards us. This Grace was grace was granted unto us by
God only for the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, of his Death, and his
Sufferings, without our Intervention: So that Jeſus Chriſt
may for this be truly call'd our Saviour; for he alone has ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us from the death of Sin, and recover'd us from eternal
Damnation, into which we had miſerably fallen through our
own Fault and our Sins: for it was impoſſible for Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
himſelf from ſo grievous a Fall.</p>
                  <p>14. He would have remain'd to all Eternity in his Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without remedy, ſince he ſaw not <hi>the means</hi> by which he
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:94808:225"/>
might be re-united to his God: But Jeſus Chriſt brought
Light unto them when he came into the World, and has
made them ſee by his Deeds and Words the things which had
withdrawn them from God, and what things they muſt do
that they may return unto him: for he was not ſatisfied to
<hi>have obtained Grace</hi> for them, but he would alſo <hi>procure their
Salvation,</hi> which cannot be obtain'd without the co-operation
of our own Will, becauſe we are created by God free Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
He cannot take back that which he his once given.
So that tho' God was able to create us of nothing, without
our own Will, before we had a Being, yet we cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
without the co-operation of this Free will which he has
given us; for <hi>Adam</hi> could not be ſaved after his Sin without
his accepting of the Penitence due unto it: even ſo Jeſus
Chriſt cannot ſave Men by the Merit of his Sufferings, and of
his Death, if they will not take the Remedies for their Evils.</p>
                  <p>15. He is indeed the Phyſician who prepares Phyſick for
our Souls, and takes it himſelf in our preſence; but if we will
not ſwallow it our ſelves, it will have no operation upon us:
This we ought well to conſider, if we would know how Jeſus
Chriſt has ſuffered for us, and how his Merits will be applied
unto us: for, to believe fooliſhly that the Merits of Jeſus
Chriſt will ſave us, without our co-operation, is a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Miſtake, ſeeing God could not pardon the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi>
who had committed but one Diſobedience, without obliging
him to ſo long a Penitence, how could he ſave us who have
committed ſo great a number of Sins, unleſs we will embrace
for them the Sufferings which Jeſus Chriſt has taught us,
ſince the Scripture aſſures us, by Jeſus Chriſt, that unleſs we
do Penitence we ſhall all periſh.</p>
                  <p>16. How can we refute this Truth by ſaying, <hi>That we are
too frail to imitate Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> This is directly to reject his
Merits, ſince they have merited for us <hi>Pardon, and Grace to
amend our Sins, and to do Penitence for them.</hi> They who after
ſo many Favours ſay that they are uncapable to imitate him,
deſpiſe his Merits, and will not have them applied unto them,
rejecting them as inſufficient to give them ſtrength to do
well; which is falſe: for there is nothing wanting to us on
God's part. He ſays, <hi>Be faithful in few: things, and I will ſet
you over many things.</hi> We have received by Jeſus Chriſt the
Light of Truth, which is not a ſmall Grace, ſince by it we
can diſcern Good and Evil, and in what ſtate our Soul in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="436" facs="tcp:94808:226"/>
17. If we were faithful in this Grace of Knowledge, we
would obtain that of amending our Faults, and reſiſting
Vice; and after being faithful to this Reſiſtance, we would
obtain Grace to renounce all together, the Inclinations of our
Nature, and to die unto the Old <hi>Adam</hi> that we might live
unto the New, which is Jeſus Chriſt. This is to have no
Faith nor Belief in Jeſus Chriſt; for if we did believe that he
has merited for us the Grace of God by his Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
it would be impoſſible to ſay or believe, that we are
too frail to be able to imitate him.</p>
                  <p>17. Your Friends reject my Sentiments, as if I rejected the
Merits of Jeſus Chriſt; and they do not ſee that it is they
themſelves who do indeed reject them, while they ſay that they
eſteem them. This cannot proceed but from a great blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Spirit, that they do not ſufficiently-diſcover it; and
in this they are much to be lamented, ſince they cannot be
ſaved in this Belief, becauſe <hi>Faith without Works is a dead
Faith,</hi> in which while they remain, they will never obtain
Salvation, ſeeing a living and operative Faith is neceſſary,
which cannot be recovered but in the imitation of Jeſus
Chriſt; for otherwiſe no body can recover the Grace of God,
which he has merited for us, for thoſe only who will embrace
the Goſpel Law, for it only teaches us how to return to God,
and points out all the things which have withdrawn us from
him.</p>
                  <p>18. If the Goſpel Law did not tell me that <hi>I must be poor
in Spirit,</hi> I would never have known that the Goods of the
World could withdraw me from God; and if the ſame Law
did not tell me that I muſt be <hi>humble in Heart,</hi> I would have
remained in the Pride in which Nature begot me; and if the
ſame Law did not teach me that <hi>I muſt deny my ſelf, take up
my Croſs, and follow Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I would never have known
that the Love of my ſelf drew me away from the Love of God,
or that my natural Inclinations did incline me to Sin: I
would never have done Violence to them that I might take
the Kingdom of Heaven by force; but having learned in the
School of Jeſus Chriſt the Truth of my Duties, I will follow
them, and walk in the Light that he has purchas'd for me by
his Sufferings, and will not lean upon the Opinions of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, who take Lies for Truth; for I know well, that for
me the Goſpel Law was made, and that without the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of it I cannot be among thoſe whom the Father has
given unto Jeſus Chriſt, and for whom he prays unto his
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:94808:226"/>
Father. I hope you alſo will be of that number, my dear
Child, that having been in this World united in the Spirit
of Jeſus Chriſt, we may be united together with him for ever.

thoſe ways which they will needs chooſe for their Damnation.
I will not ſay, my dear Child, that you walk in this way of
Damnation, ſince you have an effectual Deſire to be ſaved,
and to accompany me: But you are yet travelling towards
the World which is not as yet crucified in you; you do not

troubleſome to you in RESOLVING TO WALK
ALONE; and you give me more trouble to oblige me to
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:94808:227"/>
follow you, in travelling towards the Earth and Temporal
things, where I cannot accompany you without continual
Strife and Debates; for there is not a temporal Action or
Word which is not blameworthy in this way that leads to
Eternity: For I ſhould no ſooner hear you ſpeak of things
which reſpect the Earth only, but I would reprove you for
them as idle Words and unprofitable for Eternity. And if
by your Actions you ſhould labour for earthly things, I would
complain of your Employ, and reckon your Labour to be
vain.</p>
                  <p>5. You ſee how I would be a Burthen to you, and you
would be inſupportable to me. And therefore our Journey
would be melancholly and troubleſome both for you and me,
and worſe than that of two Perſons who did not underſtand
one another by Signs nor Words. Nevertheleſs your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
does not offend me, for I love it becauſe of the good
Deſires which you have; neither will I reprove you by way
of Correction or Reproof, but out of good Inclination for
your Perfection; which I love as my own. But your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will feel Troubles thereby, which perhaps would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
to you, or would wrong your Health.</p>
                  <p>6. For I YIELD IN NOTHING TO NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE,
knowing well that it is corrupt, and begets all
ſort of Sins, which kill the Soul, and make it loſe a Bleſſed
Eternity: Of neceſſity we muſt contradict it and deny all its
Deſires; or otherwiſe it will lead us to all ſort of eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
which few Perſons do conceive. For we ſee every one
follows his own Will without thinking that he does Evil,
for they do not ſufficiently perceive that our SELF WILL
BRINGS FORTH ETERNAL DEATH,
as in Truth it does; which I ſee by the Eyes of Faith. And
Jeſus Chriſt has alſo taught us it when he ſays, <hi>that he who
does not deny himſelf cannot be his Diſiple.</hi> I cannot find
more expreſs Terms to make Man underſtand that he muſt
not follow his own Will, but abſolutely deny it all that it
asks. Nevertheleſs, we ſee that the beſt enclin'd now adays
think themſelves happy that they can follow their own Will,
which is always enclin'd towards earthly and tempo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al things,
and never towards Eternity, which is unto it inviſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible.</p>
                  <p>7. For this Cauſe I can never Accompany one who travels
towards the World, and follows his own Will: I muſt ſtill
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lk alone, ſo long as I ſhall not find others, being <hi>like a
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:94808:228"/>
deſolate Widow,</hi> who has no Companion, nor Conſolation in
this World; which is even very grievous to Nature: Becauſe
it is always ſociable, and is pleas'd with the Society of thoſe
like to it, which I have not as yet met with in this World,
having being always obliged to travel alone, for I have found
none to joyn my ſelf unto, tho' I have ſtill ſought after
them, and inform'd my ſelf, where are THOSE SOULS
WHICH TRAVEL TOWARDS ETERNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY,
without having hitherto diſcovered any.</p>
                  <p>8. I have convers'd with the Religious and Devout Perſons
of our ſide, and have found them all ſeeking after earthly
things; for if they ſtudy and preach, it is to recommend
themſelves to Men, or to get their Living. And ſecular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who are engag'd in the Practice of Phyſick or in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing,
do all to gain Money, or to acquire Honour and
Pleaſure in this World: So that none of thoſe can accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
me in the way to Eternity; and therefore I muſt walk
alone, or turn backward to the way of the World: Which
I will never do, chooſing rather to die alone in the way of
Salvation, than to follow a croud in the way of Perdition;
ſeeing the great number of the damned would never eaſe
my Pain, but rather encreaſe it by the encreaſe of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of damned Souls.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I will continue in the way to Eternity, tho' I
ſhould travel ALONE in it even to Death, chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be alone with Jeſus Chriſt, than in a great Company
with the World and Hell. I know indeed, my dear Child,
that you do not deſire to follow the World or Hell; but in
effect you ſtill follow them ſo long as you yet ſeek any other
thing than Eternity. You think you will not ſeek any other
thing, ſince you have reſolved to quit the World: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, ſo long as you yet ſeek <hi>to pleaſe Men,</hi> and that you
are afraid <hi>to diſpleaſe them,</hi> you are ſtill in the way of the
World: And ſo long as you take pleaſure here in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
or <hi>Proſit</hi> of the World, you cannot reliſh the Delights
or the Repoſe of Eternity. And if you have yet an Eſteem
for <hi>Wealth,</hi> it is certain you are not come to the Knowledge
of eternal good things, for theſe make one always to deſpſe
earthly Goods, finding them to be vain and unworthy of our
Love.</p>
                  <p>9. By which you may certainly diſcern if you are in the
way of Eternity, or in that of the Earth and Time; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as your Aims and Deſigns tend unto the one or the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:94808:228"/>
other. This is a general Rule for ALL Men of the World,
by which they may meaſure if they are in the way to a
BLESSED ETERNITY, or in that which leads unto
a MISERABLE ETERNITY, by examining if
their Cares, Deſires, and Affections are towards earthly
things, or indeed towards things Eternal.</p>
                  <p>10. Not that one muſt live in Idleneſs in this World, for
he ought continually to <hi>labour</hi> in it, to accompliſh the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that God has enjoyn'd us. But our Labour ought to
reſpect Eternity, the Glory of God, the Salvation of our
Soul, or that of our Neighbour; and all that is without this,
is Evil. For if one labour for this World, he receives here
the Recompence of his Labour; and therefore he has no
more to pretend to for Etern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty. For otherwiſe, God would
not be juſt; ſeeing he who has laboured that he may gain
Money, having gain'd it, has received the Reward of his
Labour, and has no Right to pretend to any other thing;
for he deſired no other thing. If you labour that you may
get an Office, and you obtain it, your Labour is well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by the obtaining of that Office. If you labour in
Traffick and Buſineſs, that you may gain Money, and if this
ſucceed according to your Deſires, you muſt not look for any
other Recompence but the Money that you have gained. If
you ſtudy that you may accompliſh your ſelf before Men,
you are rewarded by the Praiſes which they give you, and the
Eſteem they have for you. You ſee all that a Perſon can
pretend to who labours for the Earth and for Time. God
cannot in Juſtice give him a <hi>Bleſſed Eternity,</hi> when his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
have no other End but the Earth, towards which he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
all the Days of his Life; as we ſee all Men do now, and
they think themſelves Wiſe and Happy when they dextrouſly
ſeek after their Advantages in this World: For he who does
it not, is deſpiſed by them, and look'd upon as a Fool.</p>
                  <p>11. This is the way in which all Men do travel, wherein
it would be impoſſible for me to follow or imitate them; for
I look upon all theſe things as Follies and Amuſements of
Satan. For what can it profit a Man if he attains to ſome
Office or Benefice, or that he has heaps up Money that he may
take his Delights in this World? Death puts an end to all;
and the Praiſes of Men which he has acquired by improving
himſelf, are nothing but a blaſt of Wind, which drives away
the Aſhes of our Corruption by forgetfulneſs out of their
Memories: And the poor Soul finds it ſelf deprived of
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:94808:229"/>
eternal Glory, which it can never recover after this tranſitory
Life, which is the only way to a bleſſed or miſerable Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
It is a Folly and Deceit to hope for it. He muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himſelf with the Earth, which he lov'd; and with Men
whom he deſired to pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>12. Behold, my dear Child, what Recompence the
Earth and Men can give them for all the Services which they
ſhall render them; nothing but the Pain and Sorrow of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced to abandon them, and Remorſe of Conſcience for
having ſought after earthly things, and travelled towards a
deceitful and tranſitory World. For my part, I ſee all theſe
things as clear as the Sun; I will therefore deſpiſe and forget
them, that I may think only upon durable Goods, whcih will
never end. If you will accompany me, you may do it; for
God has created you free, <hi>placing you between Fire and Water,
that you may chooſe which you pleaſe beſt.</hi> The Fire will
warm you with a Deſire of having Riches, Pleaſures, and
Honours in this World: And the Water will make you to
embrace Penitence, that you may reſiſt the Devil, the World
and the Fleſh, which are the Three Enemies of your eternal
Bliſs. You have already taken up a Reſolution to travel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Eternity, and to quit the way of the World; which
in effect you do not as yet perfectly do. Therefore you cannot
accompany me, until you ſhall be altogether free from earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Goods, and ſhall have quitted the Deſire of pleaſing Men:
For theſe things would always make you ſtumble in our
Journey.</p>
                  <p>13. For ſometimes a Man muſt loſe or ſpend earthly
Goods upon Occaſions reſpecting Eternity; which would be
troubleſome to you ſo long as you have yet any Affection for
theſe Goods. And in the way to Eternity we muſt often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
Men. Therefore Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>that he who would
pleaſe Men, is not his Diſciple.</hi> And elſewhere he ſays, <hi>that
he came not to bring Peace upon Earth; but War between Father
and Son, Brother againſt Brother, Husband againſt Wife,</hi> &amp;c.
to ſhew that he who would travel towards Eternity, muſt
fight againſt all thoſe who travel towards the World, even
tho' it were againſt his neareſt Kinsfolk and Friends.</p>
                  <p>For if one would ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ken that he may pleaſe them, he will
never arrive at Eternity; for they will ſtill hold us in the way,
without coming to the End. For our neareſt Relations are
the moſt powerful Enemies that we meet with in travelling
towards Eternity, when they will not accompany us; we
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:94808:229"/>
muſt therefore quit the Deſire of pleaſing them; for this
Cauſe Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, that <hi>he who forſakes not Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Siſters, Brethren, and all things for his Name, is not
worthy of him.</hi> Whereby he ſhews what Foundation of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
thoſe ought to have, who would travel towards Eternity.</p>
                  <p>14. They ought <hi>firſt of all,</hi> to offer unto God all the Goods
which they poſſeſs, to be employed only for his Glory, and no
longer according to our Deſires, or that we may follow our
Senſualities. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Man muſt leave off the Deſire of
pleaſing Men, ſince in pleaſing them of neceſſity he muſt
diſpleaſe God; becauſe their Deſires are altogether different
from thoſe of God, and reſpect only their own Intereſts;
and therefore they cannot approve that we ſhould abandon
the World, and its Riches, and Pleaſures, of which they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
ſo long as we poſſeſs them to ſatisfie them. You ſee why
it is that we muſt loſe their Friendſhip, if we would have
God's, and undertake this War into which Jeſus Chriſt is
come to engage us againſt the Fleſh and our neareſt Relations.</p>
                  <p>15. People think that it is well done to preſerve Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them; which I grant ſo long as they will travel with
us in the way to Eternity. There is nothing more deſirable
in this World than Peace and Concord between Friends and
Neighbours. But when they detain or hinder us from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
towards Eternity, we muſt break that Peace, which
ominates nothing but the Wrath of God. For it is one of
the Signs of his laſt Plagues; <hi>when Men ſhall promiſe to
themſelves Peace and Security, then</hi> (ſays the Holy Spirit) <hi>is
the Time of their utter Ruine.</hi> Thus it befalls a Perſon who
undertakes to travel towards Eternity, and will maintain
Peace with thoſe who yet travel towards the World. We
muſt declare WAR againſt them, if they retard or hinder
us from advancing towards Eternity; for their Friendſhip is
not ſo conſiderable as our Eternal Salvation, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give us, but they may ſerve as a mean of our Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For theſe two Points, <hi>the Love of Riches, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to pleaſe Men,</hi> have been the Occaſion of the Eternal
Ruine of a great many, even well-meaning Perſons.</p>
                  <p>16. For ſo long as we have yet an Affection for earthly
things, we cannot travel towards Eternity. We muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
free, and aſpire only after our bleſſed Country, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
for our Neceſſity the leaſt that is poſſible for us of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, that we finiſh our Voyage; the leaſt of Honour,
of Offices, of Money, of Apparel, of Meat and Drink, that
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:94808:230"/>
we can. And with this we ſhall indeed travel together to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Eternity, adn chearfully perform the Voyage. For
tho' we ſhould find in our way Labours, Cares, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Perſecutions, Contempt, Reproaches, Priſons, or
Death; all this will ſeem Light to us in the Hope of that
Eternal Bleſſedneſs. For if he who travels after the World,
thinks himſelf happy in gaining Money by his Pains, Cares,
or Labours; how much more ought he who looks for the
Eternal Reward in travelling towards Eternity. He will
be loth to ſtop to gather up the Sand of Gold and Silver,
which would be very heavy to him in travelling towards Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
I adviſe you therefore to caſt it far from you; and
then, I will take you by the Hand, that we may the better
accompliſh our Journey. In expectation of which, I remain</p>
