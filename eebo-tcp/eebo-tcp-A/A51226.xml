            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T would not be eaſie for men with little Temptation to be drawn into great Sins, if they were fully perſwaded that God was preſent, did behold the Affronts they were put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon him, and would call them to a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60079:3"/>
ſtrict account for them: Neither would good Chriſtians be ſo affrighted with the remote appearances of danger, and ſink ſo quickly under Affliction, had they a firm belief that God was ever nigh them, and ready to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ſupport them.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Holy Perſons who accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to conceive God always preſent, as they dread doing the leaſt evil, or neglecting any part of their Duty, ſo the moſt terrible and cruel Attempts of the Wicked, cannot make them withdraw their Dependance upon the Divine Providence, or renounce the hopes they have in God's Mercy: So that the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Security which does appear in bad men, and the unreaſonable and groundleſs Fears to be found in ſome Chriſtians, do both chiefly proceed from their want of a hearty Perſuaſion of the Omnipreſence of God, who obſerves their whole Behaviour, and will certainly puniſh Sinners, but protect and preſerve his Servants.</p>
            <p>Nothing then will more ſuppreſs Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and diſmay and terrifie Sinners, than frequent Meditations upon the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and nothing would ſo uphold our Spirits in all Conditions, as to let it be our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60079:3"/>
daily Practice to think of the unerring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, which diſpoſes all Affairs and Events by wiſe Rules, and ſends Good or Evil to men according as the circumſtances of their preſent ſtate do require, and ever with a deſign to make them the better thereby.</p>
            <p>If therefore men did believe that God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the World, and ordered all the Affairs thereof, they could not aſcribe the iſſue of things to their own Power, and look upon the Proſperity of their Condition to be the effect alone of their own Wiſdom and good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement. Neither would they think that thoſe Pains, Loſſes, and Calamities came by Accident and Chance, which God ſent on purpoſe, either to try their love, or to reform their Manners, or to puniſh their Sins for an example to others.</p>
            <p>It muſt much abate the Bitterneſs of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Loſſes, to be convinced, that they who are humbled under them, who bear them meekly, and dutifully do ſubmit to the Pleaſure of God, will thereby greatly improve the Graces and Virtues of their Soul, and ſhall receive ſome extraordinary Bleſſing from the hand of God, the reliſh of which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60079:4"/>
will be much heighten'd by their paſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. So as in due time they ſhall ſee good reaſon for that Calamity, which was at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo grievous unto them.</p>
            <p>They then who think God does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf in the Affairs of the World, nor regard the Lives of Men, can never truly Reverence him, nor Worſhip him ſincerely; but whereever there is a vigorous belief of Providence, it will always be followed with the Love and Fear of God.</p>
            <p>That therefore in the courſe of our Lives, we may ſet the Lord before us, and direct our Deſigns to his Glory, that we may uſe the Goods he gives us, diſcreetly and temperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and when he afflicts us, that we may be patient, quiet, and humble, and without Murmur or Complaint, make an entire Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of our ſelves, and of all we have, unto his Righteous Will, that we may be grateful for his Mercies, and <hi>in all our ways acknowledg him,</hi> and think of him; I ſhall take leave to propoſe theſe following things to your Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That nothing can come to us through the whole Courſe of this Life, without the Order or Permiſſion of Providence.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60079:4"/>(2.) That we ſhould ſometimes receive Evil from the Hand of God as well as good, is very agreeable to his Wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That if we equally conſider things, God's Goodneſs and Mercy will appear in our greateſt Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That nothing can come to us through the whole courſe of this Life, without the order, or at leaſt, the permiſſion of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. When God had made the World, he did not leave it to ſhift for it ſelf, without any farther regard of it: But his Power does as truly appear in the Preſervation and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, as it did in its Creation. What he thought fit for his Power to give Being and Life to, he thinks becoming his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wiſdom to uphold and preſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as judging all the works of his Hands, worthy of his Providence and Care.</p>
            <p>So that there is not any thing which does come by inflexible Fate, or depend upon the uncertainties of Fortune: But God does look down upon every work, he beholds the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of all his Creatures; he perpetually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the order among things, and directs the whole courſe of Nature in ſuch juſt manner, as ſhall ſerve for the greateſt good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60079:5"/>
of the Creation, and moſt illuſtrate his own Glory.</p>
            <p>This all follows plainly from the Nature of God, which conſiſts in infinite Perfection; but the denying of Providence, or the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal that matters go in the World, either by Fate, or Chance, is moſt repugnant to the Bleſſed Nature of God, and does contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict almoſt every one of his Attributes and Perfections; who could not be Almighty if there was any Power independent upon his; who would not be infinitely Wiſe if he Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd the vaſt productions of his Power by no Laws; whoſe Goodneſs would not be boundleſs, if he had no care of thoſe who Loved Him; if he did not reſcue thoſe who ſuffer'd for his ſake; whoſe Knowledg would not be immenſe if he did not ſee all that was acted in the World, if he was not an obſerver of the words and deeds, but alſo privy to the very thoughts of his Creatures.</p>

not at all mind the ways of men, they would have no motives to Love him, nor reaſon to Fear they ſhould fall under his diſpleaſure, by acting the moſt horrid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties.</p>
            <p>Prayer is the primary Duty of Chriſtians, the great Inſtrument by which they obtain a ſupply of all neceſſaries, Bodily and Spiritual, and the chief ſupport of their Minds in Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; whereby they compoſe themſelves to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſharpeſt Sufferings, and become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors of their ſtrongeſt Temptations: But if God has no Knowledg of the affairs of this World, the reaſon and very foundation of Prayer will be deſtroyed, which ſuppoſes, that God knows all the Circumſtances of our particular caſe, and does not only hear us when we call upon him in our want and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, but alſo that he has both the Power, and the Will, to relieve, or deliver all thoſe who make their humble ſupplications unto him.</p>
            <p>Did afflictions happen by meer Chance, we ſhould not know how to behave our ſelves under them, we ſhould have no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to bear them Patiently, nor skill to make a due Proviſion for thoſe which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60079:6"/>
may ſeize upon us hereafter, and turn them into a benefit to our Souls.</p>
            <p>But when we know from whence they come, and that our Cup, how bitter ſoever it be, was mingled by the merciful hand of our Moſt Gracious Father for the Health of our Souls; with what readineſs and courage ſhall we ſtoop to our Burden, and what an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and heavenly Temper ſhall we attain by our Sufferings?</p>
            <p>Did not God know us, or take notice of our Lives, how could he now Govern the World, or Judge it hereafter? Inſomuch as there is no calling the truth of the Doctrine of Providence into queſtion, without ſtriking at the foundation of all the Arguments for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, for the Fear and Service of God, for Truſt in his Mercy, and hope in his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: and without putting an end to every reaſonable thought about future Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>But though there be a great deal of Malice in the objections againſt Providence, yet upon little examination they will be found weak, and ſuch as cannot ſhake the belief of any who will impartially conſider them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60079:6"/>'Tis objected, That for God to have the care of all things upon him, would diſturb his Peace; and that for him to condeſcend to obſerve the actions of trifling Man, and to have a regard to the ſmall and vileſt parcels of the World, would be below the dignity of his Glorious Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The weakneſs of this Objection, which is ſo much flouriſht by the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> lyes herein, That they ſuppoſe God to be like unto men, who can hardly tranſact any affair wiſely without much thinking; who cannot be concern'd in many things together without great diſquiet and trouble. Now the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, uneaſineſs, irreſolution and difficulty, which men find in much or great buſineſs, does ariſe from their faculties being ſtinted: they are fain to turn things up and down in their thoughts, and to work their brains with long conſideration before they can reſolve what is fit to be done; and after they have reſolved, they are as much at a loſs for means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their deſigns. But what is more evident, than that the boundleſs Power, Wiſdom and Knowledg of God, cannot be expoſed to any of theſe Objections and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties?

Scripture, not only how God is pleaſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf in making proviſion for the Children of men, but how his care does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the ſmalleſt Creatures, and the meaneſt parts of the Creation.</p>
            <p>We are taught not only that the Rational Beings do live and move and ſubſiſt by the Goodneſs of their Maker; but that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends to feed the little Sparrow, and to cloath the fading Lillies of the Field, and even to number the ſlender Hairs upon our Head.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in the Word of God is ſet forth all the ſorts of Inſtances, in which the Divine Providence does manifeſt it ſelf to men, who ſeem to be the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Objects of God's Care and Love. There an account is given how God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns himſelf in our Birth and firſt Production; that he makes the barren Woman to be a joyful Mother of Children; that it is he that takes us out of the Womb; that he is our Hope, and our whole Dependance is upon Him, from the time we hung on our Mothers Breaſts; and that the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings, ſet forth the Praiſe of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60079:9"/>That the Divine Providence doth not only exerciſe it ſelf about particular Perſons, but reaches unto Societies and Communions, and takes Cities and Nations within it's ſpecial Cogniſance; that both their Proſperity and Sufferings come from him; that <hi>except he keep the City, the watchman waketh</hi> but <hi>in</hi> vain; and that no <hi>Evil happens there, but he hath</hi> done it; and that he ever makes them to Flouriſh or Decline, in proportion to their Virtues or their Sins, the univerſal good of the Creation being the great deſign and meaſure of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>The Holy Scriptures ſometimes acquaint us with thoſe parts of Providence which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to God's Infinite Knowledg, and the Righteouſneſs of his Dealings, that nothing which we do or think can be hid from Him, but that all lies open and naked to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Him before whom we ſtand; that exact obſervation is made of every turn and deſign in our Lives; that he ſeeth all under the whole Heaven, and looketh unto the ends of the Earth; that our whole behaviour is as it were regiſted in a Book; that at the great Day of Judgment, this Book ſhall be open'd, and we be Sentenc'd to Everlaſting Happineſs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60079:9"/>
or Miſery, according as our Lives ſhall from thence appear to have been Good or Evil.</p>
            <p>In our Bibles we learn that God ſuffers Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to fall upon his own People, and are there ſhewn the juſt reaſons of thoſe Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his, which at firſt view ſeem'd hardly conſiſtent with his immenſe Goodneſs; and that all things in the end ſhall work together for the good of them who love him.</p>
            <p>There we alſo learn, that the Preſervation and Continuance of Life, is not in our power, and that length of days does not depend upon our care and skill, but that God keeps the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues of Life and Death in his own hand, and we never by any means can be aſſured, how long we have to live, who ſee the days of the weak and ſickly ſometimes extended to very old Age; and they of ſtrong Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of firm and vigorous heal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60079:10"/>In this Word of God we find an account not only of the uncertainty of our Lives, but of all the other Goods we poſſeſs, which belong unto the preſent ſtate; that the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion we have of them is very preca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But tho the ways of turning us out of what we have, be many, yet the Holy Scripture gives us good aſſurance, that we ſhall never be diſpoſſeſt of the leaſt good without the Appointment or Licenſe of Providence; that as we may not ſet our hearts upon any of the things of the World, which we have, ſo we may bear Loſſes quietly; and without ruffling the Peace of our Minds, and making any abatement of our Love of God, may ſubmit to every change in our condition, with the Patience of <hi>Job,</hi> yielding back to the Lord what he had given.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the Scriptures diſcourſe of the ſtrange Changes which are made in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; how God pulls men down, and ſets others up by unlikely means, and when they leaſt expected it; and that in an inſtant he

ſtript them of their vaſt Poſſeſſions, when their Power and Plenty had thruſt him out of all their thoughts, and they placed their ſecurity in their own ſtrength, and did not attribute to his Providence the Glory of their Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>Of the wonderful effects of Providence, we have unqueſtionable examples in all Ages, wherein the motion of God's hand hath been ſo viſible, that neceſſity will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel men to aſcribe them to him.</p>
            <p>How frequently hath the interpoſition of the Divine Power been clearly manifeſt in the Riſe and Declenſion of Kingdoms, and in the ſurprizing Periods which have been put to mighty Empires by ſmall and improbable Cauſes, notwithſtanding they were founded in deep Policy, and had been of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; he in a moment breaking the firm frame of things, and turning up the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were laid by the Counſels of the moſt skilful and ſagacious men?</p>
            <p>VVhen the meaſure of the ſins of a great People is full, and their Iniquities are grown up to a ripeneſs fit for ruin, ſo that God will no longer endure the abuſe of his Mercies, and the bold affronts which are put upon his

Love and Kindneſs; then Deſtruction comes ſwiftly upon them, and they receive their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible overthrow from thoſe hands which they did deſpiſe.</p>
            <p>Hiſtories of all Countries furniſh us with inſtances of this kind; and we may read abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the myſterious variety of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Providence in the quick turns, and amazing changes which did happen to the Kingdoms of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi>: Either the ſick or the lame have ſtrength enough to pull down the mightieſt Nation, when the crying ſins thereof have provoked God peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Of this caſe we have a memorable decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made from the Lord to the <hi>Jews,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> of the fatal Blow which ſhould be given to their Kingdom, even by thoſe they themſelves had beaten; and that only the wounded men which remained, ſhould be ſufficiently able to ſet Fire to their City, and lay it in Aſhes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Deceive not your ſelves, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Chaldeans ſhall ſurely depart from us; for they ſhall not depart; for tho ye had ſmitten the whole army of the Chaldeans,</hi> that fight againſt

            <p>On the other hand, to ſee a ſmall Society or Body of Men preſerv'd when environ'd with

Powerful Enemies, each of which could have devoured it; and its State and Condition ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, when they did all conſpire to work its ruin; and Peace and Safety reſtored by moſt improbable means, where there was no appearance or likelihood of it, muſt be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration that God governs the world, and orders all the affairs thereof.</p>
            <p>From hence it is, as the Divine Providence hath wonderfully put forth it ſelf in all times, ſo God ſhews himſelf highly diſpleaſed, when his people preſume to call his Care of them into queſtion, and make any doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he obſerves their behaviour; declaring it to be utterly impoſſible, that he ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglect or forget them.<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.9, 10.

            <p>Thus I have diſpatch'd the firſt Head of this Diſcourſe, namely that nothing can come

to us through the whole courſe of this life, without the Order, or at leaſt the Permiſſion of Providence; and ſhewn, That not only the Proſperity and Adverſity, the Poverty and Riches, the Wiſdom and Underſtanding, the Length of Days, and Death of particular Perſons, but alſo the Growth and Fall of Nations and Kingdoms, comes from the Lord:<note place="margin">Pſal. 113.6.

               <hi>Who humbleth himſelf to behold the things that are done in Heaven and Earth: He ſheweth loving kindneſs unto thouſands, and recompenceth the iniquity of the fathers into the boſom of their Children after them: The great, the mighty God, the Lord of Hoſts is his name, great in counſel, and mighty in works; for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the ſons of men, to give every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That we ſhould receive evil from the hand of God, as well as good, is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Wiſdom: In the miſeries God ſends or ſuffers to fall upon men in this life, many of his great Ends in governing the world, are ſerv'd, and much Spiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit may accrue to them, who by the croſs Events and Diſappointments they here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60079:13"/>
are wean'd from the world, and will not be drawn in by its moſt alluring Temptations; who every day diſcovering more the vanity of all earthly Pleaſures, have an immediate recourſe to God, and entirely depend upon his Wiſdom and Goodneſs both as to their preſent condition, and that happy one they hope for hereafter.</p>
            <p>All men receive Proſperity from God very kindly, tho they frequently make an ill uſe of it; but when he ſends any affliction, how much ſoever they may ſtand in need thereof, they forthwith complain, as if he dealt hardly by them. Nay, when he lays a far lighter Judgment upon them, than their folly and ſin has deſerv'd, and than the preſent ſickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their ſoul did require, immediately both his Juſtice and his Wiſdom muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached.</p>
            <p>Poor man! he thinks he has ſevere uſage, when God is very merciful unto him; and is apt to grumble and be querulous, when the Divine Wiſdom does uſe the moſt proper and ſuitable methods to do his ſoul the greateſt good. Moſt men, if they might chuſe for themſelves, would never have any thing fall

croſs to their own Wills; and the beſt reaſon that may be for their ſufferings, will ſcarce bring them to think well of them, or to judg favourably of him who order'd and ſent them.</p>
            <p>This is uſually the perverſe behaviour of thoſe mean ſpirits, in every trouble and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, who having fixt their hearts upon the goods of this world, do never lift up their hands and eyes towards the Glorious Heavens, or ſpend any thoughts upon the boundleſs Eternity into which they are ready to launch: It is alſo true, That God's own People may ſometimes have their feet ſlip, and be at firſt ſtagger'd by a great evil, which ſuddenly ſurprizes them; but with a little thought and recollection, they recover the due temper of their minds, and diſcern the calamity to be ſo fit and reaſonable for their condition, that they not only frame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a ſincere ſubmiſſion to God's pleaſure, but devoutly magnifie and praiſe his Name for the ſignal advantage their ſouls will gain thereby.</p>
            <p>This is the language of the Saints; <hi>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth; therefore

            <p>Theſe things to them would have been a burden, and they therefore never ſought them; but a compoſed mind, devout thoughts, eaſineſs in every condition, a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſignation of themſelves, and of what they had, to the Will of God, when Croſſes and Sickneſs, and Diſgrace and Loſſes ſhould come, is what they heartily deſired, and what they earneſtly prayed for, and what God graciouſly was pleaſed to give them, and in the enjoyment whereof they find real and moſt intenſe happineſs.</p>
            <p>Hence we may be inſtructed how to take the meaſures of our Felicity, and to form a true judgment who are the happy, who the miſerable men.</p>
            <p>That no man is happy by reaſon of his vaſt Riches, but Generous Mind, which makes him to live above them, and inclines him to the higheſt Inſtances of Charity; ſo that he

is merciful and lendeth; he diſperſeth and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to the poor, and the acts of his Bounty ſhall be had in everlaſting remembrance.</p>
            <p>That no perſon is miſerable, becauſe by the malice of deſigning men he may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his Native Soil; ſince he may bear his Calamity ſo evenly, and with ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Providence, as thereby to enſure to himſelf an habitation in the Heavenly and Eternal Countrey, from whence all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Darkneſs can never baniſh him.</p>
            <p>That a man is not happy becauſe he has a healthy and ſtrong Body; but becauſe in an infirm and ſickly one, he does carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a ſound and ſpotleſs mind.</p>
            <p>That he is not miſerable who meets with much unkind uſage, and upon whom many croſs and ſharp things do fall; But he, who being beſotted with proſperous Succeſſes, doth lift up his eyes no higher, but ſits down with the brittle and deceitful Goods of the preſent ſtate, and only among them ſeeks for reſt. Thus it is manifeſt, that real Felicity does conſiſt in the Innocence and Tranquility of the Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60079:16"/>But notwithſtanding in the general we may pronounce all thoſe happy, who have quiet and unblemiſh'd Souls; yet we cannot ſpeak with confidence, as to the happineſs or miſery of particular men, becauſe by their outward Circumſtances, and appearance to the World, we can never be certain of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their minds, nor whether they have thoſe Virtues in their Poſſeſſion, which cauſe ſolid Happineſs. Wherefore ſeeing we are not competently qualified to judg either of the Piety or of the Happineſs of particular men, it evidently follows, That there is very little in that Popular Objection againſt the Divine Providence, taken from the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Adverſity of the Good, and flouriſhing ſtate of the Wicked.</p>
            <p>Further; Neither is it any diſparagement of Providence, nor unkindneſs in God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his faithful ſervants, that ſometimes he tranſlates them early from hence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to dye in the vigour of their years: For can a greater favour be done them for their ſhort and faithful ſervice, than for God to remove them not only from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and temptations to ſin, but alſo from

            <p>For a Man to look that God ſhould exempt him from theſe publick Evils, is to expect he ſhould alter the Courſe of Nature for his ſake, which is wiſely eſtabliſh'd, and for great ends; and therefore all ſuch hopes can have no ground, and muſt be deem'd very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>

it God tries our Conſtancy; whether we will equally Love him, and preſerve as great a Reverence for him in the days of our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as when he crown'd us with plenty? And if upon this Trial we entertain as honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thoughts of the proceedings of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as when the World went well with us, he has attained his end in Viſiting us, and will quickly deliver us from our Grievance. For if under the ſoreſt Croſſes, the heavieſt Loſſes, and ſharpeſt Pains, we uphold in our Souls as worthy opinions of God's Adminiſtration of Affairs, as when he enricht us with his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; then we ſhall make an undoubted diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the ſincerity of our Love of Him; and it will be evident to men, that we value the Peace of Conſcience, and his Favour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all ſenſual comforts.</p>
            <p>Beſides, nothing will more leſſen our eſteem of theſe mean and deſpicable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, nor take off the edg of our deſire for them, than frequently to be diſturbed in the enjoyment of them, and to have them forced away, when we were moſt delighted with them, and confidently promiſed to our ſelves their long continuance.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:60079:18"/>It may indeed be a general Obſervation, that much Proſperity corrupts mens Morals, and tempts them to rely upon their own Powers; but Adverſity reforms their Lives, and teaches them to know their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wants, which they perceive would grow inſupportable, did God once withdraw his Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſeeing it is ſo much hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to walk uprightly before God in a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, that make us apt to forget him, than in an afflicted ſtate, which naturally diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us to ſeek the Lord, is there any reaſon, why we ſhould thus murmur at his Rod, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine when he Corrects us with the tenderneſs of a Father, and viſits us with his Judgments, only that he may heal our ſpiritual diſeaſes?</p>
            <p>How terrible ſoever any Calamity may appear to us, yet it is fitted to our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and is not greater than the crazy ſtate of our Souls does ſtand in need of. For Troubles do not ſpring caſually out of the Earth; or fall upon us without meaſure or bounds: But God in his Wiſdom does order the time when we ſhall be Afflicted; he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the kind of Evil which ſhall fall to our
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60079:19"/>
Lot, and metes the very quantity that we muſt Suffer. Which as ſoon as it has Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled our Vanity, or extinguiſh'd our Luſt, or abated our Love of Riches, and reduced us to juſt apprehenſions of our ſelves, be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will recall from us, and let in the light of his countenance into our hearts.</p>
            <p>Now this being the true ſtate of things, as will be plain to every honeſt enquirer, it may be matter of wonder, why men take Afflictions ſo ill at the hand of God, when they know they proceed from his Love; and behave themſelves ſo untowardly under almoſt every degree of Adverſity.</p>
            <p>A great cauſe of all this, I judge to be, their making ſlight or no preparations for Afflictions before they come. Now there is that diſtraction and diſorder raiſed in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man, who is ſurprized with any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, that he toſſeth like a Bull in a Net, and has not temper enough left to conſider of the great Cauſes there were to move God to lay it upon him, or of the ſweet fruit he might gather from it by a modeſt and quiet carriage under the heavenly Diſcipline, and a total Submiſſion of himſelf to the will of his Merciful Father.</p>

            <p n="iii">III. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT if we equally conſider things, we ſhall be conſtrain'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, That God's Goodneſs and Mercy do appear in our greateſt Sufferings; and this will be evident from the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe, if we look upon God as the Supreme Lord and Owner of the World, who alone has the Right of all, we ſhall find our ſelves to be but Tenants at will, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that we have: And if God has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us nothing, but during pleaſure, then let him take it away when he pleaſes, he can do us no wrong.</p>
            <p>Our Life, that makes us capable of his other Favours; our Health, which makes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60079:21"/>
life comfortable; our Relations, our Eſtates, our Eaſe and Peace, are all the free Gifts of the Bounty of him, who had not the leaſt Obligation to us; and if he revoke them all, or any of them, we receive no Injury; for he does but reſume his own Right.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch, as if God ſtrips us of all down to nothing, he will but leave us in the ſtate he found us: Wherefore we ought to be ſo far from charging him with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs for any temporal Evil, that we muſt own, it is his ſingular Goodneſs we have been permitted the Enjoyment of ſo many of his Bleſſings ſuch a long time.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We cannot but acknowledg the Goodneſs of God in our Troubles and Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when we conſider him as the great Judg of the Lives of Men, and examine the Conditions upon which he was pleaſed to grant the uſe of his Creatures unto them, and the Puniſhments he has threatned to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon the diſobedient.</p>
            <p>Upon this Examination it will be plain to the greateſt Sufferers, that God has been merciful, in that they, in many particulars,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60079:21"/>
have broken the Conditions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which was made between him and them, and he has not taken the whole forfeiture.</p>
            <p>There is no breach of God's Law, in any great inſtance, made coolly and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but it does deſerve, not only a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhment, but the pains of Hell, ſhould God deal with us according to the meaſures of ſtrict Juſtice. Now, when he, who if he proceeded ſtrictly againſt us, might paſs the Sentence of Death upon us, and ſhut us out of his preſence for ever, does but gently correct us with ſuch chaſtiſements as are proper to reform our faults, and cauſe us to grieve we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended our beſt Friend; What can we do but admire his Goodneſs, and magnify the riches of his Mercy towards us!</p>
            <p>If God did not let ſinners, who have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a great while ſecurely in their iniquity, at length feel the weight of his Juſtice, they would lay aſide all fear of his Power, and fall into ruin beyond a poſſibility of being recover'd. But yet we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That there is a plentiful mixture of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60079:22"/>
Mercy in the Puniſhments which God firſt inflicts upon the greateſt ſinners; and that he does not proceed to high degrees of ſeverity, until their hearts are ſo hard, that lighter Afflictions would make no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore when very bad Men are brought to Repentance by a terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they diſcern God's Goodneſs in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than the terrour which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Judgment wherewith he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them; becauſe they are ſenſible it would not have reclaim'd them from their wicked Courſes, had it been of a milder ſort.</p>
            <p>God then tempers Judgment with Mercy, that as the contemplation of the one may preſerve in Mens minds an awful regard of his Majeſty, ſo the conſideration of the other may keep them from running into deſpair. Where Sinners are become bold, more of his Juſtice is requiſite to make them dread his diſpleaſure, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the infirmities of their own Nature; but on the contrary, where ſuch a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is found in the Conſciences of Men,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60079:22"/>
that they are extream fearful of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, notwithſtanding to the beſt of their ability they ſincerely endeavour to ſerve him; he is ſo far from putting any unneceſſary hardſhip upon them, that he letteth forth the treaſures of his Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon their diſturb'd Souls, does ſcatter their groundleſs fears, and refreſh and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them with his Mercies.</p>
            <p>There is no want of proof to convince Men, that as all the temporal evils they ſuffer are leſs than in rigour of juſtice God might lay upon them; ſo they never overtake them, before they are neceſſary either to make them reflect upon the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of their own ways, or to put a ſtop to others in a bad Courſe.</p>
            <p>The Servants of God, who have been renowned for their Piety, and whoſe holy deeds, and glorious ſufferings in the Cauſe of Religion, have been recorded by the Holy Ghoſt for the imitation of the Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt, and the ſupport of all afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saints, theſe eminent inſtruments in the work of the Lord, I ſay, have ever been ſo ſenſible of their own frailty, as to dread the Divine Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:60079:23"/>They never did preſume to inſiſt upon their own Righteouſneſs, when they came before God, as if they had lived with ſuch exactneſs, according to his Laws, that he could not afflict them, without being injurious. They were not ſuch ſtrangers to themſelves, as not to be conſcious, that in a great number of reſpects their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour came ſhort of perfection; which alone can juſtify a Man. Wherefore we ſhall never find that they appeal to their Innocence, when they have to deal with their Righteous Judge; but full of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of their guilt, they caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at his feet, and addreſs their Cauſe wholly to his Mercy.</p>

doth a living Man complain, a Man for the puniſhment of his Sins? i. e.</hi> While a Sinner has Life, he hath more than he can claim, and therefore hath no cauſe to find fault with any ſmaller evil that God corrects him with for his crimes.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) We muſt acknowledg the Divine Goodneſs in our Loſſes and Sufferings; when we conſider, that in the Goſpel there is no expreſs Covenant, obliging God to beſtow temporal proſperity upon Holy Men. In the Chriſtian Religion there is no abſolute promiſe of worldly Power, Honour, or Wealth, even to them who do perform the Conditions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>And if God has not tied himſelf to preſerve the Saints always in a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, Shall they who are wicked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from him? Shall the Sinners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that, as juſtly belonging to them, which he has not made a debt to the beſt of his Servants? Wherefore, if God be under no obligation in the Goſpel to beſtow a greater ſhare of the things of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60079:24"/>
the World, which are by Men ſo fiercely ſought after, than what is neceſſary to Life, he does not, in depriving us of any of our ſuperfluities, break any one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant between us; ſince the ſmalleſt Secular conveniency in our poſſeſſion, is more than we can claim, or than he contracted for. Our Saviour was ſo far from making any engagement, That they who are his Diſciples ſhould all be Rich, or Rulers, or Men of intereſt in the World; that he has declared, Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Lands, muſt all be forſaken, where they cannot longer be had without doing diſhonour to his Holy Name, or breaking the Laws of his Religion.</p>
            <p>And becauſe upon account of their Relations, or Riches, or Power, Men would meet with the moſt prevailing temptations to tranſgreſs the Precepts of the Goſpel, it is that Chriſt does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, That <hi>it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle, than for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:60079:25"/>May we not then be ſure, that Chriſt would not encourage his Friends to hope for a conſtant and ſteddy current of Plenty, and Honours and Pleaſure, when theſe things powerfully draw their affections from him, and tempt them to blot him out of their thoughts? His Kingdom being of another World, none of the Glories of this are neceſſary to the attainment of it.</p>
            <p>And as we do not find, that our Lord made any promiſe to Chriſtians of an abundance of things, highly valued by the Men of this World; ſo neither do we obſerve, that he treats Great Men with more reſpect, or gives them cauſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they ſhall have kinder uſage, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more favours from him, than the Poor, and thoſe of low Rank. He has made no ſpecial Promiſes to the Rich, and Celebrated and Popular Perſons: But the Beatitudes deſcend upon the Heads of Men of quite other Qualification: Not their outward Circumſtances, but the holy diſpoſitions in their Souls, procure and fetch down his Bleſſings. He bleſſes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60079:25"/>
the Humble, the Poor in Spirit, the Holy Mourners, the Meek, they that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, and earneſtly deſire to fulfil God's Juſt and Good Will; the Merciful, the Pure in Heart, the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, and they that ſuffer Perſecution, and are evil ſpoke of by all for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake.</p>
            <p>And hence it follows, that no body by reaſon of their Wealth or Honour, are greater objects of Chriſt's love, or come more within the Verge of his Care; but that men of mean and contemptible ſtate, are as much under the Protection of his Providence, as thoſe of higheſt Quality; have as plentiful a Portion of his Grace, and ſtand in as near a capacity to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Had our Lord come into the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled with all that Pomp and Power which the <hi>Jews</hi> expected the Meſſias ſhould appear with, as he could have been no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Sufferings to his Followers, ſo would they have been tempted to arrive at ſome degrees of their Maſter's Glory, and have ſet their Hearts upon the Greatneſs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60079:26"/>
and Splendors of the preſent ſtate, when it was ſo principal a part of his work, to teach his Diſciples to neglect and deſpiſe them.</p>
            <p>Since then the Poſſeſſion of a large Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of worldly Goods, is no part of the Bargain Jeſus Chriſt made with men in his Religion, who only promiſes a Supply of the Neceſſaries of Life; and ſince men, for the moſt part, have more than what is barely neceſſary to ſuſtain them, they muſt acknowledg their great Obligation to the Divine Goodneſs, with reſpect of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and eaſe of their condition here upon Earth.</p>
            <p>How much men under the Chriſtian Law, owe to the Bounty of God, more than by the terms of it they could demand, is plain, notwithſtanding you ſuppoſe them to perform every condition of the Goſpel, and to live in a ſtate of innocence; but look upon them what really they are, as vile ſinners, and then in God's uſage of the greateſt Sufferers, enough will appear to clear the Juſtice of his dealings, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, who complain moſt bitterly,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60079:26"/>
That he has been Gracious, and corrected them with Mercy.</p>
            <p>But further; When we reflect upon the utter averſeneſs of the world to the deſigns of Chriſt's Religion, and the deep Malice which it bears againſt thoſe who ſincerely profeſs it, as we ſhall ſee reaſon to believe and expect, that thoſe who live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould ſuffer affliction; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all good men may to their unſpeakable joy obſerve, That their Religion does mightily thrive, when the wicked moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſuppreſs it; and that nothing more refines the Lives of Chriſtians, and makes them come up to the Purity in the Goſpel required, than Perſecution.</p>
            <p>Of that part of Providence which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts Good out of Evil, the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſes well;
<q>It is, ſaith he, the greateſt Argument of Divine Providence, that it not only altogether deſtroys the hurtful quality of the Evil which proceeds from the Apoſtacy of Human Will; but alſo does not ſuffer it to abide uſeleſs and unprofitable; for it is the buſineſs of the Divine Wiſdom, Virtue, and Power, not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60079:27"/>
only to do good (for that is the Nature of God, to ſay it once for all, as much as it is of Fire to burn, and of Light to ſhine), but eſpecially to order and direct, that the Devices of the Wicked ſhould ſerve to good and uſeful Purpoſes.</q>
               <note place="margin">Clem. Alex. Strom. lib. 1. p. 312.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As therefore it is in the nature of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and of the Prophane, to hate the People of God, and to deal cruelly by them; ſo it is God's Will to ſuffer it, that thereby his own may be improved in that Piety and Virtue which will prepare them for his Preſence, and incline him to take them out of all their Troubles the ſooner unto himſelf.</p>
            <p>And tho it be a great crime in naughty men to perſecute the Servants of God, yet they have the leſs reaſon to complain of it, or to be very uneaſie when afflicted; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſufferings do tend ſo much to their Perfection. Nay, on the contrary, they ought to eſteem it as a mark and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God's Kindneſs, that he is pleaſed to better and advance their Nature, even by Adverſity. And it is no leſs than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Infinite Wiſdom, that the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60079:27"/>
Plots which are laid to ruin the Saints, ſhould make them more perfect; and that, to the aſtoniſhment of all men, the Spight and Cruelty of Perſecutors ſhould make Religion take deeper root, to grow the faſter, and in the ſhorter time to ſpread it ſelf over the face of the Earth.</p>
            <p>If indeed we regard the Malice and Rage of men, certainly enough has been attempted to baniſh the Goſpel and Name of Jeſus Chriſt out of the World, had not God appeared on its ſide, and maintained his own Cauſe and People. And while God is with us, and does ſupport the Intereſt of the Religion wherein we are engaged, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main confident, that Captivity, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Bonds, and Scourges, how much ſoever at preſent they may terrifie and grieve us, yet they ſhall never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Chriſtian Church, or reduce to a ſtate of Deſparation, the ſincere Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; but God's ſpecial Grace will help and carry them through troubles of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60079:28"/>
every kind and degree, and make all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in their Salvation.</p>
            <p>Let us then not hope either that the Wicked ſhould alter the Perverſeneſs of their Natures; or that for our ſakes God ſhould change the Wiſe Methods of his Providence. Let us not think we ſhall have kinder uſage from the World, than Chriſt and his Apoſtles had, and than the Army of Martyrs and Confeſſors, and all the Primitive Chriſtians did meet with.</p>
            <p>But as we are baptized into the Name of Chriſt, ſo never let us be aſham'd openly to profeſs it, or afraid to bear the Croſs of our dear Maſter: <hi>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</hi> And let us ſteddily <hi>look unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy which was ſet before him, endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God; for conſider him that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, leſt ye be wearied, and faint in your minds.</hi> Heb. 12.23.</p>

We muſt acknowledg the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, whether in Sickneſs, Pain, or Trouble, when we place our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on the ineſtimable Rewards of the next Life, which he has provided to recompence the Sufferings of Holy Men in this. Our deep ignorance of the Joys of the other Life, will make all things ſaid of them, to be with great diſadvantage. The Philoſophers, and Men of refined Reaſon, were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſt with the Belief of a Future State; of which yet their Diſcourſes are obſcure, and full of uncertainty; and when they handle this Argument, they are often inconſiſtent with themſelves.

            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60079:29"/>So that the beſt Information we are to expect in this matter, muſt be from the Holy Scripture; neither doth that it ſelf deſcend into a particular deſcription of the nature of Heavenly Joys: The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thought it ſufficient for the ſupport of our Faith, to give a general account of the uncounceivable Happineſs of the Future Life; and to let us have full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that it ſhould be the Portion of all thoſe, who ſhall to the end perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in a ſincere obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel. And notwithſtanding, the beſt Progreſs we can make in our enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after the Delights of the Glorious World above, will be chiefly by Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; <hi>for eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him</hi>; yet the conſideration of them, will be mighty comfortable, and enough to make us bear up under all the Preſſures and Troubles which ſhall attend the Croſs of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In Heaven we ſhall be free from all Sins; and from every Temptation to do
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60079:29"/>
evil, which now proceeds from ſo huge a number of cauſes and occaſions. We ſhall be placed above the reach of the Malice and Power of the Devil; whoſe perpetual work it is, to lay Plots to corrupt our Innocence, to take and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare our Souls by his cunning De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
            <p>We ſhall be removed from the ſight and company of bad men, who by their ill example, and reſtleſs importunity, are ever inticing us to ſin. We now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe among the dangerous Enemies of our Souls, who have a conſtant eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; ſo that if we do but forbear to watch never ſo little, they will ſurprize us; if we do not walk circumſpectly, we preſently ſhall be made to fall; if we do not pray continually, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will prove too ſtrong for us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us with the gaudy appearance of their tempting baits.</p>
            <p>O what a perpetual ſtruggle have we with our Luſts! and how much pains does it coſt to overcome them, when they violently preſs upon us!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:60079:30"/>What a Vexation and Grief is it to our Minds, that we find it ſo hard to ſubdue the Motions to almoſt every ſin! Nay, that thoſe Luſts which we have conquered, ſhould rally their Forces, aſſault us afreſh, and ſometimes prove too many for us, and often ſo terrifie us, as to make the Victory hazardous! ſo that we are fain to cry out with the great Apoſtle, O wretched creatures that we are, who ſhall deliver us from this body of Death! Who ſhall deliver us from the Tyranny of our impetuous Luſts, which are always labouring to get the Rule over us, and would lead us captive into the Gates of Death! We have not ſtrength enough in our ſelves; nothing but the Grace of God, and the cheriſhing Influences of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, will enable us to get the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery over our own Rebellious Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.</p>
            <p>So difficult it is for the Spirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Fleſh, and to drive Satan out of his ſtrong-holds; who will diſpute eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Paſs, and contend every point with us;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60079:30"/>
and never yield, while we allow him the leaſt encouragement.</p>
            <p>O what fears muſt be injected into the hearts of faint and timorous Chriſtians, by their being conſtantly plyed with ſuch implacable Adverſaries! To ſerve God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is their real deſire, and they love him with all their hearts; but deſpair holding out under theſe furious and hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attacks of the Powers of Hell. They dread they ſhall fall away in this day of heavy tribulation, and would give all they were worth, to be ſecured from the danger and trouble of their Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>Now in the next world, theſe Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and Fears and Dangers, which are here ſo frightful and ſo conſtant, will all be at an end: And what an undiſturbed Peace, and equality of Temper will the Mind poſſeſs, when it is got paſt the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of all kinds of Temptation; when the Fleſh ſhall be entirely ſubject to the Spirit, and make no further oppoſition to its reaſonable dictates; and there ſhall be nothing which can raiſe the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60079:31"/>
or diſorder within it; but it ſhall abide in an uninterrupted courſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; and behold all its Enemies lying ſlain before it, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did with Joy and Triumph look back upon the drowned <hi>Egyptians,</hi> floting on the <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as we ſhall be freed from the Power of Sin, ſo we ſhall get rid of all the Vexations, Grievances, and Miſeries of this world; many of which are the natural fruit, and proper effects of our ſins. We ſhall be ſtrangers to the drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and labours, which are ſo neceſſary to get a Livelihood in this earthly ſtate, and to all the fears and cares which are needful to preſerve our Gains, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m down ſafe and entire to our Children and Poſterity. Neither Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor Contempt, nor Diſgrace, will threaten us; neither the Covetouſneſs of men will leſſen our Plenty, nor their Perverſeneſs diſturb our Peace, nor their Cruelty bring any Hardſhip upon us: We ſhall meet with no Difficulties to perplex our Thoughts, nor Dangers to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60079:31"/>
exerciſe our Fears; but abide in a ſtate of perpetual Love and Friendſhip with all our fellow-creatures.</p>
            <p>And as in the Regions of Heaven we ſhall get above the Power of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Malice of ill men, and all the Calamities of the lower World; ſo ſhall theſe infirm, crazy, and fading Bodies, which ſtand in need of daily ſupplies to repair their decays, and which miniſter fuel conſtantly to our Paſſions, be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into Incorruptible, Heavenly, and Immortal ones; which will not ſolicite and make the Soul uneaſie with their hunger; nor clog and burden it with their weight; nor diſcourage and grieve it with their groſs and melancholly fumes; nor ſpot and defile it with their Luſt. We ſhall know nothing more of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor Pains and Aches, nor Hunger nor Thirſt. <hi>They hunger no more, neither thirſt any more; for the Lamb which is in the midſt of the Throne, ſhall feed them; and ſhall lead them unto living Fountains of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Then we ſhall be clothed with Robes of Beautiful Light, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60079:32"/>
ſhall ſhine as the Stars of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament for ever.</p>
            <p>In that Holy Place our Deſires will be gratified; our Appetites will have full ſatisfaction; our higheſt expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be anſwer'd; and all our hopes turn'd into Fruition: But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every capacity of our nature will be filled with its proper pleaſure, yet they ſhall never be glutted; but as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Heaven increaſe, ſo will our Faculties be more and more enlarged to receive them: And although there ſhall be no end of our Joys, yet their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual abode will never cloy us; who ſhall to all Eternity be improving into a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Likeneſs of God; and ſtill attain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to a higher, and more quick and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Reliſh of our Heavenly Delights.</p>
            <p>Then we ſhall be admitted into the moſt deſirable and pleaſing Company: We ſhall converſe with Angels, and be of the Society of all the Holy Men, who have been ſo renown'd in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and have ſet thoſe admirable Examples of Godlineſs and Virtue. There
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60079:32"/>
we ſhall ſit down by our neareſt and moſt dear Relations, whoſe departure hence was ſo terrible and grievous to us; by our beſt Friends, Neighbours, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and love and rejoice together, and praiſe the Lord for the great good, which by our mutual Piety we did one to another.</p>
            <p>O then we ſhall behold the Glorious Face of our Ever-Bleſſed Redeemer, who ſacrificed his own Blood to reſcue us from the Power and Guilt of our Sins, and to bring us into this moſt illuſtrious Habitation! And that which ſwallows all the Powers of our Imagination, we ſhall come into the Preſence of the great and mighty God, and ſee him as he is, and for ever be taken up in rapturous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of the inconceivable bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſplendor of his Infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
            <p>Now when we duly conſider that theſe ſhall be the unexpreſſible Rewards of our ſlight and ſhort Afflictions, will it not appear moſt juſt and reaſonable that we ſhould ſubmit to the Will of God in all things?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60079:33"/>As nothing will tend more to God's Glory, ſo nothing will agree more with our Intereſt, or more produce true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Peace in our Minds; than thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to receive all that God gives, and patiently and meekly to bear the loſs of all he takes away; who will ſo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompence all our ſufferings for his ſake in the next life.</p>
            <p>And ſince God has provided ſuch Joys for our Souls in the other State, O that he would quicken our Deſires, and help our Endeavours to prepare our ſelves for them! Seeing he hath been pleaſed to chuſe our Bodies for Temples for his Holy Spirit to dwell in, O that he would free them from all Malice and Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and chaſe away every ſtrange and filthy Luſt from his choſen Habitation!</p>
            <p>O that we might have ſo lively a ſenſe of the Goodneſs of the Lord, and of the Infinite Advantage we ſhall gain therefrom, as not to give ſleep to our eyes, nor ſlumber to our eye-lids, until from the bottom of our Hearts, we had repented of every ſin; until we had
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60079:33"/>
worked up our Souls to an utter hatred of it, and obſtinately reſolv'd to forſake it; until laying aſide all the Thoughts and Intereſts of this World, we had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed our Souls wholly in making a firm, well-grounded, and laſting Peace with our God.</p>
            <p>May we ſo frequently meditate on the Glories of his Nature, as earneſtly to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſtrive to grow like him in his Truth, and Purity, and Love, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. May we ſo often ſpend our thoughts on Heaven, that the Joys thereof may deeply affect our ſouls, and become moſt deſirable unto us.</p>
            <p>Did we deliberately conſider theſe things, it can be no queſtion, but we ſhould make it the great buſineſs of our whole lives, to fit and duly qualifie our ſelves for the Kingdom of Heaven. We ſhould abundantly more endeavour to live as the Righteous man doth, did we oftner reflect upon the unſpeakable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which attend his Death; did we but ſeriouſly think upon the Peace and Joy with which he finiſheth his courſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts this Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60079:34"/>For Death will only be to him a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from bad Men, and malicious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, to Holy Angels, and Innocent and Bleſſed Souls; from Labours, and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Toils, to perpetual Eaſe and Quiet, and moſt durable Satisfaction; from Pains and Grief, and Sickneſs, to Everlaſting Delights.</p>
            <p>When the Wicked ſhall begin to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and their hearts to fail and ſink within them, and their Conſciences to aſtoniſh and amaze them with a full and lively Repreſentation of their many vile ſins, and the notorious and ſhameful abuſes they have put upon all God's ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies, and of the intolerable ſlights and contempt with which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Numerous and kind Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to turn from their evil ways and live; and when there ſhall be no other Proſpect before their Eyes, but that of Miſery, Horror, and Confuſion; then ſhall you good Chriſtians look up towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and behold certain ſigns of your Salvation drawing near.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60079:34"/>O in what a Tranſport of Pleaſure will your Souls be, in the minute they are reunited to your Bodies, and ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that moſt Bleſſed and moſt dear Saviour approching towards you on a bright Cloud, whom you have ſerved with all your Powers, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt ſolicitous Care, to the end of your days; whom you have loved above all, and denied the fierceſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of the Fleſh, and ſtoutly reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt preſſing Temptations of the World, that you might follow him, and exactly conform your ſelves to his moſt Holy Example: When this Glorious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of yours, appearing in all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, ſhall call you forth from the midſt of that vaſt Aſſembly of men of all Times and Places, and looking very graciouſly upon you, ſhall take particular notice of the Zeal, Love, ſincere Affection and Piety with which you have always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved your ſelves towards him, and in his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>O what Tongue can deſcribe the Joy you will feel in your hearts, when the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60079:35"/>
Camp of Heaven, as it marches and moves on, ſhall ſhout and rejoice to meet you; when the Angels, who conceived ſo much Pleaſure at your firſt Converſion, ſhall loudly triumph at the Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Happineſs!</p>
            <p>O how will your Souls overflow with grateful Reflections upon the Boundleſs Goodneſs of God, when the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and Holy Apoſtles, and Glorious Martyrs, with all the People of the Lord, ſhall congratulate your eſcape from a wicked and miſerable World, and ſing, and praiſe their Redeemer, at this the accompliſhment of your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>
            <p>When having put on a Splendid Body of Light, Chriſt ſhall preſent you to his Father on the Throne, and reckon up all your Prayers, and Faſtings, and Tears; all your Acts of Devotion; all your Deeds of Charity and Compaſſion to thoſe in Miſery; your readineſs on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to comfort Widows, relieve Orphans, and to deliver the humble and helpleſs from the hard hands of the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60079:35"/>
your Meekneſs, Temperance, and Chaſtity, and inceſſant Pains to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your lower appetites to a ready Obedience to the Divine Laws, and the ſuggeſtions of clear Reaſon; when your Kindneſs to Strangers; your Humility in a Proſperous State; your Patience and Submiſſion in Adverſity; your unſhaken Conſtancy to the Intereſts of him your dear Maſter under Perſecution; and your ſteddy adherence to the True Faith, in the Times of greateſt danger, ſhall be all diſtinctly rehearſed, and accepted, and adjudged worthy of Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards!</p>
            <p>O how thankful will you be to God for the day in which you did ſeriouſly begin your Repentance! how will you love the man who did miniſter the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and was the Inſtrument of your ſincere Converſion, and did firſt guide you into the right Paths of Everlaſting Happineſs!</p>
