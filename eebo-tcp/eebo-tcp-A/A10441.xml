            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the mode and figure of a logical answer,

that it may be made to serue for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques

That the Catholikes haue presently their
enemies and slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derers, it may be proued

By al which it apereth, how sharply
the Protestants are set, against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
and how litle regarde they haue
what they write or report of them. Ergo
if thei which find enemys haue the truth:
wherefore then are so many Catholikes,

the whole Churche was not deceiued,

An other answer is, that this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection

ye not the first Christians vsage? Except

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5443:24"/>See the pity which these men take of
the old Fathers,<note place="margin">Confut. 239.</note> because their sayinges
are not regarded: and see the pityful ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
in which themselues are taken,
whiles they would seeme to alowe the
old Fathers. S. Augustine liketh not
the idlenes of Monkes: but ydlenes put
away, did he not alow the order of them?
His booke is <hi>De opere Monachorum,</hi>
of the labour of Monkes, prouing that
none of them must so thinke hym selfe
addicted to the seruice of God, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
reading, or in spirituall exercises,
that he should not sette his handes to
corporal labour. And he maketh it not
a case of necessitie, that euerie Monke
must labour: but he impugneth theyr
sayinges, which made a necessitie of it,
not to labour wyth the bodie for theyr
lyuing, but to serue God and man by the
labour of mynd only, as in praying, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and such like.</p>
               <p>Nowe therefore, if S. Augustine
would haue had the very Order it selfe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:5443:24"/>
and profession of Monkes destroyed, he
should haue made short and saied, not
that such monks as wold hold the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that they should not labour bodily, ought
to be sette therevnto: but simplie and
plainly he would haue concluded, that
all Munkerie should be taken away.</p>
               <p>And then, how could he make a whole
Booke, <hi>De opere Monachorum</hi> of the
labour of Monkes, except he would find
some what where nothing is, and build
a house without labourers?</p>
               <p>But you, whom the idlenes of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
offendeth, and the neglecting of the
old Fathers orders: shew to vs, I pray
you, your refourmed Monasteries.<note place="margin">Let He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes shevv their mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</note> And
if your factes haue declared before, and
yet hytherto your rayling tongues can
testifie, that ye hate the verie Order
and Rule of Monkes, nor would abide
a laboriouse and a vertuous Monke in
your companie, how vnsensiblie doe you
confesse the olde Fathers to haue spoken
againste idle Monkes, (whereby they
<pb facs="tcp:5443:25"/>
signifie no abhomination to be in the
Order it selfe) your selues allwayes so
mockingly and spitefully handeling, not
distinctly idle Monkes, but (without all
addition) Monkes? As maye appeare
by Iohn Foxes no litle booke of Actes
and Monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (to name one for all) and
by your great muse in the next sentence
folowing these words of which I speake,
<hi>where, you wote not whether to
name them droues, or heardes of
Monks,</hi> as though no other title might
be geuen vnto them, besides that which
is proper for brute beastes.</p>
               <p>Concerning the old Father Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
if idle Monkes be theeues, what
call you them which doe robb and spoile,
not only the idle, but the laborious and
holy Monkes? And robbe them, not of
their house, land, and goodes only, but of
their fame and estimation: and robbe
againe, not only the Monkes, but the iust
and true owners of such goodes as were
bestowed vpon Monasteries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:5443:25"/>But put the case, al Monks had bene

                  <note place="margin">Sabellic. Decad. 2. lib. 1.</note> but, he came of his owne
accorde. And to moue the Pope vnto
pitie, creeped vppon all fower to his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

               <p>Secondlie, he was not then Duke of
Venice. (For their Dukes vse not to be
Ambassadours, nor to goe out of the

he put about his owne necke, and which
he might haue taken of, and gone awaie
at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he was not hurled <hi>vnder
the table</hi> to feede of bones. For neither
the Pope doth make any fare so harde,
neither setteth he any man to diner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>Last of all, that he should <hi>be hurled

that either the Pope hath none at all,

neuerthelesse was nothing abated in his

               <p>Nazianzene likewyse speaketh of
S. Basiles Fathers perfect life in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
with A <hi>(but yet)</hi> saying: <hi>Although
he put himself in bondes of mariage,
yet he liued so therein, as he was let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no whyt therefore, from the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of perfect vertue, and folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of wisedome.</hi> As who should say,
it commeth most times so to passe, that
when students or holy men are maried,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5443:46"/>
they looke but seldome on their bookes,
but wait vpon the busines of the world:
yet was it otherwyse with Basiles Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For he, although he put himself in
<hi>bonds of mariage, yet he was no whit
letted therefore &amp;c.</hi> In which words
he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth his vertue, and geueth no
exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to vnmaried Priests, that if they
wil be furthered to perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they should
not be without a bedfelow: nomore tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he which should report of an other, <hi>that

yet neuer surfeiteth vpon them,</hi> that
proue that it is a right waye to tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
alwaies to be at many and fine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes.
Whereas contrariwise, in all things
that are delectable vnto the senses, and
hurtfull, by excesse, vnto morall vertues,
the safest way is, to flee from occasions
of euill, vntil by longe custome, an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
be obteined in the vertue. And
then, as it is an argument of greate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
to liue with a woman and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be hindred in deuotion by her,
<pb facs="tcp:5443:47"/>
so, it is so rare a vertue, and needelesse
(thoughe it be in a man) to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that as it may sometimes come to
passe, that one is not the worse, yet there
was neuer yet any man so blind and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible,
which would thinke it to be a
preferment toward perfection, to be at
bed and at borde with a woman.</p>
               <p>The more you haue then to answer for,

                  <hi>S. Hierome: Al these things, saith he,

against the deceits of heretikes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was ryghtly said by Pius the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

away from Priests, but many moe and
more weighty causes, why they ought to
be restored to them againe.</hi>
               </p>

And if he had so ernestly spoken, as you
suppose, yet dothe he not allowe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of priestes, whiche he confesseth to
haue bene taken away for greate cause:
but so muche he seemeth to be greaued

to <hi>being,</hi> and from <hi>being</hi> to an <hi>other
being.</hi> As, if God hath made nothing
somewhat, muche more of somewhat he
may make another thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. Before the world
began, the Heauens, waters, and Earth
had no existance or being at al. God spake
the word, and so of nothing he made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to haue a beginning <hi>and being:</hi> but bread
had a <hi>being,</hi> when it was yet vnconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,

it keepeth stil a <hi>being</hi> (because it is
not annihilated, and vtterly made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
yet it keepeth not still the <hi>same
being</hi> it had before, because it is no more
natural bread, but is turned by the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie
of Gods worde, into the bodie
of Christe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5443:50"/>
As in example of the meate whiche

after it is once digested it hath <hi>a being,</hi>
(for we are not fedde with nothing, and
our meates are not annihilated in vs, but
conuerted into our bodily substance) yet
they keepe not <hi>the same being</hi> whiche
they had before. For then should theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
which fed alwaies vpon veale, mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
capons, wodcockes &amp;c. consist not of
mans fleash, but of calueflesh, shepes flesh,

they might proue (in theyr own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte)
as wise as Calues, Capons or Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cockes.</p>
               <p>This example wel considered, it will
appeere, that S. Ambrose saieth right lie,
that, <hi>quae erant, sint, the things which
were, keepe a being</hi> (as bread dothe
when it is consecrated) but not (as the
Apologie abuseth S. Ambrose) that,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:5443:50"/>
                  <hi>Sint quae erant, they should remaine
styll the same they were before.</hi> For
bread is conuerted by consecration into
the bodye of Christe, and so keepeth <hi>styll
a being,</hi> but not <hi>the same,</hi> whiche it

               <p>S. Augustine doth so greuouslie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
and he is so ready to diminsh the

               <p>Secondly, I might wel and truely say,
that S. Bernard speaketh against the

And though he should name the Pope

S. Cyprian therefore speaketh of such, as

Vnto whom (which whom? Vndoubtedly
such as liued emong virgins, not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
virginity, but intending and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it only) <hi>it must be plainly saied,
that either they mary if thei ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Now that there is such a distinction
of virgins to be made, it appeareth most
euidenly by S. Hieroms owne wordes not
twentie lines before this place, saying.
<hi>But let this perteine to those virgins
which haue not yet chosen virginity,
and nede exhortation, that they may

                  <hi>The holy Apostles
of God haue leaft this tradition vnto

post decreta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> virginitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, after virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
decreed and determined. And the
Apostle writeth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor 7.</note> 
                  <hi>If a virgin mary, she
hath not sinned. How then agreeth
this with that?</hi> That is to say, if this be
true, that a <hi>vrigin may mary,</hi> how agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it with the Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Apostles,
that <hi>It is a sinne for a virgin to turne
to mariage?</hi> Epiphanius answereth by
expounding the Apostle in these words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Illam dicit quae non est Deo dicata,
The Apostle</hi> (in saying, that if <hi>a virgin
marie, she doth not sinne) speaketh of
that virgin, which ys not dedicated
vnto God.</hi> Ergo he is not contrary to
the foresaied Tradition of the Apostles,
by which such virgins are forbidden to
marie, as haue vowed their virginitie.
Ergo, to say further: They which acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt
mariage to be vncleane (as the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lici
<pb facs="tcp:5443:65"/>
did, against whom Epiphanius there
writeth) agree not with the Apostle.
And further, they that saie, a virgin
maie marie after she hath made a vow,

some other cause, and not of this, that the
Bishop of Rome hath iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Italy.</p>
               <p>Now consider the mater as the truth
is, that the Bishoppe of Rome hath su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
authoritie emong al Bishopes, and
then it foloweth by good reason, that the
Bishop of Alexandria shall rule Egypt,
because the Bishop of Rome hath so vsed.
That is, because it is so apointed and so
receiued at Rome, that Aegypte, Libya
and Pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tapolis should perteine to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe
of Alexandria: therefore let that
order continue.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
Councell, and this maketh for the
Popes Supremacy, and this proueth you to

               <p>
                  <hi>The Councel of Carthage,<note place="margin">Apolog.</note> did cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectely

               </p>

                  <hi>A Bishop of a first See,</hi> shal
not be called Chiefe of Priestes or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

priestes besides in the world, which are
not subiect vnto his see: reason it is, that
his title extend it selfe to no more than
those that are vnder his Iurisdiction. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
this Canon was for the Bishopes of the

               <p>Therefore the Councel in forbidding

               <p>
                  <hi>The old Councell at Rome decreed,<note place="margin">Apolog.</note>

wordes of the councel are these. <hi>It hath
seemed good vnto vs, that besides the
Canonical Scriptures nothing be red
in the Church vnder the name of the
holy Scriptures.</hi> Therfore it forbiddeth
not the reading of other thinges, but in
that sort, as they should be commended
and vttered for Scripture it selfe. And

<hi>Let it be lauful also for the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

               <p>And beholde whiles I thought this
obiection could not possibly be refelled, it
was for certainty reported vnto vs here
by some that were present at M. Iewels

               <p>Did ye so in deede? Is not your Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie

               <p>How dare ye then so loudly to lie, that

with his two felowes the Legats

sentence of condemnation against Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorus,
the forme whereof is fully there

that one of the Popes Legates was a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

               <p>The most that ye might saie (as farre
as we can reache) is, that the Ciuile ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
subscribed vnto the sentence of
the Councell, and by his voice also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Dioscorus for an heretike. But
this is not inoughe for you, to saue your

by his testimonie or assent, but also <hi>by his

as might concurre with the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
of the Superiours (lyke as euery bishoppe

so. For if we shal consider the acte of the
Priest as it is his owne Psonal, so doth he

by authoritie, but by supplication, obtaine
a vertue and influence to come frome
Christ, to them for whom he specially of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth.

to labour in the numbring of harlottes?</p>
               <p>Or went they from house to house

Now concerning the yearely pension

Make a gheasse as you do vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the annual
pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sion gathered of them. Are there think
you, thirty thousande harlottes or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about?
Nay are ther three or foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of <hi>So many</hi> as you would haue seme
to be there? Surely within this number
you can not welcome, because ye affirme
that manie thousandes are there.</p>
               <p>Goe to then, if there can not by your
accompt be lesse than three thousand (for
of two thousand only no man euer sayeth
there are many thousandes) euery one
paieing ten ducketes by the yeare, the
whole pension maie easely be made vp.
And thinke you, that any man disposed
to make a va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, would gather no more
of such persons, as so lightly come by their

foule companie in his Citie of whome he
might take large exactions euen for iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

an yearely pension of so litle value? So

he telleth them. But the cause of Hosius
fact is euident, for that his principal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in that place, was to shew the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
procedinges, and not to tary about
the confuting of theyr sayinges. And
whereas he compteth Zwenkfeldius an
vptars<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t heretike for those foresayd wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
is it not manifest, that he him selfe
hath no lyking of those woordes? Verelie
although Hosius in noting Zwenkfeldius
for those wordes, hath not straitewaies
aunswered his argumentes: yet he suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proueth himself to be of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
opinion, and thereby aunswereth your
fonde obiection, by whiche your would
seeme to make Hosius a Zwenkefeldian,
in that he iudged Zwenkfeldius wordes
to be wicked, and yet spake <hi>not so much
as one worde to confute them.</hi> As
though it were not to speake some word
at the least against a position, to saie no
more but this of it, that it is an heresie.
But see what foloweth in the Apologie.</p>
               <p>

Hosius peraduenture wyll not

the meaning of the wordes.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>howe so euer the matter go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>

seeme to recant and reuoke that, which
most vniustly and blindly ye haue layed
vnto his charge.</p>
               <p>And therefore, whereas it is most

vnto Zuenkefeldius, and whereas ye

               <p>There is no doubt, but Hosius and you,
will not agree vppon the sense of many

reiecte them, being a Catholike. For
in such cases he can doe nothing of him
self, but must folow the Catholike church.

                  <hi>Yet truly we do not despise councels,<note place="margin">Apolog.</note>
assemblies and conferences of Bishops
and learned men, neither haue we done
that we haue done, altogeather without
Bishopes, or without Councel. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath ben treated in open Parleame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
with long consultation, and before a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Synode and Connocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yeas,<note place="margin">Con. 275.</note> altogether without Bishops and
without a Councel. For in that notable
Parleament, the first of our Soueraigne
Lady that now is Quene (in which that
was don for you that was done) ye could
haue no Bishops in the plurall number to
stand for you: because ye had not so much
as one in the Singular number.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5443:107"/>Albeit afterward in dede one ye had, and

beare with the procedinges more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prely,

               <p>This is one. Now, as for the treating
of the matter in open Parleament, it
was so open, that your voices had no place
in it. This is an other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, concerning the long consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
that was vsed, the Parleament
began after Christmas, and without any
greate arguing to or fro, the maydenbill
(as it was called) of the Princes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie
was readye to haue passed aboute
the beginning of Lent. Then stode one
vp that spake against it, with such liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that he was examined vpon it, and
lost his owne libertie 30. dayes together,
and with such truth and grauitie, that
for so many daies after, the matter also
of the Supremacie was suppressed. Yet
about Easter, for the worde <hi>head,</hi> came
in the word <hi>Gouernour.</hi> And so was
the Supremacye admitted, when the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:5443:107"/>
Parleament so little thought of such a
fetch, that an earnest fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

toke indignation at it, and saied, that
if men were ashamed of the word it self
<hi>head,</hi> they should also refuse the <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie</hi>
it selfe which was imported by it.
And cal you this a long consultation? This

               <p>Last of all touching the notable Synod

they knowe not what is true Religion:
then doth it remaine, that you tel your

merelie awaie with the sentence, whiles
the mater is a hearing yet in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie.</p>
               <p>But if you obiecte this crime to the
Catholikes, that they knowe wel inough
what Idolatrie is, and see the kindes of

and so vile a fault, that ye shoulde

               <p>That you therfore may be corrected of
your lie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the simple Reader of his error,
I say that the Pope is no Monarche at al.

by reason of the Temporall, and greate

what one errorhaue they amended?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what are they first,<note place="margin">Con. 291.</note> that we may
knowe them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These men vse of course,<note place="margin">Apolog.</note> to denie all
thinges, be they neuer so cleere: yea, the
very same, which they presently see and
beholde with theyr owne eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This lye is of the same sute with his
foresaied felowes,<note place="margin">Conf. 317.</note> because it layeth such
thinges to our charge, as our doeinges
proue to be most false and incredible. For,
al the Scriptures we haue receiued, and
excepte we had commended them, no
protestant could euer haue trusted them.
The old Councels and Fathers we more
esteme than Protestantes doe, we refuse
no laufull testimonie of any age. That
which we see with our eyes we do neuer
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:5443:124"/>
deny, though we vnderstand such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as come vnder our senses, otherwise
than the heretikes doe.</p>
               <p>To whom therefore may I compare
these Aduersaries, which wil make vs
beleue, that we see well inough that,
which we do deny, and sometimes denie
that, which we do see. I thinke they are
disposed only to make sporte, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d so to plaie
in maters of religion, like as idel spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders
of theyr wit and time doe, in the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of mad mery games. For when halfe
a dosen such are agreed togeather, one of
them (for example) laieth handes vpon a
quiet man that passeth by: And whyle
the innocent looketh backe vpon him, in
commeth an other that helpeth to holde
him, so fast, as though it should be for the
kings auantage, to haue such a one made
sure. With that, he that without cause is
so apprehended, wondreth at the matter
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d asketh what they meane a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d stretcheth
his power to break away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. But he
begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth no soner to resist, but straitwaies
<pb facs="tcp:5443:125"/>
they cry, helpe Sirs, helpe for the Lordes
sake, this felow is mad: see how his colour
chaungeth, see how he panteth &amp;c. And
with that, the rest of the brotherhoode
sore moued with bitter compassion, make
in to him, and for lacke of other sprites,
there they possesse him, and holde him,
and crie vnto him, and kepe such a sturre
about him, as is able to bring many a man
halfe out of his wittes, and to perswade
with other that stande by and consider
the thing, that vndoutedly the felow that
suffreth the violence is mad, and not that
they, which goe so sadly and constantly to
the holding of him, should be any thing
madde.</p>
               <p>After which sorte if the Authors of
the Apologie haue concluded to cry out
vpon vs, that <hi>we can not denie,</hi> that,
<hi>we knowe in our owne conscience,</hi>
that, <hi>we knowe for a truth,</hi> such and
such thinges as we lay against them, to
be false, and if they will needes enforce
it vpon vs, that <hi>we can not deny, but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:5443:125"/>
all thinges are gouerned purely and

vs into Bedlem with so many holy and
learned men our forefathers, as already

be answered with our open confession in

such a Conscience as can not be gathered
of any our external acte: Iudge thou In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different

               <p>Here ye are to be pressed, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d here should

Ambrose, or S. Augustin that did affirme
anie thing, the Catholike would so farre
accepte it, as he should see other Fathers

               <p>These grounds then so standing, I say
vnto you: for as much as the Church of
Christ consisteth of a visible cumpanie
of men, which is kept in order and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
by reason that euery one knoweth
his place and keepeth himselfe within

for as much as this cumpanie and order

vnto you, that either our Catholike
Church is the true Church of Christ, or
<pb facs="tcp:5443:132"/>
els that Christ hath no Church at al. For
besides our Church ther is none that hath
bensene to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in any form of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
euer sensth' Apostles time hitherto. As

if it were, it was not visible, or if it were

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5443:133"/>In whiche Churche there was so little

table pulpit, vestiment, or other

               <p>Yet, we see this by experience, that
when a cumpany of heretikes doth mete
togeather, they wil not be longe without
theyr preacher (euerie one is so readie to
be preacher) and they can not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some place, and they wil make harde

which is the cause, that so many reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
haue bene made to Gouernours of

hewed and squared for the receiuing of

               <p>Therefore if there was anie congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
extant of this your Church, before

Frier Luther lay with Nonne Katerine

and they vsed such order, as they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
of theyr Forefathers, and you are
hable to name the place and tel vs theyr
Order.</p>
               <p>But we can he are of no such thing: er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
there was no Church of yours at all as
then. Add then now vnto this, that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Church began with Luther, and
so furth euery Church sens Luther hath
begon with the Diuiser of it: And consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the true Church of Christe can
haue no suche discontinuance or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
as that it shoulde be saied after
manie hundred yeares comming in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene,
in which one forme of Religion

and ye shal perceiue, that either

and that yet he hath none: or els
that our Catholike Church is the one and

haue either disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued, either they
haue not bene sensiblie perceiued, either
they haue ben within memorie erected,
and so they lacke Succession, visiblenes,
Antiquitie.</p>
               <p>Of whiche three pointes, the Church
that Luther and Zuinglius went vnto,
when they departed from the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
had not one. But afterwardes when
they became them selues builders of A

in that mater) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in dede, it was
not long but they gote one of the forsaied
three pointes. For they kepte such a sore
sturre against all Christendome, that it
was most euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that they were a visible
Congregation. But as for succession, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:5443:134"/>
antiquitie, they can neuer get it, because
they can neuer proue it: for why, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

striue, and crake (as the Authours of the
Apologie doe) <hi>that they doe come as
neere as they possiblye can, to the
Church of the Apostles and of the old

they can not tell, what to aunswer for

               <p>For how,<note place="margin">Let the heretiks shevv their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</note> thinke they is it possible, that

               <p>For if they knowe the Apostolike

where it was in the yeare of our Lorde

holde it for A Principle, that manie

was there, in those dayes whiche they
knowe <hi>to haue bene sound, perfite, and

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues
confesse, that the Greeke Churche
doeth erre. Ergo, if the Churche of
Rome was not sounde, and perfite, in
those foresaied yeares, and if the Greeke
Churche be notorious for the errours
of it: howe doe these Felowes <hi>knowe,</hi>
that the Apostolike Church <hi>hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto

               </p>
               <p>For what signifieth <hi>hithervnto,</hi> but
euen vnto our time? And if the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

euen vnto our time: there was suche a
Churche vndoubtedlie in the yeares of
our Lorde 1500. 1400. and 1300. and that
Churche was not (as they holde) the
Churche of Rome: Ergo some other.
<pb facs="tcp:5443:137"/>
But there was no other that they knowe
to haue ben <hi>sound, perfite, and pure:</hi>
Ergo they speake more then they know,
and ioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues close to the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

               <p>How much more trulie should ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
