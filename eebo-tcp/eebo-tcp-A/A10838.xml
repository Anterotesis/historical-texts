            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it is lawfull to partake: but so is not the Byshop a lawfull Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall

Gods servants may communicate. And is this to <hi>lead men by the hand,</hi>
to take for graunted the mayn question in controversy, to wit, that the
Bishops jurisdiction in their Provinces &amp; Diocesses is lawfull: which I
have also by sundry arguments proved vnlawfull, &amp; antichristian.<note place="margin">Act: 9.</note> Surely
they who suffer themselves thus to be <hi>led</hi> must be as destitute of spirituall

And so, that which I bring pag: 15. Arg: 2. of my book, is here mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed.
I there speak of lawfull actions performed merely by the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

            <p>Suppose after this that being desyred,<note place="margin">5 Qu:</note> &amp; so chosen by some assembly wherein there
are many fearing God apparently, he taketh a Pastorall charge of them, haveing the

they may then easily conclude theyr purposes. But .1. I deny that
an assembly gathered, &amp; consisting of <hi>many fearing God,</hi> &amp; many (which
must also be supplied) without the fear of God, is a lawfull Church-assembly,
haveing a right in communion, or common right, to call, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

or can truely take a pastorall charge in the parrish assemblyes. It belongs
to the pastours charge not onely to teach, &amp; minister the sacraments, but
also (&amp; that as a mayn parte, or duety thereof) to govern, and <hi>rule the

manner were heavenly dutyes? May not his fault be an humayn infirmity, in an

            <p>This Quaere is in effect comprehended in the former,<note place="margin">Ans:</note> in whose answers

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7044:5"/>
with the parrish assemblyes as they stand: but rayther haveing framed a
plot of ministery, &amp; other devise in his study, sends men by doubtfull
suppositions to seek they know not what, nor where. It remaynes we
now come to his removall of <hi>the barrs</hi> which I in my book set in the way:
the first whereof is, that, <hi>such a parrishional minister is a branch of the
prelacy / as receaving power from it / by which it doth administer / and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all communion with it to be avoyded by Gods people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His answer is, that</hi> in proper, &amp; accurate speach the minister, whom he former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
described, is no branch of the prelacy, nor doth receave his power of ministering fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
any prelate.</p>
            <p>The question is not whether the minister which he describeth, or rather
<hi>Supposeth,</hi> be a branch of the prelacy, &amp; so minister or no: but whether the
ministery of the parrish assemblyes, being partes of the Diocesses, and
Provinces, be such or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He addeth, that</hi> the power of right he <hi>(that is his supposed minister)</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever he had to do with any prelate, which power is from God by the Church: but
a power of externall legall abillity to do that, which from God by the people he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
right to do, this he may be sayd to receav from the prelate.</p>
            <p>He looseth himself in the labyrinth of his own devise: for even his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
minister had to do with the prelate, both for <hi>license to preach &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of ministery</hi> before this supposed right conveyed to him by the people,
as appears in his Quae: 3. 4. &amp; 5 compared together. 2. None of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
assemblyes have in theyr hands, as Churches, <hi>power of right</hi> to chuse
theyr ministers, nor are the Lords free people in that case: but do, on the
contrary, stand in subjection &amp; bondage spirituall to the prelate, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
by whose appoyntment they must receave them, will they, nil they.
Indeed some of them do by favour, or mony get <hi>ius patronatus</hi> into theyr
handes, &amp; so do agree amongst themselves what person they will present
vnto the Bishop for theyr Clark: but this they do not as a Church, neither
will, or may the Bishop so receave him from them, or appoynt him over
them, but as a patron, (which right any one profane person may have &amp;
enioy as well as they): nor, that such a person may be ordeyned a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in, &amp; of that Church,<note place="margin">Act. 6, &amp; 14</note> accordeing to the order Apostolicall: but that
being before, or first, a minister at large of the Bishops makeing, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyning,
he may by the same episcopall authority, in way of licence, or
institution conveyed, be determined to that particular parrish, according
to the Popish order. So that if there were any thing in the distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>the power of right,</hi> &amp; <hi>of freedom,</hi> he hath <hi>the power of right,</hi> or <hi>authority</hi>
by the Byshop at the first, in his ordination: &amp; <hi>the legall ability</hi> or <hi>freedom</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by the patron, &amp; prelate presenting, &amp; appointing him to his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7044:5"/>
place: &amp; so the parrish, as a Church onely receaves him so appoynted by
others. But the distinction is more subtile then sound: &amp; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without a difference, yet a division of things inseparable in this kynde.
No man hath <hi>externall spirituall power of right,</hi> to minister the holy things of
God, but by a lawful calling: &amp; no man haveing a lawful calling wants <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
spiritual power of ability</hi> or <hi>freedom</hi> to minister them: &amp; of this power we
speak, as being that which the Bishops as the spirituall governers of theyr
Prov: &amp; Dioc: do confer. I know a man may be restreyned by viol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce,
or other bodily impediment from the vse of this spirituall freedom, but
then he is restreyned from the vse of his power of right also. Whosoever
hath the one hath the other by the same act, &amp; whosoever hath a lawfull
calling, hath both. Of his great mistakeing (vpon which notwithstanding
he builds the weight of his answer, both in this, &amp; the former parte of the
book) which is that the Bishops Provinciall, &amp; Diocesan authority &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations
are civile, &amp; derived from the king, I shall speak hereafter.</p>
            <p>He ads that <hi>it cannot stand with my plea, that such a man preaching diligently,
&amp; professing that to be his mayn office should in this work be a branch of the prelacy,
&amp; d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t by his power receaved by him. For. 1. this is not any parte of the prelates
power (as he is a prelate) to preach the word.</hi> Which he also would prove by
an affirmation in my book, which is (though he weaken the evidence of
the truth thereof in relateing it) that <hi>the prelates office / and order is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vppon theyr usurpation of the rights / and libertyes wherewith Christ
the Lord in his word hath endowed his Church (the Elders for theyr go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment / 
and the people for theyr liberty) for the calling of officers / &amp; cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureing
of offenders. Power therefore</hi> (sayth he) <hi>of preaching can be no parte of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First that which he admits in myne affirmation hath enough in it to
overthrow his consequence. For if it belong to the prelates to call mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
&amp; that in calling them, they give them power &amp;<note n="*" place="margin">Book of ordering of Preists.</note> 
               <hi>authority</hi> (though
no absolute charge) <hi>to preach</hi> according to the order of that Church; then
followeth it vndeniably, that those ministers thus preaching do therein
excercise the prela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es power: &amp; that it may be sayd of the ministers, and
Bishops,<note place="margin">Mat. 10, 40,</note> as Christ sayd of his disciples &amp; himself, that whosoever receaves
them which are sent, receaves them which send them. In submitting vnto,
or withdrawing from him that is sent by the king, in a work of his office,
men do submit vnto, or withdraw from the king himself, &amp; his authority;
so is it in all estates, &amp; subordinations, whether Ecclesiasticall, or civile;
as every one that dimms it not in himself, may see by the light of nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if vnto this be added, that,</hi> as the whole nation is devided into two

we are not to vnderstand (as doth myne opposite) <hi>the work of preaching,</hi>
or any other work whatsoever, but the office, &amp; power exequuted, &amp; vsed
in these works. For if we will exactly weigh things in a just ballance, we
must consider of these three distinct poynts in the ministery. 1. The <hi>office.</hi>
2. The <hi>power.</hi> 3. The <hi>workes.</hi> The <hi>office</hi> is the very state, &amp; function conferred
vpon a man by his calling: from which office ariseth immediately <hi>power,</hi>
&amp; charge to minister, and to perform the workes of that office: in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of which <hi>workes</hi> the office is exequuted, and power vsed. And if

            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> It followeth not because <hi>the office of the prelates is founded vppon theyr v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation
of the Churches rights in calling of officers, &amp; consureing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

therefore <hi>power of preaching is no parte of theyr office.</hi> Men may by theyr office
have power to do more then the very things vppon which theyr office is
founded: otherwise the parochiall ministery should be very slightily foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
considering how many trifles, and superstitions the ministers have
not onely <hi>power</hi> but charge also to perform. By this mans reasoning theyr
office should be founded vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wearing of a surplice, makeing a crosse,
&amp;c. for these they have power to do, yea not power to leav vndone, by
theyr office.</p>
            <p>There are among men many lawfull offices or orders, &amp; those lawfully
founded, and yet not so perfitly but that some evil actions are (through
humayn fraylty) done in &amp; by them: so on the contrary is the office of
prelacy vnlawfull, &amp; vnlawfully founded, and yet not so absolutely, but
that the good work of preaching may be and is performed in, and by it.
Which preaching being also an inferiour work of that office, and order
(which is principally set vp for government): and that wherwith the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

theyr power to preach when and where they list in theyr provinces, and
diocesses, exorbitant, and antichristian; &amp; so a parte of theyr usurpation,
whether of the foundation, or building, it matters not: a parte of which
power they also share out vnto the ministers in theyr severall parrishes.
An other argument he bring vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an affirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in my book, (p. 29) that
<hi>preaching is no natural, or necessary parte of the parochiall ministers office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This myne assertion in the first place he reprocheth as <hi>an intemperate
speach proceeding from an impotent sicknes of mynde, which yet</hi> (sayth he) <hi>may be
vsed agaynst my selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I were sick of any such impotency of mynde, as he in his potency
of mynde pronounceth, I should surely fynde him a <hi>phisition of no value:</hi>
which brings no other medicine then a reproch to cure me withall. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he insinuates a reason agaynst that I say, which is, that, <hi>preaching the
word is expresly mentioned in the ministers ordination.</hi> And is it not also men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the ordination of a Mas-preist, of whose office notwithstanding
it is no necessary or naturall parte? yea is it not evident that one, and the
same ordination serves both for a Mas-preist, &amp; parochiall minister, being
given, by a popish Byshop? and so by consequence, that there is one, &amp;
the same office of both, though exercised in some different workes? So
also is <hi>ministring the disciplyne of Christ, as the Lord hath commaunded,</hi> expresly
mentioned in his ordination: &amp; is it therefore a necessary work of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall
minister? or is he any more then the Bishops mans man in publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
his court censure? The Bishop also expresly bids his ordeyned one,
<hi>Receav the H: Ghost.</hi> Doth he therefore so receav it? Or know we not
that it is Antichrists guise, and that not a litle advantageable to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of his iniquity, to keep the formes of good wordes without the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of things, &amp; so vnder the name of Christ to subvert Christs truth,
and ordinances? I would to God the notorious ignorance, and vtter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability
to preach the gospell in the greatest parte, by farr, of the parochiall
ministers, to the destruction of so many 1000 soules for which Christ dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
did not cry out vnto God, and men agaynst both that Church, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,
and ministery, that preaching is no necessary parte, or work of theyr
office. There is but one order, or office of preisthood in that church: &amp;
how can that be a naturall, or necessary parte of that office, which the
most of those officers want, this especially being by the constant practise
of the puqlique governers, &amp; according to the constitution, and state of
that Church, ministery, and government; the publique lawes thereof also
both ecclesiasticall, and civile approveing it; as otherwise, so by appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
homilyes to be read by such as are vnable to preach.</p>

(though most ordinary) no minister is, or can be deposed: but for not

true, as it cannot be denyed without losse of credit both to the person, &amp;
cause of the denyer, in the eyes of all reasonable men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vppon which affirmation of myne his inference notwithstanding is of
no force, viz. that</hi> such ministers as give themselves to preaching do not in that

            <p>It followeth not. For as some partes, or workes of the parochiall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
office are naturall, and necessary, as to <hi>read divine service</hi> &amp;c. so
are other workes or partes thereof but casuall, &amp; arbytrary, as is this of
preaching, as the person can, or will. It is not by any absolute necessity
required of every minister to preach, but yet he that doth preach, doth it
by authority of the prelate, in his parrish, as in a parte of the prelates pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,

power receaved from the prelate in that buesines of preaching,</hi> it is, as a poore shift,
so a vayn insinuation, that though in other buesinesses he did excercise the
prelates power, yet not in that of preaching. Wheras he both preacheth, &amp;
readeth divine service &amp; doth whatsoever he doth publickly, by one &amp; the

            <p>Well, I deny, &amp; marvell he would affirm, that the same parochiall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and power of ministery doth remayn in those Churches, which was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7044:7"/>
in vse before the extirpation of the prelacy there. The office it self was the
order of Mas-preisthood, &amp; the power derived from the Pope, &amp; popeish
prelacy. That the works of preaching, and prayer, performed by many of
the parochiall ministers, and also by some of the Masse-preists) may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn,
though the prelacy be taken away, (&amp; with it the parochiall preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
also) is without doubt; as they do in the reformed Churches, and
with vs, where there is neyther prelate, not parochiall minister: but our
question is not about some particular workes, as myne opposite makes it,
but (as hath been oft observed) about the very function it self, and the
power by which it is given, and vsed.</p>
            <p>And for the poynt: since all the ministers of that Church are made, &amp;
appoynted by the Bishops authority, take away the same Bishops authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and how can the ministers remayn the same ministers? Take away the
correlative, and the relation ceaseth. 2. Take away the prelacy, and how
possibly can such a ministery continue (as is the parochiall) whereof the
one of the two partes (though the inferiour) which stands in <hi>fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

flock</hi> by <hi>ruling,</hi> shal be vsurped, and possessed by the prelates and theyr or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaryes.
3. Take away the Provin: and Dioc: Prelates, and with them the
prov: and dioc: churches: and then the parochiall churches as partes of
them must fall with them theyr whole: and with the churches the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
as partes of them. 4 It is not possible that the prelacy being aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
such an office of ministery (of which office the reader must still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
our question to be) should survive, as whereof men vtterly vnapt
to teach should be capable, as it is with the parochiall ministery. Can such
stuffe passe thorough any but Byshops fingers? or will the Lord ever wipe
away so much of theyr shame as to suffer any other hands but of prelates,
and theyr chaplayns to be layd vppon the heads of such Idoll-preists? Or
is it possible that in any other then the Episcopall governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               </gap>o many zealous, and learned teachers should hang vppon the cop-web
of conformity to Crosse, Surplice &amp; such vanityes, &amp; be in daunger
every day for refusall thereof to be broken asunder? Can this web be wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by others then Byshops, or of other stuffe then comes out of theyr
bowels? Lastly is it possible that in such light of the truth, as now shineth
in Engl: all the profane parrish without difference should be compelled to
be of the Church, &amp; the minister of them to take charge, as his flock (as
the parochiall ministers do): but as the same is a part of the Bishops flock,
&amp; well serving for to supporte his lawlesse Lordship? Now no man weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these things with an equall hand will judge them light, and sleighty
matters, but weighty, &amp; as he speaks, <hi>substantiall,</hi> in <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>&amp; about the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.
Which therefore cannot stand, as now it doth in the severall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7044:8"/>
when God in mercy to that nation, shall <hi>root out</hi> that <hi>plant</hi> of the
prelacy, which his hand never <hi>planted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where after to myne obiection, &amp; charge, that <hi>all the parochiall mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are subject vnto the jurisdiction of the prelates spiritually, in theyr cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
suspentions, and exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munications,</hi> he for answer alledgeth, that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christians are subiect to the same jurisdiction personally, &amp; for personall &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
opinions, and behaviours also,</hi> it is that which I say, &amp; vppon which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a separation from the formall state, &amp; government of that Church eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
manner of way, since with the sinns of Babylon (whereof I have proved
in my former book the Hierarchicall government one) no man may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.
But if herevppon he would conclude the vnlawfulnes of private or
personall communion with the godly, as well as of publique, or Church
communion, I must deny his consequence; &amp; because I would not repeat
the same things agayn, do desire the Reader to take knowledg of the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
difference about this matter shewed in my former book.</p>

though diversly. His answer, &amp; defence is.</p>
            <p>The greatest parte of theyr jurisdiction being externall &amp; coactive or forcing, is
from the king derived vnto those that do exercise the same: &amp; therefore must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
be a civile power, such as the king might as well perform by other civile officers,
as it is indeed exercised in the high-commission, &amp; some other courts also, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he lawes
of the land do so esteem it, as Sir Edward Cook now L: cheif justice of Engl: hath
largely shewed in the first book of his reportes.</p>
            <p>Divers pleas for the prelates have been made by men diversly mynded
touching them: but that theyr jurisdiction in theyr provinces &amp; Diocesses
should be civile, &amp; coactive (for externall we graunt it to be, which is ill
joyned as the same with civile, &amp; coactive, since even<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor: 10.</note> 
               <hi>spiritual</hi> ordinaunces
are externall also) this I say is a plea, which to my remembrance I never
heard of before. The Authour in the front of his book proclaymes <hi>the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonablenes
of</hi> our <hi>separation:</hi> but I hope the Lord will give me grace, and
modesty, never to defend, or continue in that state, &amp; standing, for which I
shalbe driven, to make so vnreasonable a defence: which is indeed an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

            <p>For the better then both clearing of this poynt here and els<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>where in
the book, &amp; help of others otherwise: it must be considered that the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
have in theyr ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds a double authority: the one civile as magistrates:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7044:8"/>
the other spirituall, as Church-officers: and so do perform workes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kyndes according to these their divers callings. By the former they sit
with other Barrons in the parliament-howle for the enacting of lawes, &amp;
statutes, vnder bodily punishments: some of them also being of the kings
p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ivy councell, &amp; some of his high commission, haveing therein ioynt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with other Lords, &amp; Magistrates civil. They are generally, in the
Countyes &amp; Shyres where they live, Iusticers of peace, in the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
with other honourable, &amp; worshipfull personages &amp; thus they sit
vppon the bench at Assises, &amp; Sessions: &amp; have authority civil ioyntly with
the other Iusticers, &amp; so severally as they, at other tymes, to apprehend,
imprison, fyne, &amp; punish bodily, malefactors, according to the common
lawes of the land, &amp; theyr office of Iusticeship: and all these theyr admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
they perform expresly in the kings name. In which also they are to
be honoured, &amp; obeyed, as are other civil magistrates whatsoever, by all
the kings subiects, &amp; wherein, for my self, I professe communion with &amp;
submission vnto theyr authority, &amp; power.</p>
            <p>But besydes this theyr civil authority they have also ecclesiasticall Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
as they are the Arch-Byshops of Provinces, &amp; Byshops of Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And thus they with the rest of theyr triumphant Church, &amp; Clergy,
sit in the convocation house, frameing Canons, &amp; constitutions ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
vnder spirituall penaltyes. Thus they ordeyn ministers, &amp; institute
them to theyr several charges; &amp; give them licences to preach within theyr

&amp; theyr subordinates, Chauncelours, Commissaryes, Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
&amp; other theyr officials: citeing men thither by theyr Apparitours;
as on the contrary in theyr civil administrations (though in matters ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall)
they vse Pursivants, &amp; Constables. There, and thus they sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
depose, &amp; degrade ministers, as at the first they ordeyned, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
them: as they also excommunicate, &amp; absolv both ministers, and

to that end S. <hi>Edw: Cook L; cheif Iustice,</hi> there is a great mistakeing in
the matter. No onely the greatest parte of, but in effect, theyr whole Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
in theyr provinces, &amp; diocesses, standes, in theyr ordeyning of
ministers &amp; excommunicateing of offenders with theyr apurtenances, &amp;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7044:9"/>
in theyr contraryes, of the same nature? Now to make the power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
&amp; of ordination of ministers civile, or these such workes
as may be performed by civile magistrates, the king, or others, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

the prelates is in it self, &amp; nature, spirituall: &amp; in the extent of it over an
whole Province &amp; Diocese, &amp; all the Congregations therein (to the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing

sayth</hi> in her government, &amp; ministery. Papists have made of Popes
kings, by deriveing from them civile governments: and will protestants
make of kings, Popes, by deriving spirituall authority from them? And
because Popeish <hi>kings</hi> have <hi>given theyr power to the beast,</hi> shall Christian kings
therefore take the beasts power vnto them: which they should surely do in
makeing themselves the spring-heades from whence floweth the power
of makeing ministers, &amp; excommunicateing offenders which the Prelates
vse in theyr Provinces, &amp; Diocesses?</p>
            <p>And albeit for want of the bookes I cannot exactly set down the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the lawes in this case, yet may I safely affirm, that they no where
derive from the kings civile authority, the power of these spirituall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations,
but do onely make the king the establisher, &amp; vphoulder civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of this power. The same ecclesiasticall jurisdiction which had been in
vse in popery, &amp; a great part of the popish Hierarchy, was confirmed <hi>Eliz:

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in the washing of this blackmore. Neyther yet doth it follow, though the
lawes of the land did esteem this Iurisdiction civile that therefore it were
such indeed. They may, and do misesteem many things especially of this
kynde. They esteem the Crosse, Surplice, &amp;c. indifferent, yea comely, &amp;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dificative ceremonyes: &amp; are they therefore such, or so esteemed by this
authour? So for those <hi>corrupt vsurpations, &amp; abuses,</hi> which he affirmeth to
be <hi>mingled</hi> with the Byshops (so seeming vnto him) <hi>civile power,</hi> do not the
lawes of the land esteem even them also lawfull, &amp; laudable ordinances, &amp;
orders? The Arguments therefore from the lawes esteem to the nature
of the thing is of no force.</p>
            <p>Now that the prelates Iurisdiction in theyr Prov: &amp; Dioc: is not civile,
but ecclesiasticall, &amp; a spiritual externall power, appeareth playnly by these
Reasons.</p>
            <p>First where he makes it <hi>civile,</hi> because it is <hi>coactive,</hi> or bodily enforceing,
I conclude on the contrary, that because it is not so coactive, therefore it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7044:9"/>
is not civile. The furthest the Byshops can go, as Byshops, is to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
a man, or to pronounce him an heretique: which done they may
deliver him to the secular power, or procure a civile coactive<note n="†" place="margin">De exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

&amp; Iusticers: &amp; therefore is nothing at all to that iurisdiction by
which they ordeyn ministers, and excommunicate offenders, which the
foresayd civile magistrates neyther have nor can have power to practise:
though (by theyr civile power) they do, and may (civilely) restreyn men
vnder peyn of bodily punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Ad vnto this also, that the Byshops may,
&amp; do excercise all, &amp; every part of theyr episcopall authority, where they
have not the least civile authority, viz: in the cittyes and corporations
within theyr Provinces and Diocesses: as for example, the Bishop of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich
in the city of Norwich, where his civile authority is no more then
myne.</p>
            <p>Lastly whereas all civile proceedings are made in the name of the king; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
they on the contrary side proceed <hi>In the name of God,</hi> though too oft verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the old saying, <hi>In nomine Dei incipit omne malum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by these reasons that which I did not suspect that any would have
denyed, is confirmed, to wit, that the Prelates power in theyr Provinces,
and Diocesses, is not civile, but a kynde of externall spirituall power which
I have also in my former book proved Antichristian, as vsurpeing vppon
Christes royal prerogatives, subverting the order of true Christian govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7044:10"/>
&amp; su allowing vp, as with full mouth, both the peoples liberty, and
Elders government, wherewtih Christ the Lord hath invested the true
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He proceedeth. <hi>But if this be so, then (sayth Mr Rob:)</hi>
               </hi> those ministers are
vnder no spirituall government: and so be lawlesse persons, and inordinate
walkers &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His answers are. 1. that</hi> they so govern themselves, as that no honest man
hath cause to abhor from theyr communion. 2 that they are subiect to civile govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
even in spirituall actions: &amp; in the larger acception of the word to externall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
merely spirituall. 3. <hi>that</hi> they are no more lawles persons, then I my self was
when I had no elder ioyned with me, or am now with <hi>myne</hi> one Elder, since I exclude
the people from all government.</p>
            <p>In these answers he neyther dealeth with me, nor the cause of the Lord,
as is meet. For first, I do not in my book inter this exception vppon the
former ground, as he sets it down for his advantage, as will appear in the
examination of the 3. answer. 2. I do not alledg it to prove communion
vnlawfull with them, as he insinuates, but to reprove, &amp; that vppon theyr
own plea, theyr Church-state, &amp; standing, as such, as wherein they ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do nor can enioy the <hi>spirituall externall government of Christ in his Church:</hi>
&amp; so <hi>neyther have that conscience, which is meet of the commaundements of Christ by

of the Lords ordinances, &amp; of this in speciall, for theyr guidance, &amp; conservation in his

Ghostes, turning it off another way, yet let the godly Reader with good
conscience remember that the disciples of Christ are to <hi>observ whatsoever he
hath commaunded</hi> his Apostles: &amp; withall that it was the Prophets comfort,

the outward guidance &amp; ordering of the Church in her publique affayrs,
by the Byshops, or Elders. And thus, and in this regarde all in the parrish
assemblyes (if not vnder the Prelates spirituall iurisdiction, as many would
make themselves, and others beleev) are <hi>lawlesse persons, &amp; inordinate walkers:</hi>
neyther is this myne assertion eyther <hi>lavish,</hi> or <hi>lawlesse,</hi> but a just &amp; neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
testimony agaynst theyr transgression: of which I wish them from the
Lord more conscience, &amp; for that purpose, better counsayl, then in this
<hi>manuduction</hi> they finde. Lastly, to make way to a touch of wit, vnto which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7044:10"/>
he cannot get by my wordes, &amp; meaning truely related, he takes liberty
to change the one &amp; other, for his advantage. I do p: 30 propound <hi>sundry
defences made by such</hi> both ministers, &amp; people, <hi>as dislike the prela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y:</hi> and the
first, of the people, to wit, that they are <hi>not subiect to the prelates government.</hi>
And that I intend this of the people, is evident by my reply in the same
place: the words whereof I have formerly noted down in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his answer. This by me spoken, and intended of the people, he
misapplyeth to the ministers, putting, as my wordes, <hi>These ministers are

the same reproof vpon my self as haveing been formerly with none, &amp; now
with one Elder, without government also, and so an <hi>inordinate walker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth then is, that the people professing themselves (though most
vntruely) to be from vnder the Prelates Spirituall government, do therein
professe themselves to be from vnder all christian church government: &amp;
that, both ministers, and people professing themselves to be from vnder
the prelates spirituall power, do therein professe themselves to be from
vnder all power of Christ for the censures; &amp; in those respects, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations

reason thereunto agreeable, are of absolute necessitie for a true ordinary
Church-officer, and minister of Christ; which for order sake I will reduce
to four heads.</p>
            <p>The first is, that there be a true visible Church, in which he is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted

               </q> Whereupon 1. I desire to know how the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Church of England can be true Ministers, not being made,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3, 1.</note>
and ordeyned such in and to any particular Church?<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 5.</note> 2. Since, as is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledged in the former part of the book, <hi>Every true visible Church is
a company of people called and separated out f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world,</hi> I would know how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and which of the parrish Churches consist of such a separated people,
and are not both (at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est) in their persons mixt of the people of God,
and the world, and also mixt in one nationall, provinciall, and diocesan
Church, or body with all the godles multitude, and part of the world in
that land? 3. I ad, that since <hi>a separated people from the world</hi> is but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Church, and that for a true Church a true form is also required,
it must also be shewed how that can be found there. This form cannot be
any particular act, which is transeunt, and passeth away, but something
constant, and permanent, without which resydeing actually in the whole
and all the partes thereof, the Church cannot consist one moment; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet can it be any personall thing eyther disposition, or other relation
whatsover: nor other, as I conceav, then a publique orderly covenant,
and union of a particular assembly, by which it hath in it self entyre right
to Christ, and to all the meanes of enjoying him: which I rayther wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h
could be, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleefe can be (for the present) found in any parrish Church
in the land. Lastly, if the Provinciall, and Diocesan Churches be not true
visible Churches (which I suppose is this Authours judgment) I would
know how the parrish assemblies being partes of the other, and so partes
of false Churches, can any more be reputed true Churches, then could a
particular Iewish Synagogue be reputed a true Church, which should have
made it self an entyre, and independent body in respect of the nationall
Church, and Temple?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:7044:12"/>
But now if any of the parrish assemblyes be thus separated in theyr per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall,
&amp; church estate, and formed accordeingly (though with defects, &amp;
wants) we desire to take knowledg of them, and which they be, that we
may rejoyce for the grace of God towards them, and perform vnto them
the dutyes of Christian fellowship, as is meet.</p>
