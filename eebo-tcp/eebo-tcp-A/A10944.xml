            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:128:5"/>

            <p>Wherefore to omit

this point, let vs only

Now, whereas vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable

ſome fierce and cruell,
as Dogs &amp; Lyons, that

and Foxes, full of ſhifts
and faire pretences. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
in this place, hath
to deale with the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For hee hath to
deale with <hi>Saul,</hi> who
hauing (for the time)

diſpoſition, wherewith

            <p>For firſt of all (put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on a brow of
braſſe,<note place="margin">Verſ. 13. 10. 12.</note> and a fore-head
of iron) hee telleth <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
by way of preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and againſt the
light of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,<note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note>
that he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
being put from
that ſtarting hole, and
<pb facs="tcp:128:7"/>
plainely conuinced of
a flat vntruth, hee ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it off from himſelfe
to the people; whom
yet hee iuſtfieth, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their end and
good intent, which was
(as he ſaith) to do ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the Lord their
God.<note place="margin">Verſ. 20. 21.</note> Thirdly, being
further conuinced of
his ſin, and the root of
it (that is, greedy aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice)
being layd open,
hee hardneth his heart
yet more, and with an
impudent face doth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie,
both himſelfe and
the people, as thinking
<pb facs="tcp:128:7"/>
it great pity, to kill ſuch
a goodly Prince as <hi>Agag</hi>
was, and to ſpoyle and
caſt away ſuch fat cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and make them a
prey for the fowles and
wilde beaſts, which
might ſerue for better
purpoſes; thus ſecretly
taxing the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord, of
too much rigor and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity,
&amp; making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
more wiſe &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
then God.<note place="margin">Verſ. 24. 25.</note> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
being driuen from
this hold, and ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
conuinced, that
he could not deny it to
<pb facs="tcp:128:8"/>
be a ſin; yet he ſeeketh
to extenuate and excuſe
it, as a ſin of infirmity,
which hee committed
not in contempt of
God;<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note> but for feare of
the people, which thing
alſo mooued <hi>Aaron</hi> to
make the molten Calfe.<note place="margin">Verſe 30.</note>
Laſtly, being brought
by maine force, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that his ſin
could not bee cloked,
nor excuſed, hee doth
not goe about to ſeeke
reconciliation, &amp; make
his peace with God; but
all his care is, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his honor, and to
<pb facs="tcp:128:8"/>
keep his credit with the
people.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
in this Treatiſe
two things: whereof
the firſt is the matter &amp;
ſubject thereof; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
the ſpeech and
manner of handling. In
regard of the former,
it may bee called, The
vncaſing, or diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

In regard of the latter,
it may be called (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

the Apoſtle.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 13</note>) A true
type and patterne of
wholſome ſpeeches or

words. The firſt is a fit

Miniſter of Gods

               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 15</note> opening and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of it with that
wiſdome, plainneſſe,

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE occaſion
of theſe words
was this. The
Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
King
<hi>Saul</hi> by <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet,
that hee ſhould goe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Amalekites, all,
both man and beaſt, and
leaue none of them aliue.
Touching the cauſe (ſeeing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:128:17"/>
it were too long to ſet
downe) I referre the Reader
to <hi>Deut. 25. 18. Saul</hi> went
about this worke of the
Lord very ſpeedily at the
firſt, as appeareth in verſes
3. 4. 5. but (as it is commonly
ſeene, that men are not ſo
forward and feruent in good
attempts vnto the end of
them, as they are hot in the
beginning) ſo it was with
him: for afterwards, when
he had taken the King, hee
ſhewed kindneſſe and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
towards him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the expreſſe charge
and commandement of the
Lord, and ſpared the beſt of
the Cattell, and deſtroyed
them not. For the which the
Lord was ſore diſpleaſed,
ſeeing he had ſerued him by
halfes, and done his buſines
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:128:17"/>
negligently.<note place="margin">Ieremy 48. 10.</note> God declared
to <hi>Samuel</hi> how greatly <hi>Saul</hi>
had offended him: <hi>Samuel</hi>
was exceedingly grieued for
him, and cryed to the Lord
all night to pacifie him. In
the morning he roſe early to
ſeeke <hi>Saul,</hi> that he might by
pittying his eſtate, moue him
to pitty himſelfe, and whiles
the offence was yet but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrought, hee might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
it, and intreate the
the Lord againſt it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
not hardning his heart.
This was the occaſion of
theſe words.</p>
            <p>The Text followes from
the 13. verſe. Firſt <hi>Samuel</hi>
found <hi>Saul</hi> glorying in his
Triumph ouer the Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites,<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, from Verſ. 13. to Verſ 30.</note>
and farre from any
thought that hee had done
any euill that hee ought to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:128:18"/>
repent of, inſomuch that at
his meeting of <hi>Samuel</hi> hee
preuented him, and beganne
to iuſtifie himſelfe, as though
he had done well, before <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
could tell him how
greatly his offence diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Lord. <hi>Samuel</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him thus to ſpeake, was
holden and hindred, from
telling him what God ſaid to
him of <hi>Saul,</hi> for the which
end hee came to him; and
therefore is cauſed firſt to
conuince him, that hee had
broken Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe hee heard the
bleating of the ſheepe, and
the lowing of the Oxen,
which hee had ſaued aliue,
and brought from the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lakites.
<hi>Saul</hi> firſt excuſeth
the matter by ſhifting, and
not ſaying any thing direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:128:18"/>
Then <hi>Samuel</hi> bad him
hearken what God had ſaid
of him the night before. And
he, nothing fearing (though
it is manifeſt that hee had
cauſe) boldly bad <hi>Samuel</hi>
ſay his minde, as though all
had beene well on his ſide.
Then hee told him, ſpeaking
from the Lord, that hee
brought him from a low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
to be a King, yet when
hee ſent him to deſtroy his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
the Amalekites, hee
obeyed him not, but did
what he thought good. But
<hi>Saul</hi> bluſhed not a whit for
al this, but waſhed his words
away, freeing himſelfe from
blame, and the fault that was,
he laid on the people, that
they indeede ſaued ſome of
the cattle aliue, but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was ſmall (hee ſaid) for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:128:19"/>
they did it to offer them to
the Lord in ſacrifice. This
anſwere <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhewed to
be weake: for what (ſaid he)
did God account of thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
in compariſon of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
him? But as ſmall a
fault as thou holdſt it, I can
tell thee, it will coſt thee thy
kingdome. At that word,
when he heard of loſing his
kingdome, he was much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
For we ſee for all his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
of himſelfe, and bold
deſending of his innocency,
yet this wrung from him a
confeſſion of his fault, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he ſaid the cleane
contrary, that he had ſinned
and ſought pardon; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<hi>Samuel</hi> to returne with
him to worſhip God, but he
would not, but confirmed to
him, that God had taken his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:128:19"/>
kingdome from him: yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
<hi>Samuell</hi> conſidering
that <hi>Agag</hi> was yet aliue, he
followed <hi>Saul,</hi> who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
God, but <hi>Samuell</hi>
did not accompany him
therein, but called for <hi>Agag,</hi>
and ſlue him: and after that,
<hi>Saul</hi> and he, parted each to
his owne houſe, and <hi>Samuell</hi>
went no more to <hi>Saul,</hi> to the
day of his death: (it is like
that he ſaw there was no end
thereof, neither any good
like to come thereby) but
much lamented his eſtate,
being deſperate. And this
for a view and ſhort ſumme
of the text in hand.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
of the words: whereof
there are three parts.</p>
            <p>The firſt containeth the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication betwixt <hi>Saul</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:128:20"/>
and <hi>Samuell,</hi> before the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
was deliuered, in the
firſt three verſes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is a part of the
meſſage, and <hi>Sauls</hi> anſwere
before hee confeſſed any
fault, to verſe 24.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third part conteines
the other part of the meſſage
after <hi>Sauls</hi> confeſſion, vnto
verſe 19. and ſuch other
things as follow towardes
the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>Euery part I will handle
thus. Firſt in ſome generall
manner I will ſhew the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereof, and afterwards
ſpeake more particularly of
the matter, by ſetting downe
the doctrine and the vſe. For
the firſt.<note place="margin">The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the firſt part.</note> When <hi>Samuell</hi> had
found <hi>Saule,</hi> and was readie
to tell him what the Lord
had ſaid to him that verie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:128:20"/>
night before, <hi>Saul</hi> preuents
him (as I ſaid) and tels him
how hee had executed the
charge which he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the Lord, concerning
the deſtroying of the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lakites,
when it was nothing
ſo, but manifeſt and cleare,
that he had very negligently
and ſlightly diſcharged it.
Then <hi>Samuell</hi> was ſtayed,
from telling him what the
Lord had ſaid to him, and
was driuen to anſwere him
to his ſo groſſe iuſtifying and
commending of himſelfe,
and to conuince him of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth
as he did, ſaying, if thou
haſt faithfully executed the
Lords Commaundement,
then thou haſt deſtroyed and
killed all that perteined to
<hi>Amaleck,</hi> but that thou haſt
not done, for I heare the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:128:21"/>
bleating of the ſheepe, and
the lowing of the Oxen,
which thou haſt brought

then that which was in <hi>Saul.</hi>
For hee that beareth reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

Miniſtery, which is Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:128:35"/>
for the ſaluation and

in ſuch contempt? and that

that the moſt are
ſo farre off from receiuing
their Miniſters, as the Augels
of God for their meſſage
ſake, that they are vile in
their eyes, and of all people

Neither offer they this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to the idle, ignorant,
proud and vnprofitable,
who if they are ſuch, as they
deeme them (their office ſet

ſaw how hee iuſtified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,

his vntrue, bold, and vnſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
commending of his
act done to the Amalakites:

it, and conuicted him, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:128:38"/>
proued by cleere euidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, that he groſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

ſaying, Why haſt thou not
then deſtroyed all, both men
and cattell? But haſt reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
ſome of them: For I
heare the lowing of the ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

Therefore thou haſt not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed

blinde, and full of ſelfe-loue,
do readily flatter themſelues
in their ſinnes, and are ſlow
to come to the examination
of them: and therefore if
they bee not rouſed vp and
made to ſee them as farre as
they haue giuen cauſe, by
prouing to their conſciences,
and conuincing them that
they are guilty, they accuſe
not themſelues, but goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in their ſinnes. And
therefore Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> among
all his graue and waighty

in themſelues, that they
are iuſtly found fault with.
And that is moſt likely, if any

good, namely to controle
the conſcience, and to cauſe
thoſe who are guiltie, to ſee
and acknowledge their ſins:
The which effect euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe

Therefore our Sauiour hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

him, that if he would
haue dealt vprightly and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

needes, either haue accuſed
himſelfe as guilty, or elſe he
muſt haue cleered and iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelfe: he did not the
firſt, and the laſt he could not
doe, being double hearted:
and therefore fell to meere
ſhifting and ſophiſtrie, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by his words, which
conteyne two points.<note place="margin">The words opened.</note> For
that which was euill done of
him and of the people, hee
layeth it wholy to their
charge, and yet he ſaith, if
they were faulty in that
which they did, it might be
the better borne, ſeeing they
did it to glorifie God by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
This was the firſt
point of his anſwere in theſe

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:128:44"/>
which thou heareſt, they
haue brought from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malakites,

was, that in the things that
God was obeyed in, he had
his hand in them, and was a
doer of them among the reſt,
in theſe words, <hi>the reſt we
haue deſtroyed.</hi> But in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
had he, think we obeyed
the commandment of the

hauing boldly and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
caſt it behinde his backe,
did he relent for and bewaile
his fault? oh nothing leſſe;
then it is cleere as I ſaid, that
he did but waſh off the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
reproofes, ſhameleſly
by a ſhift. For he knew that

confeſſed it.</p>
               <p>And this bewrayeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſin in hypocrites: that
though in words they can
make good their cauſe, and
can iuſtifie themſelues to be
as blameleſſe as any other,
yet hee that will obſerue it,
ſhall finde, that they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
bee brought to plaine
dealing, nor be willing, what
ſoeuer they ſay, to be iudged
by the Word of God. The
reaſon is, their conſcience
tels them they are guilty.
They would make a ſimple
body beleeue, that none
would more readily yeeld to
haue their doings tried by
the Scripture then they (as is
to be ſeene in them who call
for the day of the Lord)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:128:45"/>
which if they would doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,

themſelues to bee ſuch, as

it is nothing ſo with them,
but they pleaſe themſelues
in thinking, that their eſtate
is good, ſeeing they do ſome
things that are commanded:
but in what manner, and
with what affection, they do
them, and to what end, or in
how many things they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
they will in no ſort be

bringing in pretences of
their good workes and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
and that they bee not
(they hope) ſo bad as ſome,
&amp; that they would bee loath
it ſhould be proued by them,
meaning ſome open &amp; groſſe
offenders, or elſe thus they
ſhift and ſay, doe not ſome
profeſſors the ſame that wee
doe, yet they are thought
well of, and they would that
none did worſe then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and though they haue
not ſuch knowledge as ſome
haue (they ſay) nor cannot
make ſuch ſhewes as ſome
doe, yet they truſt they haue
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:128:46"/>
as good hearts, and meant as
well as the beſt. By theſe and
ſuch like ſhiftings they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelues; but what is
all this to the purpoſe, to free
themſelues from blame: Is
this to go to worke plainely,
and to ſticke to the Scripture
to bee tryed by them? The
which palpable and groſſe
deceiuing of themſelues,
when it is ſhewed them, doe
they acknowledge and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of it? which yet if they
were truely humbled, they
would doe. Therefore let it
be taken for a cleere note of

cleere themſelues by the

but ſhift for themſelues
diſhoneſtly, as hath beene

of them, which will

and how fearfull a thing
this hardening of the heart

melting and relenting of the

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:128:48"/>
which as it readily receiueth

him to an account for

that he yeilded not to him,
the fruite of them, that hee
will require at our hands,
how we haue vſed, the good
things that he beſtoweth on
vs; For thus he ſaith, I aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thee, &amp; did greatt hings
for thee, in reſpect of many

that I might haue thee more

to <hi>Dauid, Ieroboam</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
So that when men
come to receiue at Gods
hands any benefites, they
ſhould not only thinke of
the ſweetnes and greatnes of
them, and how they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
by him, which is the

               <p>Whereby we may ſee,
that God doth looke for it
at mens hands, that they
ſhould be knit to him, and
wholly at his pleaſure, when

that they looke for kindenes

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:128:61"/>
manyfold benefites now; as
it is to be ſeene generally
through townes and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and in infinite perſons,
in ſo much that I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
(and I will not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ſay it) that I would
thinke my ſelfe, as happie as
the moſt, if I could weepe
bitterly for the loſſe of this
people,<note place="margin">Eſay. 22.</note> and if my eies could
guſh out with water, for
that I ſee ſo infinite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
of God are ſo wickedly
beſtowed and waſted, euen
eſpecially and cheefely, in
whoredome, drunkenneſſe,
pride, idlenes, gaming, and
other ſuch abhominations,
and fruites of the fleſh: And
if I ſhould goe about parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
to ſhewe it in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
and ſnndry eſtates, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and perſons, I ſhould
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:128:62"/>
not knowe where, nor when
to make an end. Therefore
I will conclude this point,
that ſeeing God asketh to
haue another manner of
fruite, of his ſo innumerable
vndeſerued kindeneſſes, and
that where more is receiued,
there ſhould more bee yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him againe, I will I ſay
conclude with this ſpeach,
much like to that of the
prophet <hi>Amos.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amis. 3. 3.</note> This nation
and people among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath the Lord knowne,
and choſen to beſtowe his
goſpell and benefites vpon,
therefore he will moſt ſurely
viſit it for her iniquities,
and then it ſhall ſee that
there was an other manner
of vſe, to haue beene made
of them. This cauſeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, whome in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight

they call preciſians to
looke ſomewhat more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
to their liues then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe, knowing what
cauſe they haue receiued to
doe ſo, euen to render vnto
the Lord, the fruite thereof.
And yet we cannot yeilde
him one of the thankes, wee

<hi>Saul</hi> did we haue alſo heard,
that is, that in part, he did as
God had commanded him:
but how ſuch obeying plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

where he calls it wickednes,

ſaith, why haſt thou not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
the voyce of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:128:63"/>

So that when he ſerued
the Lord but in part, and (as
we ſay) by halfe ſeruice, God
vtterly abhorres it. To teach
vs, that he will not be ſerued
of vs by halfes, as that wee
ſhould do ſome thing which

not beare, nor put it vp at

               <p>And great reaſon,<note place="margin">Reaſons.</note> we may

               <p>And yet ſuch is the moſt

not with an honeſt and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

as I ſaid: euen as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

men, doe declare in their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:128:64"/>
owne words, who if they be
asked what they thinke the

goe to Church on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathes,

               <p>Now,<note place="margin">Such come ſhort of <hi>Saul.</hi>
                  </note> if they thinke and
hold this for their opinion,
that the ſeruing and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, conſiſts in ſuch
a ſleight keeping of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boath
(as by the ſpeach and
practiſe of too many may
eaſily bee gathered) I in
comparing them with <hi>Saul,</hi>
and making them like to
him, aſcribe more to them
then is their due. For the
ſtorie both in this and ſome
other chapters before, doth
clearely and largely ſhewe,
how he beſides the publique
ſeruing of God, did many
worthy and religious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:128:65"/>
and commendable, and
did ſee that God was in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
actions and partes of
his life, obeyed of him;
wherein he went before the
common ſort of ſuch as be
called Proteſtants, who are
not troubled from morning
to night, nor from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the weeke to the
end, how they obey or diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the lawes of God in the
courſe of their liues, or how
they liue: but hold this in
their iudgement, that they
neede not ſtretch their care,
nor take any thought that
way. And yet <hi>Saul,</hi> who did
goe before them ſo farre (as
may apparantly be ſeene,)
becauſe hee did not duely
looke vnto, and carefully
diſcharge ſuch duties as hee
tooke in hand, and in part
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:128:66"/>
alſo did performe, wee ſee
how God ſetteth him as it
were vpon the ſtage, as a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
ſtocke to be looked v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
and for not obeying
him ſendeth a heauie meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
vnto him, how he was
diſpleaſed with him, and
pronounced this fearefull
ſentence vpon him, to wit, it
repenteth me that I haue
made him King.</p>
               <p>And therefore what iuſt
cauſe haue the common ſort
of this people,<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the point. 1. To the péople of the worſer ſort.</note> to lament, and
bewaile their eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
who in this long
time wherein the goſpell
hath brought light among
them, haue not [I dare bee
bold to ſay and haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it] ſo much knowledge
and care as he had; nor oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie
themſelues ſo much in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:128:66"/>
many duties doing to God
in their particular actions,<note place="margin">2. To Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> as
he did: Yea, and if this were
well conſidered, what care
and diligence ſhould it ſtirre
vp in the miniſters, to pitty
this miſerable condicion of
the people, and with all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtnes
and loue, to make
the ſame known vnto them,
and to diſſwade them from
it, as much as in them lyeth?
For if God might iuſtly
challenge <hi>Saul,</hi> for this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
him by halfes and
ſlightly, what ſhall he haue
againſt them, who (a fewe
things excepted, and thoſe
yet to ſmall purpoſe) ſerue
him not at all in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
actions and courſe of
life? And yet that this may
be no defence for them, that
they goe with others to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:128:67"/>
publique place to worſhip
God, it may be truely ſaid,
that many of them doe that
more for loue then for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
and yet many heere
thinke, that for that very
action, they are to be taken
for right good Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But now that I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that the moſt part come
behind <hi>Saul</hi> for the practiſe
of religion,<note place="margin">3. To hollow profeſſors.</note> and obedience
to God, giue me leaue to go
a little further, and by this
occaſion of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſinne, to
ſhewe them their face as it
were in a glaſſe, who can in
no wiſe proue themſelues
better then he was. Of this
ſecond ſort therefore a little.
For I would be loath, whiles
I am ſpeaking againſt the
ſeruing of God by halfes, to
be iuſtly charged in this ſo
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:128:67"/>
weightie a matter, to do my
dutie but by halſes, by ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
but of the one halfe of
them, whome the text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth.
To paſſe therefore
from this ſort of men, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
which more nearely
reſembleth <hi>Saul,</hi> and in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
apparance goeth farre
beyond the former in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
duties: I make no doubt
but that the greateſt part,
who haue any vprightnes of
iudgement and gift to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne,
will readily agree
with mee in that I haue ſaid
of the former kinde. There
will be greater queſtion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this latter. Not for that
it is ſo doubtfull, but for that
many are ſo blinde in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
cauſes, and ſo partiall
in iudgement. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
euen this may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:128:68"/>
the queſtion, if in this
time of clearer light, men
can haue no greater proofe
of their godlines, and ſynce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
then <hi>Saul</hi> had in a time
of groſſer and deeper dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
I hope none will denie,
but that they are as deepe in
the puniſhment, and are as
guiltie of it, and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhall as certainly goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it as he did. And to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
thoſe two ſorts of
men, I did as I ſaide in the
beginning, vnfold this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Now therefore this I ſay,
if God could beare <hi>Saul</hi> no
longer, but giue him ouer to
be vexed with an euill ſpirit,
as appeareth he did in the
next chapter, and that for
his halting and obeying
God by halfes, and for that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:128:68"/>
hee did it not in ſynceritie
and faithfully, what hope
haue they to God-ward,
which doe the like? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if many now among vs,
not only worſhippe God
publiquely, but alſo priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take his word into their
mouthes, ſo that outwardly
and openly, they ſhewe
themſelues to bee good
Chriſtians, yea, if in many
things they doe after the
doctrine which they learne
out of the word, yet if they
do it but in ſome things, and
endeauour not in all,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> what
vprightnes can be in them?
According to that of ſaint
<hi>lames,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 2.</note> he that keepeth all the
commandements, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
ſome one of them, is
guiltie of all: meaning, that
he that will not be ſubiect
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:128:69"/>
to God in one thing as well
as in another, ſhall ſhew his
contempt of Gods maieſtie,
who is the law giuer, euen as
he doth who ſhall declare it
in many things: which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Apoſtle, agreeth
with that of the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiell:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note>
If a man be a theefe
or a ſhedder of blood, or
hath defiled his neighbours
wife, or if he doe any one of
theſe things, though he doe
not all of them, but hath
oppreſſed the poore, or hath
giuen forth vpon vſurie, hee
ſhall die the death, and his
blood ſhall be vpon him,
What can bee more plaine
then this,<note place="margin">Ezek 18. 10.</note> which the Prophet
ſpeaketh to proue, that
though a man be free from
many defilements, and yet
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ainted with ſome one; or if
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:128:69"/>
contrarily hee will bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in many duties, and
yet will not be ſubiect to the
will of God in other, which
he knoweth to be required
as well as in them, what is
plainer (I ſay) then this, that
God will not accept of him,
but take him for one which
ſerues him by halfes? And
who can gather, that <hi>Saul</hi>
was for any other cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
of the Lord?</p>
               <p>Then we muſt come from
this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſeruing of God,<note place="margin">What ſuch ſhould do.</note>
(which yet is farre before
the former) and yet alike
reiected of God as it is: and
conſequently all ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that God may accept of
their ſeruice, and take them
that offer it for his beloued,
in whome he delighteth,
muſt bring themſelues into
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:128:70"/>
a narrow compaſſe, and
ſtretch their care further;
that is to ſay, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
and couenant to take
heede to their wayes, and
courſe of life more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
and labour faithfully
in one thing as in another, to
pleaſe God according to the
meaſure of their knowledge.
And I dare boldly affirme
by the authority of theſe
forenamed ſcriptures, that
he which dyeth with leſſe
then this, and hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
for it, nor obtayned
pardon of it, dyeth in the
diſpleaſure of God and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaued.</p>
               <p>And this is moſt fearefull
if we conſider,<note place="margin">Further vſe of this doctrine.</note> that if any
beleeuing this, doe addreſſe
themſelues to this care and
practiſe, they are by and by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:128:70"/>
ſcorned and ſcoffed at,<note place="margin">1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of ſcorning.</note> and
reproachfully taunted, and
tawed with odious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
names of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
and ſuch like: as if
they would boldly contend
with, and ſet themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God in their ſo doing:
when he ſaith on the one
ſide to men, except they liue
thus they are indeede hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
and cannot be ſaued,
and they directly contrary
anſwere and ſay, if they doe
liue thus, they are diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers,
fooles and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
in which eſtate they
cannot be ſaued: For let him
that thinketh himſelfe wiſeſt
of theſe contemners and
diſcouragers of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
ſpeake. Is it for any
other cauſe that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and crie out of them
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:128:71"/>
then this? that their deedes
are good, and their owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill?
For if they could bee
content to ſerue God looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and to halfes as they doe,
there ſhould be no riſing of
heart againſt them: no veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but euen therefore they
are their ſongs and matter to
talke of. But if for all this
they will iuſtifie their halfe
ſeruing of God to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to commend them to
him, and that in ſo doing
none doe liue better then
themſelues, I leaue them to
a deeper conſideration of it.
I haue ſhewed what ſeruice
God requireth, euen ſuch as
they that offer it, ſhould take
heede that there be not at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time in any of them an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
heart; and that they
ſhould endeauour whether
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:128:71"/>
they eate or drinke, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
they doe, that all
ſhould be to the praiſe of
God: and by watching and

to <hi>Saul</hi> from God, I meane
an other ſin of <hi>Saul,</hi> though
more ſecret, yet horrible in
ſuch a man as he was eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally:
and that was that hee,
though a King, was ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in this halfe ſeruice of
God, by the deſire of the
goods and cattle of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malakites,
inſomuch that his

againſt the Lord,

he had done. For when hee
ſawe what commoditie and
benefite he might reape, in
this charge of killing the
Amalakites, he not looking
vuto the commandement of

deſtroy all, but to the bootie

for that you cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,

ſo great awe he had
them in: And therefore
ſmall likelyhood there was
heere, notwithſtanding his

and had little truth in it. And
by this we may learne; that

faultie in that which he
layed to the people:
doth make light of it. It tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs, when the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites

and found guilty, it doth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:128:100"/>
what it can to extenuate the
ſinne, and make it ſeeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
The reaſon is, becauſe
it is not repented of, but the
offender purpoſeth to lye
ſtill in it: and while it is ſo,
he loueth not to heare it
made odious, and to be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauated,
whereas they, who
turne to God in truth, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate
it to the vtmoſt that
they can, and why ſo? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe they neuer pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to commit, or to haue
to doe with it any more, as
we ſee in <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 2.</note> and in <hi>Paul.</hi>
In all this,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 15</note> 
                  <hi>Saul</hi> knew hee
ſpake vntruly: for the cattle
was not reſerued to bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
in ſacrifice, but as <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi>
charged him, to his owne
vſe; and yet when he ſawe
no other way to make his
part good, he did it by a lie,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:128:100"/>
which he thought could not
be knowne: It teacheth vs
that he who dareth doe euill
and ſinne againſt his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">And (if need be) hide it with a lie.</note>
will (if he be put to it)
hide his ſinne with a lie. As
we ſee it is bred in nature to
doe ſo, for little children if
they be charged with a fault,
will make it away with a lye.
But what lye made <hi>Saul?</hi> I
ſay a cunning lye, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell</hi>
could not knowe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
God had reuealed it to

yet as it is ſaid, men loue

becauſe their deeds are euill:

doe not countenance and
further the ſyncere prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

both preacher and

out from among them, and
content themſelues with the

And heere of it is that

that it may

wherein he
would haue couered the
fault (which hee could not
denie altogether) ſaying, it
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:128:108"/>
was to honour God which
they did: meaning the
beaſtes were reſerued, to be
offered to him for ſacrifice,
and therefore the fault (he
hoped) was not great; for
he had (he ſaid) obeyed the
Lord, &amp; gon the way which
he had commanded him.
This anſwer therefore of his,
in both points the Prophet
ſheweth to be but gloſing,
and dawbing with vntem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
mortar, and therefore
not able to ſtand him in any
ſtead. For know ſaith he,
that as concerning the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which thou ſpeakeſt of,
if thou haddeſt meant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to haue offred it to the
Lord (which yet thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
not, but reſerued the
beaſts as a pray to thine own
behoofe) yet if thou haddeſt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:128:109"/>
meant to offer them for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
the Lord will take no
ſuch offring, as is ioyned
with diſobeying him, as that
ſhould haue beene; but hee
looketh that his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
ſhould be obeyed.
This is the firſt part of his
replie or reproofe, when he
ſaith, hath the Lord as great
pleaſure in burnt offrings, as
that his voyce ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed?
no: but I tell thee,
to giue eare is better then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and to harken to his
commandement is better
then the fatte of rammes. In
the ſecond part of his ſpeach
vnto him, he tells him, that
as light as he made of his
fault, it was witting diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and rebellion againſt
the Lords commandement,
and that was euen as witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:128:109"/>

               <p>Therefore in this replie of
<hi>Samuell</hi> vpon <hi>Sauls</hi> anſwer,
he layeth out <hi>Sauls</hi> ſinne of
diſobedience in this verſe
and the next, and then tells
him of the puniſhment
which God had threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and that is in the

becauſe he made light of it,
ſeeing God (he ſaid) was to

was, and that was the

when he rung this alarom in

awoke him, as it appeareth in

was offred was wholy the
Lords, and did ſignifie that
he who offred it, did wholy
conſecrate himſelfe, ſoule
and body to the Lord. Now
theſe all being commanded
by God, muſt needs be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
accepted of him, which
being ſo, why was not the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:128:113"/>
offring of them accounted
obedience? For the anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this doubt, three
things are to bee marked.
Firſt, if obedience to the
morrall law, and ſacrifice
might goe together, they
were both accepted. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
if they could not go
together, (as oft times it fell
out they did not; for he that
was obedient could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
offer ſacrifice, and
one might offer ſacrifice,
who yet was not obedient
to God) in ſuch a caſe, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
was accepted of
God without ſacrifice.
Thirdly, ſacrifice might bee
offred by him who obeyed
not God, but that neuer
pleaſed God. Of this <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi>
ſpeaketh here, obedience
is better then ſacrifice: and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:128:114"/>
if <hi>Saul</hi> and the people meant
to offer any (as he ſaid they
purpoſed to doe) it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
being without obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and yet this is the moſt
and the beſt, that could bee
ſaid of it. So that, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
being better then ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
at the beſt; euen when
both went together: much
more is it better, when ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
goeth alone.</p>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 16. Sacrifice pleaſeth not God without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</head>
               <p>This being thus ſaid,
which was neceſſary,
let <hi>Samuells</hi> words [hath the
Lord as great pleaſure in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
as that his voice
ſhould be obeyed?) teach
vs, that the moſt religious
actions that God requireth
(ſuch as ſacrifices were) as
prayer, hearing the word,
the vſe of the Sacraments,
&amp;c. are in no account with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:128:114"/>
God, if he that vſe them be
not obedient in his life to
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of God
and a repentant Chriſtian.
A wonderfull and fearefull
doctrine (yet moſt true, for
this our age, wherein ſo few
are, or thinke it meete they
ſhould be obedient to the
truth in particular, which is
taught them, and haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to commend them
vnto God, vnleſſe it bee the
ceremonious worſhipping
of God, in the manner I
haue mencioned, a ſeruice
not better then the offring
of ſacrifice, which (we ſee)
without obedience was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth. Indeed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Reuel. 1. 3.</note>
bleſſed is
he that heareth and readeth,
and keepeth the contents of
that booke, but not he that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:128:115"/>
heareth and readeth only,
but that keepeth it alſo. So
then, this obedience to
Gods will, is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with ſacrifices, but to
be preferred farre before
them: ſacrifices were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings
to God which were
commanded, but ſo as they
offred them in faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
alſo: but obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is the fruite of both,
therefore to bee preferred;
The Lord tels the Iſraelites,
I required no ſacrifices of
your fathers, after that I
brought them out of Egypt
(meaning after that in Sinai)
but that they ſhould obey
my voyce,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 6.</note> and that is our
wiſdome,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 28.</note>
ſo he is not a Iew
which is one outwardly.
Therfore our outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is nothing, if the heart
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:128:115"/>
goe not with it: whatſoeuer
men anſwere in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
if they obey not,
prayer is nothing cap. 13.13
we hold the generall, but the
particular, we looke not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
for then our hearts
ſhould be taken vp wholy in
one dutie after another,
which now is ſcarcely done
in any, to purpoſe. And it
is called obedience of faith,
ſeeing we muſt beleeue that
God requireth a thing of vs,
before we can, or will do it.
But men deale with God, as
one with another, for they
cogge and deceiue, and time
muſt waſh it away, and then
good fellowſhip againe, ſo
they diſobey God, and after
they would be friends again
with him.<note place="margin">The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine more fully ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note>

               <p>Out of the prophets words

in this verſe and the next,

all diſobedience is to
the commandement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
will of God, and
withall, how we ſhould cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſuch diſobedience, and
thinke of it in our ſelues. In

when the prophet ſaith, hath
the Lord as great pleaſure

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:128:116"/>
manner reprooue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
though they offred to
the Lord ſacrifice, ſeeing
they were diſobedient.<note place="margin">Eſay 1.</note> Doe
you offer to mee the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of your ſacrifices? I am
full of your burnt offrings
ſaith the Lord: I haue no
pleaſure in the blood of
your lambes and goates; and
that ye come to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mee, who required this
at your hands? with many
like ſpeaches: and yet wee
know as hath bene ſaid, that
God commanded all ſuch
things. But why then doth
he thus refuſe them at their
hands? and ſay he will ſhut
his eyes when they ſtretch
out their hands vnto him,
and when they poure out
many prayers vnto him, he
will not heare them? This
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:128:117"/>
he ſaith vnto them, not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
becauſe hee did diſlike
the things themſelues, but
for that their workes were
euil who offred theſe things,
and they did not obey the
Lord in other things, which
he commanded them: and
therfore he ſaith, waſh you,
make you cleane, take away
the euill of your workes
from before mine eyes, and
ceaſe to doe euill, or elſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me none of your prayers
nor ſacrifice: ſuch a thing it
is to diſobey the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of God, that they
which doe ſo, although they
ſhould offer to God their
prayers and praiſes, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Ioh. 9.</note>
yet he will not accept
them at their hands, but caſt
them backe in their faces, as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:128:117"/>
dunge, as not heere only,
but in many other places he
bewrayeth his vtter deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſuch kinde of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
him: but behold
now he goeth further in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing
diſobedience, for he
ſaith, it is as witchcraft and
Idolatrie:<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 16</note> ſo in Pſal. 50. he
maketh it odious ſaying,
what haſt thou to do to take
my name into thy mouth,
and hateſt to be reformed?
And in the Prouerbs,<note place="margin">Prou. 28. 7.</note> he that
turneth away his eare from
hearing the Law, euen his
prayer is an abhominacion
vnto the Lord. With which,
agreeth that of the Apoſtle
to the Romans, he is not a
Iewe, which hath the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
circumciſion in the
fleſh, but inward,<note place="margin">Rom 2 28.</note> in the
heart. Out of all which it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:128:118"/>
is cleere and euident, that if
a man be not vnfainedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
to bee ſubiect vnto
God, and obedient to his
will, in vaine doth he make a
ſhew and profeſſion therof.
Now to bee obedient in
ſome things, and in other to
be vndutifull (wee know) is
no obedience, but contempt
of God, for which cauſe
Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 10.</note>
                  <hi>he that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
the whole Law, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
any one point of it is guilty
of all:</hi> for he that will be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable
in one, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that he dare prouoke
God, and ſet light by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
in other points, who
gaue him his Law: and if he
dare tranſgreſſe in one, and
take libertie therein to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
who doubteth but hee
will do the ſame in another?
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:128:118"/>
ſo that he, that is not affraid
to offend in one thing, euen
the leaſt, knowing it to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euil,
may wel be ſaid to haue
no feare to offend in any of
all, no not the greateſt.</p>
               <p>So truly hath our Sauiour
giuen teſtimony to this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 10.</note>
                  <hi>He that is faithfull in the

and he that is vniuſt in the

neceſſarily hath God ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the obeying of one with
the obeying of the reſt; and
the renouncing of one ſinne
with the renouncing of all
other, (as he ſaith by ſaint
Iames,<note place="margin">Iam. 2.11.</note> 
                  <hi>he that ſaid, thou ſhalt

<hi>thou ſhalt not kill: now though
thou doeſt none adulterie, yet
if thou killeſt thou art a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor
of the Law.</hi> This is
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:128:119"/>
not alleadged by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
nor mencioned by mee,
as though we affirmed that
any man can keepe the Law,
or all the commandements
except ſome one; but to
teach, that there is no care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
obeying of one, in him
who hath not care, and doth
not endeauour to obey all:
and ſo doe all other ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
meane, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
obedience, as well as
this preſent text of ours,
they require it in one part of
the commandement as well
as in another, and not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
but particularly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one, or ſome fewe,
but in all.</p>
               <p>For elſe we might endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to ſerue God in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
and diſobey him in

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:128:119"/>
of the doctrine of the
holy profeſſion of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
which if it be ſo, then
it followeth, that all which
worſhip God outwardly,
and would be taken to be
religious, and looke not to
their particular wayes, are
deceiued and lie ſtill in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and God they pleaſe
not, but ſhall be challenged
of him, for workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie:
which the more I
conſider, the more I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile
at it, becauſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part take no knowledge
of any ſuch thing: for they
that draw themſelues from
nothing that they luſt after,
neither feare to offend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they do euill, nor trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for it when they haue

<hi>what haue I done?</hi> If they

quarrell, braule, reuenge,

ſinne in other, or doe
any ſuch like ſinne, it is but
their ordinarie and common

to be pricked in conſcience,
for any thing they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe;
and as for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſeruice, the Lord is not
pleaſed with it, when his

them who bare great ſhews,<note place="margin">Micah. 6. 6.</note>
yet they ſought to pleaſe

<hi>Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

<hi>he hath ſhewed thee (O

and what is good, ſurely
to doe iuſtly and to loue mercy,
and to humble thy ſelfe to

               </p>
               <p>Which plainely teacheth
vs,<note place="margin">Vſe both of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> that if men muſt bee ſo
farre from committing wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
that it is required of

they out of fauour with

wittingly diſobey in both?
and repent of neither. And
if they be not in fauour with
God who offend thus as I
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:128:121"/>

where ſhall they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
who defend that they

on ſuch as dare not goe ſo

vnlike are ſuch to them, who
hauing but ſome one ſinne,
(as anger) to encounter

ſeeing God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

no ſuch (nay I may ſay,
few of all the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of profeſſors) do in any
other manner then general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and in words only, hold
that we ſhould offer to the

the obſeruing of our wayes
particularly to ſee that they
pleaſe God,<note place="margin">Prou. 4. 18</note>
or the keeping
of our hearts with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that our liues may be
ſutable (as the wiſe man
ſpeaketh) they hold it as a
thing meerely ridiculous:
for then ſhould they ſee
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:128:122"/>
cauſe (as others doe whom
they count fooles,) to looke
to the particulars, and to one
part of their liues as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to be taken vp in
their conſultacions and
thoughts, how in one duty
as well as in another they
might pleaſe God; whereas
now they ſhew, that al is too
little to pleaſe themſelues.
But ſuch deale with God, as
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> neighbours deale one with

till they breake out into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
and contention, &amp; hard
thinking one of another, and
then time &amp; a little abſcence,
muſt waſh away diſpleaſure:
and ſo they winde in toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againe, and are good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
and friends: So men
deale with God: for if the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:128:123"/>
hardeſt fall out with them as
they count it, that by the
light of preaching they muſt
needes ſee, that they are
ſhamefully out of the way,
(which they will not bee
brought to acknowledge for
their common faults &amp; ſins)
but yet if they muſt needes
ſee their liues foulely out of
order, and that thereby God
is ſore diſpleaſed with them,
at the hardeſt, if they come
to Church, and there doe as
others; they thinke they
ought to be receiued into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
with God, and their ſins
muſt be forgiuen them, and
all muſt take them for good
Chriſtians, or elſe they doe
them great wrong. But if
God will accept the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of ſuch (in reuerence
be it ſpoken of his Maieſtie)
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:128:123"/>
hee did <hi>Saul</hi> vtter wrong,

more good actions, both

yet ſeeing it is cleare that he
was reiected of the Lord, I
do conclude, that ſuch kinde
of obedience as I haue here

diſobedience, and that they

that thou haſt done againſt

And although I nor this

maketh their offence greater,

               <p>Hitherto, theſe two things

God vnto him; it is cleere

and after the word of God,

all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes
which he had before,

who thinke ſimply

yet (if euer they turne to

ſhiftes and excuſes? Who

then he that hid his

was committed to him: for
that is ſure, in ſo doing hee
did no euill with it; but did
that excuſe ſerue him? no:
but becauſe it was giuen him
to doe good with, and to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie,

when the Word of
God reprooueth them, that
they will anſwer it well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and when Preachers
conuince them, they hope
God will not deale with
them ſo hardly, as they doe:
and men loue alwaies to

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:128:133"/>
flatter and deceiue their

wiſely foreſeeing his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw

men can ſhift off the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their ſinnes, that
they may not terrifie nor

they thinke their eſtate good
enough, and ſo dance in a

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:128:134"/>
And how can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?
Doth not the ſcripture
tell vs plainely, that he who
followeth not the light wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in darknes, and cannot
tell where he goeth. But we
may know that when men
beginne to conceiue of their
eſtate, and their doing, not
being guided by the light of
knowledge, they are out of
the way and deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and when they crye
peace,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8 17 Compared with 12. 20</note> peace, there is no
peace; they finde not that
which they hope for, much
like vnto them who would
haue a King, and be like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nations, and that they
thought beſt for them (ſay
the Prophet what he could
to the contrary) did they
not finde to their coſts, that
they erred in the imaginaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:128:134"/>
of their hearts,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.</note> and were
deceiued? The young man
to whom <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh,
who will needes rejoyce in
his youth, and take his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
if ye tell him that there
is any danger towards him,
will he beleeue it? and doth
he not therefore come to
iudgement, and prooue by
wofull experience, that his
dreames in thinking all is
well with him, are vaine, and
diſapoint his fooliſh hope?
And to ſhut vp this point,
what is clearer then that in

that Ieruſalem had grieuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly

remembred all her pleaſant

which ſhee had enioyed:
and although this bee not
fulfilled in all euery day, yet
doe vnbeleeuers hold their

God will plucke them out

               <p>And therefore they are

who beware of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

prouide in euery ſtate of life

it is ſaid by our Sauiour <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are the meek, for they ſhall

               <p>The vſe of this, is to teach vs
to acknowledge, that in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular, as when wee
be depriued of inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
outward peace, health
wealth, or any other thing,
appertaining either to the

and finally to raine them

And thus I conclude that

hauing heard how <hi>Samuel</hi> hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to bring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
It is ſayd here,
that <hi>Saul,</hi> as bold denials as
he made of his ſinne, and for
all his iuſtefying of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that he had obeyed the
will of God, in this warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Amaleck,</hi> yet contrary
to all likelyhood, hee now
bewrayeth, to his owne
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:128:141"/>
great ſhame, that hee had
lyed in ſo ſpeaking, and ſo
had not vttered the truth;
for ſo it is ſayd here of him,
<hi>I haue ſinned, in that I did not
obey the commandement of
the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But while <hi>Samuel</hi> doth
thus narrowly and neerely
follow hard vpon him, mee
thinkes I heare ſome Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and Pittyers of <hi>Saul,</hi>
thus ſcornfully braying out.
Oh ſeuere <hi>Samuel!</hi> and oh
wofull times, and vnhappy
ſtate to liue in, when great
men muſt be purſued of ſuch
baſe fellowes, when Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and Prophets muſt bee
ſo bold with their betters:
yet welfare the good high
Preiſt <hi>Azariah,</hi> who (ſay
they) with held ſuch open
mouthed and vnciuill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:128:142"/>
from the Kings Court.
And againe, is it meet that a
mean Miniſter ſhould preſſe,
and bee ſo bold with great
perſonages? I haue heard
little leſſe with mine owne
eares, of prophane and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Gentle-men (as they
are called) but to anſwer
them, they ſee it was meet
then, and the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the higheſt King,
that the Prophets of God
(who were reuerend men of
God, and by <hi>Sauls</hi> owne
confeſſion, Gods Choſen,
and not baſe and of meane
account) ſhould do his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
vnto them, that are great
in place and authority, both
publiquely and priuatly, and
as they gaue cauſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the manner and
quality of their offence,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:128:142"/>
ſhould reproue them in the
name of God, and yet gaue
them their due honour, as
became them, for their owne
parts, being their inferiours;
yea, and when they thus did
their meſſage, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
of ſuch, as were wiſe
and religious, as became the
Amhaſſadours of the high
God: yea, and ſo did <hi>Saul</hi>
himſelfe honor and receiue
<hi>Samuel.</hi> I ſay thus it was
then, and thought meet it
ſhould be ſo: but ſo are men
degenerate now from that
practice, that meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
then Nobles would,
with reproch and contempt,
thruſt ſuch an one as <hi>Samuel</hi>
from them, and ſcorne any
reproofe that hee ſhould
bring to them, how iuſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
and in beſt manner it
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:128:143"/>
ſhould bee done vnto them.
And yet I ſpeake not, as
though I thought that all of
that eſtate and degree were
ſuch; but know and am
perſwaded that there are
ſundry of them; yea, and of
the Noble themſelues, who
receiue the Miniſters of God
as his Meſſengers, to whom
(as vnto meaner perſons) I
wiſh no worſe then this, that
both they may enioy ſuch,
plentifully among them, and
receiue them with that reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and credit giuen vnto
them, that they may both
make the ſcorning Atheiſt,
and prophane ſort, more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dions

cannot abide their ſtinking
dung-hill to bee ſtirred, and
may themſelues reape the

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:128:143"/>

               <p>Now followeth (after <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi>
long trauerſing the
matter with <hi>Saul</hi>) his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of his ſinne: and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
he is brought after ſo
many ſhamefull and fearfull
denials, of that which <hi>Samuel</hi>
had charged him with, at
length, to confeſſe; and for
that here are other things of
weight, to be conſidered of,
I will ſtay a while, and refer
that, which I haue to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this matter of <hi>Sauls</hi>
confeſſion, to theſe foure
poynts. Firſt, I will ſhew
the odiouſneſſe of this ſin, in
that he had ſo oft and boldly
denyed his being in fault,
yet did now confeſſe it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:128:144"/>
I will declare how,
aud by what meanes, he was
brought to confeſſe it.
Thirdly, ſeeing hee did ſo
(which hee was very vnlike
to come to) whether in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
hee repented alſo.
And fourthly, becauſe it
ſhall appeare, that hee did
not, therefore euen his very
confeſſion ſhall bee ſeene to
be another note of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
in him.</p>

               <head>Doct. 21. An hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite makes no conſcience of lying.</head>
               <p>Concerning the firſt;
of the foulneſſe of his ſin;
in that hee had ſo oft iuſtified
himſelfe (as much as in him
lay) about the accuſations
which the Prophet brought
againſt him, who doth not
ſee how odious it was in
him? And who would not
haue beene perſwaded, that
he ſpake the truth, being ſo
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:128:144"/>
great a perſon as he was, and
ſo boldly and reſolutely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
it, when he ſayd, hee
had fulfilled the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord, when yet
<hi>Samuel</hi> charged him from
God, that he had broken it?
And whom (almoſt) may a
man beleeue, if hee might
not bee reſted in, and giuen
credit vnto? This is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to teach vs, that it is a
moſt ſhameful and greeuous
offence, when men hyd their
ſinne, and deny that they
are guilty, when yet they
ſhall after confeſſe it freely,
and bee contrary to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and ſo lay out their
ſhame to them that liue with
them, when they ſhall affirm
boldly, that they are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
yea, with oath and
proteſtation, that it is ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:128:145"/>
as hee that heareth
them ſhall ſay; Doubtleſſe,
they ſpeake the truth. And
yet afterward, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ſhall deny that, which
they ſo vehemently affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
Oh how fearefull a
thing it is?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Examples and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</label> A notable example wee
haue of this,
in the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of Bethel: who, when
hee had for his owne vaine
credit, drawne the man of
God, who came from luda
(contrary to the expreſſe
commandement of God) to
eat in that place;<note place="margin">1 King. 13.</note>
yet, to his
owne great ſhame, hee was
forced to confeſſe, that hee
had made a lye, in ſaying;
that an Angell appeared to
him, and bad him doe ſo.</p>
               <p>It is the common practice
of men,<note place="margin">2.</note>
to ſay and vnſay, to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:128:145"/>
affirme and deny the ſame
thing, though it hath beene

So that a man
ſhall haue peaceable and

and yet falſhood in his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 27</note> as <hi>Ioab</hi> ſaluted <hi>Abner</hi>
friendly, and yet ſmote him
ſo, that he died.</p>
               <p>This ſinne is ſo bred in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and confirmed by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
that Gods deare ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
are not free; but are
ſometime ouercome of it, as
we ſee in <hi>Peter;</hi> who, as well
as hee loued his Maſter, and
profeſſed himſelfe to be his
Diſciple; yet, by a ſmall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
was brought to deny
that hee knew him, by oath
and proteſtatiou. And if it
bee thus with men, in ſinnes
committed in the ſight of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:128:146"/>
men, as this of <hi>Saul</hi> was, how
much more doe men deale
with God in their ſecret ſins?
to hide, excuſe, and extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
them, as if they were
none, &amp; asif none were who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
and ſounder then they,
when yet afterward, when
the Lord ſeeth good to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skirt
them, they be forced to
cry out as the Prophet did;
but in a far better caſe, when
hee had ſeene the Lord of
glory:<note place="margin">Eſay 6.</note>
                  <hi>Woe is mee, I am vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the caſe of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi>
when the Lord gaue
him his charge, to goe and
to crie againſt Nineueh, hee
fled from his preſence, and
went another way to Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh.
And leaſt hee ſhould
haue beene brought backe
againe (ſo little was he trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:128:146"/>
for his ſinne) hee made
all poſſible haſt to bee gone,
and paid for his carriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand, and went downe
into the ſhip, &amp; ſlept ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
ſo that the fierce wind &amp;
ſore tempeſt, that made the
Mariners afraid, could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
him. Then the ſhip ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
rouſed him vp, ſo that he
ſaw the great danger that he,
with the reſt, was in; for all
that, hee bewayled not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cried out of his ſinne:
and vntill he was ſingled out
by lot, wee read no word of
any remorſe that he had for
it; but for all his concealing
of it ſo long, then hee was
loden with the burthen of it
and repented. But oh how
long firſt? and how gladly
would he haue ſhifted it off?
And thus we would doe all,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:128:147"/>
through our corrupt nature,
when wee haue offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Maieſty, euen flie
from his preſence if wee
could, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, and
ſhake off all thought, and
goe from all deſire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
it to God. But that
ſhall bee with the greater
ſhame to vs, when God ſhall
plucke vs out of our dens
and corners, wherein we had
hid our ſelues.</p>
               <p>And thus <hi>Dauid,</hi> who had
not accuſed himſelfe for his
foule and groſſe adultery
and murther, till <hi>Nathan</hi> the
Prophet, from God, had
challenged him for it; yet
after that, cryed out of his
imborne corruption, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that to bee the cauſe
of the other, ſaying, <hi>I was
borne in ſinne,</hi> and by that,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:128:147"/>
was carried to ſinne againſt
thee in ſecret, and ſo tell to

               <p>The vſe of this doctrin is,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note>
that we ſhould bee wary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

and if yet through frailty we
be ouertaken any way, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpy

that this and ſuch like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

much falſhood and deceit,

then wee haue proofe
and experience of mens

ought not to bee too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,

nor too ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

And moſt of all, if
it bee in a matter concerning

as their credit. For,
men will lye moſt groſſely,
to enrich themſelues, and to
ſeeke their pleaſure and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
and therfore, when

in ſuch a caſe will not ſtraine

that they will neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray

hereby it doth come to

hardly, and with much ado,
will they bee made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe

many to thinke them inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and falſely charged.
And yet to the bewraying
of ſuch, and bringing them
forth to their ſhame, and
that the iuſt and vpright,
who come againſt them,
may bee iuſtified, God doth
oft times himſelfe (when
there is no other way to be

them to confeſſe their guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

ſee it came to paſſe here in
<hi>Saul,</hi> and daily doth and

But the Deuill holdeth them

denyed his ſin. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee would bring him to
confeſſion of it, though to

for the inſtruction of his

It was neither wrung from

was he brought to it by
flattery (for hee that dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nor ſo much as to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his ſin, for that he had
done in the verſes going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
but <hi>Saul</hi> waſhed off
all, as wee haue heard.
But the Lord drew him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it by ſtrong hand, whom
he could not reſiſt nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
               <p>And though the telling
him of loſing his kingdome
went neere him; and it is
certaine, that he would haue
done very much, to haue
kept and retained it, and hee
was more moued with the
hearing of that word, then
all that concerned the ſauing
of his ſoule. Yet what was
his confeſſion able to doe,
toward the preſeruing of his
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:128:151"/>
kingdome, which hee knew
wel enough. It was the Lord
therefore that drew him to

vs, that God who doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull

lyars, diſſemblers, and
ſuch as none can wring
from them, the leaſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of ſinne, which
yet is well known, that they
are guilty of it, and do (with

Lord will make, euen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to bring it to light, &amp;
confeſſe it.</p>
               <p>And this he doth for theſe

Firſt that all may

except the Lord ſhould

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note>
the Lord doth
it to this end, that we ſhould
not hide, denie, or extenuate
our ſinnes when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted
of them, or when we
ought freely to confeſſe
them, for by ſo doing wee
ſhall encreaſe our ſinne, and
either be forced afterwards
with the more ſhame to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
it, as <hi>Saul</hi> heere did, or
be preſſed with the load and

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note>
that wee ſhould
not be too light of credit to

earneſt therein, for they may
(for all that) euen themſelues
auouch the contrary.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">4.</note>
to this end God
will thus drawe men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
to feare vs from
bold denialls of the truth,
and to teach vs to rule our
hearts, &amp; gouerne our liues
in ſuch good manner, that he
bee not driuen to ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
arreſtings of vs.</p>
               <p>To this end I thinke it
not amiſſe,<note place="margin">A remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this doct.</note> to tell you of a
report which a graue Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
vttered in the Pulpit,
and it was this. There was a
man who had committed a
fearefull murther. Hee was
conuicted thereof by the
Law, he vtterly denyed it:
he was vrged by his friendes
to confeſſe it, but in no wiſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:128:153"/>
would be brought to it: the
Preacher tooke him in hand,
but he would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it, he was brought to
the place of execution, and
there he was much laboured
with to acknowledge it,
but for all this, hee would
yeeld no whit. What of all
this, ye will aske, or to what
end is this example al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged?
I anſwere to very
great, for when all hope was
paſt, and hee was caſting
downe from the ladder, hee
claſped his hands about the
gallowes, and cryed out ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it was I that committed
the murther. It is therefore
to bee feared, that at the
death God will force ſuch
men to confeſſe, (to their
woe) that which in their
health and proſperitie they
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:128:153"/>
would neuer be brought to.
We read of <hi>Achan,</hi>

when <hi>Gehazai</hi> the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant

had ſeene great offers made
to his maſter, of ſiluer and
gold by <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian,
for healing him of his lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and that his maſter had
refuſed them, we read that
he went after the noble man,
when he was departed from

when he came as at other

                  <note place="margin">2 King. 5. 25</note> did hee confeſſe it?

<hi>thy ſeruant went no

it will winde in with them
that euen the wiſe may bee

that wee euer haue our hearts in

and to pleaſe

the eſtate of all ſuch, as
looke after no ſerious and

more particularly, the ſloth,
pride, and prophanenes of
many in the miniſtrie: the
little regarding of Gods
matters, and ſetting vp of
his honour, and magnifying
the goſpell as they may: in
many of them who haue rule
ouer other, how little care
they haue to rule them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues?
(though no time be
too much to look after their

own profit, pleaſure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment)
and in all ſorts of

they goe to worke, ſetting
earth before heauen, darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

their fooliſh delights more
then God, <hi>and hauing a ſhew

their ſorrow and woe not
ſarre of; Oh that I could
perſwade them, that which
I knowe; and that mine eies
were a fountaine of teares,
that I could weepe bitterly,
for the deſolation that ſhall
come on them. for let them
ſay as long as they will with
<hi>Saul;</hi> wee in thus liuing, doe
pleaſe God and obey him,

To whom I anſwere, alas, that action

as may bee thought:
it was not free and vnfeined

                     </gap> nor he conſtant
in it, and therefore it was far
from being a fruite of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing the cauſe muſt
firſt be reaſoned of, before it
be concluded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will firſt ſay
on both ſides ſomewhat; I
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:128:161"/>
meane what likelyhood of
repentance was in <hi>Saul:</hi> and
on the other ſide, what may
be brought forth and ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, wherupon the truth
will ſoone appeare.</p>
                  <p>That which may moſt
probably be ſaid for it, that
I can ſee or finde, is this.
Firſt, that this confeſſion of
ſinne was not only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
but alſo particular, and
of that very ſin with which
he was charged, and which
he had before denyed. For
if it had beene but generall,
it might haue ſeemed to bee
leſſe regarded. And as hee
did it particularly, ſo it was
that, wherein he had moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.
Secondly, this may
be ſaid for ſome likelihood
of his repentance, that hee
did after this, call <hi>Samuell</hi> to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:128:161"/>
goe with him to worſhippe
God, and deſired him to
pray for him.</p>
                  <p>But theſe were very weake
proofes, as ſhall eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by them, that ſhall be
brought on the contrarie,
and by that which ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bee ſaid of them. For
concerning his confeſſion, it
was no better then Iudaſſes,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 4.</note>
which was alſo of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſin, and that which moſt
concerned him, as may bee
ſeene by his words, when he
ſaid, <hi>I haue ſinned in betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the innocent blood:</hi> and it
was nothing like <hi>Dauids</hi> in
ſoundnes, who yet did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
but generally, ſaying,
<hi>I haue ſinned.</hi> Indeed for the
outward manner of <hi>Sauls</hi>
confeſſion layd forth in
words,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> there can no eccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:128:162"/>
be made againſt it: And
I graunt that there was no
more to be ſeene in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note>
whereby they teſtified
their true repentance. But
we muſt know that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is neuer in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
neither ought of vs to
be meaſured by the outward
confeſſion only, but by the
vprightnes of heart; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
after God, who hath
beene ſo ſore prouoked, and
by the vnfained faith of the
partie, and by the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and forſaking of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Theſe graces muſt bee
found to accompany con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
ſo that it may bee
ſound and good, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them it is nothing
worth: and <hi>Sauls</hi> being
voyd of theſe, was in no
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:128:162"/>
wiſe to be taken for a true
note of repentance. And
that theſe muſt go with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
is to be ſeene in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places of ſcripture. For
<hi>Dauids</hi> confeſſion, that it
came both from faith and
repentance, is cleere by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi>
words, ſaying to him,
vpon his confeſſion made,
<hi>the Lord hath forgiuen thee
thy ſinne:</hi> which is neuer
obtained without them.
And ſo <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Prou. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>hee
that confeſſeth and forſaketh
his ſinne</hi> (which is done of
none, but of him who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth
it to bee forgiuen
him) <hi>hee ſhall finde mercie.</hi>
And therefore <hi>Sauls</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
not going with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
of his ſinne (for hee
waxed worſe after it) neither
comming from faith, which
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:128:163"/>
muſt haue gone before both,
I conclude, that it was voyd
of repentance. And for his
worſhipping of God which
is the other thing alleadged
to proue it, ſeeing hee grew
worſe after it, let all iudge
as they ought, and they ſhall
finde that as weake, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſo weighty a matter, as
his confeſſion doth, for
what change was in him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(except from euill to
worſe) or what ſigne all that
preſent time, or afterward
that his heart relented, and
melted for diſpleaſing God?
without the which, all the
reſt was but <hi>as the morning
dewe,</hi> which is ſoone licked
away with the heate of the
Sunne: Indeede hee ſaid, <hi>I
haue ſinned, yea, and to</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
<hi>pray for me to the Lord,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:128:163"/>
that hee would forgiue my ſin;
and againe: returne with me
that I may worſhip the Lord:</hi>
but what of all this? Did he
not ſhewe himſelfe to be the
ſame he was before?</p>
                  <p>But to ſay any more of
<hi>Sauls</hi> ſinne, ſeeing it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in the ſtorie following,
and I ſhall haue occaſion in
my text to ſay enough of it,
I will not trouble the reader
with needleſſe repetitions,
but referre him thither.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of the
third point of the foure,
whether <hi>Saul</hi> in confeſſing
his ſinne, repented alſo.</p>
                  <p>From which diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Vſe of this diſcourſe.</note>
yet let this bee learned, that
many Proteſtants in our
dayes, come far behind <hi>Saul</hi>
in his confeſſion: for hee
made it particularly, and of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:128:164"/>
that ſinne which was moſt
brought againſt him of all
other, by <hi>Samuel:</hi> but thoſe,
of whom I ſpeake, make ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
no confeſſion, or in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
onely, as that wee are
all ſinners; or if of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
they ſhall bee ſuch as
concerne them not: as if a
worldly man ſhould pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
pride and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or when they ſay the
Confeſſion in the Church
after the Miniſter, neuer
marking what they ſay: and
the beſt of them doe but as
he did, that is, confeſſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And thoſe that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
theſe manners of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
are many thouſands.
Theſe come behinde <hi>Saul</hi> in
their confeſſion, as they may
eaſily ſee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:128:164"/>
But to goe a little further:
let the beſt looke that they
haue better proofes of their
good eſtate and welfare to
God-ward, then the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of their ſinnes, how
particularly ſoeuer they bee
made: for, they are no good
euidences thereof. Yea, and
not onely ſo, but let them as
well beware, that other
ſhewes of godlineſſe (as
weeping for ſinne ſomtime)
doe not deceiue them, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other common gifts of
the Spirit, as to be ſometime
well moued at a Sermon, for
none of them can witneſſe
their aſſurance, or be ſound
and cleere proofes to them
of their ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>And therefore let other
weake Chriſtians take heed,
that they bee not offended,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:128:165"/>
neither take occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from their good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
in their profeſſion,
when they ſhall ſee ſuch,
who are of good hope, to
go away from the good that
ſeemed to bee in them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let them faint and
ſay, oh they ſhall neuer
hold out to the end, ſeeing
ſuch as they, are thought to
be farre before them, are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
away and reuolted. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
let vs ſeeke out better
and ſurer proofes of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and true turning
to God, then confeſſing of
ſinne onely, and calling on
God, as thoſe: that we may
cleere our conſciences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God and men, and that
wee depart from iniquity,
and bee not tainted or bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with any kinde thereof,

               <p>I will now proceed to the

an Hypocrite, and that
by his own words, who was

by hollow and ſlight dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that euen now, when
he was at the beſt, and came
moſt neere to repentance of
all other times; yet euen
now (I ſay) he could not be
free from it.</p>
               <p>For, leſt hee ſhould haue
layd too great fault on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
in confeſſing his ſinne,
therefore ſaying, I haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
therefore hee ſayd,<note place="margin">The 12. note.</note> I
was afrayd, if I had not yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them, contrary to
Gods Commandement, to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:128:166"/>
ſaue aliue the beſt of the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that they would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
and haue riſen vp a
gainſt me. Lo, this was the
bladder without winde, and
cloud without water, which
appeared in <hi>Saul,</hi> when hee
was at the beſt, I meane,
brought to confeſſe his ſin,
which was nothing but a lie,
and a coloured excuſe. For,
the Lord by the Prophet, in
the 19 verſe, conuinced him
of a couetous minde and
diſobedient, that he himſelfe
<hi>turned to the prey.</hi> So, that
as hee was hardly brought
thus farre, as to confeſſe his
ſinne, ſo yet when hee did
it, it was for feare of loſing
his Kingdome: yet, euen
this (which ſeemed good in
him) was corrupt and
naught: for beſides that, he
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:128:166"/>
bewrayed ſo much himſelfe,
as I haue ſayd, by excuſing
his fact, ſo doth the Spirit of
God by <hi>Samuel,</hi> bewray the
ſame in the next verſe, where
he plainely ſheweth, that he
did not accept, nor allow of
it. What ſhall we ſay then, if
it be thus?<note place="margin">Hard for an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite to leaue his trade.</note> Truly this: that
it is an hard thing for an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,

to forgoe his wicked gaine;
and for the Blackmore to

which, though it bee true of
all ſinnes leaning to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
yet ſomewhat more
it may be ſayd of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
then of other ſinners:
For an open offender (as
<hi>Paul</hi> and the Iaylour were)
when hee is pricked in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:128:167"/>
and troubled in
minde, ſhall much eaſilier
bee perſwaded, that it is in
truth, and ſhall bee forgiuen
then the hypocrite ſhall: not
that I ſtint or reſtraine the
worke of the Spirit, that it
cannot bee as effectuall in
one, as in another: but God
ſo diſpoſeth ordinarily, that
the hypocrite hauing ſinned
more groſſely and greeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly,
ſhall be harderly able to
apply, and be perſwaded of
Gods promiſes, then other
ſinners; though they bee in
a like manner deliuered to
them both. Ordinarily, I
ſay (though God may, when
it pleaſeth him, doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe)
but hee ſhall long (for

in faith, feare and the

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:128:174"/>
he putteth his hooke in the

bridles them from rage, by
ſuch a forcing of them to
confeſſe it to bee good and

to be held vnder, with
feare of Gods iudgements, is
a righteous thing in the ſight
of God, and the godly are
more incouraged thereto,
when they heare the way of
godlineſſe to bee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by them, who were
wont to ſpeake euill of it,
&amp; to perſecute thoſe, which
were the zealouſeſt embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of it: As, who doth
not know what an embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening
it was, to the poore
Diſciples at Damaſcus, and
round about it, when they
heard that <hi>Saul</hi> their Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enemy,
who brought letters
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:128:174"/>
from the high Preiſts to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon
them, was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the mighty power of
God, to renounce and cry
out of his doing, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
his cruelty againſt the
Saints, and to iuſtifie them;
yea, when it was not known
to them, that he had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
neither durſt they, as
yet, truſt to him, that he was
truely conuerted.</p>
               <p>And this is one cauſe, why
God doth ſuffer the bad,
ſometime to confeſſe their
ſins, and accuſe themſelues,
although they ſhould not
come to true repentance,
and this is done, as all may
ſee, for the Faithfuls ſake.</p>
               <p>Another cauſe is, in reſpect
of the wicked themſelues,
and that is this, that while
they are forced to iuſtifie
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:128:175"/>
and allow of the ſincere
courſe of the ſeruants of
God, and to cry out of their
owne, they condemne their
former wayes, when they
lay in ſin, and purſued thoſe
that were better then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and they doe thereby
giue ſentence againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
if euer they doe the
like againe. And thus much
of the painted ſhew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
in hypocrites, by
occaſion of <hi>Sauls</hi> confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And this be ſaid of <hi>Sauls</hi>
hypocriſie, the laſt of the
ſoure things concerning his
confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Saul</hi> ſaid alſo beſides in
this verſe, that hee had done
againſt the words that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
ſpake to him, and ſaid
moreouer, that he feared the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:128:175"/>
people; therefore of both
theſe a little. For the firſt:
the words that <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpake
to <hi>Saul,</hi> were the reprouing
of his ſinne, and the conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him of it, and the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauating
thereof, as God
had commanded him to do.
All which words wee haue
heard, how boldly <hi>Saul</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
them off, and was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
moued at the hearing
of any of them.</p>
               <p>How is it then, that hee
now acknowledgeth, that he
had ſore offended, in ſetting
ſo light by the ſame? I grant,
that his words were but
froth, and that it was but a
ſudden pang, that cauſed
him to vtter them: but yet
wee ſee, God forced him
thereto; to the end that hee
might thereby bewray his
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:128:176"/>
hypocriſie, when it might be
ſeene that hee amended not
for all that, and alſo to leaue
good inſtruction thereby, to
all poſteritie in time to
come.</p>

               <p>The ſecond followeth
which was this: [<hi>I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of the people</hi>] How he
bewrayed his hypocriſie in
theſe words, euen when hee
confeſſed his ſinne, I haue
ſhewed before. The thing
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:128:178"/>
that I note out of them here,
is this: that he thinking <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell</hi>
could not finde out
this that he alleadged, to wit,
that hee feared the people,
whither hee did ſo or no: he
did therefore ſtand ſtiffely
vpon that, although it was
an vntruth that he ſpake. But
heerein is liuely bewrayed a
common ſinne among vs,
namely this: that if an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
thinke and be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that his fault be hidden
from men, no perſwaſion
can cauſe him to confeſſe it.
The reaſon heereof in ſuch
is, partly, ſeeing if it be not
wrung from them (which
they moſt deſired:) and
partly ſeeing they thinke
themſelues as ſafe as in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
if it bee not knowne,
(ſuch is their blindenes and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:128:178"/>
hardnes of heart,) whereas
both the Lord hath a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
wayes to bring it to
light, if hee ſee it expedient
ſo to doe; and yet they are
in no ſuch ſafetie while they
conceale it, as they imagaine,
but rather in farre greater
danger, both toward God,
and the world alſo; to God
ſeeing while they hide their
ſinne, they cannot proſper,
neither repent while they
harden their hart: and while
they doe neither of both,
what is their life worth, but
the increaſing of ſinne, and
heaping of iudgement? And
it is worſe for them to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
becauſe if it euer after
come to light, they vtterly
looſe their credit among
men, without which, it were
better for them to be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:128:179"/>
from their ſociety, then
to liue with them: And if it
come not to light, yet they
who haue committed it,
walke among men, either
wounded or hardned, but
the leaſt of both is miſerable.

things, which are heere ſaid

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:128:179"/>
one was that he asked after
Gods mercy, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes
of his ſinne; and
would haue <hi>Samuel</hi> go with

before I goe further, let vs
firſt ſee what his meaning
was, in bidding <hi>Samuell</hi> take
away his ſinne: ſeeing no
man (as the ſcripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth)
can forgiue ſins but
God only.<note place="margin">Mat. 8.</note> The which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
graunted, it is not like
that hee meant as the words

take away his ſinne, but hee
either willed him that hee

[as he was deſired before to
doe for the people of Iſrael]
that he would forgiue him,

               <p>This being thus opened,
whereby wee ſee what his
meaning was; now we may
the better ſee, what is to be
learned from the words.
For this is cleere heereby,
that though <hi>Saul</hi> did not
feare God vnfeignedly, yet
he ſought now to haue his
ſinnes pardoned, and to doe
other duties to God: which
cleerely ſheweth that there
is a time when Gods mercie
is in price with euill perſons,
and the fauour of God is
ſomwhat with them, though
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:128:180"/>
for a time they haue no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
in them: For what is
the delight of the moſt, but
in that which is tranſitorie,

as ſuch regard not goodnes,
but by fits and in their good

haue neuer the fruite therof,
but deceiue themſelues, by

<hi>their goodnes is like a morning

                  <note place="margin">Hoſea. 6. 4.</note> as the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
whereas it ſhould bee
conſtant with them, and one
time as another. For that
which is good in it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is alwayes, and not in
a paſſion to bee eſteemed
and ſet by: for it is neuer in
kinde, but when it is deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <p>And yet, I ſay not, that
wee ſhould diſdaine or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne

                  <p>And thus I hauing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
how wee ought to
behaue our ſelues, toward

that wee ſhould follow <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi>

ſuch as <hi>Saul</hi> was, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
guideth, who did not
neglect, but take an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
to admoniſh and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
<hi>Saul,</hi> ſo long as there
was hope; but when hee
profeſſed to turne from his

dealt hollowly and doubly;
<hi>Samuel</hi> would not allow,
nor beare him in it, but
ſought to depart from him,
rather rhen hee would goe
with him to worſhip God,
in the caſe hee was in, as hee
would haue had him. Euen
ſo, when men in their words

treachery againſt God, tell
them of it, as long as they
will heare it; but, if they caſt
that louing admonition off,
and put away the Word of
God from guiding them,
leaue them in it, rather then
haue fellowſhip with them,
that they may ſee for what
cauſe they bee forſaken, and
ſo (if it pleaſe God) they
may come to amendment;
but yet loue and pitty them,
that when God ſhall giue
further opportunity, wee
may doe them good. As

for then he would haue vſed
great cruelty toward him; as
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> in the like action,<note place="margin">1 Kin. 13. 3.</note>

to be enioyed both

but how doe people, for the

in his tythes, at a

in and keepe in fauour with

they will ſpeake well of him:
others for ſome qualities of
his, wherewith they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted;
as that hee is a fit

a merry conceited perſon,
and can diſcourſe well and
wiſely of worldly matters;
for theſe and ſuch like they
affect him.</p>
               <p>And another ſort, if they
haue one that beareth the

though he bee little conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

to be groſſely bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
that <hi>Saul</hi> was neuer
more palpably deceiued, in
laboring to haue <hi>Samuel</hi> with

found (if any liſt to examine

and brought from darkneſſe
to light, to faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which are the ends,
why the Goſpel is preached
among them; but onely in
ſome ſuch reſpects, to like
and receiue them, as I haue
before ſet downe.</p>
               <p>But is this the manner of
accounting the Miniſtry and
Miniſters, as Gods holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
and his ſingular
gifts? is this to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
and preaching preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
Is this to account and
eſteeme the tydings of the
Kingdome of Heauen,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> as a
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:128:199"/>
pearle? for ſo the Scripture
cals it) is this, to receiue
Gods holy Meſſengers, as
Angels; and to ſhew, that
their feet, or comming, is
beautifull; becauſe they
bring a glad meſſage, and a
meſſage of peace vnto them?
Is it to loue, and eſteem them
ſo, as for their ſakes, to bee
ready to plucke their owne
eyes out, if need were, for
the ſingular benefit, which
they receiue at their hands,
and by their meanes?</p>
               <p>It doth well appeare that
the neare coniunction of
true and chriſtian loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Gods faithfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and their flocke,<note place="margin">The true ends of this fellow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip much neglected.</note> which
alſo ought to be betwixt all

is either not knowne, or not
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:128:200"/>
greatly in practiſe: And if
the true ſhepheard (as Chriſt
teacheth) will ſo loue his
flock,<note place="margin">Iob. 10. 5.</note> as he will looſe goods
and life for their ſake, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſhould be offred; and
if they bee like affected to
him, is there not (thinke we)
ſome great matter betwixt
them, which cauſeth this?
And what is it? the naturall
father, and ſonne are not ſo
nearely vnited as they: yea,
greater things are enioyned
of one by the other, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them: for the father
is but the meane of his ſons
being at all; but the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
father is the inſtrument of
his euerlaſting welbeing: he
can only conuey or leaue to
his ſonne, his temporall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
and goods; but this
is a meane whereby eternall
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:128:200"/>
riches, yea, a kingdome and
that eternall, is enioyed by
them whome hee begetteth
by the goſpell: againe, their
loue can bee but naturall,
therefore not euer firme and
ſtable, but the loue of theſe
is ſpirituall, and therefore
endureth: and ſuch louing
and liuing together, ſhould
be betweene the one and the
other: which I ſay, becauſe
the blinde and the beaſtly
world, who knoweth no
whit of this, when they ſee
faithfull loue betwixt the
teacher and people, doe to
their further condemnation,
reproachfully vtter theſe
ſpeaches, that the people
make their miniſter their
God: but while they thus
ſpeake, we may ſee that they
ſee cauſe to loue them, and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:128:201"/>
that there is another end
why the ſhepheards of
ſoules ought to bee deſired
and enioyed, and another
manner of benefit to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by them, then either
<hi>Saul,</hi> or ſuch as I haue ſpoken

therefore hee thus ſpeaketh
to him, as we ſee fearefully;

to him, which I haue

(when the man of God

going from him, it is ſayd he
came no more to ſee him,

And as for that it is ſaid of
him in 30. verſe of this

ſinne againe, as he had done
before, leaſt any ſhould think
his latter confeſſion to haue
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:128:204"/>
bene better then the former,
it is branded by the holy
