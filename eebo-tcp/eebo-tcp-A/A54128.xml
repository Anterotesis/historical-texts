            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I <hi>A. B.</hi> Do Solemnly in the preſence of God, and in my Conſcience Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, Teſtifie, and Declare that I do not believe, that the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> or <hi>Papal Church,</hi> is the true Church, out of which there is no Salvation; Or that the <hi>Pope</hi> or chief <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> is <hi>Chriſt's Vicar,</hi> or <hi>Vicegerent</hi> on Earth; Or that he, or the <hi>See of Rome,</hi> joyntly or ſeverally, is Head of, or hath any Supremacy over the true <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in general, or my ſelf in particular; Or that he or they is, or are Sole, Chief, or certain Judge, or Judges in Spiritual matters, or of the ſence of the Holy Scriptures; Or that the <hi>Pope,</hi> or his <hi>Prieſts</hi> have power to Pardon Sins, paſt, preſent or to come.</p>
            <p>And I do believe that at, or after the <hi>Prieſt</hi> pronouncing the Words of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration upon the Elements of <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> commonly called the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, or Sacrament of the Altar; There is not any Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, nor any part of the Subſtance of the <hi>Bread or Wine,</hi> changed into <hi>Fleſh</hi> or <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And that the Sacrifice of the Maſs, Adoring and Bowing to <hi>Crucifixes, Pictures,</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> and the uſe of them in Worſhip. As alſo of the Invocation and Adoration of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or any other Saint or Angel, the Doctrine of Purgatory, and Prayers to the Dead, and for the Dead, are Doctrines and practices Erronious, Superſtitious, and Idolatrous, and contrary to the truth of the Holy Scriptures. I believe there is no Mediator between God and Man, but Chriſt Jeſus only the Lord of Life and Glory, who is the only Head of his Univerſal Church, as the Holy Scriptures teſtifie.</p>
            <p>And I do further believe, that neither the <hi>Pope</hi> nor any other, by or under his Authority joyntly or ſeverally, have any power to depoſe Princes, or to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve their Subjects of their Allegiance, on any account whatſoever; Or hath power to authorize, or give leave to me, or any other Subject of their Realm whatſoever, to Plot or Conſpire the hurt of the Kings Perſon, his State, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or People.</p>
            <p>And I do ſolemnly in the preſence of God, Teſtifie and Declare that I make this Declaration, and every part thereof, in the plain and ordinary ſence of the words read unto me, as they are commonly underſtood by <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> without any Evaſion, Equivocation, or Mental Reſervation whatſoever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
