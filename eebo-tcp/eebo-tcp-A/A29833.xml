         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

we did ſo earneſtly and aſſiduouſly deſire to
our ſorrow, and the greater terror of the poor
County of Dorſet, that which makes us ſo
fearful, and to apprehend the dangeriwith ſuch
vehemency, is the greatneſſe of his authoritie
with us, his larg revenues and multiplicity of
tenants, who are for the moſt part Recuſants,

            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> theſe and many other conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derations,
force me this day to ſpeak ſo much
of this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> the fear of the people, the
ſtrength of the enemy, and the former trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and treacherous deſigns intended (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
by the divine providence of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, fruſtrated and made void) which if
not timely looked into, may being patrocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and uſhered in by ſuch able and notorious
Delinquents, prove the utter ruine of the
County and a meanes to introduce civill wars
within this Kingdome. What ſecurity, what
ſafety, what liberty; nay what hopes can any
true Subject there inhabiting have, when as
their obnoxious, and abrogating enemy ſo
nigh a neighbor, nay rather involved within
their bowels, one whom they know conſpires
Plots, and promiſcuouſly intends their Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
Let no man think to direct us from
the perſuit of Juſtice, by poyſoning the clear
ſtreams of our intellect with zealous expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of truth, and reality from them, whom we
have found ſuch invective perſons, agd invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
polititians, againſt both church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96599:4"/>
The happy aſſurance of your grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
towards others, makes us to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible
hope, that our loyalty wil win you
to tender the ſafety of the people: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
all our preſſures well weighed, theſe
many years, and now more dangerous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminous
then ever: it will be found the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
loyalty of this ſuffering County, hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
the active duty of all times, and ſtories;
and as the Poet hath it, <hi>Fortiter ille facit, qui
miſer eſſe poteſt,</hi> J may as properly, and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly
ſay, <hi>fideliter fecimus,</hi> we have done loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
to ſuffer ſo patiently.</p>
            <p>The root of all the evils already come upon
us, the fruſtrous labour of this induſtrious <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
the continuall fears, the obſtupifying
Plots, and late hell-nouriſhed Conſpiracies,
and what elſe you may call pernitious to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
proceedings, and neceſſary affairs,
for ſetling a reall peace in this Kingdome,
ſpring all from one current, ſhoot out from
one root, <hi>viz.</hi> Papiſticall hereſie.</p>
            <p>And is it not high time then to grub up that
root that produces ſuch fruit? He that intends

more ſpeedier way is to begin at the root, and
there (with ſubmiſſion to better judgment)
would I lay to the Axe.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured, and as much as in mee
