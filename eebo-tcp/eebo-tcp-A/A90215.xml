            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN OUT-CRY After the late Lieutenant General Fleetwood</head>
            <p>BE it known unto all People both in City and Countrey, That there is lately ſtrayed from <hi>Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Houſe a certain pious Lieutenant General, whoſe Deſcription take as followeth, and what you are to do with him, you ſhall hear anon.</p>
            <p>He hath a head like to the head of a certain beaſt, which <hi>Adam,</hi> for certain Reaſons beſt known to himſelf, did call an <hi>Aſs.</hi> His Hair came off with being much ſtroak'd on the head by old <hi>Oliver</hi> for <hi>good Boys</hi> tricks, ſo that he wears a Perrywig. This Perrywig was made of the Locks which <hi>Dalilah</hi> cut from <hi>Samſons</hi> ſhoulders; from whence you may obſerve that he is no more a Nazarite than he is a Small-coal-man; nor indeed ſo much, for he can never be a Nazarite, but he may in time be a Small-coal-man. Had he not been knockt in the Cradle, he would never have been knockt in his life, for he always kept out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but he had a ſound knock in his Cradle, which hath cauſed an extraordinary ſoft place in his head; which bred ſuch a debility of his animal Faculties, that had not the <hi>Lord aſsiſted him,</hi> he could never have held out ſo long. His Eyes are like thoſe of <hi>Solomons</hi> Miſtreſs, that is to ſay, like the Fiſh-pooles of <hi>Heſhbon.</hi> At each corner he hath two Sluces, and he can drown his Cheeks with as much eaſe, as they can drown the Lands about <hi>Hull.</hi> Had he liv'd in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> he could not have bin one of the eight, for that his tears would have gone near to have drown'd the Ark it ſelf. Though he be much given to grunting, yet his Noſe is not ſo good as a Hogs, for that he never could ſmell which way the Winde intended to blow in his life. He hath lately got a Mark in his forehead, occaſioned by the ſlimy moiſture which the Rebuking-Angel ſpit ſo fiercely in his face. He hath a Tongue that can tell a world of Knavery, if he pleaſes, and is famous for many particular and ſecret Conferences with God Almighty: however, 'tis for all that as double as a great Marygold, and his heart and it are profeſſed enemies, for there is a perpetual ſpirit of contradiction between them one towards another: I confeſs 'tis none of the Eloquenteſt that ever made Harangues, therefore let no man ſtrive for it, as the ſeveral Cities did for the Birth of <hi>Homer;</hi> If it had as many bliſters upon it, as it hath told lies, 't would look like a piece of Red Sattin embroidered with white Beads. His head is boar'd directly through from one ear to another, ſo that you may ſhoot Peaſe through his head, as through a Trunk. And this is done with great policy, that what ever he hears may with more conveniency paſs in at one ear, and out at t'other. Truly by his hearing and ſeeing, he ſhould be a kinde of <hi>Mole;</hi> for he hears every thing with much attention, and very exactly; but when he comes to the politick Mazes, and crafty Underminings of Government, there is no Mole ſo blinde; ſo that it is to be wondred at, that he did not make uſe of a Dog and a Bell, to lead him through thoſe kinde of Intricacies. His Beard is not much, but if it were ten times more, 't would never make him a Philoſopher. The bigneſs of his Heart will never give him the Sirname of <hi>Ceur de Lyon,</hi> for 'tis no bigger than a Pigeons Egge, yet 'tis as full of chinks and crannies as an old forſaken Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft; and I'le warrant ye you may finde many a ſix-pence, and many a ſhilling ſwallowed up in it. He hath a very obedient will, and, as if the firſt curſe of women were upon him, his deſire was always toward thoſe that ruled over him: He fulfils one part of Chriſts Commandement, but not the other; for he is as meek as a Dove, but not ſo ſubtile as a Serpent. He hath a broad Back, and a great Saddle upon it, which he never left off ſince the Protector put it on, that was when he firſt manag'd him; which he did ſo well, that the gentle Beaſt would not afterwards refuſe any man that pleaſed to get up into the Stirrup. His Fingers are not half ſo learned as <hi>Davids,</hi> for God never taught them to fight; but on his Heels he hath wings, as you finde <hi>Mercury</hi> pictur'd, and he hath an excellent faculty of uſing them: for all the world is to know that he hath left off his boyiſh cuſtom of <hi>Crying and Fighting.</hi> This man was once our devout Lieutenant General, and he had two Centinels ſtanding at his door, but now the Scene's alter'd, and contrary to the uſual way, he hath left his Guard, to ſecure himſelf. If any man can bring tydings where he is, he may; if he won't, he may let it alone.</p>
