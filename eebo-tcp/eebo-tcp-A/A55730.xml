            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To the Right Honourable Sir</hi> Francis Pemberton, <hi>Knight, Lord Chief Juſtice of His Majeſties Court of Common Pleas, and one of His Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy Councill.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WEE do humbly Preſent, That the beſt and moſt effectual way to maintain and preſerve His Majeſties Sacred Perſon, the Church and State by Law Eſtabliſhed, together with the juſt Liberties, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and Properties of the Subject, is an Impartial and due Execution of the Laws.</p>
            <p>That Popery and Fanaticiſme are equally dangerous to the Government: The Papiſts having almoſt ever ſince the Eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant Religion endeavoured the Subverſion thereof, but by the Providence of God have been diſappointed in all their attempts; but the Fanaticks having in our own memory, in the compaſs of a few years, actually maintained an open Rebellion, in the face of the Sun Murdered the beſt of Kings, Subverted the Government both in Church and State, and with an un-heard of Impudence juſtified <hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That We have reaſon to believe the ſame Deſtructive and Anarchical Ends, are at this day driven by many Perſons who under-hand court a Popular Fame, the ſame way and in the ſame Age to deſtroy the Monarchy again.</p>
            <p>That although His Majeſties Incomparable Goodneſs and Clemency may perpetually meet ſuch Perſons with His Gracious Pardons, yet We hope and pray that according to His Majeſties Royal Father's Advice of bleſſed Memory, His Majeſty will be pleaſed never to truſt them: Which is a wiſe and ſure Principle, whereby neither His Majeſty, nor His Loyal Subjects, can ever be ruined again by the ſame Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>That all ſuch as pretend to Moderation in Execution of the Laws where the Government is apparently aſſaulted, are but Betrayers of their own Conſciences, their King and Country.</p>
            <p>That the maintaining of the Succeſſion of the Crown in the Right Line, is the undoubted means for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Support of this Monarchy, Church and State.</p>
            <p>We do alſo Preſent, That all Perſons, whether Papiſts or Proteſtant Diſſenters, and ſuch as utter diſaffected Reflections againſt the Government, are dangerous and of ill Example; and the Names of ſuch ought to be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lord Lieutenant, or his Deputies, that they be forthwith Diſarmed, according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm.</p>
            <p>We do alſo Preſent, That the ſeparate manner of Divine Worſhip, uſed and permitted amongſt the <hi>Walloons</hi> and <hi>Flemings</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and other Places in this County, is of dangerous Example, and infections to His Majeſties Liege Subjects, many of the Diſſenting Perſons from the Church of <hi>England</hi> daily flocking to their Aſſemblies; and therefore We humbly conceive ſome Regulation is fit to be made therein, according as to His Majeſties Wiſdom ſhall ſeem moſt fit.</p>
            <p>We do alſo Preſent as our humble Advice, That all Perſons that keep Ale-houſes, Victualling-houſes, or other Publick Houſes within this County, ſhall bring a Certificate under the hand of the Parſon of the Pariſh, or other Incumbent there, at the ſame time that they come to renew their Licenſes, that they have duly repaired to their Pariſh Churches, and received the Sacrament according to Law.</p>
            <p>That Coffee-houſes, and the Selling of Brandy by ſeveral Shopkeepers in Towns Corporate, Villages and other places in this County, is a frequent occaſion to gather Perſons together diſaffected to the Government, who there take a Liberty to intermeddle with affairs of State, to reflect upon their Superiours, and to debauch the Affections and Loyalty of His Majeſties Liege People, by amuſing them with cauſeleſs Fears and Jealouſies.</p>
            <p>All which, We humbly ſubmit to the Wiſdom of this Honourable Court, and humbly Pray, That His Majeſty may be acquainted with the Loyal Preſentments and Dutiful Affections of His Majeſties moſt Obedient and Loyal Subjects of the ſaid County:</p>
