            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Seaſonable SPEECH Made by Alderman Atkins, IN <hi>The Rump-Parliament,</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFter ſo many diſpenſations and out-goings of Providence, we are now the third time returned to ſit in this Honourable Houſe again; but how long we ſhall do ſo, I believe the wiſeſt of us all cannot tell: For the Souldiers have of late ſet up Governments, as Boys do Nine-pins, to throw them down again: But how oft ſoever they turn us out hereafter, I ſhall never doubt to get in again; for I perceive thoſe Changes and Revolutions (as they call them) are juſt like caſting of Knaves at Cards, where ſome play, and ſome ſit out until the Set be up, or the Gameſters fall, out and throw up their Cards, and then they ſtand fair to get in again. But notwithſtanding ſo many interruptions and diſturbances, many mighty and great Works have been carried on by us Worms and no Men. You, Sir, have a new Wainſcot Chair, and our Seats, that were but covered with Mats, when we came firſt to ſit here, are now lin'd with good Broad-Cloth of 16 <hi>s.</hi> a yard, and the whole Houſe is hang'd in a better manner then any man expected. But this is not all that we have done, for we have reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and brought the Church as nigh to what it was in the Primitive times among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> as may be; for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have ſold all they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45187:2"/>
have long ſince, and laid it at our feet, and we begin once more to have all things in common. Beſide, Sir, we have done ſtrange Juſtice on the late Tyrant, and transform'd the Kingdom into a Commonwealth, as <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> was into a Beaſt. But there is one thing that we have omitted, no leſs neceſſary then any thing that we have done, and which indeed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have much more reaſon to expect from us; for Reformation, as well as Charity, ſhould begin at home: To hold forth my meaning in brief to you, Sir, it is the cleanſing of our own <hi>Houſe of Office</hi>; and if that name be not mannerly enough for this place, it is in your power to help it: for there is a ſpare name that hath been lately conferr'd on this Honourable Houſe by the people, which was once called the <hi>Houſe of Parliament,</hi> as it is now the <hi>Rump.</hi> This name, in my opinion, we cannot better diſpoſe of, then in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it on the Houſe I ſpoke of, that not only that, but all other Houſes of the ſame quality (of which ours is the Repreſentative) may in the right thereof hereafter be call'd a <hi>Rump,</hi> as being a name more proper and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, in regard of the relation it hath to that part. And truly, Sir, I believe, the wiſdom and juſtice of this Houſe can do no leſs, if you pleaſe but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the near and intimate correſpondence that Houſe has ever held with this, as having ever been entruſted with the moſt urgent and weighty matters that we ever carried on, and ſo neceſſary, that I may boldly ſay, without that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which we have had to it in our greateſt extremities, this Houſe might have ſuffered for it many a time and oft. It is now, Sir, as full, as this Honourable Houſe was once of Members, and as unuſeful, until we take ſome courſe to empty it, as we did this, which, I humbly conceive, we can by no means avoid: For, under favour, I do not think we can uſe this Houſe, as we did the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi>; I mean, Vote it down, when it will ſerve our turn no longer; no, this is a matter of a higher nature, and more weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; and as the difference is very great in reaſon of State, ſo is it alſo in point of Conſcience. For though it is true, we engaged and ſwore to maintain the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> yet we did it not after a right manner: For we read, it was a cuſtom among the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they made any ſolemn Vow, to put their hands under one anothers Hams; and if we had done ſo when we ſwore that, and kiſs'd the Book, I grant, we had been bound in conſcience to have upheld it longer than we did, I mean, longer than we had need of it: but we, quite contrary, held up our hands, and ſo are not bound to keep it otherwiſe than we took it, that is, hand over head; for unleſs we differ'd from the <hi>Jews</hi> in other matters more than we do, I know no reaſon why we ſhould in this—But now I ſpeak of the <hi>Jews,</hi> give me leave, by obſerving one paſſage in their Hiſtory, to hold forth unto you the danger of ſuppreſſing the aforeſaid Houſe. <hi>Saul,</hi> for want of ſuch a convenience, going into a Cave where <hi>David</hi> had hid himſelf, had like to have loſt his life; for if <hi>David</hi> had been one of us, I know what had become of <hi>Saul,</hi> he would rather have cut off his Head than a piece of his Coat, as I wonder he did not, ſince, being a Prophet, he might have made Scripture of purpoſe to have prov'd him a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and a Traitor, as we did Law to condemn the late King after he was put to death. But though <hi>David</hi> were wiſer than his Teachers, he was not ſo wiſe as we were; 'Tis true, for his own advantage, he knew how to make the ſilly <hi>Philistims</hi> believe he was mad; but I am miſtaken if we have not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45187:2"/>
him that way too, and made the wiſeſt think us ſo. But to return to the purpoſe. Suppoſe, Sir, the Army ſhould have occaſion to give this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe a purge again, you would be loth it ſhould work here; and truly I do not know what other way you have to avoid it, unleſs we ſhould make uſe of that place where the Aſſembly of Divines lately ſate; which for my part, I like very well, if it were nearer; and certainly they have no reaſon to take it ill; for it is according to the example of the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches. And I know no reaſon why we may not as well ſit there, and make ſour faces at our own charges, as they did at the charge of the Commonwealth. For mine own part, (did not the common good provoke me to it) I have as little reaſon to ſpeak as another, and perhaps leſs; for my Breeches are made cloſe at the knees, and ſo better fitted againſt a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance. Beſide, I know the worſt of it, for I believe you have often heard what I have ſuffer'd in the ſervice of my Country. But let that paſs, though it were the worſe for my Reputation, and my Breeches, it was the better for my Body, and my Soul too, for I have edify'd much by it. 'Tis true, the Boys hold their Noſes, and cry <hi>Fogh,</hi> when they ſee me in the Streets; but, What of that? A wiſe man knows how to make an advantage of the greateſt diſaſters, and ſo have I done. For there was a time (Mr. Speaker) when this Honourable Houſe had like to have been a Foul-Houſe; And when was that? Truly it was when the Prentices came hither, to ſhew us one trick more than ever we taught them: Then did I take this worſhipful Chain off my Neck, and very politickly put it in my Codpiece; for I know well enough, that no body in this Town, where I am ſo well known, would venture to look for it there; and I was not miſtaken, for here you ſee I have it ſtill. The ſame thing I did at another time, and that was, when (as you may well remember) a piece of Plaiſter falling from the Roof, ſome of the Members cried, <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and many made haſte to get out of the Houſe as faſt as they could; ſo did not I, no, Sir, I reſolved to ſtay by it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (having put my Chain in my Codpiece) I crept under the Bench in this very place where I now ſit, and there I lay cloſe, until I heard ſome that were near me ſay, They ſmell'd Gun-powder; but then I knew it was a miſtake, and ſo it prov'd indeed: but if it had been otherwiſe, no danger ſhould have made me forſake my duty. No, Sir, I have been ſo faithful to this Houſe, and ſo conſtant to my Principles, that I have not changed ſo much as my Seat ſince the happy beginning of this Parliament. In this very place did I then ſit; on both ſides of me ſate two Members, that afterwards prov'd Malignants; for they took ſnuff at ſomething that fell from me in my zeal to the Cauſe, and ran to <hi>Oxford</hi> to the King; their Eſtates are long ſince ſold, for which the Commonwealth may thank me: For verily, Sir, I have not been altogether an unprofitable Member, according to my Talent, and the diſpenſation of what was in me; for my Bowels have been often pour'd out for the proſperity of this Houſe; and, I hope, my converſation hath held forth ſo much of the inward man, as may be ſufficient to ſatisfie the well affected, by whom I am entruſted. And as for my Back-biters, I forgive them freely; alas, they hurt themſelves, and not me; for if they get any thing by dealing with me that way, they muſt have good luck.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45187:3"/>
               <hi>SIR,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have us'd the more freedom with you, becauſe I have ſome pretence to your pardon; for I believe you have often obſerv'd, that when any thing has fallen from any of my fellow-Members that the Houſe has reſented, it has preſently been laid to my charge, and I have always taken it upon me freely; for I ſhall never refuſe to ſerve this Houſe in any ſenſe whatſoever. I ſhall therefore humbly move, that you would be pleaſed, to order this Honourable Houſe to adjourn for a convenient time, until that Houſe be emptied and made ſweet again; for if we ſhould ſit here before, it will not be in the power of any one man to own ſo much ſtink as will be laid to my charge.</p>
