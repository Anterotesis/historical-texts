            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have made bold to prefixe your <hi>Names</hi> to this short <hi>Discourse,</hi> since you were pleased to <hi>honour</hi> it with your
<pb facs="tcp:114999:3"/>
               <hi>courteous acceptance,</hi> I cannot but pay it down as your own by <hi>grateful acknowledgment.</hi> The <hi>Benignity</hi> of which I have had experience, makes me <hi>confident</hi> the second time: your <hi>Candor</hi> takes off those <hi>feares,</hi> which otherwise I should justly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, upon the thoughts of your <hi>Judgement.</hi> I have here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to your eyes what you heard, with a small addition of some things which could not conveniently be spoken for want of time, which was then more then ordinarily, but very justly, shortened by the <hi>Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My designe in the choyce of this <hi>Argument</hi> was not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; But, as it is one of the great <hi>Truths</hi> taught by our <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>pious Mother</hi>; of whom I received it, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the testimony of all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches,</hi> so when I weighed the <hi>Importance</hi> of it, I thought there was scarce any thing, that could be known, more <hi>necessary,</hi> and considering some things, which I shall by and by set down, I judged it not <hi>unseasonable,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was satisfied as to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi> of it, since it includes the <hi>Fundamentall concerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the opening of it disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the strong <hi>Pillars</hi> upon which it leanes, and shewes written upon them <hi>clear testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> that it came from <hi>God</hi>;
<pb facs="tcp:114999:4"/>
by the consideration of which, <hi>well-meaning</hi> Christians will strengthen a <hi>rational belief</hi> in God, and easily perceive that <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> of what sort soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, are not such, because the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> doth not give proof of its Truth, but because they have either by some sad mis-hap, lost the faculty of believing most necessary Truths, or because something or other doth hinder them from consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is more then sufficiently credible.</p>
            <p>Not that I presume to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all those things which belong to the full explication of so great a matter, much lesse to comprise them in this small Treatise (for that I may with <hi>Alexander Aphrod.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:114999:4"/>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) but however it will briefly exhibit several things towards the <hi>vindication</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Truth</hi> from <hi>Atheistical unbelievers,</hi> for the <hi>justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our <hi>profession</hi> against <hi>Romish aspersions,</hi> some of which are foul enough; and take off that which is said against the <hi>perfection</hi> of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> by <hi>dreaming Enthusiasts</hi>; and so may possibly contribute something to <hi>undeceive</hi> some which are in errour, or <hi>rescue</hi> from temptation an endangered soule.</p>
            <p>Indeed the comprehensive sence of this Truth, <hi>That the holy Scripture does perfectly contain, and plainly discover
<pb facs="tcp:114999:5"/>
all things necessary to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> doth include <hi>the Defence</hi> of <hi>our Saviours honour,</hi> the <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Wisdome</hi> of the divine <hi>Providence,</hi> and the <hi>Churches security</hi> in point of <hi>salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>for the honour of our Lord and Saviour,</hi> how shall that be safe, if it can be proved, that when he came to declare <hi>Gods mind</hi> to us, he went home again, having done but <hi>half his errand?</hi> if being to write an <hi>Epistle</hi> from God to us, he left some of the <hi>main con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments</hi> of it, to be supplyed in a <hi>Postscript,</hi> to be written by any that would take up his Pen? and being about to make his own <hi>will,</hi> he was so forgetful of that which is to be done in such a
<pb facs="tcp:114999:5"/>
matter; that he left out many <hi>principal</hi> things, to be inserted in <hi>unattested posthumous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicills?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it was quite otherwise; for Christ in the close of his <hi>Sermons</hi> declareth plainly, that he had <hi>perfected</hi> the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>necessary Doctrine,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little before his Death, Go and preach what I have taught you, and those which believe, shall be saved.</p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Grace and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of divine Providence,</hi> how can they but suffer, if God, pretending a great love to the happinesse of Man-kind, hath either not <hi>appointed sufficient meanes</hi> for their salvation, or not let them <hi>know what</hi> and <hi>where</hi> it is? If the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:114999:6"/>
be not <hi>plain,</hi> what wisdom, was it to write our highest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in such words as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand? If they be not <hi>perfect,</hi> how is his <hi>good will reall?</hi> for having given us but an <hi>imperfect</hi> notice of our way there, he doth not mention any <hi>power</hi> to make the <hi>supply,</hi> nor say whom he would <hi>intrust</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>From both of these, <hi>the inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of our salvation is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consequence.</hi> For how shall we attain so <hi>great an end,</hi> with <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient meanes?</hi> But as our <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledg of the Truth,</hi> taught all that Truth before he left this world, so the <hi>Evangelist Luke,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:114999:6"/>
in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the History of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that what <hi>Christ</hi> taught before his <hi>death,</hi> and till the <hi>Ascension was written by himself,</hi> not long after.</p>
            <p>The Truth of these things doth so distresse those that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to believe against it, that they are fain to summon their wits to find evasions from the mighty power of it.<note place="margin">Exomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logesis. Cap. <hi>32.</hi>

and wrote them for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials to succeding ages, but they would have been strange <hi>witnesses</hi> of his <hi>doctrine,</hi> if they should have told other tales of their own invention, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous <hi>assertours</hi> of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,</hi> if they should have changed them at their pleasure; as for Example, If after he had given the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> to his Disciples in his last Supper, they should upon the first repetition of that <hi>Sacrament</hi> have given only the <hi>bread</hi> to the Communicants, and so have contradicted Christs order with pretence of Tradition.</p>

            <p>In the close of that paragraph to prove a little better, that the

            <p>But for all that, what this should be to his purpose, I am not able to ghesse. For what can be inferred from these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but to the benefit of our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion? for if Christ promised the spirit to lead them into all Truth, did he not teach them it perfectly? and if he promised to be with them unto the end, did he faile to assist them in their work, which was to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the Truth by writing as well
<pb facs="tcp:114999:11"/>
as preaching? as we learn from S. <hi>John,</hi>

And as it appears from the <hi>20.</hi> ver. of the <hi>28.</hi> of <hi>Mat.</hi> read all together, all the assistance that the Church for future times could expect from this promise, is only while she does teach others to observe what Christ commanded, unlesse we will break that sacred <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,</hi> which all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans know to be between the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> and <hi>promises</hi> of God.

<pb facs="tcp:114999:12"/>
we understand not, nor why they should not invent new <hi>promises,</hi> as well as pretend to other <hi>precepts.</hi> Neither do we trouble our selves at all with those big words, which, to amuse ignorant people, they speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>imperfection</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to be supplyed by the dictates of a pretended infallible Church, since we could never yet hear of any one <hi>Truth</hi> necessary to salvation, but we found it in <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor had any certain newes of one <hi>Tradition</hi> that is <hi>universall,</hi> and of <hi>Primitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation,</hi> and so of good use in the Church of God, but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it willingly.</p>
            <p>I have judged this <hi>Discourse</hi> the more <hi>seasonable,</hi> because the adversaries of our Church make

concluding absurdly, that because some silly people, and others disaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to our profession, by the trouble of worldly temptations, that have happened of late among us, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily inclined towards them upon shallow or perverse grounds, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore few or none of us understand the Truth of our own Principles, or the impertinency &amp; danger of their bold additions; or, as if because they had no mind to remember, it being to their grief, that therefore we have forgot that Bishop <hi>Jewel</hi> did long since shew them, that for six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Christ, the Church taught not many of those things, which Rome did in his time; and as if <hi>Doctor Featly</hi> had not put the <hi>Jesuits</hi> to a loss, to prove, that for the first five hundred years, there was any City or Parish, in which there
<pb facs="tcp:114999:14"/>
was any visible Assembly that taught the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> As if we did not know by their writings, that the Fathers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that we were at last by some <hi>strange Accident</hi> grown so foolish, as to take their <hi>corrupt present party</hi> for the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> or that they could make us tamely believe that we differ from <hi>the ancient primitive institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> if we reject their <hi>Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or as if we did not understand their <hi>horrid uncharitablenesse,</hi> which denies salvation to those multitudes of Christian Churches and Nations in the world, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not their new doctrines, and also as absolutely necessary, though they have no <hi>testimony</hi> of <hi>antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and are contrary to <hi>Scripture,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:114999:15"/>
and therefore for our selves, were as much afraid of their <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications</hi> and <hi>sentences of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> as we should be in <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>burning</hi> or <hi>hanging,</hi> if they had the same power over us now, which they <hi>cruelly</hi> executed in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> dayes. But I will insist no further upon this discourse.</p>
            <p>Some attempt the <hi>disgrace</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> another way, making the pretence of the <hi>spirit</hi> an argument of the imperfection of holy Writ: and of such I think it is no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to affirm, that they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what they say. What good man ever denied the necessity of the help and guidance of the divine Spirit? We stand not in so much need of <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> as of Gods <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> but what wise man ever made this an argument of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb facs="tcp:114999:15"/>
imperfection? but such a proof as this serves the inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, <hi>God helps us to understand the Scriptures, &amp; therefore they are an imperfect Revelation of his wil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the Spirit be pretended fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then so, <hi>i.e.</hi> to teach us other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eessaries to salvation, besides the Gospel of Christ. I answer, that this is such a <hi>spirit,</hi> as was not promised to the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> no nor the <hi>Apostles,</hi> for the <hi>spirit</hi> was <hi>to lead them into all Truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> but by <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their remembrance what Christ taught</hi> them, and that was enough. As Christ had <hi>received a commandment from the Father what he should say. Joh. 12.49.</hi> so <hi>he gave</hi> the <hi>words to them,</hi> which he had <hi>received.

For the <hi>Scriptures</hi> given by <hi>inspiration</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and written by his <hi>instinct</hi> for our instruction, are a great part of his assistance, and are therefore most truly called by the <hi>Italian Poet.</hi>

For, what tongue could <hi>Dives</hi> have, whose bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was in the Grave? Or, what fingers should <hi>Lazarus</hi> dip in water, who was unbodied? Do flames of material fire burn souls, or singe our thoughts as they passe through them? The great Gulf denotes a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of converse between blessed and damned spirits.

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:114999:21"/>
but <hi>executed</hi>? To upbraid the miserable is a thing unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly below the temper of the blessed, who are so because they were forgiven; and now their tranquillity is freed from the groanes and cries of the damned, as a most unacceptable disturbance. It is unlikely that those which are in Hell make prayers to the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; so that, what is set down as spoken, signifies only what was fit to be said, if any words were to be made of such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Our expectation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from this Scripture must lie upon that, which is indeed the main of all <hi>Parables,</hi> The scope to which it was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and here Christ teacheth two things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:114999:21"/>1. That a poor man whose soule is rich in goodnesse, though he be distressed in this world, shall one day be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Regions of Repose and Blisse: and the luxurious unmercifull rich shall suffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable torments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That observance of the directions of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is the right way to escape those torments, and to be made partakers of rest in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> bosome; that is, true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
            <p>My designe is upon the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which lies fair in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses read. For, our Saviour, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting mans foolish after-wit by <hi>Dives</hi> his request, that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> might rise from the dead; and, with relations of strange
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114999:22"/>
things in the other world fright his brethren from their sins, doth also shew the true way to the Living in <hi>Abrahams</hi> answer, <hi>They have Moses and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> the sufficient guidance of the Scriptures; and if they will not follow that, there is no reason <hi>one shonld be sent from the dead,</hi> to preach to them, <hi>neither if one did come, would they heed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, lest any should stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the threshold of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, before I go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will remove a scruple or two, which may possibly lie in the way. Once is, Why do you say,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note> the guidance of the holy Scriptures? so the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is included, whereas it is said here, onely <hi>Moses</hi> and the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114999:22"/>
Prophets, that is, the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament?</p>
            <p>I say the New Testament al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so because <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets direct so,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> and that is a good warrant: to observe the direction of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a great piece of the guidance of the Old. As for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> he wrote so much of Christ, that, when he himself dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Jewes, he thence convinced them of malitious unbeliefe.<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 46.</note> 
               <hi>Had you believed</hi> Moses <hi>sayings, you would have believed me, for he wrote of me.</hi> What did he write? you may read in his book called <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> these words,<note place="margin">Chapt. 18. 15.</note> 
               <hi>God will raise up unto thee a Prophet like unto me, of thy brethren, according to thy desire, and I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114999:23"/>
will put my words into his mouth, and whosoever will not hearken unto the words which he shall speak in my Name, I will require it of him.</hi> The sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle-hearted Jews, aware of the divine truth of this Prophesy, were guided, as the <hi>Magi,</hi> by a star, to Christ. So <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Nathanael,</hi> true Israelites, embraced him, saying with joy,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 45.</note> 
               <hi>We have found him of whom</hi> Moses <hi>wrote in the Law.</hi> Whom when the degenerate Jewes rejected, the wise Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles reproved them from the same <hi>Moses,</hi> quoting the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited words; as we see, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22. therefore well might our Saviour say, <hi>Had you belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> Moses? that is, Had you been, as you pretend, true chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114999:23"/>
of <hi>Abraham</hi> and genuine disciples of <hi>Moses,</hi> you would not have disowned me, whom <hi>Moses</hi> acknowledged for his Master, and esteemed so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of honour, that he <hi>counted the sufferings of Christ greater riches then the treasures of Egypt.</hi> For, as <hi>Abraham saw my day afar off, and rejoyced,</hi> so, <hi>Moses</hi> knew the liquid <hi>Rock, which followed them</hi> in the Desert <hi>was,</hi> (i.e.) did signifie, <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Prophets</hi> also told the same tale,<note place="margin">Mal. 4.</note> and <hi>Malachi</hi> that brought up the rear, and claspt the Old Testament, bad the Jewes expect <hi>the Sunne of Righteousnesse,</hi> which was to rise and spread his wholesome rayes like wings of salvation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114999:24"/>
over the world. This was written in the close of that Oeconomy: since therefore <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets told us <hi>the desire of all Nations,</hi> whom they had long waited for, was coming; and bad the people to prepare his way, by fitting their wicked hearts for so great a comfort, whofoever doth not receive Christs Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, doth not hear <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets: Neither do they consider the great reasons which they afford to convince us of this matter. For they taught that Christ was to be <hi>the light of the Gentiles, and the Glory of Israel,</hi> and this in a sence so raised, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer glory stood valuable by it in no degree of comparison.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114999:24"/>
He was to fulfill the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, which had been but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vanities, if he had not made them good. He was to chase away shadows, and what is the day to night? To heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their motives with <hi>better promises,</hi> and take off the false Comments, which had crept upon the Law by the iniquity of the times, <hi>viz.</hi> the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse of the people, and the wickednesse of the Pharisees; so that the New Testament must not be left out.</p>
            <p>But then one may say (and some have been as foolish as to say it;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note>) We do not care for <hi>Moses and the Prophets,</hi> we have no need of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>

post of the doore. He that is no better advised, is just like a man, who having a great cause depending, is resolved, let it go right or wrong, he will use but one witnesse; he can have more, but he cares not for them. We do not use to burn the Records of our Ancestors, nor to cut in pieces the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of our lands, nor the Counter-parts of deeds. He which values the possession of truth, will not easily part with one of its best witnesses. The Scripture saith as much as one can well desire in this point. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared in the transfiguration of Christ, and were <hi>witnesses of his glory,</hi> The Gospel is his spiritual transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, and unto that Glory
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114999:25"/>
they bear a full and well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing witnesse. This spirit might murmur thus, Why could not one Cherubin have served to cover the Mercy-seat? God put two, whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were towards each other, and their wings did meet. So do both the Testaments spread their golden wings over our <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>What is thus said of the Old Testament, we easily learn of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, who acknowledged the usefulnesse of its divine Truth, whilest they proved their asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by it; nay, they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing but what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets foretold, and longed to have seen; by which it appears, that God hath so put them
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114999:26"/>
together, that it is devillish to attempt a divorce. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> did not only advise <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>read</hi> them,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.</note> but told him that they <hi>were able to make him wise to salvation</hi>; (i.e.) were full of divine instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and as fit for the Jews to walk by towards heaven, as the morning light is for a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller to begin his journey, and as to himself, he professed that he had <hi>great consolation and hope through the knowledge of</hi> the rare instances of the Old Testament,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note> in which he saw his hopes verified. Who would destroy such famous memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Truth? and, writing to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> concerning the Church under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, which is an <hi>habitation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114999:26"/>
of God through the spirit,</hi> he saies it is <hi>built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Christ being the great Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-stone.</hi>

But they honour the Church just as <hi>Haman</hi> did <hi>Mordecai</hi>; he would never have said so much should have been done to him whom the King would honour, but that he thought himself to be the man.</p>
            <p>And if we did not read the Scriptures, their lie might be more easily swallowed. For they declare a perfection as to all necessaries, and so these men peradventure speak worse then they thought at first, for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114999:30"/>
they make the Scriptures, not only <hi>imperfect, but Lyars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, as it should have been difficult to say such things (for men ought to speak the truth) so, it is harder to prove them, for the holy Scriptures, and the all-wise Providence are not so easily slander'd. Not the Providence of God: for, as he was careful to give us sufficient means of salvation, and hath preserved many things which are not necessary, but because they were written, would he not preserve what was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be written and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served?</p>
            <p>And, if he had meant to send us to the Church upon this Errand, he would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have told us where she
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114999:31"/>
dwelt. It were as bad as no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to say there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain advice for you lockt up in a chest, kept <hi>in terra incognita,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>no body knowes where. Abraham</hi> had given, if not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advice, yet but imperfect dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when he said, <hi>Hear</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> if this were the businesse.</p>
            <p>The Scripture sayes enough to vindicate it selfe, and to give satisfaction to all conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men. That very place which they would suborn, to speak against it self, resolves against them.<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 30,31.</note> 
               <hi>There are many more miracles which Iesus did, but these are written, that you might believe.</hi> If one question what they were which are not written, that doubt must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114999:31"/>
as to the particulars, for it sayes nothing of them. But it can never be proved, that these which <hi>Rome</hi> would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon us are they; much lesse that they are necessary; for the place asserts those which are recorded to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. The spirit of Truth doth often leave men to their wilfull mistakes; the Text speakes of miracles, and they quote it for Doctrines.</p>
            <p>But that the Scripture hath no defect in this point, a man may soon see; for, let any body compare the Provisions which are in the Scripture with his own necessities, and if he be not supplyed there, we may safely say, he hath some want, that is beyond the case
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114999:32"/>
of men that need nothing but salvation. As to salvation, we need instruction only in three points, and there we have it.</p>

               </gap> hath suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared to us his Nature and his Will, what he is, and what he would have us do, and what we may expect, How he will be worshipped; How we may partake of his love, continue in it, and be happy in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As we relate to others,</hi> he hath taught us how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our selves to them in his most perfect Rules, <hi>Love thy neighbour as thy self, Do what thou wouldst have done to thee, and what thou wouldst not have done to thee, do not to another.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:114999:32"/>These he hath explained in speciall precepts, so filled with all necessary instances of Duty, Justice, and Charity, that well may a wronged man complain of his Brothers inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but not of Christ, because he did not forbid him to do it. The murmuring poore may complain of their hard-hearted neighbour, but not of Christ for neglecting to command Charity. He hath bid us imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Father with Charity as large as the Sun-beams, to forgive love, and help our enemies, and overcome all evill with good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>As to the Government of our selves,</hi> how discreet and prudent would that be, if we followed Christs directions?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:114999:33"/>He, if any, taught the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the right estimations of soul and body, that we are, what we are, most upon the account of soul, whole nature and duration he hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and taught to provide for immortality. He hath also chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out the proportions of worldly cares, the measures of our passions. Both the roots of Passion are secure, if we keep his rules for Desire and Anger. One may say to all other Physitians, not onely, How imperfect are your cures in comparison of Christs, but how short your prescriptions? what sobernesse of mind? What Temperance, Meekness, and Peace, are the products of his precepts? He which reads
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114999:33"/>
Christs words duly, is <hi>perfectly instructed to every good work.</hi> He that hath lodged these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions in his soul, <hi>may bring out of his treasures new and old, like a Scribe throughly instructed to thè Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if the Grace which Christ hath brought to light in the Gospel, hath taught us <hi>Godlinesse, Righteousnesse, and Sobriety,</hi> we may say with <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>;<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But as we see what little reason there is for that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in which the Papists bring this particular Scripture to accuse the whole of <hi>obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (for it neither speaks of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114999:37"/>
their <hi>obscurity</hi> nor <hi>plainnesse</hi>) so we see by it, how great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we have to believe the Scriptures, since their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is from God. It is a plain consequence, since the holy perimen neither invented them by their wit, nor writ them of their own will, but delivered Gods sence at his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we ought to give them all possible credit and observance.</p>
            <p>But what should I speak of mens authority, or of believe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> or <hi>Apostles</hi> upon their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? <hi>Moses</hi> was but a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and once so disobedient, that for it he was kept out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and if his design had been to have had credit for his

own authority, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have lessened it with that story. The <hi>Prophets</hi> were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to like passions with our selves (i.e.) they were men. The Apostles were weak in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so far from being the <hi>New Wine</hi> of the Gospel, that till Christ had strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with new principles, they were like <hi>old torn bottles,</hi> they could not receive it. But this hinders not their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, their authority is from God. He took the stammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Moses</hi>; and made him a God, (i.e.) a divine teacher to the Church. <hi>Moses</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of his own inability, and loth to stir, but at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he took up his bundle of ceremonies, and carried an

               <hi>Vmbrella</hi> to the <hi>Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi> The <hi>Prophets,</hi> as was said just now, spake not of private impulse, but <hi>God spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets ever since the world began.</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to stay till they <hi>were cloathed with power from on high,</hi> and when they had that divine accomplishment, they preacht, and Christ whom they preacht, <hi>was believed on in the world:</hi> So that it is great reason we should believe their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, for they are the word of God.</p>

            <p>It is true, Mountebanks may play tricks, and cunning men put cheats upon easie people, so the <hi>Thessalians,</hi> knowing the time of Eclipses, made their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant neighbours believe, that they pull'd downe the Moon with their verses; but by which of their Devices, nay, by which of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorismes may one learn to cure <hi>a lame man with ones sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> or <hi>a fever with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief</hi>?</p>
            <p>What is further to be said in confirmation of this proof, I shall bring in by and by to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114999:42"/>
the mock-miracles of some heathen pretenders quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in opposition to Christ; only here I may add these two things concerning such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they are not onely a testimony of the worlds opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning the <hi>Divinity</hi> of miracles, but also a tacit confession that <hi>Christ</hi> did them; As counterfeit coin speaks the use of true money. If there had not been such a way of proof, why did they <hi>ape</hi> it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they were foretold by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and so people were not only fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of a danger, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the beliefe of the Truth, when they saw the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions written concerning
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114999:43"/>
               <hi>Impostors</hi> exactly fulfilled. For as the <hi>predictions</hi> and <hi>prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, made way for his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he came as the true <hi>Messia,</hi> so the <hi>predictions</hi> and <hi>predescriptions</hi> of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> written by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> gave argument against them, when they came accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to be <hi>Impostors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Seale is the Resurrection of the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of divine Truths, after he had bin dead and buried three dayes, And here behold the incomparable wisdome of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, which brings day out of darknesse, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, the death of Christ (a great piece of the mystery
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114999:43"/>
of Redemption, for <hi>his blood was shed for the Remission of our sins</hi>) put a doubt upon his doctrine, and stagger'd his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples. But this cloud made onely way for a more illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearance of his Truth, for the Resurrection took off all doubts arising from his death, and his Gospel gained confirmation, as a Truth doth from a clear answer, to a strong objection. Indeed it was to be feared, that the doctrines of Christ would have lien in the dust, if he had not brought it forth with his own Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth well say, that <hi>he was strongly declared to be the Son of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>by the Resurrection from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:114999:44"/>Indeed his murderers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the souldiers with money, to affirm that his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples stole him from the grave, but how came they to steale his soule into him, and to steale a power from his life to work miracles in his name? It is possible to make a lye, but impossible to hide it in so great a matter. Why did none of the Antichrists rise out of their graves, and confront those which adhered to Christ, and after forty dayes converse with worthy persons by a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ascension before compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent witnesses endeavour to get belief in the world? No, no, God will not be a witnesse of falshood.</p>
            <p>Besides these, there is also
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114999:44"/>
               <hi>a peculiar kind of signature or mark of divine authority</hi> upon these writings; one may think that Gods character, which men never usurp't (i.e.) <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full threatnings</hi> pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as should disobey this Revelation. What Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher ever used the mode of such Authority? for the things menaced; what Tyrant ever mentioned them? or if he had, the Majesty had been ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. <hi>Eternall punishments!</hi> poor men! when they are so ill minded <hi>they can kill the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but that is all they can do</hi>; God sayes, <hi>fear me who can cast soul and body into Hell.</hi> What man ever stamp't that Image upon his book!</p>
            <p>There are most becomming
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114999:45"/>
the divine Majesty, for they are not onely <hi>Authority,</hi> but full of <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>love</hi>; for since fear was a tool meet for Gods work, he made fit matter for it, and in the use of these threatnings, the great Father of the world threatens his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that so by a wise feare they may escape the feeling of his Rod.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Incarnation of the Son of God,</hi> the word was made flesh; A wonderfull grace to our nature, and denied to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. That we might not doubt but we may go up to God, behold; he cometh down to us, his Tabernacle is pitched in flesh, I, now he is <hi>Emmanuel.</hi> God comes into our Nature to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114999:46"/>
call us home to himself. What will make us like unto God, if he do not, when he is made so like unto us? Who can unfold the mercies lapp't up in this Mystery? In this good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels find wonder and joy, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills horror and envie, but all good men the greatest occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love aud obedience ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; especially if it be joyned with the second consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And that is <hi>the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death of the Son of God,</hi> so made man. He <hi>offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by the Eternall Spirit,</hi> and shed his blood for the pardon of our sins. He took our Bond and nailed it to his Crosse, and there cancell'd it with his blood. Look up sinner and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114999:47"/>
behold the guilt of thy Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes falling off, like the waxe of a broken Seale. That we the enemies of God, might learn the goodnesse of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, God doth act it first, who was not engaged to it, but by the goodnesse of his own Nature. The Father loves, the Son dies; we are loved and pardoned, that we might see how base a thing it is to sin, be impenitent, and hate. He slew the enmity upon the Crosse, in his own death he killed our hate, or in himself, I, in himself, where else should he break the flint, but upon the Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our hard hearts, upon his own most soft and loving bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some?</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have here <hi>the most
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114999:47"/>
excellent example of Christ,</hi> which doth secure our directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perfect our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Men think themselves in a good safe road, where they have ever and anon a Mercurial Statue pointing to their way, but what perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be added to their guidance if it went along with them? Christ doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew us, where we should go, as in a Map, but goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us as a sure guide, and a comfortable companion. <hi>Si quis unquam fuerit, ille comes in via pro vehiculo est.</hi> I, may we say, now we know what we should be, and do in these bodies, for the word made flesh hath shewn us.

that are of the <hi>right brood of Travellers</hi>; for in the worse way Christ goes before, breaks the Ice, and when we go up hill, lends us his hand. But why do I point any longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Sun, which from the Scriptures shines so comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon all good men?</p>
            <p n="4">4. He <hi>hath engaged our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with most incomparable promises</hi>; such as he onely could make, such as he onely could perform. What the Pharisees said of one sort, we may say of the rest, <hi>Who can forgive sins but God?</hi> It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to serve God for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For he payes all his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants before hand, but he is not so content, for he will adde such wages, as none can

give their servants; Not <hi>Earth</hi> or <hi>Tinne,</hi> or <hi>poor matters</hi> in the power of <hi>Kings,</hi> but things worthy of God, <hi>Eternall Life, and Blisse.</hi> If these were as truly believed, as they are plainly revealed, we should find our selves sufficiently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to obedience, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all that desire to be saved to look to it: but because they are so plainly revealed, I shall speak no further of them.</p>
            <p>Now if any say that these things are enough,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4.</note> if they can be proved to be true, I hasten to the fourth particular head; (i.e.) <hi>That the Scriptures are a proposal of all these Truths to our understandings in a way of most fair and full credibility,</hi> &amp; that appears in these three things.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:114999:50"/>
               <item>1. <hi>The way of proposall is most credible.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>The things propounded, are in themselves evidently true.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>The expressions in which they are laid down, are plain, and fairly intelligible.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>No man can say, but when things are propounded so, he is fairly dealt withall.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, <hi>The way of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall is most credible,</hi> That whatsoever God sayes is true, is the ground upon which this assertion sets its foot, and that is such a great Truth, that it is above the necessity of proof. He which believes there is a God, believes his Veracity, and he which believes not that there is a God, hath no reason
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114999:50"/>
to believe any thing. He hath no reason to believe any thing, if there be not Truth. And if there be not a God, there is nothing, and so no truth.</p>
            <p>But as that foundation is firm and unquestionable, What God saith is true, I must build two things upon it, and on them the credibility of the first particular is founded. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That <hi>since, what God sayes is true, we ought to receive whatsoever, we have abundant reason to believe that God did say it.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Whatsoever comes to us as Gods word, we ought by no means to reject it, without most weighty reasons to make us think that God did not say it.</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:114999:51"/>1. As to the first, <hi>Scripture is the way of proposal,</hi> (i. e.) God hath written his mind to us; now we have two great reasons to make us believe this writing to be his word.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Because writing was the fittest way to communicate his will to us.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Because since all writings need witnesse, that we might not doubt this to be his, he hath sent it attested by the witnesse of all those that were worthy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>the good men of all ages.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Because <hi>writing was the fittest way to communicate the Gospel or his will to us,</hi> that appears thus; All the Nations and ages of the world, could not be present at the birth of

Christ, nor be eye-witnesses of his miracles, see him rise out of grave, and ascend into heaven, put their fingers into his side, &amp;c. what then? will they not believe unlesse they do? shall Christ be crucified afresh in every age, that we may see him rise from the dead? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ was not to remain alwayes below, nor come again in that manner, and it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world to know the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, God committed it to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and hath made the holy Scriptures the safe Reposito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Truth, that is, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent preservatives against weaknesse of memory, and the rust of malicious designes,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>How much God was in love with this way appeared of old, for though he was pleased to converse familiarly with his plain friends the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> yet lest his counsels should slip out of the frail minds of men, he commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to write them. <hi>Litera scripta manet.</hi> The Jewes nice care of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was well made use of by God; for it became <hi>Septum Legis,</hi> whilest <hi>they</hi> looked to the <hi>words, God</hi> secured the <hi>sence:</hi> and how unsure all other wayes are, we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in that the Church hath not preserved the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christs miracles,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114999:52"/>
which were unwritten. Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is the Garb of Truth, it comes not abroad till it be cloathed in words; and since Christ was not to stay here to preach alwayes, he enabled those whom he deputed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his will in several langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that it might be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by divers Nations, when it was spoken and heard, and because the Apostles were to die too, he commanded them to write it, and hath enabled his Church to translate it into the several languages of the world, and so they understand it being written and read.</p>
            <p>And herein God shewed his care of the <hi>Vnlearned,</hi> who are the greater part of the world; for though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114999:53"/>
read the <hi>Originall</hi>; yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a <hi>Translation,</hi> which, in that it is a <hi>Translation,</hi> agrees with the Original, they receive the same mind of God that the <hi>Learned</hi> do. Why should any man be unsatisfied with this way of delivery, whereas <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> in matters which they esteem the greatest, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Proposals</hi> of <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours</hi> by an <hi>Interpreter</hi>? If to <hi>read,</hi> or <hi>hear these read,</hi> be not sufficient to direct us, what shall become of the <hi>blind,</hi> who can neither read <hi>Original</hi> nor <hi>Translation</hi>? And if any think that they say a great matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Translations,</hi> when they affirm, <hi>That we know not the signification of Hebrew and Greek words, but by the report
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114999:53"/>
of men.</hi> They may as well say so of our Mother-tongue; for we know not that this word <hi>Book</hi> signifies, that which men commonly understand when they heare that word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, but that we are told so; shall an <hi>English-man</hi> for this fine reason doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can speak true English or no? or shall any <hi>child</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his <hi>Duty</hi> to his <hi>Parents,</hi> whom he can know but by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>? Behold how many ways can the divine Providence use one thing? The first division of Tongues broke a foolish at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of scaling the skies; This second further'd a Noble Designe of lifting us up the right way to Heaven. By the curtesie of so many <hi>Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:114999:54"/>
the Holy Ghost appears again in <hi>cloven Tongues.</hi> Those men which would make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the written word, is no fit Rule, because every body skills not the Hebrew and Greek, do not onely say that they are not a rule to us, but that they were not to the Jews or Grecians. For it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble some Jews, and more then probable, that many Greeks could no more read Greek or Hebrew, then many now can read English: and how did they do? If we may be deceived by those which interpret, so might they by those which read. But if they say, as they would fain have it, that the Jews had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible spirit, then it's lawfull to ask where he lay asleep,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114999:54"/>
whilst the Jews, being wickedly misled, rejected the Messiah?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Scripture was the best way, and therefore most likely to be made use of by the wise God, so that we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he did, <hi>We have the testimony of all that were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be believed,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>good men in all ages.</hi> The first age saw things, writ the truth, and so witnessed to it.

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Iewes</hi> were his

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114999:58"/>
and confirmed the truth with miracles, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
            <p>Besides this, <hi>the Iewes</hi> in their books say so much for him, that they are a proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselves of falshood, in what they spake against Christ. They confesse him to have been a great Prophet, and to have wrought miracles, (i.e.) in their opinion, he had Gods witnesse:<note place="margin">

whom he causelesly hates. If there be not a <hi>New Testament,</hi> what will become of the <hi>Old? Christian Religion</hi> and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> thereof is the only proof, that <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>rest</hi> were <hi>true Prophets.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Devills</hi> were noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enemies, and pretended that Christ tormented them before their time with his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and spoyled their Devillish sport. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

whom he knew to <hi>be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars from the beginning</hi>? so the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> would not have a good saying sullied with a wicked mouth.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:114999:62"/>
bold wit of his lying pen, and spoyled the heathenish hopes by undoing that foolish obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to wit, <hi>that none but the rude multitude became disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ,</hi> they saw it was not want of learning that made them Christians, for <hi>Origen</hi> had so much, that the most learned <hi>Plotinus</hi> seeing him amongst his Auditors blusht, and after a few words abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brake off his Lecture.</p>
            <p>But why should I go about to reckon those starres, which gave light to this truth? and whereas 'tis said, that there were many others; which dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all those that misled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts could say, we may easily make answer to this.</p>
            <p>Amongst these <hi>Celsus</hi> must
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114999:62"/>
have the disgrace to be named first, for he was the first that wrote against Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He denied not the miracles of Christ, but would needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the world that they were Magical. But as he might learn this of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for he read the New Testament, though to a most hellish end, so there he might have learned an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. When Christ cast out Devills, they said it was by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> a Prince among them, but Christ does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of folly for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a Prince would as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist to destroy his own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and condemns them by their owne Disciples, whom they acknowledged to do it by divine power; by which

So the Disciples of Christ long before by speciall Miracles, (<gap reason="foreign">

mercy to the <hi>Inhabitants, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliane, si vis vincere, nihil est quod de civium meorum nece cogites,</hi> &amp;c. whereupon, he saith, that <hi>Aurelian,</hi> though he had vowed, upon their shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the gates against him, <hi>not to leave so much as a dog alive in the Town,</hi> intending the utter ruine of the place, yet he only killed the <hi>Dogs,</hi> but spared all the <hi>people,</hi> except <hi>Heraclammon,</hi> by whose treachery he gained the place; and promised a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and <hi>Statues</hi> to <hi>Apollonius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we grant this apparition to have been true, it is not such great matter. It was not the first time, that the <hi>Devill</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a <hi>Prophets mantle.</hi> But we may well suspect the <hi>Truth</hi> of it, both because it is

not mentioned in <hi>Aurelians</hi> letter to <hi>Mallius Chilo,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gives him an account of the taking of <hi>Tyana,</hi> and why he killed <hi>Heraclammon,</hi> though he spared the rest, where it seems utterly improbable, that he would have concealed that apparition, had it been the reason of his clemency.

            <p>Of those many Arguments to prove this Truth, which are necessary consequents from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of Scripture, I shall content my self with these three.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1.</note>The <hi>first is taken from the Reality of that love and regard, which God professeth to mans happinesse in the bestowing of his Gospel upon the world</hi>; and that is expressed thus: <hi>He would

have all men to be saved, &amp; come to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.4.</note> The Apostle in the beginning of the Chapter exhorts to a great Charity, which he would have expressed in prayers for the good of <hi>all</hi> men, and sayes, this is <hi>acceptable to God,</hi> who himself hath a <hi>Love</hi> to their salvation and to that end <hi>would have them come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth</hi>; so that in these words, God gives us to understand that he doth not envie us eternal happinesse, but doth extremely desire it, and hath appointed means for the attainment of it. Therefore left we should <hi>accuse</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Love</hi> for want of <hi>since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> we must conclude that these means are revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandably.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114999:84"/>
Would God have us saved by the knowledg or acknowledgment of his Truth, and will he not make the <hi>Truth</hi> knowable? but how shall we know it, if it be muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled up in dark expressions? The <hi>Truth</hi> which is here meant, is the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and that he hath written in such great <hi>Capital Letters,</hi> that he which <hi>runs may read</hi> the way to salvation. Why should God speak to us in an unknown tongue? that which <hi>Paul</hi> sayes concerning the use of intelligible speech, (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114999:84"/>
how shall it be known what is piped or harped? for if the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battel? so likewise you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? for ye shall speak into the ayre, therefore if I know not the meaning of the voyce, I shall be unto him that speaketh a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and he that speaketh, shall be a Barbarian unto me.</hi> Doth not God know this, and doth he not speak accordingly?</p>
            <p>But how shall God please this vain world? some are not satisfied, because the Scripture is so plain, they would have had it composed in more artificiall guise. There is not art <hi>enough</hi>

and art, as might make them lesse understandable to all, especially being such things as concerne Eternall Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> argument is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>from the pocesse of divine Iustice,</hi>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114999:86"/>
us to unsufferable torments, if we be disobedient, doth not righteousnesse require that the law should be made known to us, or knowable by us? How shall a man be condemned for ignorance, if wilfulnesse be not added to make it affected? will not that ignorance excuse, which was invincible without his fault? what justice can pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish a man for not doing that which he could not know? The condemnation must needs be hard, when the offendour could not understand that the Law was given, or what it meant.</p>
            <p>He <hi>which doth not the will of God shall be beaten,</hi> saith our Saviour. The sinner replies, <hi>I could not know it</hi>; what saith
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:114999:86"/>
our Saviour against that? <hi>Thou child of darknesse, thou hatedst the light.</hi> He which would not obey, will not know; that truth which God hath graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously revealed, he doth detain in an unrighteous will.

            <p>Men may dispute, but when they are upon their knees, to deprecate the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sin, dare they object to God, <hi>that they could not know his will?</hi> So men some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cavill at God for not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them grace, and pretend to leave the matter so; but in prayer do they make this plea: <hi>Forgive me O Lord, though I

purity of heart, and hast reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the vanities of superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they be never so gay or costly, all exteriour shews, which want the corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of inward goodnesse; so that now we may well say, <hi>thou hast shewed us men what is good, and what the Lord our God requires of us,</hi> even <hi>to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.</hi> Thou hast taught us, how in all our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious addresses we may come acceptably before the Lord, and what <hi>Mediatour</hi> we are to use, we need no longer ask, for thou hast shewed us the <hi>one Mediatour</hi> between God and man, and told us for whom he will intercede, <hi>even all that come to God by him, and

Interpreter</hi> of Gods mind, <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of all his servants, that they presume not to take any Mastership in this point.<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 9,10.</note> 
               <hi>And call no man your Father upon the earth, for one is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is in heaven; Neither be ye called Masters, for one is your Master, even Christ.</hi> These words are justly interpreted by most learned men as a command of <hi>Christ,</hi> directed against mens usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of authority to impose upon others, what they are to believe. The chief <hi>Master</hi> in the Shoole of the <hi>Iewish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> had such authority, that no man might contradict what he said, and in this sence we are to call no man
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114999:90"/>
               <hi>Father,</hi> but God who hath taught us by him, whom he appointed to be our <hi>onely Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> (i.e.) <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>

            <p>And now we see with what reason our Saviour closed his discourse, saying, <hi>If they believe not</hi> Moses <hi>and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, neither will they be perswaded, though one rose from the dead.</hi> With which I shall also close the doctrinall

            <p>Those which are not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with <hi>Gods</hi> truth so fairly propounded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may pray to <hi>Abraham</hi> to send one from the dead to preach to them, if their eares itch for such teachers, but when he comes, would they believe him? No, they would rather accost him thus. <hi>Art thou come out of thy Grave to fright us? Where is thy Certificate that thou wast in the other world? Wed do not know that ever thou wast dead; or if thou art a Ghost, we know not whether thou camest from heaven or hell, whether thy design be to teach, or to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb us. They say, good spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do not walk. What? thou
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114999:91"/>
hast hid some money somewhere. If thou comest to discover any murder, tell us. People talk of Goblins to fright children and fooles, but dost thou think that we will leave our profits or pleasures for a shade?</hi> That this is too true, we have an instance in the <hi>Iews,</hi> to whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> preached this point. For they had <hi>Lazarus</hi> (whether Christ alluded to his name or no) raised from the grave, and he discoursed with the <hi>Pharisees</hi>; but as soon as he asserted a truth, that cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their humour, they would have killed him, and sent him to the other world again, a messenger of their unbelief. When men have no mind to do their duty, they will quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:114999:91"/>
with the Messenger, and ask for another; not that they will then obey, but to gain a truce for disobedience, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and in the mean time they will seek for that which no doubt they will find, (i.e.) something to make themselves believe, that the next will not be so sent nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that they shall be able to except against him.</p>

When this holy Writ

               <p>It riseth in another, and brings up and lands safe the Truths which were committed unto it, as Historians report of the aforesaid river. <hi>If Moses</hi> applauded the Jewes happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, when he had finished his <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> saying, What nation is so happy, whose Statutes are so righteous? &amp;c. how happy are we, did we but know it, when God hath finished the Revelation of his will, filled it with all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary truths, plainly set down; and given us the <hi>Bible</hi> for the

                  <hi>Pandects</hi> of them? He hath drawn down his love from generation to generation, and hath made this great instance of it to teach us also.

                  <hi>vainly puffed up</hi> with conceits of their <hi>knowledge,</hi> neglect this most <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>greatest wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> God slights their <hi>presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and passeth them by with disregard, &amp; giveth such grace to the <hi>Humble,</hi> as maketh them <hi>wise to Salvation</hi>; so that <hi>This Temper</hi> is not only secured by Gods <hi>promise,</hi> but is indeed <hi>in it self</hi> the most <hi>disposed &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified</hi> for divine illuminations. <hi>A good and honest</hi> heart is like a <hi>soile fit</hi> &amp; <hi>prepared</hi> for the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal seed,</hi> as our Saviour hath taught us. And this is so known a Truth, that all wise men have propounded <hi>purification of heart as a rare method of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true knowledg, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the light of God shines brightest in those soules that are
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:114999:102"/>
purified with the flames of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love. Blessed are the pure in spirit, for they shall see God. Fogges</hi> of <hi>lust darken the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi> a soule possessed with sin is low, and uncapable. <hi>Dishonourable affections</hi> che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht by a <hi>wicked life,</hi> bring on a <hi>sottishnesse</hi> of mind, and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of fancy.</p>
               <p>But I have spoken of this <hi>Temper</hi> of soule, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth highly <hi>capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> us to the knowledge of God, but because the <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of it is the true <hi>improvement</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures, words,</hi> and <hi>sence,</hi> and in the happy <hi>product</hi> of it, all excellent <hi>knowledge</hi> ought to terminate. All spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation separate from this is contemptible, and leaves a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114999:103"/>
man miserable in the midst of his contemplations, let the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of them be what it will, even the revelations of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, for <hi>not the Reader, or knower, but the Doer shall be blessed,</hi> therefore let us take heed, lest for any <hi>fair shew</hi> we lose this <hi>true substance,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of seeming <hi>profound in knowledge, great in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, Masters of an opinion,</hi> or any such poor contemptible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let us become <hi>true lovers,</hi> and <hi>sincere practisers of those</hi> divine Truths, which are here declared by God; <hi>First,</hi> indeed that they might pass into our <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,</hi> but with this <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal intention,</hi> that our <hi>hearts</hi> by that means might be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to a <hi>true obedience</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:114999:103"/>This we shall more easily perform, if we endeavour, as we ought, to overcome <hi>two great hinderances</hi> (for the things are not grievous in themselves.)</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If we strive Christianly against our indispositions</hi>; this is requisite, for otherwise we shall ever and anon pretend impossibilities in our duty, and then we shall not onely <hi>grudge</hi> at the <hi>performance</hi> of it, but also <hi>quarrel</hi> with <hi>Divine Equity, Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> which hath appointed us fit duties, such things as in the <hi>matter</hi> are best for us, and whereof it hath given <hi>plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations</hi> that we may know them, and doth continue <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful assistances,</hi> that we may do them. Now if we indulge our
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:114999:104"/>
owne sloth, wee shall seek grounds of complaint, where we ought most to be satisfied, and at <hi>last</hi> fall into desperate murmurings, as the disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Jewes did, <hi>We pine away in our iniquities, and thou regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not our damnation. Nay, if our Fathers have eaten soure grapes, our teeth must be set on edge for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If <hi>we strive manfully against Temptations,</hi> which if we do not, we shall make <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements</hi> to <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to <hi>Duty, Gods mercies:</hi> or we shall seek a <hi>vain refuge</hi> for sin in that, which is put for <hi>the proof</hi> of our <hi>fidelity</hi>; as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry state of suffering is, and in both preposterously frame the reason of not sinning into a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:114999:104"/>
Childish excuse of Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. So <hi>Adam</hi> began,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The woman that thou gavest to be with me, offered me some, and I did eat. The woman that thou gavest me?</hi> See, how he crooks the Rib again! was it better to have been without her? it was ill to <hi>be alone</hi> before thou hadst <hi>company,</hi> and is it good now, when thou hast made an ill use of it? The <hi>woman,</hi> that he speaks of after this fashion, was given him for a <hi>meet help</hi>; and must the divine goodnesse be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with his own gift, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had perverted the use of it? It was the worst instance of excuse alleaged in the unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test time, for the gift was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an aggravation of the sin, and the ingratitude should
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114999:105"/>
have been confessed. Must all that God gives to careless men become of no better use then a <hi>great estate</hi> left to a <hi>young and foolish heir</hi>? must not <hi>God</hi> be <hi>good,</hi> lest <hi>we</hi> be <hi>bad</hi>? Because men abuse Gods gifts, will they therefore with that they had never received them? they will,
<q>
                     <l>Quam vellent sceptris nunquam fulsisse superbis!</l>
                  </q>
But what is that to God? they shew onely that his mercies were too good for them; for they have abused them.</p>
               <p>And if any <hi>condition</hi> be <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> we are to look upon the <hi>difficulties</hi> of <hi>duty,</hi> as <hi>spurres</hi> to <hi>vertue, trials</hi> of our <hi>Ingenuity</hi> set to <hi>enhaunce</hi> the <hi>reward,</hi> and we are to esteem them alwayes <hi>conquerable</hi> to good men; for
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114999:105"/>
God hath promised <hi>that we shall not be tempted above what we are able to bear</hi>; and therefore we should make that use of them, that the Apostle doth;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Let us be stedfast in a well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Religion, and unmoveable from the obedience of it,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To conclude briefly, since God hath <hi>magnified the word</hi> of his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> which he hath given to us in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> above any other <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Notice</hi> of his <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> to us, let us take heed.
