            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is written (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader,) that in the beginning, in the dayes of Seth the ſonne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, the people firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan<note place="margin">Geneſis. 4.</note> to inuocate and call on the name of God, which is to ſaye, by deuout Prayer they did require and aſke all things of him, prayſed him, truſted in him, and gaue to him the honour and worſhip that belonged vnto him.</p>
            <p>And this maner of praying, was vſed among the Fathers from Noe, vnto the comming of Chriſte: And they did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent &amp; vſe the ſame as a ſpecial meane and way to craue of God, his mercy, hys grace and his aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>By Prayer alſo they did ſet forthe the glory of God, appeaſed hys wrathe and diſpleaſure, and rendred hym thanckes for his benefites receyued. Chriſte oure Sauioure after his comming taught it<note place="margin">Math. 6. 7. Iohn. 16.</note> alſo, as a moſte neceſſary and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable doctrine, wherby we might craue of hys

heauenly Father, not onely all thyngs neceſſary and needefull for vs (as appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in hys Prayer taught to hys Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) but alſo forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, to the attainement of eternall Lyfe. And therefore maye we well ſaye, that as the vſe thereof is worthye prayſe, ſo is the want therof to be lamented. For where as Prayer is not frequented, there God is not called vppon for hys grace and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, neyther is he thancked for hys gracious benefites, the free gyfte of hys mercy is not deſired, neyther is the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible puniſhement of hys iuſtice feared.</p>
            <p>Right well therefore may we in this our age (wherein ſinne ſo much aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and the ordinarye vſe and time and place of Prayer ſo muche neglected) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the lack of the vſe thereof in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, wyth the looſe lyfe of men, whiche is ſo frayle, ſo weake, ſo peruerſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſo prone to euill, that almoſte none in manner ſheweth in liuing to feare God. Who is afrayde to offende hym? or who refrayneth to blaſpheme hys holye name? who ſeeketh to ſubdue
<pb facs="tcp:10137:4"/>
the fleſhe to the Spirit? yea rather who ſeeketh not to lay the brydle. of liberty at length, freely and without ſtaye to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe ſinne, the cauſe whereof is (as I haue ſayd) the want of true and vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned calling on God in deuout Prayer: For by it is wrought in vs, the hate of ſinne, and by it is driuen from vs, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions that might prouoke the wrath of God vpon vs. And therefore it may be called oure ſpeedy meſſanger or truſty Embaſſadour, which doth obtain<note place="margin">1. Kings. 2.</note> for vs a gratyous audience before the Maieſtie of God, preſenting to him the fruites of our contrite hearts.</p>
            <p>But who may not now troweſt thou (Gentle Reader) rightlye ſaye to the world, as Ionas ſayd to the Niniuetes: There is yet forty dayes, and the world<note place="margin">Luke. 11</note> ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The Niniuetes, as ſone as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had proclaimed diſtruction to come on them for their ſinne, they immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the firſt crying of him, with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and feare turned to God, beleued him, feared his iuſtice, confeſſed their
<pb facs="tcp:10137:5"/>
ſinnes, and with penitent hearts craued hys mercye. But thou, O Englande, whome it hath pleaſed God to call, not by the mouth of one man, as he did the Niniuets, but he hath called thee by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other and ſundrye meanes: as firſt by giuing thee a moſte vertuous &amp; graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Queene, who for hir worſhipping of God and ſetting forth hys name and glorye, maye be compared wyth Ioſiah king of Iuda: for hir vertues, pollicie, &amp; wyſedome, with Iudeth: &amp; for the cares toward hir peopte, with humble Heſter.</p>
            <p>He hath not (as I ſaye) called thee, by thys hys good gifte of ſo mercifull and gracious a Queene, but alſo hath called thee by the Preachers of hys Worde, by death and famine, otherwiſe by fyre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Heauen, by motion of warre, and laſtly by mortallitie of Peſtilence, yet nothing (O Englande) doeſt thou regarde hys calling: wherefore to thee it may be ſaid, the more he ſeeketh thee the more thou ſhunneſt him, the more he loueth thee the leſſe thou regardeſt him, the more thou needeſt him the leſſe thou thinkeſt
<pb facs="tcp:10137:5"/>
on him: ſo that by thy great vnkindneſſe God is compelled to ſay vnto thee, as hee ſayd to the Iſraelites: I am ouerweried with bearing and long ſuffring of thy wycked and ſinfull liuing. If thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doe deſire to be free from the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plagues and threatnings of GOD, thou muſt lyke a true Niniuete, wyth a broken and penitent heart, call on God wyth continuall Prayer, crauing of him hys mercy, grace and aſſiſtaunce, which if thou aſke wyth a ſure Fayth, he wyll graunt it thee. And therefore when thou doeſt praye, thou muſte (after the minde of the Apoſtle) aſke with a ſtedfaſt faith,<note place="margin">Iames. 1.</note> not wauering nor doubtfull, and thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſhall be graunted thee. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that aſketh as he ought, receiueth: and hee ſeeketh well that ſeeketh wyth continuall deſire: and he knocketh well which dothe prouoke Gods goodneſſe to heare him, as did the Woman of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanie, vnto whome Chriſte ſayde, after hir peticion made: O Woman great<note place="margin">Math. 15.</note> is thy Fayth, be it vnto thee euen as thou haſt deſired.
<pb facs="tcp:10137:6"/>
Thus (gentle Reader) if thou loue thy health, if thou long to be acceptable to God, if thou deſire to be ſure from the grennes of the Diuell, from the ſtormes of thys Worlde, from the way of thine ennimies, if thou couet to be happye at the laſte, let no daye paſſe thee, but that thou once at the leaſte doe preſent thy ſelfe to GOD by Prayer: And falling downe before hym wyth an humble af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte of deuout minde (not from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of the lippes onely, but oute of the inwardeneſſe of the heart,) cry with the Prophet: O Lorde, the offences of my Youthe and mine ignoraunce, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member<note place="margin">Pſalme. 25.</note> thou not: but after thy mercye and goodneſſe O Lorde remember thou me. And thus the holye ſpirite that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thee, and eke thine owne neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſhall euery houre put thee in minde what thou ſhalt praye for, and what you ſhall deſire of God.</p>
            <p>Who therefore that will perſiſt and continue in Prayer, ſhall not onely bee vnto God dailye more and more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and acceptable, but ſhall alſo dailye

Looke (O Holye Father vppon the Sacrifice of fleſhe, and pardon the offences of fleſhe: and bycauſe fleſhe hath ſtirred thee to anger, let fleſhe (I beſeeche thee) moue thee to mercy, that lyke as fleſhe hath ſeduced and led mee to ſinne, ſo fleſhe may gette and obtayne for me, remiſſion for ſinne. For certayne it is, muche that mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity hath deſerued, but yet much more it is, that the goodneſſe of my redeemer may euen of ryght require. Mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe is great, but yet holye Father, hys righteouſneſſe is greater: wherefore moſt noble Creator of lyght, pardon mine offences, for the miſerable trauayles and paynes that thy beloued Sonne did ſuſtayne. Now I beſech thee (O mercifull Father) let hys goodneſſe be ſet againſt my wickedneſſe, hys mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtye and temperance, agaynſt my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious
