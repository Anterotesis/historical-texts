            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But what is your ende M. Mosse in alleaging this saying of the Preacher <hi>There is no end of making manie bookes?</hi> I feare me you ayme not at that marke which the Preacher did: you haue another ende then he had, and therefore y<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

meaning is corrupt.</p>
                  <p>Indéede the varietie of matter and inuention in all ages hath beene wonderfull: yet can you not saie, and say truely, it was without measure, vnlesse you condemne simply the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of wits, and inuention, which are the worthie giftes and graces of almightie God, bestowed vpon man, nor that this varietie of matter and inuention hath bene manifested in all ages by written bookes. For both the heathen people were a long time without the benefite of bookes, and the Iewes, and Church of God, till Moises daies (which was many ages from the creation of the world) vtterly voyde of all helpe of the written word. And saie you not your selfe within a few lines<note place="margin">Contrariety.</note> after, <hi>the writings of the ancients were few?</hi> If fewe, how were they without measure?

                  <p>Last of all, interpreting the saying of the Preacher so as if he spake onely of this present age, and latter time wherein we liue, you mistake him much. For albeit he foresawe the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of writings that were to come abroade in the latter daies, yet, no doubt, he ment properly the writings which he saw were attempted in his daies, or extant in the world afore his time, which neither can be said to ouerflow, or to haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowed the bankes of modestie and discretion, because there be multitudes of them: that is no sufficient cause, yea no cause at all. Of good thinges the moe, yea the greater multitudes, the better, and there be multitudes of writings, which you dare not without impudencie auouch to haue ouerflowed the bankes of modestie and discretion. And of such bookes it is not the iniquitie, but the felicitie of the latter time to haue good store.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1034:7"/>
or vpon what ground you write, blame me not though I doe déeme you none of the wisest Writers. And be your selfe iudge whether you were with or besides your wits when thus you wrote. <hi>And me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are become like windy instruments, ready to speake as soon as they receue breath, though they giue an harsh &amp; vncertain sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

The first sentence agréeing nothing with that going afore in your Epistle, in which you spake wholie of writing, and in that of speaking: the nexte answering nothing vnto the other, where you enter into the speach both of reading and writing, and vtter nothing of speaking, and yet all so with Coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons either copulatiue or causall are linked together, as if they depended directly one thing vppon an other, when they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse.

Church and Common weale which they are bounde. The worlde is not of golde nowe, but of earth.

                  <p>He is a foole that will no siluer because he can get no golde: &amp; they are no wise men that despice the meane graces of God, (if any grace of God be meane) séeing they can haue no vse of the best mens gifts, or more truely of the more notable giftes in worser men.

                  <p>But you are deceiued much. The often imprinting thereof doth no whit argue the good approbation which publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie doth giue vnto a booke. I could name bookes vnto you (within lesse than twenty yéeres) foure times imprinted, which yet neuer by publique authoritie were approoued. It followeth not, <hi>A booke is often imprinted, therefore it is allovved by authority.</hi> You know, or at least may know, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters commonly doe gaine most by those bookes which are most forbidden. Whereby you may note into what a peruerse and froward generation we are fallen, wherein men most earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire, though they buie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most déerelie, the things which by wholsome statutes and Proclamations be most straightlie prohibited to be either bought or solde. I say not that this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme is so.

                  <p>Neither doth it followe, It hath béene foure times within these twentie yeares imprinted: therfore the particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this lande do approoue it. You are neuer able to prooue

that the particular Chuches of this lande haue approoued the same. I thinke your meaning is, it hath béene approoued by all because it hath béene taught in some particular Churches.
