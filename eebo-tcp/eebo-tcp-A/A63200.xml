         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Maſter <hi>Ball</hi> moved by the requeſt of Brethren, drew up this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,

unto the reverend Elders of the ſeverall Churches in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
The Reply ſent miſcarrying in the hand, to which it was
committed, though both Letters and printed Bookes truſted in
the ſame hand were delivered: Hereupon another Copie was
from <hi>New England</hi> deſired, and accordingly prepared in the yeare following. In
the meane time, the Anſwer being tendered to the Preſſe, it was judged more
meete to keepe the Reply in readineſſe to attend the publiſhing of the Anſwer, then
to part with it in the other way. This intelligence was the laſt yeare conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>New England,</hi> ſince which time, there hath been an expectation to ſee that in
Print, which now is ſent abroad to open view. By this Relation it is manifeſt who
are voluntiers, and who are preſſed to come forth as defendants, in theſe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.
Theſe differences betwixt the loving Brethren of old <hi>England</hi> and New,
had not been made thus notorious, if ſome who cry up the Church way in <hi>New
England,</hi> as the only way of God, had not been forward, to blow them abroad in
the world. But ſurely the providence of God is remarkeable in bringing theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
into debate at this time, when the Miniſters of the Goſpell from all the
Counties in the Kingdome are called together by both houſes of Parliament, to
conſult about the healing of our breaches, which are very many and dangerous:
The Copie of this Reply being committed to our cuſtodie we are neceſſitated to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the publication of it: yet we ſhall preface nothing concerning the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
it ſelfe, becauſe our known reſpects to the reverend and judicious Author will
render us partiall, and our teſtimony can adde no credit to his works, which withall
indifferent Readers will plead ſufficiently for their own acceptance. If this diſcourſe
ſhall adde any diſcovery of light unto them, who deſire a ſound judgement in the
controverſies here agitated, our end is obtained, and our prayers anſwered,

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hiles we lived together in the ſame Kingdome, we profeſſed the ſame faith,
joyned in the ſame Ordinances, laboured in the worke of God to gaine ſoules
unto his kingdome, and maintained the puritie of worſhip againſt corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
both on the right hand and on the left. But ſince your departure into
<hi>New England,</hi> we heare (and partly beleeve it) that divers have embraced
certaine vain opinions, ſuch as you diſliked formerly, and we judge to be groundleſſe and
unwarrantable. As that a ſtinted forme of prayer, and ſet Liturgie is unlawfull; That it
is not lawfull to joyne in prayer, or to receive the Sacrament, where a ſtinted Liturgie is
uſed. 3. That the children of godly and approved Chriſtians are not to be Baptized, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
their parents bee ſet members of ſome perticular congregation. 4. that the Parents
themſelves, though of approved piety are not to be received to the Lords Supper, untill
they bee admitted as ſet members. 5. That the power of Excommunication<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. is ſo in
the body of the Church that what the major part ſhall allow, that muſt be done, though
the Paſtors and Governors, and part of the aſſembly be of another minde, and peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
upon more ſubſtantiall reaſons. 6. That none are to be admitted as ſet members,
but they muſt promiſe, not to depart, or remove unleſſ the Congregation will give leave.
7. That a Miniſter is ſo a Miniſter to a particular Congregation, that if they diſlike him
unjustly, or leave him, he ceaſeth to be a Miniſter. 8. That a Minister cannot performe
any ministeriall act in another Cogregation. 9. That members of one Congregation may
not communicate in another.</p>
            <p>Theſe and other ſuch like (which we omit to reckon up) are written and reported to
be the common Tenents in <hi>New England,</hi> which are received with great applauſe,
maintained with great confidence, and applauded as the only Church way wherein the
Lord is to be worſhipped. And letters from <hi>New England</hi> have ſo taken with divers
in many parts of this Kingdome, that they have left our Aſſemblies becauſe of a ſtinted
Liturgie, and excommunicated themſelves from the Lords Supper becauſe ſuch as are
not debarred from it. And being turned aſide themſelves, they labour to enſnare others,
to the griefe of the godly, the ſcandall of Religion, the wounding of their owne ſoules (if
they did adviſedly conſider the matter) and great advantage of them, that are wily to
eſpy, and ready to make uſe of all advantages to prejudice the truth. (Beloved brethren)
if you ſtood in our places, we are well aſſured it would be no ſmall griefe unto you, to
beare and ſee the people led aſide to the diſgrace of the Goſpell, upon weake and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
imaginations, and in raſh end inconſiderate zeale to deale with that which is of God,
as if it were of man. And if it be to us griefe of heart to heare that you have changed
<pb facs="tcp:59009:3"/>
from that truth which you did profeſſe, and embrace that for truth which in former times
upon ſound grounds you did condemne as erroneous, we hope you will not be offended. You
know how oft it hath beene objected that Non-conformiſts in practice are Separatiſts in
heart, but that they goe croſſe to their own poſitions, or ſmother the truth for ſiniſter ends.
They of the Separation boast that they ſtand upon the Non-conformiſts grounds. A
vainglorious flouriſh and ſleight pretence. But both theſe are much countenanced by your
ſudden change if you be changed, as it is reported. How ſhall your brethren bee able to
ſtand up in the defence of their innocencie, and the uprightneſſe of their cauſe, when your
example and opinion ſhall be cast in their diſh? Muſt they leave you now, with whom
they have held ſociety? Or will you plead for Separation, which you have condemned as
raſh and inconſiderate? You know that thy who have run this way, have fallen into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
diviſions, and may not you juſtly feare, leſt the ſame befall you? Some warnings
you have had already, and have you not cauſe to feare every day more and more? Errour
is very fruitfull and will ſpread apace. A cracke in the foundation may occaſion a wide
breach in the building, where there will not be means, or mind to amend it. Experience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day may tutour us herein. But to let paſſe all inconveniences, our requeſt in all
meekneſſe and love is, that if theſe or any of the forementioned opinions be indeed your
Tenents, you would be pleaſed to take a ſecond review of your grounds, and ſend us your
ſtrongeſt reaſons that have ſwayed you in theſe matters: and if we ſhall find them upon
due examination to be ſuch as will carry weight, we ſhall be ready to give you the right
hand of fellowſhip; if otherwiſe you ſhall receive our juſt and modeſt animadverſions in
what we conceive you have erred from the truth. You will not iudge, if we cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the ſtrength of your grounds it is becauſe we love not the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or bee carryed
with by-ſpects (though theſe conceipts prevaile too much:) Such rigid and harſh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
cannot lodge in meeke and humble breaſts. Weighty reaſons promote the truth not
unadviſed judging. You your ſelves have judged that to be errour, which now you take
to be truth when yet you were not blinded with by re-reſpects, nor hudwinked your eyes, that
you might not ſee the light. And if you have juſt warrant from God to pull downe what
you have builded, and to build what you have pulled downe, we deſire you would loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and maturely impart it, for as yet we have ſeene none, which we are not ready to prove,
and ſhew by the rule of truth to be too weake to carry any burthen.</p>
            <p>We adore with you the fulneſſe of the Scripture, and we know the Counſell of the Lord
ſhall ſtand: if you can ſhew that you walke in the wayes of God, we ſhall heartily rejoyce
to walke with you: but if you have turned aſide, we ſhall earnestly deſire that you would
be pleaſed ſeriouſly to conſider the matter, and ſpeedily reforme, what is out of order.
Thus not doubting of your favourable interpretation of this our motion, for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of diſtraction, maintenance of peace, and ſearching out of the truth, whereby we may
be directed to live to the praiſe of God, the good of his people, and comfort of our ſoules,

we hope ſhall never be blotted out) ſo we have alſo ſeen cauſe to looke back to our
former adminiſtrations there, and to ſearch and trie our wayes; that wherein ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we have formerly gone aſtray, we might judge our ſelves for it before the Lord:
And that ſeeing now God hath ſet before us an open doore of libertie, wee might
neither abuſe our libertie in the Goſpel, to runne out into any groundleſſe unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
courſes, nor neglect the preſent opportunitie to adminiſter (by the helpe of
Chriſt) all the holy ordinances of God, according to the patterne ſet before us in
the Scripture; In our native Countrey, when we were firſt called to the Miniſtery,
many of us tooke ſome things to be indifferent and lawfull, which in after-times we
ſaw to be ſinfull, and durſt not continue in the practiſe of them there; Afterwards
ſome things that we bare as burthens, that is, as things inexpedient though not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unlawfull; we have no cauſe to retain and practiſe the ſame things here, which
would not have been not onely inexpedient, but unlawfull: ſuch things as a man
may tollerate when he cannot remove them, hee cannot tollerate without ſinne,
when he may remove them; Beſides ſome things we practiſed there (which wee
ſpeak to our ſhame and griefe) which we never took into ſerious conſideration whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were lawfull, and expedient or no, but took them for granted, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
received; not onely by the moſt Reformed Churches, but by the moſt godly
and judicious ſervants of God amongſt them; which nevertheleſſe when we came
to weigh them in the ballance of the Sanctuarie, we could not find ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in the Word to receive them, and eſtabliſh them here: of one of theſe three
kinds will theſe our preſent practiſes appeare to be, which you call our new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or, Innovations here; except it be ſome few of them, which though they have
been reported to you to be our Judgements and practiſes, yet are indeed farre from
<pb facs="tcp:59009:4"/>
us: The particulars are too many, and too weightie to give you account of them,
and the ground of our proceedings about them in a Letter. But to give you (if it be
the will of God) the better ſatisfaction, we have ſent you a ſhort Treatiſe touching
each particular, that according to your deſire you might underſtand from us how
farre we do acknowledge any of theſe tenents, and upon what ground, hoping that
according to your promiſe, if upon due examination you ſhall find any weight in
them, you will give us the right hand of fellowſhip. But if otherwiſe, you will ſend
us your juſt and faithfull animadverſions, and we doe not ſuſpect your loves to the
truth, or your ſincere ſpeaking according to your conſcience in the ſight of God,
Neither taxe we you as ſiding from the truth with by-reſpects, whereof you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
verily we abhorre ſuch raſh, harſh, and preſumptuous notoriouſneſſe, we ſee
as much cauſe to ſuſpect the integritie of our own hearts, as yours; and ſo much the
more, as being more privie to the deceitfulneſſe of our own hearts then to yours.
And we cannot but with much thankfulneſſe of heart acknowledge the many rich
precious treaſures of his grace, wherewith the Lord hath furniſhed ſundrie of you
above your Brethren, which cauſeth us with great reverence to accept, and receive
what further light God may be pleaſed to impart unto us by you; But as we have
beleeved, ſo have we hitherto practiſed, and ſo have moſt of us ſpoken this our
Anſwer to your particulars, moſt of us we may ſay, becauſe there wants not ſome
Brethren amongſt us who proceed further, even to looke at all ſet formes of Prayer
invented by men of another age or congregation, and preſcrib<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to their Brethren
to be read out of a book for the prayers of the Church, as Images, or Imaginations
of men, forbidden in the ſecond Commandement; But as we leave them to their
libertie of their own judgements without prejudice, ſo do we alſo concurre with
the reſt of them, ſo farre as we all goe in bearing witneſſe againſt any ſet formes, or
the corruptions in them; In diſpatching whereof, we have been the more ſlow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it behoved us firſt to inquire into, and to ſettle ſome controverſies amongſt
our ſelves, before we could well attend to entertaine diſcourſe about forraigne que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
which do not ſo neerely concerne our preſent eſtate and practiſe. Beſides
your Letters being ſent to the Miniſters of the Churches, and ſome of us dwelling
farre a ſunder, it was not an eaſie thing for all of us often to meet together to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of theſe Queſtions, much leſſe to reſolve upon one juſt anſwer. But having at
length (by the aſſiſtance of God) brought our Anſwers to this iſſue, we commend
it to the bleſſing of the Lord, and in him to your Chriſtian, and judicious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
where if all things bee found ſafe, and duely warranted from Scripture
grounds; do you alſo as ſeemeth vigilant Watchmen of the Lords flock, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
witneſſes to God; If any thing ſeeme doubtfall to you, conſider and weigh it
very well before you reject it: If any thing appeare to be unfound, and diſſnant
from the Word (which we for our parts cannot diſterne) we ſhall willingly attend
<pb facs="tcp:59009:5"/>
to what further light God may ſend unto us by you: In the meane while wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you in the Lord, not to ſuffer ſuch apprehenſions to lodge in your minds,
which you intimate in your Letters; As if we here juſtified the wayes of riged ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
which ſometimes amongſt you we have formerly borne witneſſe againſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſo build againe the things we have deſtroyed; you know they ſeparate from
your Congregations, as no Churches; from the Ordinances diſpenſed by you as
meere Antichriſtian, and from your ſelves as no viſible Chriſtians. But wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
unfainedly, we ſeparate from the corruptions which we conceive to be left in
your Churches, and from ſuch Ordinances adminiſtred therein as we feare are not
of God, but of men; And for your ſelves, we are ſo farre from ſeparating as from no
viſible Chriſtians, as that you are under God in our hearts (if the Lord would
ſuffer it) to live and die together; and we looke at ſundrie of you as men of that
eminent growth in Chriſtianitie, that if there be any viſible Chriſtians under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
amongſt you are the men, which for theſe many yeeres have been written in
your foreheads <hi>(Hoiineſſe to the Lord)</hi> which we ſpeake not to prejudice any truth
which our ſelves are here taught and called to profeſſe, but we ſtill beleeve though
perſonall Chriſtians may be eminent in their growth of Chriſtianitie: yet Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
had ſtill need to grow from apparent defects to puritie; and from reformation
to Reformation, age after age, till the Lord have utterly aboliſhed Antichriſt with
the breath of his mouth, and the brightneſſe of his comming to the full and cleare
revelation of all his holy Truth; eſpecially touching the ordering of his houſe and
publick worſhip; as a pledge of this our eſtimation of you, and ſincere affection
to you, we have ſent you theſe Anſwers to your demand, and ſhall be readie, by the

beſet with many temptations to ſinne,
knowing what we know beſt, but darkly
and in part, no marvell, if in many
things we offend ignorantly, of frailty
for want of due conſideration, raſhly miſtaking Errour for
Truth, condemning Truth for Errour, ſuſpecting evill without
cauſe, and not ſuſpecting where is juſt reaſon, drawing erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
concluſions from ſound principles, and maintaining
truths upon weak grounds; ſo that in examination of our wayes, and endevours
of their Reformation wee had need to looke warily, that wee turn not to the right
hand or to the left, for in the one we add to the Word of God, as well as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and of our ſelves are apt to ſtrike aſide to both. A looſe conſcience will be
profane, a tender, ſcrupulous. It ſtands us therefore upon to have our ſelves in ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in as much as experience teacheth that many have ſwerved from the path of
found peace and comfort on each hand.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>(Beloved Brethren)</hi> if ſince your comming into <hi>New England,</hi> upon
ſerious Review of former actions you have diſcovered any truths heretofore not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of, we ſhal be ſo far from rejecting them becauſe of your former judgment
and practice, that we ſhall heartily deſire to know and imbrace the ſame with you,
and bleſſe God for you as the happy inſtruments of his glory, our Inſtruction &amp; the
advancement of the truth. But if the diſcoveries be of the like nature with the poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
mentioned in the Letter; as before, ſo ſtill, we conceive them to be new opinions,
and not warranted by Scripture, which is the true Antiquity.</p>
            <p>Opinions we ſay, not practices, for not changing your opinion, you might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
alter your practice; nay, what you did tolerate formerly as a burthen, in caſe
<pb facs="tcp:59009:6"/>
not free, you might well forgoe being at your liberty. Your judgement being the
ſame, you might uſe your liberty in forbearance of a ſet Liturgie, and yet retaine the
ſame judgement of a ſtinted Liturgie, that you had before; you might forbeare
for a time upon ſpeciall Reaſon (ſuch as preſent ſtate and occaſion might ſuggeſt)
to receive to the Sacrament approved Chriſtians, not ſet members of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Congregation; as ſome Brethren do) who yet dare not think it unlawfull to
communicate with ſuch in the act of worſhip, or deem it juſt and right altogether
to debar them, as having no right nor title to thoſe priviledges of this Church.
It is your opinions whereto we had reſpect not ſimply your practice. It never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into us to perſwade you to a ſet Liturgy, much leſſe to complain that you
had not accepted ours. But that all ſtinted Liturgies ſhould be condemned as devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
worſhip, and ſo condemned as that none may lawfully be preſent at, or pertake
of the Sacraments adminiſtred in a ſtinted or deviſed forme, this wee called a new
opinion.</p>
            <p>Neither do we mention it becauſe we knew it to be the private opinion of ſome
Brethren among you, whom we had left to the liberty of their owne judgment, ſo
far as the maintenance of the Truth, and a juſt call did not ingage us: but becauſe
it was cryed up, and advanced with all diligence, and endeavour of ſome among
us ſtanding affected <hi>New England</hi>-ward, as if a chief point of holineſſe conſiſted in
ſeparation. You know how great a fire a little ſparkle kindles. And ſeeing this
Diſtraction and Rent had its originall, growth and continuance from ſome Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in thoſe parts, or affected to that way, when in loving and friendly manner
we could neither receive grounds at home for our conviction, nor procure juſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to the contrary; what could wee doe leſſe then call upon you joyntly to
know your judgment, and either by ſound proof to be by you convinced (if happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you ſhould approve their ſeparation (which we eſteem groundleſſe, raſh, unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and prejudiciall to outward peace) or being backed by a teſtimony of its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
from you, we might the better be both incouraged, and furniſhed to endevour
the quenching of that fire which was kindled but in too many places,</p>
            <p>In other perticulars alſo, wee conceive, you goe beyond Commiſſion given of
God: granting them authority to whom God hath not committed it, debarring
others from the priviledge of the Sacraments, who have title thereto by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace.</p>
            <p>Your love in that you were pleaſed to ſignifie firſt your kinde and reſpective ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of our Letter, and now alſo to ſend us an anſwer thereto, we acknowledge
it with all thankfulneſſe, and ſhall endevour (through the grace of God) to return
like affection in truth of heart, if in meaſure we fall ſhort. Of your reſpect to us in
particular, we make no queſtion, your expreſſions are beyond that we could expect,
as alſo what we dare own. But we humbly beſeech the Lord to direct, uphold, and
<pb facs="tcp:59009:6"/>
guide us, that in ſome meaſure we may walk worthy of our vocation, and approve
our ſelves faithfull to your conſciences.</p>
            <p>It was one end of our writing to be ſatisfied in this point, whether you approve
the ways of Separation (whereof wee complain) and their courſes who laboured
with all their might, when they conceived hope to be heard to perſwade thereunto.
Againſt which (if we knew your judgment) you teſtified among us.</p>
            <p>You know they that ſeparate are not all of one ſtraine and temper. Some deny
all communion with us publick and private, ſome admit of private, but deny all
publick, and ſome joyne in Prayer before, and after Sermon, as alſo preaching of
the Word (becauſe in their eſteeme, this may be done without communion in a
Church-way) but refuſe to partake of the Sacraments. All which Separations wee
judge uncharitable, contrary to the Commandement of Chriſt, and have ever
thought that you (whilſt with us) and we were of one minde herein.</p>
            <p>If of late we have conceived fears of ſome of you (deere Brethren) as leaning too
much to what formerly you diſliked, we beſeech you weigh what urgent and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Reaſons forced us thereunto, and we ſhall moſt gladly (wee heartily deſire you
to reſt aſſured) lay hold of every line and ſyllable, that may tend to diſlodge ſuch
apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>For as we conceive, the diſpute to be unreaſonably moved, the Rent offenſive,
the opinions themſelves prejudiciall to the cauſe of God, and the advancers thereof
to have paſſed the limits preſcribed by God; ſo wee ſhall eſteem it an ineſtimable
bleſſing, if (now what hinders being removed) wee might joyn with one heart and
ſoule, in one way of God to promote his glory, and ſeek the good of his Church
and people.</p>
            <p>We truſt in the Lord, we ſhould not draw back in any courſe wherein wee may
ſee the Lord going before us, nor be an offence to any to keep the Lords way; wee
ſeek the truth, and are perſwaded it is the cauſe of God which we defend: we plead
for Communion with the Churches of Chriſt, no further then they hold communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Chriſt, ſtill deſiring <hi>to keepe the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, with
your ſelves and all others,</hi> who walke in the right way of truth, peace and
comfort.</p>
            <p>How the Lord may be pleaſed to deale with us, or diſpoſe of us wee know not
(his bleſſed will be done.) But of this we are reſolved, through his grace, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to raiſe trouble or diſſention among you, if through ignorance or infirmity
we ſhall not ſo fall in, as to be of one minde with you in theſe matters. And here
we deſire you to conſider that in theſe particulars you diſſent as much one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we proceed to declare our ſelves concerning this poſition: It
will be needfull that ſome things be premiſed, for the explication
of the terms thereof. We ſuppoſe,</p>
               <p>1 By a Liturgy and forme of Prayer, you mean not a forme of
private Prayers compoſed for the helpe and direction of weaker
Chriſtians: but the <hi>Syſtem</hi> or body of publike Prayers generally
uſed in the Engliſh Pariſhes, complied for the Churches uſe by other men not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
guided by God, to be ſaid or read out of a Book by their Miniſters as the
Churches Prayers. And that this is your meaning, may appeare from your Letter
it ſelf, wherein you complain that divers in many parts of that Kingdome have
left their Aſſemblies, becauſe of a ſtinted Liturgy. Now we know not of any other
ſtinted Liturgy from which the people do abſent themſelves, but onely that which
is in uſe in the Engliſh Churches.</p>
               <p>For as for a forme of Prayer in generall, wee conceive your meaning cannot be
of that. For it is evident that many Preachers conſtantly uſe one ſet form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of their own making before their Sermons, with whom the people refuſe not to
joyn.</p>
               <p>2 By ſtinted and ſet, you mean ſuch Prayers, as are ſo impoſed upon the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Miniſters, as that they are limited to that very form of words expreſſed in
the Book without addition, diminution, or alteration; for that Liturgy and forme
among you, is in this ſenſe ſet and ſtinted.</p>
               <p>3 By unlawfull, you mean that we looking at that form, as ſwerving from the
Rule; neither dare firſt practice it our ſelves, not ſecondly approve the uſe of it by
others.</p>
               <p>This being the true ſtate of the queſtion, ſo far as it appears to us, from the letter.
We anſwer, 1 For our own practice, the Churches here doe not uſe any ſtinted
forme of Prayer and ſet Liturgy, for theſe and other ſuch Reaſons. 1 Becauſe
we finde no neceſſity of any ſtinted Liturgy to be uſed among us, by vertue of any
divine precept. And ſeeing the Commiſſion of the Apoſtles limited them, to teach
men to obſerve and do onely what Chriſt did command them in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Math. 28. 20.</hi> Who are we and what are our Churches, that we ſhould preſume
above this Commiſſion? And, we hope, it will not be offenſively taken by any godly
Brethren, That we ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free in
this, as well as in all other things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the lawfulneſſe of ſet forms and ſtinted Liturgies is queſtioned
and doubted of by many faithfull ſervants of God: whereas for Church-officers to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59009:8"/>
edifie the Churches by their own gifts, as well in praying as in preaching, all ſorts
without controverſie grant it to be lawfull. Now ſpirituall prudence guideth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
when two ways are ſet before them, one doubtfull though ventured on by
ſome, the other certainly ſafe and good, though neglected by many, to chooſe that
which is ſafe, declining the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe Primitive paterns of all the Churches of God in their beſt times
(when as touching this point they kept the rule in their eye) whether Jewiſh before
Chriſt, or Chriſtian above a 100 yeers after Chriſt, yield not the leaſt footſtep to
ſhew us another ſafe way to walk in, then this w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have choſen. As for after times
towards the end of the ſecond, and beginning of the third Century, we know how
far the Churches were then degenerated and declined from the firſt purity; neither
do we marvell at it, ſeeing in the Apoſtles time the myſtery of iniquity began to
work, and it was then foretold, that the power of godlineſſe would be in aftertimes
exchanged for empty formes. In which reſpect, we look not at them as our guides
neither in this, nor other particulars not warranted by the Rule, herein following
the adviſe of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who himſelf ſaw the corruption of thoſe times, <hi>Non eſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendendum
quid aliquis ante nos faciendum putaverit, ſed quid qui ante omnes est
Christus fecerit &amp; faciendum praeceperit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, ſeeing our Chriſtian liberty freeth us from binding our ſelves to
any religious obſervances, whereunto the written word doth not bind us. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpirituall prudence directs us to chooſe thoſe ways, which on all hands are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
to be ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fe, avoiding thoſe that be doubtfull and hazardous. And ſeeing it will
not be ſafe for us, needleſly to ſwerve from the conſtant practice of all Churches
that are recorded in Scripture, and there held forth as a cloud of Witneſſes for us to
follow in matters of this nature, wee therefore may not, doe not, dare not uſe ſet
forms of Prayers and ſtinted Liturgies in theſe Churches.</p>
               <p>More particularly, in that we doe not uſe that forme of Prayer and ſtinted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
which is in uſe among your ſelves: theſe and ſuch other like Reaſons have
induced us thereunto. 1 The many and juſt exceptions whereunto that Liturgy
is lyable both for matter and manner; for the proofe whereof wee referre you to

may be cleer to any that ſhall conſider that it is the ſame for ſubſtance that
was uſed in the days of Poperty. And therefore when the Papiſts in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and

uſed in that Kingdome, that he would have ratified it by his authority, if Q.
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> would have ſo received it. And many of the people put ſuch holineſſe
in it, that they think God is not rightly worſhipped, nor his Sabbath well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
nor the Sacraments ſufficiently adminiſtred, if there be no reading of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
And others put ſuch holineſſe and neceſſity in it, that they preferre it before
Gods holy Ordinance of preaching the Word.<note place="margin">This Argument is uſed by the Abridgment againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Ceremonies, and we do not ſee but it is as ſtrong againſt this Liturgy.</note> In ſo
much as the Miniſters are in the danger of being called
in queſtion, and of being cenſured, if they doe not read
that Liturgy every Lords day without omitting any part
thereof, either in reſpect of preaching or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>3 In regard of the many wofull ſcandals, and dangerous conſequences of uſing
that Liturgie, of which we ſuppoſe you are not ignorant.</p>
               <p>To mention but two, <hi>Viz.</hi> The hardning of Papiſts who are imboldned to think
better of their own Breviaries, Maſſe-Books, Portuiſſes, ſeeing that Liturgie hath bin
extracted out of thoſe books, and rather fetched from them then from the forms u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in any of the reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>2 The conntenancing and eſtabliſhing of an unlearned Idol Miniſtery, of not-Preaching
curates, Non-reſidents, Pluralities, &amp;c. in whoſe skirts is to be found the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59009:9"/>
blood of ſo many mens ſouls living and dying in their ſins, while they ignorantly
content themſelves with, and harden themſelves in ſome empty forms of Religion
and blinde devotion, which are begotten and cheriſhed chiefely by ſuch prayers and
miniſters. Neither is there leſſe ſcandall hereby (we meane not onely taken but
given) then by the eating of an Idolathite, in the Idols Temple condemned by the
Apoſtle <hi>1 Cor. 8. 7 10.</hi> For if the eating of an Idolathite by him that had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and knew that an Idol was nothing, and that all meats were lawfull, did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
others to honour the Idol, and therefore was a ſcandall given, ſo alſo it is in
this caſe.</p>
               <p>4 Seeing that booke is ſo impoſed as that the miniſter in reading of it, is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the very words ſet downe without any diminution, addition, or alteration;
therefore we dare not uſe it.</p>
               <p>For 1 The Lord himſelfe hath not limited his people to his own formes and
therefore we ſee not, how it can be lawfull to be limited to other mens formes;
For in thus doing we ſhould ſubject our ſelves to the exerciſe of ſuch an authority
and power of the Prelates, as in this caſe puts forth a ſtronger act of limiting power
then Chriſt himſelfe, who doth not limit us to thoſe formes, which himſelfe hath
ſet downe in Scripture: For though we acknowledge the Lords prayer and other
formes ſet down in Scripture, may be lawfully uſed as prayers (due cautions being
obſerved) yet there is not a limitation lying upon the Churches in the uſe of thoſe
prayers. And therefore we do not find that the Apoſtles ever uſed that form taught
by Chriſt in thoſe very words, much leſſe limited themſelvs to it, when they prayed,
nor did they teach the Churches ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>2 If the Lord would not have us limit our ſelves in our own forms, whiles we are
exerciſing our own gifts (which he hath ſpecially ſanctified to edify his Church
<hi>Act. 6. 4. Eph. 4. 8. 1 Cor. 12. 7.)</hi> leaſt we ſhould quench or at leaſt ſtraiten his
ſpirit in prayer, <hi>1 Theſ. 5. 19.</hi> would he then have us limited to other mens forms,
which have not beene in like ſort ſanctified of God, but will rather quench or ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the ſpirit of God, whiles we are ſo limited to them?</p>
               <p>3 The entertainment of this form hath been a manifeſt ſnare unto the Churches
who upon the ſame ground on which they have received this forme into the desks
have beene limited to others in the pulpit, by meanes whereof the poore Church of
Chriſt hath bin wholly deprived of the publike uſe of the Miniſters gifts in prayer,
and the ſpirit of prayer in the Miniſters in publike, hath beene greatly reſtrained.</p>
               <p>As for our Judgement concerning the practice of others, who uſe this Liturgie in
our native Countrie, we have alwayes beene unwilling to expreſſe our mindes
there againſt unleſſe we have been neceſſarily called thereunto, and at this time we
thinke it not expedient to expreſſe our ſelves any further concerning this matter, as
loath to intermeddle with the affaires of other Churches, but contenting our ſelves
with, and bleſſing the Lord for thoſe liberties, which we, by the mercie of God, do

               <head>Reply.</head>
               <p>THis poſition cannot beare that meaning which you give it, if you take it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording,
o our mindes, and the plain conſtruction of the words. We never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
why you made not uſe of a ſtinted Liturgy, much leſſe why you did not
wholly and in every part tye your ſelves unto, and approve of that forme in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us. You might well thinke we had little to doe to put forth ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>viz.</hi> whether you thinke it lawfull to approve in others and practice your
ſelves, what ſwerveth from the rule, and we thinke it ſtrange you ſhould give our
words ſuch a meaning.</p>
               <p>The thing we craved reſolution in was, whether in your judgements all ſtinted
and ſet formes of prayer and Liturgies be unlawfull. The reaſon hereof was becauſe
in writings from <hi>New-England,</hi> we had ſeene all ſet liturgies, and ſet formes of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
condemned as deviſed worſhip which God would not accept, and partaking
in the Sacraments of the Supper in our aſſemblies, therefore diſallowed, becauſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
in a ſtinted Liturgie, which things were received with ſuch likeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ſome brethren with us, and by them imparted and recommended to others,
that they occaſioned that rent and diſtraction whereof we complain.</p>
               <p>It is true, the people among us ſeparate from our forme of prayer or liturgy, but
the reaſon hereof is becauſe it is ſtinted, not becauſe this or that or ours in
particular.</p>
               <p>You confeſſe you want not ſome brethren among you who look at all ſet formes
of Prayer invented by one of another age or congregation, and preſcribed to their
brethren, to be read out of a booke for the prayers of the Church, as Images and
Imaginations of man forbidden in the ſecond Commandement, and that the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of Liturgies, and ſet formes is queſtioned and doubted of by many faithfull
ſervants of God ſuch alſo as come over occaſionally, who withdraw themſelvs from
the Sacraments in the congregation, doe it on this pretence, that a ſtinted Liturgie
is a humane invention. And if we examine the reaſons brought againſt ſtinted
formes and Liturgies, we ſhall finde them to ſtrike at all formes and Liturgies
though deviſed by men of the ſame age and congregation, and to be uſed but now
and then, or but once on ſet purpoſe, and that either in publike or in private, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
we may have occaſion to ſhew.</p>
               <p>You ſay it is evident, many Preachers conſtantly uſe a ſet forme of Prayer of
their own making before their Sermons, with whom the people refuſe not to joyne;
And you know (we doubt not) that ſuch ſet formes are diſliked alſo. And if the
grounds be examined (in our underſtanding) they make as much againſt the one
as the other. View but the reaſons why you admit not a ſtinted Liturgie and forme
of prayer, and ſee whether the two laſt will not in the ſame terms directly conclude
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59009:10"/>
gainſt both. But what ever is to be thought herein, or whether mens practiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with their opinions we now diſpute not. This is plaine and manifeſt, that
mens opinions are to be judged by their expreſſe words and reaſons, not by their
practiſes. The Browniſts (as they are commonly called) can ſeparate from no
ſtinted Liturgie amongſt us, but that which is in uſe, and for ought we know they
may joyne with their owne Paſtors, though they oft uſe the ſame forme of prayer
in whole or in part, in thankſgiving before meat, or in prayer before Sermon, or
the like. And yet their opinion is that all ſtinted Liturgies and ſet Formes of prayer
be unlawfull, humane inventions forbidden by the ſecond Commandement.</p>
               <p>But if any thing had beene left doubtfull in the Letter, that it might be ſtrained
to another ſence, either becauſe we were ſhort in expreſſion, or many of you not
informed in the paſſages which gave occaſion to the queſtion, it is well knowne
what the words meane in ordinary conſtruction. And we doubt not but many
brethren among you, might and could fully informe you of our meaning that there
need no ſuch ſtraining to find it out.</p>
               <p>That which followeth in your anſwer to the poſition (as you interpret it) wee
paſſe over, becauſe it is not to the matter intended. And wee are as unwilling to
trouble you with the affaires of other Churches taking you from your owne weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
occaſions, as you are unwilling to be interrupted. Onely in regard of promiſe,
and becauſe plaine dealing ſerves to maintaine love, we thinke good to advertiſe
you theſe few things.</p>
               <p>1 That your reaſons why you accept not of a ſtinted Lyturgie be ambiguouſly
propounded, for ſometimes you plead onely for your libertie herein, and that a ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
forme is not neceſſary, and ſometime you ſpeake ſo, as they that looke at Stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Lyturgies, as Images forbidden in the ſecond Commandement will eaſily draw
your words to their meaning.</p>
               <p>2 The reaſons you bring againſt a ſet forme of prayer or Liturgie doe hold as
ſtrong againſt a ſet forme of Catechiſme confeſſion and profeſſion of faith, bleſſing,
baptizing and ſinging of Pſalmes.</p>
               <p>3 Wee have not called upon you at this time to witneſſe for, or againſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
in the Communion-Booke. This you fall upon by ſtraining the ſenſe of
our demands contrary to the true meaning thereof.</p>
               <p>The reaſons which you bring againſt it, we cannot approve them all; The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
which have bin taken both from the matter and manner thereof we know:
But to eſteeme the whole for ſome corruptions found therein, a monument of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that we have not learned.</p>
               <p>The Argument in the abridgement which is uſed againſt conformity to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
did not in their judgement who were authors of the Booke hold againſt
the Lyturgie, of which opinion we are alſo.</p>
               <p>4 If theſe reaſons be intended onely to ſhew why you receive not our forme of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59009:10"/>
adminiſtration, it is that which (we are perſwaded you know) we never required
of you. If to diſallow the uſe of the Booke amongſt us altogether in things lawfull,
good and pertinent, they will not hold weight.</p>
               <p>5 You are generally (as you ſay) loath to meddle with the affaires of other
Churches, unleſſe you have been neceſſarily called thereunto. But when ſome upon
the requeſt (as we ſuppoſe) of private friends, and others out of their zeale and
forwardneſſe have laboured to draw many to ſeparation from the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
miniſtred in a ſtinted Lyturgie: wee cannot apprehend any juſt ground of
this apologie. The Rent is wide, and ſome brethren had their hands deepe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which made us at this preſent to crave your judgements, and the reaſons thereof
to make up the breach.</p>
               <p>6 <hi>I. D.</hi> objecteth to Maſter <hi>P.</hi> that his manner of preaching was diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in carrying that matter,<note place="margin">Whereas the publiſher of this anſwer to the ſix Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, refers the reader to Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> anſwer unto Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> for ſatisfaction in this point concerning ſet formes of prayer. The reader is earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to compare Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Balls</hi> Treatiſe, and Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> anſwer with ſeriouſneſſe and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie, becauſe Mr <hi>Ball</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received that anſwer before the publiſhing of his Treatiſe (being much enlarged, whereof <hi>Mr, Cotton</hi> was ignorant) was confident, that with addition of ſome marginall notes (which in reference thereto he added) his Treatiſe would ſufficiently defend it ſelfe, againſt all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, which that anſwer made againſt it.</note> he ſpeakes of, to the Claſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had declared to the Church the equity of his refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Miniſters deſired by the Scriptures. And may not
we with like reaſon object, that this manner of proceeding
is diſorderly in ſeeking to draw men to Separation, becauſe
of ſtinted Liturgie, before you had ſhewed to us or other

an able faithfull miniſtry, as no miniſtry of Chriſt, and from their godly congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

               <p>As for our Judgement concerning the Poſition it ſelfe, we would promiſe two

things; Firſt concerning the perſons reading this Liturgie, which may be either an

               <p>Secondly, concerning the Liturgie it ſelfe, which may be either of the whole or

               <p>Now if the queſtion be of joyning in prayer with, and when that whole Liturgie
is uſed, or where that which is uſed, is read by an unable and ungodly Miniſter,
we then ſee not how it can be lawfull to joyne in prayer in ſuch caſes; For</p>
               <p>1 The prayers of the Miniſter are not his private prayers, but the publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the whole aſſembly, whoſe mouth he is to God. And when the prayers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
up by the Miniſter, as a living holy, and acceptable ſervice to God, are not
through humane frailty, but otherwiſe for matter and manner corrupt, wee ſee not
what warrant any one hath to joyne with ſuch prayers, <hi>Mal. 1. 13, 14.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 When men ioyne therein with an inſufficient Miniſtry, they doe not only

               <p>SUfficient hath been ſpoken of the meaning of the poſition and the grounds thereof
and if we have not miſtaken your judgment &amp; practice both, you have born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
againſt both that you call the rigid ſeperation, and this more moderate alſo;
And we humbly wiſh, the moderate doe not degenerate into the rigid ere long.
It is very ſtrange, if they take not great incouragement upon your grounds. The
truth of our miniſtery, Churches, Ordinances, and calling is queſtioned, and where
men will ſtay the Lord knoweth, and what more common then that our Liturgie
is unlawfull, becauſe it is the deviſe of man; The Author (or publiſher at leaſt)
of a letter againſt our Service booke beginneth with ſuch like diſtinction.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Againſt this Prayer-booke (ſaith he) divers have pleaded in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Firſt ſome arguments are proper to the Separatiſts <hi>qua tales, viz.</hi> that it is
offered in a falſe Church; 2. By a falſe miniſter; 3. In the behalfe of the ſubjects
of the Kingdome of Antichriſt. Theſe are properly theirs, being the grounds
whereupon they make a totall ſeparation from all the Churches in this Land, as
no Churches of Chriſt. Theſe I approve not, yet note them that yee may ſee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59009:11"/>
upon what different grounds, the ſame Poſition is maintained by ſeverall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and that yee may be delivered from the prejudice, which hinders many from
receiving thoſe truths, becauſe they feare the reproach of Browniſme.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are other grounds which are common to all that plead for the
the puritie of Chriſts ordinances, and which doe not neceſſarily inferre ſuch ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but only ſerve to ſhew the unlawfulneſſe of that practiſe, and our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating therein.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus the Epiſtle wherein the ſame diſtinction of ſeparation is noted: but how
truly, let the indifferent judge. If none muſt be counted Separatiſts, but ſuch as
have pleaded againſt the booke of Common prayer as unlawfull, becauſe offered up
in a falſe Church, &amp;c. then are there none ſuch in the world, that we have knowne
or heard of: for it is apparent they caſt us off as no Churches of Chriſt, becauſe
our Service is a humane deviſe, will-worſhip, Idolatry; And not on the contrary,
that our Service is will-worſhip, or Idolatry, becauſe our Churches are falſe
Churches. Againſt all Communion with us they plead, becauſe we are a falſe
Church, but againſt our ſtinted Liturgie they argue not in that manner.</p>
               <p>The grounds on which that Authour builds (which he ſaith are common to all,
that plead for the purity of Gods ordinances) are one and the ſame with the grounds
of the Separatiſts, ſhafts taken out of the ſame quiver and peculiar to them, ſome
few brethren onely excepted, who of late have looked towards that opinion. See
how affection will tranſport. Thoſe reaſons ſhall be common to all that plead for
the purity of Chriſts Ordinances, which were never taken to be ſound and true, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the reformed Churches abroad, or by the godly Brethren at home, whether
now at reſt with the Lord, or for the preſent living, or yet by the moſt of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
among whom they live, and with whom they hold ſocietie, or by any miniſter
or Societie which did hold the unitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace for the ſpace
of this 1400 yeares and upwards, by your owne confeſſion, unleſſe within theſe few
dayes, and that by a few onely. If this be not to ſtrengthen the hands of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts,
or at leaſt, to lay blocks of offence in their way, what is? As yet we thinke
moſt of them that have ſeparated, are not ſo farre gone, as to condemne all our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
as no Churches of Chriſt, but we judge they have proceeded further then
Chriſt the Lord and Saviour of his Church hath given them commiſſion or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that the grounds whereon they build are unſound, and ſuch as make way for
further danger, if the Lord prevent not. And that the reaſons mentioned in the
letters are the proper grounds of Separatiſts, and not common to all them that ſeeke
the purity of religion, for they are not approved by your ſelves: and if all this tend
not to turne them who halt, out of the right way, wee heartily intreate you to
conſider.</p>
               <p>Your judgement concerning the Poſition, you deliver in three propoſitions (for
ſo many they be for ſubſtance) In reſpect of the perſons reading the Liturgie, or the

thing it ſelfe that is read. As if any part of the Liturgie bee read, (put caſe ſome

make it unlawfull, then all communion in any part of Gods
worſhip, with ſuch Miniſters is unlawfull, and ſo the Church in all ages of the
world, the Prophets, our Saviour Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and the faithfull in the

ſinne againſt God, much leſſe then do they in ſuch joyning ſet thoſe
Idols and meanes of worſhip, which God never appointed in his
Word. For the worſhip is of God, and the Miniſtery is of God, the
perſon unworthily executing his place, is neither ſet up by ſome
few private Chriſtians, nor can by them be removed. And warrant to withdraw
themſelves from the worſhip of God, becauſe ſuch as ought not, are ſuffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
in the holy things of God, they have none from God. Dumbe Dogs,
greedy Dogs, Idol-ſheepheards, falſe Prophets, Strangers, are unworthy Miniſters,
but they that communicate with ſuch in the ordinance of worſhip, are never ſaid
to ſet up Idols or means of worſhip which God never appointed. The ſheep of
Chriſt will not heare ſtrangers in the Lords ſenſe, but outwardly they heard thoſe
ſtrangers preach (if the Scribes and Phariſees were ſuch) and by hearing them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
them to be ſtrangers, i. e. falſe Prophets; Some ſtrangers at leaſt, of whom

follow: but as they be tolerated in the Church, ſo they may hear them, ſo long as they
bring the truth. Unworthy Miniſters are no Miniſters for themſelves, but they are
Miniſters for the people of God, that is, ſo long as they be in the place of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,

by an ungodly miniſter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition. Where the whole Liturgie is uſed, though by an able
and godly Miniſter, it is not lawfull to joyne in prayer in that caſe. Herein wee
cannot be of your judgement; for in the times of the Prophets, and our Saviour
Chriſt, as great abuſes, no queſtion, were found in the Church of the Jews in the
adminiſtration of holy things of God as can be imagined in our Liturgie or forme
of prayer: but the Prophets and our Saviour who taught the people to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
pure and undefiled, never taught them to ſeparate from the adminiſtration of
the holy things of God. And if the preſence at our forms of prayer be not lawful by
reaſon of the corruptions alleaged, there can be no viſible ſociety named throughout
the world ſince 200. yeeres after Chriſt or thereabouts, wherein a Chriſtian might
lawfully joyne in Prayer, reading the Scripture, hearing the word or participation
of the Sacraments. For compare the doctrines, prayers, rites at thoſe times in uſe in
the Churches with ours, and in all theſe, (bleſſed be the name of the Lord) wee are
more pure then they. But no man will be ſo bold (we hope) as to affirme the ſtate
of the Churches within 200. yeeres after Chriſt, to be ſo miſerably decayed that the
faithfull could not without ſin hold communion with them in the aforeſaid ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
The prayers of the Miniſter, whether conceived or ſtinted in a ſet forme, be
not his private prayers, but the publike prayers of the whole aſſembly, whoſe
mouth he is to God both in the one and the other. But you will not ſay, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ought not to joyne with their Paſtor in the publique aſſembly, if ought bee
amiſſe in his prayer for matter, or manner, or both. It is all one to the people in
this caſe, whether the fault be perſonall (as ſome diſtinguiſh) or otherwiſe knowne
beforehand or not knowne: For if ſimple preſence defile, whether it was knowne
beforehand or not, all preſence is faulty. And if ſimple preſence defile not, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
is not condemned, by reaſon of the corruptions knowne, whereof we ſtand
not guilty, whether the corruption, be through humane frailty or not, it is not in us
to enquire, but rather whether we be called to come, and the faults ſuch as one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59009:13"/>
cannot or muſt not tolerate in another without breach of charity. For if the
errour be ſuch as may be tolerated, and I am called to be preſent; by ſuch fault
I am not defiled though knowne before. If the error be ſuch as in conſcience may
not be tolerated, though not knowne before hand, I am bound, if preſent ſome way
to profeſſe againſt it. This diſtinction of perſonall and miniſteriall faults in this
caſe untill it be cleared by ſome Text of Scripture or ſound reaſon from the word,
muſt goe for the diviſe of man.</p>
               <p>A Church, a Miniſter, or a Chriſtian may be ſtiffe in an error (being miſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
it is a truth) after many meanes long uſed to convince them, with whom
yet we muſt hold communion in the ordinances of Religion: and the error may
be ſuch as we cannot without hypocriſy or denyall of the truth hold communion,
though ſuch meanes of conviction have not gone before. But the corruptions
alleadged againſt our forme of prayer for matter or manner, are ſuch as one
Chriſtian may and muſt tolerate in another where he hath no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe them.</p>
               <p>Hath not Chriſtian wiſdome and experience of humane frailties leſſoned you
(deere brethren) to beare one with another in matters of greater conſequence
then any have or can be objected truly againſt the form of prayer in uſe among us?
And why ſuch corruptions ſhould not be aſcribed to humane frailty; we ſee not: For
if a godly Miniſter make uſe of a book in things which he judgeth lawfull for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and manner, the corruption in him that uſeth it according to his judgement,
from what cauſe can it ſpring but humane ignorance and frailty? We reſt aſſured
you queſtion not the integrity of many, who make much more uſe of the booke
then onely in a few ſelect prayers. From the bottome of our hearts we deſire and
pray that God would remove out of his Church and worſhip whatſoever offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for matter or manner, and that all things may be ſo done, not onely that they
may be tolerated but that they might be approved in the conſcience of all men.
But we are perſwaded that not onely ſome few ſelect prayers
but many prayers &amp; other exhortations may lawfully be uſed,<note place="margin">We ſee no warrant why for every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act, that in a larger ſence is Idolatrous, adjoyned to Gods true worſhip, we ſhould forbeare our preſence at the true worſhip it ſelf. Unreaſon. of ſeperation. anſw to 6. argument.</note>
with fruit and edification to Gods people.</p>
               <p>To aggravate faults eſpecially when it tends to draw away people from the
Ordinances of God, is no leſſe fault then to excuſe them, it may be greater, and
therefore we dare not eſteeme the prayers read by a godly and faithfull Miniſter
according to the booke in uſe among us, a corrupt ſacrifice whether in ſuch as
read them, or them that be preſent. In them that join according to Chriſts command
(and liberty of abſence from Chriſt hath not beene ſhewed) notwithſtanding
the corruptions, we hold the prayers to be an holy and acceptable ſacrifice to God,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59009:14"/>
and pleaſing to Jeſus Chriſt. The corrupt ſacrifice is that, which the deceiver
bringeth voluntarily, and out of neglect, having a male in his flock: but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
bringeth himſelf and his godly deſires according to the will of God, and as for
corruptions, whether reſpecting matter or forme, they are none of his, they cleave
not to his Sacrifice to ſtaine or pollute it. As for the Text of the Prophet <hi>Mal.
1. 13, 14.</hi> it is cited by many in this buſineſſe, and to many purpoſes applyed, but
we cannot finde that in the Prophet for which it is here brought, <hi>The deceiver is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
that offereth a corrupt thing to the Lord.</hi> This we reade and beleeve, but that a
godly man, being preſent at this forme of prayer among us, read by a godly and
faithfull Miniſter, is the deceiver, who offereth a corrupt thing unto the Lord, that is
not proved. No argument can be brought from this place to the purpoſe, but
by analogy, which is a kinde of arguing of all other moſt ready at hand, but lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to moſt exceptions, and apt to draw aſide, if great care be not had, (which in
this place we finde not) to take the proportion in every materiall point juſt and
right. And we deſire ſuch as alleadge this paſſage of Scripture againſt ſimple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
at the prayers of our Liturgy, adviſedly to conſider whether God allow
them to make ſuch application of his truth which wee much doubt of, to ſay
no more.</p>
               <p>Your third propoſition. That as you are very tender of imputing ſinne to thoſe
men that joyne in ſome ſelect prayers read by an able and godly Miniſter: ſo on
the other ſide you are not without feare, leaſt ſuch joyning may be found unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
unleſſe it may appeare that the Miniſters with whom the people have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in reading thoſe Prayers, neither give any ſcandall by reading them, nor give
unlawfull honour to a thing abuſed to Idolatry and Superſtition, nor doe ſuffer
themſelves to be ſinfully limited in the reading of them.</p>
               <p>1 We cannot conceive how you ſhould imagine the practice of a godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in reading ſome few ſelect prayers to be ſcandalous or offenſive in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
when the people generally, not in their aſſemblies onely, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole land, were perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of that courſe till now of
late ſome have beene drawne away to ſeparate, who yet by warrant of Scripture
produce nothing of weight to countenance that practice.</p>
               <p>2 If the booke ſhould be as you take it an idolathite, latent offence doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige.
If any man ſay unto thee, this is ſacrificed to Idols, eat it not, ſo that if it
doe not manifeſtly appeare that this practice is ſcandalous; it is not lawfull for the
people to withdraw themſelves.</p>
               <p>3 The book (we ſpeake of the Liturgie ſo far as it is ſound and good) by your
confeſſion is no Idolathite, neither was it taken out of the Maſſe-book in ſuch ſenſe
as you object, but rather the maſſe &amp; other Idolatrous prayers were added to it, for
popery is as a ſcab or leproſie cleaving to the Church; and many truths belonging
to the Church as her proper legacie were ſtolen and heaped together in that denne.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59009:14"/>
And why the true man may not challenge his goods where ever he finds the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or the
thiefe plead title to the true mans goods by preſcription, we know not? It is no
hard taske to ſhew that our Service-booke was reformed in moſt things according
to the pureſt Liturgies which were in uſe in the Church long before the maſſe was
heard of in the world. And if that could not be ſhewed, yet formes of ſpeech general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken (we ſpeak not of this or that ſpeciall word or phraſe) is no more defiled by
Idolatry then the light aire, or place where Idolatry is committed. It is not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to pray, Lord helpe, or Lord have mercy, or to give thankes, praiſed bee God,
becauſe the Papiſts ſay, <hi>Lady helpe,</hi> or, <hi>praiſed be God and the Virgin Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Put caſe the Miniſter in reading ſuch prayers gives offence, or attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
unlawfull honour to a thing abuſed to Idolatry and Superſtition, or ſuffer
himſelf to be ſinfully limited in the reading of them, what is that to the faithfull?
This can be no juſt ground of the peoples not joyning with them in the worſhip
of God, for that offence is perſonall onely, and not the ſin of them that be preſent,
they joyn in prayer onely, and not in his reading or limiting himſelf. Not to ſay
that every particular perſon muſt be herein both accuſer and Judge. If he give offence
muſt they ſtumble at the ſtone, and ſeparate from the ordinance of grace? wee
ſhould rather think it is their duty to look unto their feet, that they goe not awry.
Let it be ſhewed out of the Word of God, that either the Miniſter is guilty of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
unlawfull honour, or that the people may lawfully withdraw themſelves in
caſe he ſhould do ſo, and we will then ſay as you do, but untill that be proved, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſſed and called to proffer our judgements) we believe that ſeparation is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and ſinfull, never taught of God, nor confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the approved example of the godly in any age
or time of the Church:<note place="margin">Compare what Maſter <hi>I. D.</hi> hath written in defence or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe in reſorting to the Aſſemb. of the Separatiſts, called Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts. <hi>Apol.

God, injurious to the Churches diſtracting Chriſtians,
bringing contempt upon the Ordinances of God, and
defrauding believers of the ſpirituall food of their
ſouls, which is indeed to infringe their Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and what ever may be thought of it now, in former times it hath been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no ſmall offence.</p>
               <p>Fiſtly, if this and ſuch like ſcruples make it unlawfull to joyn in the ordenance of
worſhip, we muſt hold communion with no ſociety under heaven. For may not the
brethren which hold all ſtinted, Liturgies, and ſet forms unlawfull ſay with like
ſtrength of reaſon, It is unlawfull to joyn in conceived prayer with others, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they give too little honour to it, as deeming the other lawfull, or ſinfully limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or ſuffering themſelves to be limited to one ſtinted forme, though conceived at
firſt by them ſelves? And may not the brethren who hold a ſtinted forme lawfull
in like manner object? It is unlawfull to joyn in prayer with them becauſe they
attribute too much honour to conceived prayer, as making their device and method
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59009:15"/>
the worſhip of God? And may not the Brethren which hold it lawfull to uſe ſome
ſelected prayers according to the forms among us, upon the ſame grounds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
communion with both ſorts? and all of them one with another, becauſe
they either limit themſelves too much, or too little? You ſay in the expoſition of
the firſt poſition, many Preachers conſtantly uſe a ſet form of prayer of their own
making before their Sermons, muſt you not ſay upon this ground, that it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to joyn with them, becauſe they ſinfully ſtint themſelves? In probability a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
may preſume, that in the publike worſhip of God, there will be through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ignorance &amp; infirmity ſomwhat amiſs for matter, or manner, or both, &amp; that
upon this ground, he muſt joyn with no ſociety in any part of Gods worſhipat all.</p>
               <p>The advancing of every ſmall difference to this height, is that which will bring
all to confuſion, if men walk uniforme to their own principles. It is well obſerved
by Maſter <hi>I. Da.</hi> that unleſſe men will yield ſo much favour each to other in ſome
difference of opinions, a diſſolving not onely of Churches, but of humane ſocieties
alſo muſt neceſſarily follow, &amp; not onely not two Miniſters, but not two men ſhould
live together, which were to put off even humanity it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, wee have credibly heard that you hold fellowſhip with profeſſed, rigid
Separatiſts without any acknowledgment of their errour, and receive them as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
or communicate with them in the priviledges of the Church, though you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
you approve not their opinion or practice. And if in godly wiſdome, you can
ſee grounds to joyn with them, we marvell you ſhould be ſo timorous in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, if you judge the practice of ſuch godly Miniſters, ſcandalous to them
that ſeparate from the ordinance, becauſe it is not adminiſtred in this, or that, but in
a ſtinted form. It is a ſcandall taken, and not given; and by forbearing, if to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
men in errour, be to ſcandalize them, they ſhould offend them the more: yea,
they ſhould prejudice the truth, and it might be an occaſion to beget needleſſe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in others, and draw them ignorantly from the fellowſhip of the Saints in the
holy ordinances of God, and ſtrengthen them who by your owne confeſſion, are

               <p>VVHat is here premiſed to prevent all miſtakes, doth ſeem more to raiſe
then to abate ſcruples if we miſtake not your meaning. You refuſe not
all religious communion with all that are not Church members, and
ſo much they profeſſe, who formerly have gone for, and profeſſed themſelves Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts
from our Aſſemblies. You do not appropriate this priviledge of the Seals one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the members of your own Churches, excluding all other Churches of Chriſt
from the ſame; If your meaning be onely this, that you deny not the Sacraments
adminiſtred in other Churches to be the true Sacraments of Chriſt for ſubſtance,
then you aſcribe little more to the Churches of Chriſt in this, then to the Synagogue
of Satan, the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For you will not deny Baptiſme adminiſtred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them to be true for ſubſtance: If you deny not to have fellowſhip with them
in the Seals, and to admit them to the Sacrament, and to communicate with them:
then either your judgment is contrary to your practice, or you exclude the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>England</hi> from the number of true viſible Churches of Chriſt, which is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
what you formerly builded, and here profeſſe. All poſſible care to keep the
Ordinances of God from contempt, we allow and commend, provided you go not
beyond the Lords warrant, and deny not the priviledges of the Church to them, to
whom they are due by divine appointment, nor the name and title of Church to
thoſe ſocieties, which God hath plentifully bleſſed with means of grace, have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Tables and Seals, and have entred into Covenant with his Highneſſe. Your
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59009:16"/>
liberty to receive ſuch ſatisfaction as is meet, is not called into queſtion, nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you are to keep the bond of the Spirit inviolate according to order. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be to keep the bond of the Spirit inviolate <hi>(viz)</hi> to exclude from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
true viſible believers, or knowne recommended Chriſtians, formerly members
of viſible Churches among us; and their children; becauſe they are not members (as
you ſpeak) in Church Order. And whether God alloweth to put this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Church me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of your ſocieties &amp; other viſible believers walking in holines,
though not admitted members of any ſociety according to your Church order, as to

               <p>THe Seals Baptiſm &amp; the Lords Supper are given to the Church, as a priviledge
peculiar therto in ordinary diſpenſation. Indeed the preaching of the word is not
ſo, being an ordinance given not onely for the edifying of the Church already ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
but alſo for the gathering of men to the Churches that yet are without: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the diſpenſing of the Seals is Gods Ordinance, given onely for the edifying of
the Church being gathered, and not for the gathering of it: And becauſe there is
now, no univerſall viſible Church on earth wherein the Seals are diſpenced, there
being no place, nor time, nor Officers, nor Ordinances appointed in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
by Chriſt our Lord, for any ſuch Aſſemblies as the <hi>Iewes</hi> had under

               </p>
               <p>It remains that the Chriſtian Churches, whereunto theſe priviledges were given,
are congregationall, conſiſting onely of ſo many as may and do meet together ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
in one place for the publike worſhipping of God, and their own edifying.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that we read ſo much in the New Teſtament of the Churches in the

               <p>IF by the Church be underſtood the Society of men, profeſſing the entire faith of
Chriſt, the ſeales are given unto it as a peculiar priviledge; but if by the Church
you underſtand onely a congregationall aſſembly in Church order, the ſeales were
never appropriated to it. But to examine every thing in order as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p>1 The Seales, Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper, are given to the Church as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
peculiar thereunto, not onely in ordinary (as you ſay) but
alſo in extraordinary diſpenſation.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 4, 5.</note> True baptiſme is not without the
Church, but within it; an ordinance given to it, and they that are
baptiſed, muſt needes be of a Church. The Sacraments are the ſeales of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

                     <hi>Robinſ.</hi> againſt <hi>Bern.</hi> reaſ. diſcuſ. <hi>pa. 77.</hi>
                  </note> as in
the ordinary; ſo in the extraordinary diſpenſation of the
Seales, as is confirmed by the Texts of Scripture alleadged in the Margine. For
the Apoſtles (as you ſay) diſpenced the ſeales in an extraordinary way, but the
ſeales diſpenced by the Apoſtles were Seales of the covenant, priviledges peculiar
to the Church, priviledges of ſpirituall admittance and entertainment into the Lords
family.</p>
               <p>And when you ſay the diſpencing of the Seals is an Ordinance given onely for the
edifying of the Church being gathered, and not for the gathering of it, muſt it not be
underſtood in extraordinary, diſpenſation as wel as ordinary: To what pupoſe then
are thoſe words (in ordinary diſpenſation) added to the propoſition? if thereby you
would intimate that the Sacraments be not the peculiar priviledges of the Church,
and Seales of the Covenant in extraordinary diſpenſation, it is evidently croſſe
to the Text you cite, and to your ſelves afterward. If your meaning be, that in
ordinary diſpenſation the Sacraments doe of right belong to them onely, who bee
ſet members of a viſible congregation, it is all one with the concluſion, that which
is in queſtion and ſhould be proved, and that which this very Scripture doth plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
diſprove; for they that were baptiſed were not ſet members of a particular
congregationall Church whereunto they were baptiſed, nor in a Church way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
baptiſme (as is evident and granted by the moſt of your ſelves) but by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59009:17"/>
ſolemnly admitted into the Church, and then it is not for your purpoſe, or
they were ſet members (as ſome of the brethren ſeeme to contend in anſwer to the
objection framed againſt this conſideration) and then the words are more then ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.
Added, they were to prevent the objection which you foreſaw might be
made from the Apoſtles practice and example but ſo as they cut aſunder the ſinews
of the conſideration it ſelfe, and make it of no force. For as thoſe beleivers were
of the Church: ſo are approved Chriſtians and their ſeed among us: therefore the
priviledges of the ſeales belong unto them.</p>
               <p>2 And as the ſeales: ſo is the word of ſalvation preached and received a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Church. If by the preaching of the word you underſtand nothing but
the tender of ſalvation or the publiſhing of the will of God, concerning the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of man, whether by private or publike perſons; it is not proper to the
Church but an ordinance given for the gathering of men to the Church, and not
only for the edifying of the Church. For the Apoſtles firſt preached to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
when Infidels, that they might be converted; And we doubt not but a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
or private Chriſtian comming into a country of Infidells, may as occaſion is
offered, and as they ſhall be inabled, inſtruct and perſwade them to receive the
faith of Chriſt: but if by the preaching of the word be meant the giving of the word
to a people, to abide and continue with them, and conſequently their receiving of
it at leaſt in profeſſion then it is proper to the Church of God.</p>
               <p>The word makes diſciples to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Lev 2. 13.</note> and the word given to a people
is Gods covenanting with them,<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 17. 18.</note> and the peoples receiving this
word and profeſſing their faith in God through Ieſus Chriſt is the
taking of God to bee their God.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 2 Deut. 4. 6. Pſa. 247 19 20 Neh. 9. 13.</note> The lawes and ſtatutes which
God gave to Iſraell, was the honour and ornament to that Nation,

even the Gentiles themſelves being Iudges. The word of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
is ſent and given to the world reconciled in Ieſus Chriſt,
and they that receive the doctrine, law, or word of God are the
Diſciples, ſervants and people of God.</p>
               <p>In your ſecond conſideration you intimate that there is a two fold preaching,
the one by office and authority, the other in Common charity, or how ever elſe it
may be called. For thus you write. God hath joyned to preach <hi>(viz</hi> by office) and
to baptize together, therefore we may not ſeparate them. Now to preach unto,
that is to inſtruct or counſell in charity is a duty which may be performed to
an infidell, but to preach by office is proper to them that are called
to that office:<note place="margin">Robin againſt Bern P 15.</note> and ſo to be taught and inſtructed by Officers in the
Church is proper to the Church.</p>
               <p>To have paſtors who ſhall feed with knowledge and underſtanding is a gift of

The Apoſtles firſt gathered Churches and then ordained elders

               <p>Moreover the true worſhip of God is an inſeparable and infallible marke of the

                  </note> The continuance in the Apoſtles doctrine
and fellowſhip,<note place="margin">Act 2. 42</note> and breaking of bread and prayer. And if faith, true and

they that joyne together in the true worſhip of God, according to his

never ordained, no not in the dayes of the Apoſtles, to whom all the care of all the

true and entire faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 12. 18.</note> joyning in prayer and thankeſgiving,<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 3.</note> receiving
the truth of God to dwell among them,<note place="margin">Gal. 3 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17</note> and in ſome meaſure confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

with God. It is ſimply neceſſary to the being of a Church
that it be laid upon Chriſt the foundation, which being done, the
remaining of what is forbidden, or the want of what is commanded,
cannot put the ſociety from the title or right of a Church. For Chriſt is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and head corner ſtone of the Church, and a people comming unto Chriſt,
united unto him, built upon him, having communion with him and growing up in
him, are the true Church of God: and if the ſeals be annexed to the covenant by
God himſelfe, as we cannot deny a people in covenant to be the Church, ſo we muſt
not deny their right and title to the Sacraments. If therefore the meaning of the
propoſition be that the ſeales be given to the Church, that is, to true and ſound
Chriſtians, and people in covenant with God, as a priviledge whether in ordinary
or extraordinary diſpenſation we accept it as good and ſound, but it makes againſt
your judgement and practice in keeping away ſuch as have right and title to the
ordinances. If you meane the ſeales are given to the Church, that is, onely to ſet
members of ſome particular ſociety combined by covenant (as it is among you)
we cannot receive it, becauſe it implieth a diſtinction not taught in Scripture, and
croſſe to your ſelves. And for the thing it ſelfe the Scripture hath nothing but many
things againſt it as hath beene ſhewed.</p>
               <p>5 If it be granted that the ſeales are the prerogative of a particular viſible
Church, known and approved Chriſtians among us, and their ſeed are members of
true and viſible Churches, and ſo to be eſteemed among you before they be entred
into Church memberſhip as you call it. For every ſociety profeſſing the intire and
true faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Mr. I. D. Apol. 11. Sect. exam p. 117.</note> and joyning together in the right uſe of the Sacraments in
matters ſubſtantiall is the true Church of God, and every viſible
beleever receiving the word and profeſſing, the true intire faith, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the right and lawfull participation of the Sacraments is a
viſible member of the true Church, if he have neither renounced that ſociety, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
juſtly to be caſt out by excommunication or Church cenſure. For the intire
profeſſion of the truth, the dwelling of the truth among men, the right uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
(which is ever joyned with truth of Doctrine, and to be eſteemed by it)
is proper to them that be in covenant with God. And they that truly partake of
the Seales muſt needes be of a Church, for the ſeales are not without but within the
Church an ordinance given unto it, and if they be true members of the true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of Jeſus Chriſt, other Churches, are bound to hold communion with them in the
ordinance of worſhip as divine providence ſhall miniſter occaſion.</p>

               <p>6 The diſtinct Churches mentioned in the New Teſtament, it is not certain that
they were congregationall ſocieties conſiſting onely of ſo many as might and did
meete together ordinarily in one place at one time for the publike worſhip of God,
and their own edification, and if this were granted it would not carry the weight
that was laid upon it, But becauſe it may make way for the clearing of ſome other
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59009:20"/>
points pertaining to diſcipline and Church order, we intreat leave to ſet downe,
and deſire you to examine what may be objected againſt it. We will not inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this that the leaſt circuite wherein there is mention of Churches, is ample enough
to containe ſome dioceſſes and the leaſt City,<note place="margin">Bucer. diff. ep. 3. pa. 43. &amp; ep 48. pa. 226.</note> populous enough to
make many numberſome congregations. Nor upon this, that to
meete at one time and one place, as one aſſembly is a thing meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accidentary to the unity of the Church and ſociety Eccleſiaſticall
which is ſtill one, when they are diſperſed aſunder, and no particular man of that
ſociety at firſt remaining now alive. The number of beleevers was ſo great in
ſome Cities as they could not conveniently meete in one place as one aſſembly to
worſhip the Lord according to his will and for their edifying. That there was a
Church gathered in the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> by the miniſtery of <hi>Phillip</hi> will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
for they received the word and were baptiſed, but that the Church in that
City was onely a congregationall aſſembly is more then can probably be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
out of Scripture. For the whole City or the greateſt part could not ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 8. 6. &amp; 15 4.</note> in a manner, (as it is probable) imbraced the faith.
As the whole City from the leaſt to the greateſt had given heede to

               <p>The Chriſtian Church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was one and diſtinct,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 41. &amp; 4. 4. &amp; 5 14. <hi>&amp; 6. 1. &amp; 6. 7</hi>

grew and increaſed firſt to 3000. then to 5000. afterwards multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of men and women were added, and the multitude of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
increaſed; it is alſo noted that a company of the Prieſts received the faith.

Prieſts was not ſmall:<note place="margin">Ezra. 2. 36, 37, 38.</note> there is mention alſo of millions of beleevers.
And when all the Apoſtles, or the greateſt part of them remained at

prayer,<note place="margin">Act. 6. 2 &amp; 8. 1. 15. 2, 4, 6, 22, 23 &amp; 16. 4. &amp; 21. 18. 18.</note> and that they might doe it the more earneſtly and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
left the care of the poore to others: how can we thinke but that
Church did grow exceedingly, and the number of beleevers there to
be more then could fitly meete ordinarily in one congregation. Without queſtion
the number of beleevers in <hi>Antioch</hi> was not ſmall, of which it is ſaid expreſly, that
a great number beleeved, turned to the Lord and that a great multitude was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Lord by the preaching of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and that <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas</hi> continued there one whole yeere preaching the word of
God,<note place="margin">Act. 11. 21.</note> and teaching the multitude, ſo that the Diſciples were firſt called
Chriſtians at <hi>Antioch.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 11 24 25</note> After that this Church was viſited by <hi>Paul</hi>

               <p>It will eaſily be credited that the number of believers was not ſmall at <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
if we call to minde that when <hi>Paul</hi> had been there but two yeers, all

That the art for making Shrines, and <hi>Dianaes</hi> Temple was in
danger to be ſet at nought, and that thoſe that had uſed curious arts,
came and burnt their books in the ſight of all men, which could not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great danger unto the Church, unleſſe a great part of the City had believed.
Where a Church did comprehend a City with its Suburbs and the Country circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the believers who profeſſed the faith within that circuit. It might well be
that the number did ſo increaſe through the extraordinary bleſſing of God, which
accompanied the preaching of the word in thoſe primitive times, and firſt planting
of the heavenly Kingdome, that they could not well meet ordinarily in one place,
and yet continued one Society. For when a number is gathered in ſmall Villages,
or ſome added to the number already gatherd, it is not meet they ſhould be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
becauſe ſmall, nor divided from the body, becauſe the number not competent
to make an intire and perfect body of it ſelfe. The increaſe of the Churches doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
an increaſe of Elders, and (if they grow to bigneſſe more then ordinary) an
increaſe of places for their aſſembling, when the eſſence of the viſible Church is not
changed, nor one multiplied or divided into many. And it is more available for the
good of the Church, and further removed from all ambition, if the Society ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
occaſionally in divers places as parts and members of the body, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
a diſtinct free Society conſiſting of a few Believers, not fit to make up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
body contrary to the precedent examples of the Apoſtles. In times of grievous
and hot perſecution the Churches of God could not aſſemble in any great number
in publick places, but have been compelled to meet in Woods, Caves, Dens, and
dark corners, as the Lord hath offered opportunity, one and the ſame Society in
ſundry places: So that either it is not eſſential to the Church to meet together in
one place ordinarily, or their Society is broken off by perſecution, when their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together in one place is interrupted. It is ſaid by ſome where the Church grew
greater,<note place="margin">Robinſon <hi>againſt</hi> Bern p. 196.</note> ſometimes by the ſuddain and extraordinary converſion of
more then could well ſo aſſemble, then was there preſently a diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the former, and a multiplication of more particular Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.
But in the Scriptures quoted no ſuch thing doth appeare, but rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59009:21"/>
as hath been proved. In aftertimes when the Church was

bigneſſe of a convenient and fitting aſſembly which might ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily

the Church was but one.</p>
               <p>Seventhly. Seeing them both the Seals in ordinary and in extraordinary diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

or to be made members of a viſible Church for the time being, by admittance unto
the Sacraments, and not unto ſet members of congregationall aſſemblies only. And
ſeeing the godly and faithful Miniſters among us are the true Miniſters of Chriſt,
and their godly congregations, true Churches, and knowne, and approved Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
true members of viſible Churches formerly baptized, and admitted to the Lords
Supper. This conſideration is of no weight to juſtifie your opinion and practice in
debarring known and approved Chriſtians, profeſſing the faith, members of the

in that you alleadge for confirmation, ſomethings may be noted.</p>
               <p>1 The firſt inſtitution of Baptiſme is not contained in that paſſage <hi>Math. 28.

The Apoſtles certainly had authority, and preached by authority,

Thirdly if under the power of the keyes you compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
preaching by office, diſpenſing the ſeales, caſting out, and receiving againe
into the boſome of the Church wee deny the power of the keyes to belong to the

thoſe paſſages which ſpeake of this power,<note place="margin">In the Corporation (the Church) there is alwayes the whole power of Chriſt to reſiding, which you may call officers for the uſe of it ſelfe, to which it is ſufficient that it can without officers uſe this power for things ſimply neceſſary; as for receiving in of members by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith and confeſſion of ſins, for edifying of them by exhortation and comforts in the ordinance of propheſying, and ſo for excommunication. <hi>Rob.</hi> againſt <hi>B. pag. 224.</hi>

diſpenſation, and exerciſe of the keyes, be concredited to the Miniſters; Doth it
hold in all things or onely in the diſpenſation of the Sacraments, and preaching by

wee cannot ſee how in your judgement the diſpenſation,

Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Fourthly That which you add, that God will not vouchſafe
his preſence and bleſſing to an ordinance but when it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
by thoſe, whom hee hath ordayned and appointed
thereunto, muſt bee warily underſtood, or it may occaſion errors and diſtractions
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59009:22"/>
not a few, You know what corruptions ſoone entred into the Church of God, both
in reſpect of Doctrine, Worſhip, Offices, and entrance thereunto,
and how ready and apt is the concluſion from your words,<note place="margin">Robinſ. <hi>againſt</hi> Bern. <hi>Coun. debated,</hi> p. 32. ibid. p. 79.</note> That
Chriſt hath not vouchſafed his preſence, and bleſſing in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
to his Church? But of this before.</p>
               <p>And on the contrary, ſeeing God hath vouchſafed his bleſſing in
his Ordinances diſpenſed by your ſelves, when you ſtood as viſible Miniſters in the
congregation, and Churches of old <hi>England,</hi> you muſt confeſſe, did approve both
your ſtandings and his Ordinances diſpenſed by you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as for the Aſſumption, that Paſtors and Teachers are limited to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
charge or ſociety; but that flock is not ever one congregationall aſſembly
meeting in one place, neither the band ſo ſtreight, whereby they are tied to that one
ſociety, that they may not upon occaſion performe ſome Miniſteriall Act or Office
in another congregation, or to them that be not ſet members of their proper aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
For firſt to diſpence the Seals of the covenant is a miniſteriall act, an act of
Office, and not an exerciſe of gifts onely: But the Paſtors of one Aſſembly may
diſpence the Sacrament to the ſet members of another ſociety upon occaſion, as you
confeſſe in this and in your anſwer to the ninth poſition.</p>
               <p>And if the members of one Church may lawfully upon occaſion receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Supper in another ſociety from the Paſtor thereof, then may the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
of one congregation performe a Miniſteriall act to the members of another, and
if to the members of another then in another congregation with conſent, and upon
occaſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the Miniſters are exhorted to feed their flock: ſo is every Chriſtian
and Miniſter to try and examine himſelfe whether hee be in the faith,
but you will not allow this concluſion.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11 28.</note> I muſt examine my ſelf. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
no man is debarred from the Sacrament for his unworthineſſe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 23. 5.</note> or to be
tried or examined by others, to be obſerved, admoniſhed, and brought to repentance
for notorious ſin.<note place="margin">Beza de Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byt. <hi>&amp;</hi> Excom. pag. 32</note> No more can it be rightly gathered from the former
paſſages of Scripture, that the Miniſter is not upon occaſion to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
any Miniſteriall act to any other people or ſociety,<note place="margin">Robinſ. <hi>againſt</hi> Bern. pag. 252.</note> becauſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
he is to attend his own flock.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As the Miniſters have peculiar relation to their particular
flocks, ſo the people unto their particular Miniſters, unto whom they are tied in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
manner, as to their Overſeers, who muſt give account for theirſouls. And if this
peculiar relation betwixt the people &amp; the Miniſter doth not hinder the people from
receiving the Lords Supper at the hands of another Miniſter; nor the miniſter from
performing the Miniſteriall act to the members of another congregation. Neither
doth his peculiar Relation to his own flock hinder him, from adminiſtring unto
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59009:23"/>
others upon juſt occaſion being intreated thereunto. As the combining of the people
to their peculiar Miniſter, doth not quite cut off their communion with other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters:
ſo neither doth the reſtraining of a Miniſter to a peculiar flock quite cut him off
from adminiſtring upon occaſion: unto another people. <hi>Paul</hi> appointeth the <hi>Epheſian</hi>

to which purpoſe it is commonly cited. But that a Paſtor is ſo tied to his flock, that
he can perform no miniſteriall act to any other upon any occaſion that it proveth
not, nor can we find that it was ever ſo underſtood by Divines

the latter is proper to the place and people where
he doth miniſter. The lawfull uſe of his power is limited to that congregation or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily.
The power it ſelf is not ſo limited and bounded. In Ordination, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are not reſtrained to one or other certaine place, as if they were to be deemed
Miniſters there onely, though they be set over a certain people. And as the faithfull
in reſpect of a community betwixt them, muſt and ought to performe the Offices
of love one to another, though of different ſocieties, ſo the Miniſters in reſpect of
their communion, muſt and ought upon occaſion to performe miniſteriall Offices
towards the faithfull of diſtinct ſocieties.</p>
               <p>5 If this be not ſo, what ſhall become of the poore flock when the Paſtor is
driven away by perſonall perſecution, ſo that he cannot, if others may not afford
them helpe and ſuccour: what when the congregation it ſelfe is diſperſed, muſt no
ſheepherd receive them into fold, when they are driven from their own, or neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him?</p>
               <p>6 If the Paſtor may be abſent from his flock upon neceſſary, juſt, and weighty
occaſion, reſpecting his own good, the good of that ſociety, or the common good of
Churches conſociate, then may the Paſtor, the ſoaiety, the Churches procure ſome
man to ſupply the defect, and doe the office of a Paſtor, preach the Word, pray,
and as occaſion is offered, adminiſter the Sacrament in that Congregation unto
that Aſſembly untill their Sheepheard ſhall returne. Shall the people be left as
ſheepe without a ſheepheard; becauſe for the good of the Churches their owne
ſheepheard is called from them for a time, that he might returne with greater joy
and comfort?</p>
               <p>The Paſtor is appointed to feed his own flock, and yet for the good of the whole
Church he may be called to leave, if not the care, yet the over-ſight of his flock fot
a while; and by the ſame reaſon a paſtor of another flock or congregation may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the office, and doe the acts of a Miniſter in his congregation during abſence:
Yea if for the good of the Churches he be called away, doe not the Churches ſtand
obliged in conſcience to provide that the flock ſuſtain to hurt by his abſence which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59009:24"/>
poſſibly yee cannot doe if one Miniſter may not performe a Miniſteriall act in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Congregation.</p>
               <p>7 If the Prophets of one Church may propheſy in another, and apply their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
exhortations and prayers to any of the occaſions of the
Churches where they ſpeake,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 15.</note> whereof they are not ſet members,
what hinders why the Paſtor of one congregation, may not preach
and pray, adminiſter the Sacraments in another? The paſtor of one congregation
is appointed to his peculiar charge, but he is a Miniſter in the univerſall Church, as
well as the Prophets of one Church may bee called Prophets of the univerſall
Church by vertue of that Communion which all true Churches have one with
another. Without conſent the Prophet may not propheſie by exhortation, and with
conſent the Paſtor may adminiſter the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>8 In the Primitive Churches when Elders were ordained in every City, they
were not onely to looke to their flock but indeavour the converſion of poore Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels

but by private inſtruction and publique teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in thoſe Cities, though the number might bee ſo
great as they could not well meete in one Congregation,
nor be ſubject to the ſame Paſtor; for either they muſt bee
baptized by the paſtors among whom they lived, (being converted to the faith) or
continue unbaptized untill they were a number convenient to make a diſtinct ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
or grow together into one body, and to elect and chooſe their own Miniſter
by whom they may be baptiſed: But that either they muſt ſtay ſo long without
baptiſme, or that a ſociety of unbaptiſed men had power in thoſe times to elect and
chooſe their Miniſter, by whom they ſhould be baptiſed is contary to all preſidents
in Scripture.</p>
               <p>9 And ſo if a Paſtor may not performe a miniſteriall act to any other perſon
or people but his own flock onely, then a company newly converted from infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which cannot joyne themſelves as ſet members to another aſſembly, muſt remain
unbaptiſed till they have choſen their Miniſter to doe that office. Then muſt the
people thus converted want officers til there be among themſelves able men to pray,
preach, exhort in the congregation at the ordination of their Miniſter, or (if that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59009:24"/>
may bee omitted) till there be fit men among them to examine the fitneſſe of him
that is choſen.</p>
               <p>10 If ſubtile Heretikes ariſe, and ſeduce, and draw away many from the faith,
and the body of the ſociety be not able to convince them, either they muſt be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
or caſt out without conviction, for neighbouring Miniſters ſtand in peculiar
relation to their flocks onely, and muſt not meddle beyond their calling according
to your tenent.</p>
               <p>11 There is no precept or example in

of another Aſſembly, and uſually you admit to the Supper of
the Lord, members of other Churches, and therefore the Miniſter is not ſo limited
to his particular Church or flock but he may diſpence the ſeales to others, which in
this conſideration is denyed.</p>
               <p>12 If the want of one Officer in a Congregation for a time, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
by another, as the want of the Doctor, Ruling Elder, or Deacon, by the Paſtor;
why may not the defects of ſome Congregation or Chriſtians be ſupplyed by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
or Miniſters of another Congregation, when they are requeſted and deſired?
the minde herein is godly, and the means lawfull, and well pleaſing unto God.</p>
               <p>13 And if a Synod conſiſting of ſundry members of particular Churches, met
together in the name of Chriſt about the common and publike affaires of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſhall joyn together in prayer and communion of the Supper, wee can ſee no
ground to queſtion it as unlawfull, although that Aſſembly be no particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
or Church, hath no Paſtor over them, make not one Eccleſiaſticall body
as a particular Congregationall Church, unleſſe it be for the time onely. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
therefore may do an act of office to them that be not ſet members of his flock
as he may ſtand in Relation to them for the time.</p>
               <p>14 Your compariſon betwixt an Officer of a Town Corporate, and of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Congregation is not alike, unleſſe you will ſay that a member of another
Corporation occaſionally comming into the Towne, is thereby a member of that
Society, and ſubject to the authority of the Officer. For ſo you profeſſe that the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59009:25"/>
members of one Society may occaſionally communicate with another, and ſo be
ſubject to the Paſtor for the time being, which if you grant, it overthrows the
whole ſtrength of this conſideration. Howſoever the compariſon it ſelfe is very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
if it be preſſed. For if the Officer of a Town Corporate, preſume to doe an
act of power out of his owne Corporation, it is a meer nullity, but if a Miniſter of
the Goſpell diſpence the Sacrament of Baptiſme, or the Lords Supper to believers
of another Society (though done without conſent) it was never deemed or judged
a nullity in the Church of God. Let the compariſon hold good, and moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
have cauſe to queſtion whether they be truly baptized, or ever lawfully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. If it may not be doubted, whether ever
the Sacraments of the New Teſtament were truly or by authority diſpenced, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if we conſider what follows in the other conſiderations. This Argument
from compariſon is very uſuall in the Writings of Brethren againſt communion
with our Churches, but for the moſt part greatly miſtaken, to ſay no more.</p>

               <p>CIrcumciſion and the Paſſoever were to be adminiſtred onely to the members of
the Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Baptiſme and the Lords Supper is ſo to be adminiſtred alſo.
The conſequence is made good by the parity of theſe Ordinances. For if the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hold ſtrong for the proofe of <hi>Paedo-Baptiſme</hi> which is taken from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of Infants, why may we not as well infer a neceſſity of Church memberſhip
to Baptiſme, from the neceſſity of it to circumciſion. And that Circumciſion was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to the Church members of the Church, may appeare in that perſons circumciſed,
&amp; onely they, might eat the Paſſeover, and they onely might enter into
the Temple,<note place="margin">Exod 12 48.</note> which were the priviledges of Church members. In our
anſwer to the ſecond Objection againſt the firſt conſideration we have
ſhewed that Circumciſion was not adminiſtred to all that were under
the Covenant of Grace (which all believers were) but onely ſuch of them as joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themſelves to the Church,<note place="margin">Exod. 44 7.</note> at firſt in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, whereunto Baptiſme
doth ſo far anſwer that the Apoſtle counteth theſe expreſſe equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to be circumciſed in Chriſt with circumciſion made without
hands,<note place="margin">Col 2. 1 1, 12.</note> and to be buried with Chriſt in Baptiſme. Indeed, in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
they differ as onely the Males were circumciſed, whereas with us Females are
alſo baptized. The Reaſon is becauſe God hath limited Circumciſion to the Males,
but under the Goſpel, that difference is taken away. Againe, Circumciſion was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
in the private family; but Baptiſme, onely in the publick Aſſemblies of
the Church. The Reaſon of this difference is, becauſe they were bound to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
the Males on the eighth day, but that could not ſtand with going to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which was too far off, for the purpoſe, to bring every child thither from all
parts of <hi>Judaea</hi> to be Circumciſed the eighth day. Nor had they alway opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of a ſolemne convention in the Synagogue on every eighth day; when ſome
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59009:25"/>
child or other might be to be circumciſed. But there is no preciſe day ſet downe for
Baptiſme, nor are opportunities of publick Aſſemblies ſo remote where Churches are
kept in a congregationall frame, but that every firſt day of the week Baptiſme may
be adminiſtred if it be required. Again, for the Aforeſaid Reaſon, Circumciſion
required not a peculiar Miniſter (for ought we finde in Scripture) but it is not ſo
in Baptiſme, as was ſhewd in the ſecond Conſideration. But no good Reaſon can be
given, why, in this they ſhould not both agree <hi>viz.</hi> that they are both to be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

               <head>Reply.</head>
               <p>THis whole Reaſon as it is propounded makes onely againſt it ſelfe; who ever
thought that the Seals of the Covenant were not proper to confederates or the
Church of God? But of old all viſible Believers under the Covenant of Grace,
walking in holineſſe, were of the viſible Church, and in Church Order according to
the diſpenſation of thoſe times, though not joyned in externall ſociety with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And to exclude <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> or <hi>Iob,</hi> becauſe they were no
members of the viſible Church, when yet they were viſible Believers under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, and in Church Order as thoſe times required, is well-nigh a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
And ſo it is to debar known and approved Chriſtians members of our
Congregation, and their ſeed from the Seals, becauſe they be not of the viſible
Church, for they are members of the Church, and ſo to bee held and eſteemed
all true Churches and members of the Church, The true &amp; proper meaning of this
Conſideration, is that as Circumciſion and the Paſſeover were not to be diſpenſed
to all viſible Believers under the Covenant of Grace, but onely to ſuch as were
joyned to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, or to the people of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> no more
may Baptiſme and the Lords Supper be adminiſtred to any Believers now, unleſſe
they be joyned to ſome particular Congregation in Church Memberſhip, or unleſſe
by ſolemne Covenant, they be ſet members of ſome particular Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>The ſtrength of this Conſideration ſtands in the
parity which is betwixt the Sacraments of the Old
and New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Eraſt <hi>ſo objects againſt</hi> Bern-Sicut a Circumciſione ad Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmum argumentamur ut pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus infantes eſſe baptizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, ita etiam licet ab agno Paſchatis ad Coenam Domini, &amp;c. <hi>whereto hee truly reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Ego vero, non nego licere &amp;c. at non temere &amp; univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaliter. <hi>Beza</hi> contra <hi>Eraſt.</hi> pag. 23.</note> Circumciſion and Baptiſme,
for <hi>parum par eſt ratio,</hi> but this parity is not found
in every thing (as is manifeſt by the particulars al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
in the Conſideration it ſelf.) And wee muſt
juſtly require ſome reaſon to prove them like in that
particular, but to unfold it more fully, we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
three things. Firſt, how far an argument
may be drawn ſoundly from one Sacrament to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or wherein the Sacraments agree, and wherein
they differ. Secondly, What wee are to think of the
propoſition it ſelf. Thirdly, whether the Reaſon of Circumciſion and Baptiſme be
one in that particular.</p>

                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59009:26"/>
Firſt the Sacraments of the old Teſtament and the new agree in their Common
author, nature and end, and therfore what is ſpoken of one in reſpect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
author, nature and end that doth hold true of everie one. If Circumciſion be of
divine inſtitution a ſeale of the Righteouſneſſe of faith, and of the Covenant of
grace, a Sacrament in generall is an ordinance divine, a ſeale of the Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and peculiar to them that bee confederates. But what is peculiar to one Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that agreeth not to another. What is proper to the ſacraments of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
in reſpect of the manner of diſpenſation that agreeth not to the new, as if
the Sacraments of the old Teſtament be with bloud, obſcure in ſignification, painfull
for uſe, peculiar to one Nation, and to bee aboliſhed, the Sacraments of the new
Teſtament muſt be without bloud, cleere for ſignification, eaſie for uſe, univerſall
to all Nations, and perpetuall to continue in the Church for ever.</p>
               <p>Circumciſion and Baptiſme are both Sacraments of divine inſtitution, and ſo they
agree in the ſubſtance of the things ſignified, the perſons to whom they are to bee
adminiſtred, and the order of adminiſtration, if the right proportion bee obſerved.
As circumciſion ſealed the entrance into the covenant the righteouſneſſe of faith, and
circumciſion of the heart: ſo doth Baptiſme much more clearly: As <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his houſhold, and the infants of beleiving Iews were to be circumciſed, ſo the faithful,
their families, and their ſeed are to bee baptized. None muſt eate the paſſeover who
was not circumciſed, women excepted, who were circumciſed in the males. Nor
may a man unbaptized be admitted to the Lords ſupper. Circumciſion was but
once applied by Gods appointment and the ſame holds in baptiſme according to
the will and good pleaſure of God: But circumciſion and baptiſme agree not in
their ſpeciall forme, and manner of diſpenſation appointed of God. And in theſe
things a reaſon cannot be drawn from the one to the other affirmatively. The
males onely were to be circumciſed as only capable of that ſigne: but males and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
both ought to be baptized. The infants males were to be circumciſed the
eighth day becauſe ſeaven dayes they were legally uncleane.<note place="margin">Lev. 12. 2. 3. &amp; 22. 27 Exo. 22. 30,</note>
But the ſeed of the faithfull are not to bee reputed uncleane.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> no ſet tyme is appointed for baptiſme. Circumciſion as other Ceremonies did
diſtinguiſh the Iewes from the Gentiles; but Chriſt now of two hath
made one.<note place="margin">Eph. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15.</note> Circumciſion ſignified Chriſt to come, Baptiſme is the ſeale of
the New covenant made in Chriſt already come. And ſo in the degree of grace
given, ſome difference may be put: The other differences alleadged in the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
with the reaſons thereof are not ſo cleere and undoubted: for Baptiſme is
not tyed to the firſt day of the weeke: and the Jewes might gather an Aſſembly on
the eighth day as occaſion required and it might be appropriated to the Prieſts and
<hi>Levites</hi> though done in private: But in whatſoever they agree or differ we muſt
looke to the inſtitution and neither ſtretch it wider, nor draw it narrower then the
Lord hath made it. For hee is the Inſtitutor of the Sacraments according to his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59009:26"/>
owne good pleaſure. And it is our part to learne of him, both to whom, how, and
for what end the Sacraments are to be adminiſtred, how they agree, and wherein
they differ. In all which we muſt affirme nothing but what God hath taught us,
and as he hath taught us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as for the Propoſition it ſelfe; certaine it is, Circumciſion and the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
were to be adminiſtred onely to the viſible members of the Church, <hi>e.</hi> to men
in Covenant, profeſſing the true faith; But that in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time none were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
members of the Church, which joyned not themſelves in Church orders to the
family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> wee have not learned. In the firſt Inſtitution of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we find that God gave it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Seale of the Covenant formerly
made with him: But of any Church covenant or order whereunto <hi>Abrahams</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
ſhould enter before Circumciſion we read not. <hi>Melchizedeck, Lot, Iob, &amp;c.</hi>
were not onely viſible Beleevers under the Covenant of grace, but viſible members
of the Church, according to the order and diſpenſation of thoſe times. Wee read
not (you ſay) that <hi>Melchizedeck, Lot</hi> or <hi>Iob</hi> were circumciſed, but that is no
good reaſon to inferre negatively that they were not Circumciſed. We read not that
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, or the Apoſtles, or the 500.
brethren were Baptized,<note place="margin">Etiam ſi daremus nullam legi ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolis excommunicationem non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſequeretur ita eſſe, quum ſatis conſtet non omnium ſingularia Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolorum geſta perſcripta fuiſſe.

conclude, that they were not initiated
by that ſeale. Moreover, if they were not
Circumciſed, it may bee the Inſtitution of
that Sacrament was not knowne unto them,
or the Authour of Circumciſion (upon whoſe
will and pleaſure they muſt depend) did not
command it unto them, or require that they
ſhould joyne themſelves in Covenant with
<hi>Abrahams</hi> family: and in that caſe if they
had Circumciſed themſelves they had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed.
But then the reaſon why they were
not circumciſed was not this, that they were
not (as you ſpeake) in Church order: but
becauſe Circumciſion was appropriated to
<hi>Abrahams</hi> family by divine Inſtitution in
ſome ſpeciall and peculiar reſpects belonging
to the manner of Adminiſtration. After the
Church of the Jewes was conſtituted (when
wee can no more imagine that there was a
Church among the Gentiles, then that there
are Chriſtians among the Barbarians at this
day) we finde none muſt be admitted to the
Paſſeover that was not firſt Circumciſed, but nothing was required of a ſtranger
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59009:27"/>
to circumciſion, but that he profeſſe the true faith, and avouch the God of <hi>Abraham</hi>
to be his God, which of neceſſitie muſt be done before he could be reputed a viſible
Beleever, or under the Covenant of promiſe.</p>
               <p>Thus a learned and reverend divine, Circumciſion was a ſeale of
the covenant,<note place="margin">Io. D. exam of tents p 309.</note> that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning Chriſt that
ſhould come as concerning the fleſh of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and ſo of <hi>Iacob</hi> of whom
were the 12 tribes who were the Iſraelites, &amp;c. <hi>Rom. 9. 4. 5.</hi> So that as in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
time none were bound to be Circumciſed but thoſe that were of his family
as being borne there or bought, and ſo brought thither which were not of his ſeed:
So afterwards none were bound to be Circumciſed which were not borne in the
family of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> or joyned to them. And after their comming out
of <hi>Egypt</hi> none were bound to be Circumciſed but the children of the Iewes (then
the only Church of God,) and thoſe that deſired to joyne unto them. The ſumme
is thus much, God gave circumciſion to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a ſeale of the Covenant but
whether it was given to other beleevers in his time it is (at leaſt) a thing uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
And if they were not Circumciſed it was by reaſon of the ſpeciall Inſtitution
of God, and peculiar manner of adminiſtration of the Covenant of promiſe which
in ſome reſpect was proper, to the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not common to all the
viſible members of the Church at that time in Church fellowſhip and order. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
when there were none in covenant but the ſeed of <hi>Iacob</hi> or ſtrangers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> circumciſion was not to be adminiſtred to any man
who was not in Covenant nor any man to bee admitted to the Paſſeover who was
not circumciſed. This is the moſt that can be ſaid with any probability: But hence
it will not follow by iuſt analogie or proportion, that the ſeed of the faithfull muſt
not bee admitted to Baptiſme, or viſible believers be received to the Lords Supper
unleſſe they bee ſet members of ſome particular congregation united in Church
order. Thirdly, preſuppoſing therefore that <hi>Melchizedeck, Lot</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> were not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
we ſay there is not the like reaſon of Circumciſion and Baptiſme in this
particular. For, firſt if Circumciſion was ever appropriated to the family of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and might be communicated to other viſible Beleevers, it was in the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
and adminiſtration; but in the firſt Inſtitution and adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
it was not obſerved that beleevers ſhould be firſt gathered into a politicall
body or Chriſtian church memberſhip,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 7.</note> and then baptized. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
baptized ſuch as came to him confeſſing their ſins. The Apoſtles
baptized Diſciples,<note place="margin">Io 4 2.</note> ſuch as gladly received their doctrine, beleeved
in Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act. 2 37. 38. 41.</hi> &amp; 8 37. &amp; 10. 47. 48.</note> and received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, before
they were gathered into Chriſtian Church order, or made fit mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a Chriſtian congregationall Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>2 If Circumciſion was by ſpeciall Inſtitution given as a priviledge
to the Males of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Familie, <hi>Melchizedecke, Iob, Lot,</hi> and
other viſible Beleevers were not bound to joyne themſelves as members
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59009:27"/>
to <hi>Abrahams</hi> familie, or deſire and ſeek to be circumciſed: But they that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the doctrine of ſalvation, beleeve Chriſt, and profeſſe the faith, are bound to
ſeek, and deſire the priviledge of the ſeals in an holy manner.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Melchizedech, Job,</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were not onely viſible beleevers, but viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church, according to the manner of diſpenſing in thoſe times: but the
Seals (as you confeſſe) belong to all beleevers knit together in Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>4. If circumciſion be appropriated to the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> it is becauſe the
Covenant ſealed by circumciſion is peculiar to <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie, <hi>(ſc.)</hi> that
Chriſt ſhould come as concerning the fleſh, of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> But Baptiſme is the ſeal of the
Covenant of grace without any peculiar or ſpeciall tye or reſpect.</p>
               <p>5. You contend, that Baptiſme did belong to ſuch beleevers as were members
of the then Jewiſh Church, which cannot ſtand, if <hi>Abrahams</hi> familie did anſwer to
a Chriſtian ſocietie or congregationall Aſſembly; Juſt reaſon therefore may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
why circumciſion was diſpenſed onely to the males of <hi>Abrahams</hi> familie, when
baptiſme is not to be limited onely to the ſet members of a particular ſocietie; and
if this conſideration be applied to the purpoſe, inſtead of ſaying, Circumciſion and
the Paſſeover were to be adminiſtred onely to the members of the Church, you
muſt ſay Circumciſion was to be deſired of or adminiſtred unto all the true appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
viſible members of the Church. And if there be the ſame reaſon of both, then
all viſible approved members of the Church muſt not deſire nor be admitted to the
ſeals, but this concluſion you will not acknowledge.</p>

               <p>THey that are not capable of the Church cenſures, are not capable of the
Church priviledges: but they that are not within Church-Covenant are
not capable of Church cenſures. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The propoſition is evident, The Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be proved, <hi>1 Corinth. 5. 12.</hi> What have I to do to judge them that are

but of ſome beleevers alſo, who though by externall union with Chriſt they
are within the Covenant of grace, yet being not joyned externally to the viſible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of Chriſt (a particular Church) are in regard of viſible Church communion ſaid
to be without. To this purpoſe is this text alledged by other Divines alſo, as Dr.

               <head>Reply.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, men are capable of Church cenſures in two reſpects, either in having
the power of the keyes, and authoritie to diſpenſe them according to God, or
as ſubject to the cenſures of the Church. In the firſt ſenſe, many are capable of
Church priviledges that are not capable of Church cenſures, as the ſeed of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
parents, children and women. You ſay you admit to the ſeales the knowne
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59009:28"/>
and approved, and orderly recommended members of any true Church: but to fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
in the cenſures, admittance of members, and choice of Officers onely, the
members of that particular Church whereof they and we (any of us) ſtand mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
In the ſecond ſenſe alſo many are capable of Church priviledges who are not
ſubject to Church cenſures: as the children of Chriſtian parents are capable of
baptiſme, the known and approved members of any true Church are capable of the
Seales in other Congregations among you who are not ſubject to the cenſures of
that other Society. Spirituall communion in publick prayer is a Church priviledge,
which is not denied to viſible beleevers and godly perſons, though not in Church
order, and ſo not in ſubjection in your ſenſe to Church cenſures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a perſon baptiſed is not baptiſed in that particular congregation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but into all Churches, and every particular Church where he cometh he hath
all the priviledges of a baptiſed perſon in reſpect of his baptiſme, and is ſo to be
eſteemed by them. Now the priviledge of a baptiſed perſon who is able to examine
himſelf, and walketh in the truth, is to be admitted to the Lords Supper. All cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
perſons had right thereby to eat the Paſſeover in any ſocietie, in the place
which God ſhould chuſe to put his Name there. <hi>Exod. 12. 4. 47. Deut. 16. 1, 2.</hi> So
all baptiſed perſons have true and intire right to the Lords Supper in everie true
Church where God hath ſet his Name.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is not the ſame reaſon of every Church priviledge, for one may
have right to ſome, who is not to meddle with others. The members of one ſociety
may hear the Word, joyne in Prayer, and receive the Sacraments in another, when
they are not to meddle in the election and ordination of their teachers. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Goſpel may preach the Word, and adminiſter the Sacraments in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
congregation, and hereto he needs no other calling but that God offers an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie;
there is much need of his help, and he is intreated, or hath leave from
them in place or office; but he is not to admit members into the ſocietie, or caſt
them out that be admitted. And if the Paſtor of one Church ſhall preach or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
the Sacraments in another, contrary to the liking and approbation of the
Society and Governours, though the act be irregular, it was never eſteemed a nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
but if he ſhall preſume to excommunicate the members of another ſocietie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the conſent or the Church, and approbation of Paſtors and Teachers, under
whoſe charge and juriſdiction they live, it hath been judged a meer nullity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the propoſition is not ſo evident as to be taken without proofe, that they have
no power to admit a beleever into communion in any Church priviledge who have
no power to excommunicate.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that viſible beleevers baptiſed into a true Church profeſſing the true
faith, and walking in holy obedience, and godly converſation, that
they and their ſeed ſhould be judged ſuch as are without in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles
ſenſe,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 12.</note> becauſe they be not externally joyned as ſet members to ſome particular
congregation in Church-Covenant is affirmed, not proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59009:28"/>
1. It hath, and may fall out many times through the ignorance, raſhneſſe, or
pride of a prevailing faction in the Church, that the true members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church, and the beſt members of the orthodox viſible flock, or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Chriſt may be no members of any diſtinct viſible ſocietie. And ſhall
their poſteritie be eſteemed Aliens and Strangers from the Covenant, and debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the Sacraments, becauſe their parents are unjuſtly ſeperated from the
inheritance of the Lord? Surely as parents unjuſtly excommunicated do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſtill not onely true members of the inviſible body, but viſible members of
the flock of Chriſt: ſo the right of Baptiſme doth belong to the Infants of ſuch
parents, though not actuall and conſtant members of this or that preſent aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in Church order.</p>
               <p>2. If they be without, becauſe no members of a politike bodie or ſpirituall
fellowſhip: then all members which are of one ſocietie are without to another:
For they that be not of the bodie are not capable of Church cenſures, or ſubject
to the authoritie one of another. And ſo not being under the judgement of that
particular Church to it they are without; whereas in ancient and moderne times
diſtinct Societies did communicate together, admit and receive each other as
brethren, to teſtifie their fellowſhip in the faith. If the reaſon whereupon the
Apoſtle ſaith the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was not to judge them that were without,
was becauſe they were not within the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo not under their
cenſure or judgement: this holds true of them that be of another ſociety admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Sacrament, as well as of ſuch as be no ſet members deſiring to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>3. (The fornicators of this world) do they not explaine whom the Apoſtle
pointeth unto by the title of being without, <hi>ver. 10. 11.</hi> ſuch as had not received
the covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>4. Church order is neceſſarie we denie not; but this order that a man ſhould
be a conſtant and ſet member of a particular ſocietie by covenant, to make him a
true member of the viſible Church, or to give him title or intereſt to the publick
order, this is not taught of God.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Paul</hi> divides all men into two ranks, the firſt and greater without; the laſt
and leſſer within: but that beleevers who have received the holy Ghoſt, and have
been baptiſed into Jeſus Chriſt, that they and their children ſhould be reckoned
among them that are without, that we read not in this nor any
other Scripture,<note place="margin">1. Joh. 2. 19.</note> but in phraſe of Scripture hereticks themſelves
are within the Church.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>6. The beleevers not yet gathered (as the godly learned think) into a certain
diſtinct body are called beleevers, brethren, diſciples; but that they ſhould be
comprehended under them that are without, it hath not been beleeved in the
Church.</p>

member of ſome congregationall Aſſembly, but he that is not ſubject to the
cenſure of the community of that particular combination few or many, with,
or without Officers. And ſo all the reformed Churches in the world who aſcribe
the power of the keyes to the Presbitry or Claſſes, and not to the community,
and ſome amongſt your ſelves (if not the moſt) ſhall be without alſo.</p>
               <p>And therefore we cannot think approved Chriſtians deſiring to be received
unto the Sacrament, either to be without, or uncapable of Church cenſures for
the time being if they ſhould offend, though not ſet members of any particular
congregation: for deſiring baptiſme for their children or themſelves to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Lords Supper for the time they put themſelves under the ordinance
of Jeſus Chriſt there. And as they are members for the time, ſo they might be

would proceed with an offending member.</p>
               <p>10. If upon juſt and good reaſon a paſſage of Scripture can be cleared to
prove that for which it was never alledged by any writer, we are not to except
againſt any truth of God, becauſe it wanteth mans teſtimonie. Onely if we deſire
credit in ſuch caſes, our reaſons muſt be weightie and convincing. But for your
expoſition of this text of Scripture, as yet we have not obſerved one ſubſtantiall
ground, or approved author to be alledged. Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> ſhewing the neceſſitie
of Chriſtians joyning themſelves to ſome particular Church, giveth this reaſon,
<hi>Quoniam alias fieri non poteſt quum conturbentur ſigna illa quibus fideles ab infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
diſcerni poſſunt. 1. Cor. 5. 12.</hi> But herein Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> manifeſtly ſheweth that by
them that are [without] heathens, and unbeleevers muſt be underſtood, and not
beleevers and godly men though of no particular ſetled ſocietie for the time,
for thus we conceive he argueth. The ſignes and evidences whereby the faithfull
are to be diſcerned from unbeleevers, muſt not be confounded: but unleſſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
make themſelves actuall members of a Societie or Church, the ſignes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the faithfull are diſcerned from unbeleevers, will be obſcured and darkned.
And if this be his reaſon how can that text of Scripture be alledged for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
unleſſe by [men without] Infidels be underſtood. Again Doctor <hi>Ames</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59009:29"/>
in the ſame book, <hi>lib. 4. ca. 27.</hi> ſpeaking of Infants to be received, it is required
(he ſaith) that they be in the covenant of grace in reſpect of outward profeſſion,
and eſtimation in reſpect of their parents, and that there is hope they ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
and brought up in the ſame covenant. 2. That Baptiſme doth moſt
properly belong to thoſe infants whoſe parents, at leaſt one of them is in the
Church, and not without, becauſe baptiſme is a ſigne and ſeale of the covenant
of grace. 3. That children that are caſt forth are in charitie to be eſteemed the
children of Chriſtian parents, when there is no juſt cauſe of preſuming the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that in admitting unto baptiſme a difference muſt be put betweene the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of thoſe who in ſome ſort belong to the Church, but openly break the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of God, and the children of others.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe a diſtinction muſt be obſerved in holy things betweene the cleane
and uncleane; ſeeing elſe the ordinance of God cannot be preſerved from all
pollution. To ſay nothing of that which he addeth touching the baptiſme of
Infants borne in fornication, excommunication, and Papiſts, which is more
then ſufficient to cleare his meaning in the former paſſage. To this may be added
that he holdeth it not neceſſarie that Chriſtians ſhould gather themſelves into a
particular ſociety, but as opportunitie and occaſion ſhould offer it ſelf. So that
it was never his mind to cenſure them who be not gathered into Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,

good Chriſtians in them, united to worſhip God ordinarily in one Societie, ſo
many have the eſſence and integrall forme of a viſible Church, and all they have

Churches in the Lords Supper, and their ſeed in baptiſme. 3. The Church ſhall

is an action of pietie required of all beleevers in the ſecond Commandment;
and true pietie frameth mens ſpirits to have reſpect to all Gods Commandments.
And we have had much experience of it, that men of approved pietie in the

there now that the extraordinarie office of the Apoſtles,

               <p>You aske if without reſpect to their Church eſtate
men of approved pietie (as we ſay) are to be admitted into fellowſhip in the
ſeals, how ſhall their pietie be approved to the Church, not by their own report
of themſelves alone, &amp;c. Do not you ſay the ſame, That there be many godly
perſons, and of approved pietie among us, who are not approved by their own
report of themſelves (unleſſe ye will take their wiſedome, faith, patience, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
conſtancie, and holineſſe of life for their report) approved, we ſay by as

into Church fellowſhip, or can be required of members admitted unto
the priviledges of the Church, if men will follow the Lords direction, or as you
can give to ordinances members of your ſocieties. You profeſſe high reſpect of
your brethren in old <hi>England,</hi> but it ſeemes you judge them inſufficient to give
orderly teſtimonie of the ſinceritie and uprightneſſe of approved Chriſtians, well
known unto them, and living among them, which two cannot well agree. We
ſpeake not of ſuch who againſt light refuſe to profeſſe ſubjection to the Goſpel
of Chriſt to joyne themſelves orderly in fellowſhip with ſome approved Church:
But of ſuch as do with all readineſſe profeſſe ſubjection, and walk accordingly,
and heartily deſire to joyn themſelves to the moſt pure and compleat Churches
ſo farre as they are taught of God, or have opportunitie thereunto. And if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception

lacke of opportunitie. No doubt (as you ſay) but now and then a man of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
pietie in the judgement of ſome may be found too light, yea and in the
judgement of his owne conſcience when he hath come to triall. And no queſtion

godly Chriſtians from the Lords Supper, and much more the children of thoſe
parents who are in covenant with God, from holy baptiſme you exceed your

               <p>THis concluſion is not to the queſtion propounded, for we ſpeake of ſuch as
cannot, not of ſuch as refuſe to joyne themſelves unto the Church; or if they
do not joyne, it is not out of contempt or wilfull neglect of Gods ordinance,
or deſire of carnall libertie, and not to be in ſubjection to Chriſt, but for lacke of

Chriſt the chiefe Shepherd of the flock doth, or preſſe that upon their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

which they cannot conſent unto, if they ſhall fit downe quietly for the

We accuſe not the wiſedome and diſcretion of your Chuches, but we
know the zealous multitude may ſometimes be raſh; And when a reaſon is cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of your judgement, why you do debarre the moſt knowne and approved

we diſlike you ſhould put this note upon them, as if againſt light they refuſed
orderly to ſubject themſelves to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: What warrant you
have thus to cenſure, what uſe of this manner of diſpute we leave it to your god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſedome to judge. In the Conſideration it ſelf there are many Propoſitions
couched together, which we muſt examine ſeverally as they have reference to
the concluſion intended, and then try whether it can be raiſed from them.</p>
               <p>The firſt Propoſition, That none have power to diſpence the Seales, but they
that are called to the office of Miniſtery, is freely granted.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, That no man can be ſo called till firſt there be a Church to call
him, needeth explication. For by the Church you muſt underſtand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of the faithfull, as they are one bodie, without officers or guides. And
ſuch a Church there cannot be without a Miniſtery to call and admit them into
Church-fellowſhip. The Apoſtles baptiſed not themſelves, but by the help of
others, &amp; thoſe not called of the people to be baptiſed, <hi>1 Cor. 1. 17.</hi> The Apoſtles
appointed by electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Elders in every city or Church. And ſo there was a Church
before Elders were ſet over it, but this Church was a ſocietie of beleevers by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
admitted into Church-fellowſhip. There can be no Church to call a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
to feed the flock, and diſpence the ſeals, till they have received the doctrine
of ſalvation intirely, and by the ſeale of initiation be ſolemnly received into
the ſocietie of men profeſſing Chriſt. A company of men converted to the faith
being unbaptized, may and ought to deſire baptiſme, but they have not power
to elect and chuſe one among themſelves to diſpence the ſeales unto the reſt for
ought is to be found in Scripture:<note place="margin">Rob. <hi>againſt</hi> Bern. <hi>likely veiwed.</hi> p. 40.</note> The Churches conſtitution into
which Chriſtians are to gather themſelves muſt be Apoſtolicall, and
not one day or houre younger in nature and forme of it, thus the
firſt Church of the New Teſtament. But it can never be ſhewed in Scripture that
any ſocietie of unbaptiſed perſons did firſt chuſe from among them a Paſtor or
Teacher by whom they might be baptiſed: you cannot produce one example or
other proofe in the Scripture, of one man teaching the Goſpel miniſterially but
he was baptiſed, and a member of a true Church, or of a ſocietie who made
choice of a Paſtor and teacher, but they were baptiſed perſons.</p>
               <p>The third Propoſition, That the power of calling Miniſters is given by Chriſt
unto the Church, muſt alſo be rightly underſtood: For by the Church muſt be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59009:32"/>
meant the ſocietie of the faithfull, not onely ingrafted into Chriſt, ſet into the
ſtate of ſalvation, and made heires apparent of everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
entred and inrolled into the ſocietie of Chriſts flock, and acknowledged
members by free admiſſion into the Seales of the Covenant. Againe, by the
Church if we ſpeake of ordinary calling, muſt not be underſtood of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
alone, but their guides and officers together with them, who are to goe
before the reſt, and to direct and governe them in their choice. Neither can we
ſay, that any two or three beleevers linked together in ſocietie doe make ſuch a
Church, as to whom the calling of the Miniſter doth belong: but that right was
given by Chriſt to ſuch Churches as were gathered and eſtabliſhed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
The Church hath a Miniſtery of calling one whom Chriſt hath deſcribed,
that from Chriſt he may have power of Office given him in the vacant place.
But the office, gift, and power of the Miniſtery, is immediately from Chriſt and
not from the Church. The Church doth neither virtually nor formally give
power to her Officers but miniſterially onely, as miniſtring to him who hath
power and vertue to conferre it. And this right of election is ſo given to the
communitie and body of the people, that if they have conſented to give away
their right, or if it be taken injuriouſly from them, the calling of the Miniſter
notwithſtanding may be true, and miniſteriall acts done by him that is thruſt
upon the people without their conſent may be effectuall to their ſalvation. A
wrong it is altogether to debarre the godly of their conſent in the calling of
ſuch as muſt watch for their ſoules; but it makes not the calling it ſelfe a meere
nullitie; for then many Churches in the world within a few hundred yeares after
Chriſt ſhould have wanted both miniſtery and Sacraments, and they would have
been altogether deſtitute of both miniſtery and Sacraments for many hundred
yeares.</p>
               <p>The fourth, That all thoſe who deſire to partake in the Seales, are bound to
joyne themſelves together in Church-ſtate, that ſo they may call a Miniſter to
diſpence the Seales unto them, will not follow from the former rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
We deny not but Chriſtians are bound to joyne themſelves together in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fellowſhip, if God give them opportunitie: but they muſt partake in the Seales
before they can joyne themſelves together in Church-ſtate. And ſuch as for lack
of meanes and opportunitie cannot joyne themſelves into ſuch an eſtate, or be
diſperſed by perſecution, or be deſtitute of Paſtors and Teachers, may for a time
deſire and ſeek to have the ſeales diſpenced unto them by the Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of other Societies, with whom they hold communion in the faith. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
alſo who are deprived of right and libertie to chooſe their Paſtor, may deſire
and ſeek to have the Seales diſpenced unto them by him who is ſet over them.
If a company of Infidells ſhould be converted to the faith, they muſt deſire to
partake in the ordinances of grace before they could joyne together in a Church-way
to call a Miniſter of their own, who might adminiſter the Sacraments unto
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59009:32"/>
them. To make Diſciples and baptize are joyned together. And
if theſe Propoſitions be allowed for current,<note place="margin">John 4. 2.</note> a nation or people
plunged into Idolatry or Infidelitie,<note place="margin">Math. 28. 19.</note> or otherwiſe diſchurched, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by ordinary meanes recover into a Church-eſtate, wherein they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and according to Gods appointment deſire or expect that the Seales of the
Covenant ſhould be diſpenced to them.</p>
               <p>The fifth Propoſition riſeth beyond meaſure, that no Chriſtian can expect by
the appointment of God to partake in the Seales till he have joyned himſelfe in
Church-fellowſhip and the calling of the Miniſter. Wee conceive you will not
ſay that children and women have to doe in the call of the Miniſter (for women
they are debarred by their ſex as from ordinary Propheſying,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 34, 35.</note> ſo
from any other dealing wherein they take authority over the man)
If ſome part of the Congregation doe not conſent in the election
of Paſtors or Teachers,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11, 12.</note> have they not right to expect to have the
Seales of the Covenant diſpenced to themſelves or their ſeede?<note place="margin">Rob. ag. Ber. pa. 206.</note> If
the people be deprived of that libertie to chooſe or call their Miniſter, muſt they
ſeperate from the ordinances of worſhip there diſpenced, and from the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
as no true Churches? If ſome perſons by the providence of God live in
ſuch places where they cannot joyne in Church-fellowſhip and call of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
(as ſuppoſe the Chriſtian wife, childe, or ſervant) nor lawfully remove to
any ſuch Societie, muſt they and their children live as ſtrangers and aliens from
the Covenant of grace, wherein they may not expect to partake of the Seales<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
In Infidels be converted to the faith, muſt they not partake in the Seales, becauſe
they cannot joyne in Church-fellowſhip and call of the Miniſter, before they be
admitted to Baptiſme?</p>
               <p>Here you ſay the people muſt joyne together in the call of the Miniſter, before
they can lawfully deſire to be admitted to the Seales.<note place="margin">Rob. ag. Bern. pa. 239.</note> And another
hath zealouſly affirmed (It is a preſumptuous ſin in any to chooſe
an Officer not trained up and tryed <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> in the debating, diſcuſſing, carrying,
and contriving of Church-affaires, as alſo in admonition, exhortation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
publickly occaſioned and ſo manifeſted) Lay theſe two together, and let it
be conſidered how long many a poore ſoule converted to the faith muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to want the comfort of Gods ordinances. Beſides, if a people be joyned
together in Church-fellowſhip, and have called a Paſtor to feed and watch over
them, wee deſire (not words but) proofe why the poore diſperſed Chriſtians
wanting means or opportunitie to joyn themſelves together into ſocietie, ought
not to deſire, and that others be not bound in conſcience to afford them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of Gods ordinances.</p>
               <p>If the Propoſitions may ſtand for good, I feare we ſhall ſcarce finde that ever
in ordinary way, the Sacraments were lawfully diſpenced or received in the
Chriſtian Churches of God ſince the firſt foundation of them. Now the premiſes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59009:33"/>
being liable to ſo many exceptions, the concluſion to be laid upon them, will fall
of it ſelfe. And thereunto wee oppoſe the direct contrary. That Infidels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

               <p>THe practiſe of the Church of ſtrangers in <hi>London,</hi> recorded by <hi>John Alaſco,</hi> is
farre different from your judgement and practiſe, not in ſome by-circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
but in the maine point in queſtion; for your judgement is that true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
beleevers, baptized and partakers of the Lords Supper in other Churches not
yet gathered into Church-eſtate or fellowſhip, have no right or intereſt in the
Seales, (they nor their ſeede.) But this Church of ſtrangers held no ſuch opinion
as their own words (which you have omitted) doe plainly ſpeake. And <hi>Paul</hi>
teſtifyeth (ſay they) that by Chriſts Ordinance the Church it ſelfe without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of any member of it, is to be accounted cleane or holy by the miniſtery
of Baptiſme. Whence we may eaſily ſee, that Baptiſme doth neither belong to
thoſe who are altogether without the Church, nor to be denyed to any member
of the Church. Secondly, They held communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi>
as one and the ſame with theirs. For ſo they profeſſe: Yet nevertheleſſe, that
we may openly ſhew that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches and ours are one and the ſame
Church (though we differ ſomewhat from them both in language and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies)
We doe not refuſe that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may as publick witneſſes of the Church
offer the Infants of our members to Baptiſme in our Churches, if they have both
the uſe of our language and a certain teſtimony of their piety. As in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
our members are accuſtomed to offer the Infants of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to Baptiſme in
the <hi>Engliſh Churches.</hi> If your judgement be this of the <hi>Engliſh Churches,</hi> your
judgement in acknowledging us members of true Churches, and practiſe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring
viſible beleevers and their ſeede from the Seales, are oppoſite the one to
the other. Thirdly, This order was obſerved by them to prevent the impoſtures
of ſome, who whilſt they avoyded all Churches, pretended to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that
they were joyned to the ſtrangers, and to the ſtrangers that they were joyned to
the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But you debarre knowne Chriſtians who deſire to joyne themſelves
with you, not to prevent impoſtures of them who avoyde all Churches: yea, you
debarre them as men having no right to the Sacraments, becauſe they be not in
Church-fellowſhip: and herein you can ſhew no preſident ancient or moderne,
either from Scripture or Monuments of the Church: And as your practiſe is
without example, ſo without warrant from the word of God. And this is the

               <p>THat ſacred order which God hath ſet in his viſible Church for all his Saints
to keep and walk by, that is religiouſly to be obſerved. But for men to ſet up
that as a neceſſarie order which God never allowed, approved, or commanded,
is great preſumption. Now the Lord hath not ordained that a man ſhould be a
ſet member of a particular Societie, or body politique of faithfull people joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together in ſpirituall Church-fellowſhip by Covenant, before he be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto the Lords Supper, or that the parents ſhould be actuall viſible ſet mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of ſome particular diſtinct body before their children be baptiſed. They
that beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt have received the word of promiſe and walk therein,
they and their children are within the Covenant, and have right and title to the
Seales of the Covenant, but in their order, the infants to baptiſme, parents bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed,
to the Lords Supper. And if in that ſtate by divine grant they have intereſt
to the Sacraments, the Church in debarring them becauſe they be not yet grown
into one diſtinct ſeparate ſocietie of mutuall covenant, doth exceed the bounds
of her commiſſion. For a miniſteriall power onely is committed to the Church
to admit or refuſe them who are to be admitted or refuſed by authoritie from
God: But the Church if ſhe thruſt beleeving parents from the Supper of the Lord,
and their ſeed from baptiſme; ſhe denieth theſe benefits to them who by the
grace and gift of God have lawfull right and title thereto.</p>
               <p>1. For firſt, the baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> was true baptiſme, and truly adminiſtred
by him: And they that were baptized by him received the ſeales of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and were eſteemed members of the viſible Church: But <hi>John</hi> never deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of them who came to his baptiſme whether they were entred
into ſpirituall fellowſhip by mutuall covenant one with another.<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 6, 7.</note>
This was not then knowne to be a neceſſarie and eſſentiall point in the lawfull,
due, and orderly adminiſtration of the Sacrament. The diſciples of our Saviour

into Church-ſtate or fellowſhip.<note place="margin">

doctrine. And this they carefully obſerved in the execution of their
miniſtery upon grounds and reaſons common to them and us: for as ſoone as
any man or number of men gladly received the doctrine of ſalvation, and gave
their names to Jeſus Chriſt, if they deſired to be baptiſed forthwith they accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, never excepting, that they were no ſet members of a diſtinct viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.

were not ſet members of a diſtinct ſocietie, which had it been eſſentiall to the

<hi>Lydia</hi> and her houſhold,<note place="margin">Act. 9. 18.</note> the Jaylor and his houſe were baptiſed
without regard to their Church-eſtate.<note place="margin">Act. 16, 14. 33.</note> For in the ſame night
which he was converted, he was baptized with all his houſhold.
And this was done not by the Apoſtles onely upon ſpeciall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 17.</note>
but by others upon grounds and reaſons common
to them,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19.</note> and all ages, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they were diſciples,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 41. and 8. 12, 13, 37.</note> beleeved,
gladly received the Word, had received the holy Ghoſt, were
called,<note place="margin">Helv. conf. c. 20. Gallic. Sect. 35. Anglic. &amp; ab eo neminem qui velit profiteri nomen Chriſti ne infantes quidem Chriſtianorum hominum, &amp;c. Scot. conf. c. 23.</note> and the promiſe was made to them, and to their ſeed,
even to all them that were afarre off.</p>
               <p>Now if the Apoſtles diſpenſed the ſeales to them that were

eſſentiall to the lawfull diſpenſation of the ſeales, that all
partakers ſhould be under ſuch a covenant. If the baptiſed
diſciples, beleevers, ſuch as gladly received the Word, and
had received the gift of the holy Ghoſt, then the ſeals of the
Covenant belong unto ſuch, and by the grace of God they
have right and title unto thoſe priviledges.</p>
               <p>2. As we received the Sacraments from God by divine Inſtitution; ſo muſt
we learne from him, how and to whom the ſame are to be adminiſtred, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what he hath commanded without addition or diminution. But we have
learned from Chriſt the Author of Baptiſme, and the conſtant practiſe of the
Apoſtles (the firſt diſpenſers of theſe holy ſeales who beſt underſtood the mind
and pleaſure of the Lord herein) that ſuch as be called of God to whom the
promiſe is made, who have received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, beleeved in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59009:35"/>
Lord Jeſus, profeſſed their faith in him, and repentance for ſins paſt with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of amendment for the time to come, that ſuch have right unto, and deſiring
it ought to be received unto Baptiſme, and are greatly wronged if they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of that unſpeakable benefit.</p>
               <p>3. By a lively faith a man is made a living member of Jeſus Chriſt, and hath
internall communion with him by the intire profeſſion of Chriſtian faith joyned
with conformity of life in righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, and fellowſhip of love,
he is a member of the viſible congregation or flock of Chriſt, though no ſet mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of a free diſtinct independant Societie. And Baptiſme is the ſeale of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
into the congregation or flock of Chriſt; but not evermore of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
into this or that particular ſocietie as ſet members thereof. This latter
is accidentall to baptiſme, not eſſentiall. It may fall out to be ſo, but it is not
ever neceſſarie; nor is the Sacrament to be denyed, nor can we ſay it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
adminiſtred where it cannot be attained. For the Catholique Church is
one intire bodie, made up by the collection and agregation of all the faithfull
unto the unity thereof; from which union there ariſeth unto every one of them
ſuch a relation to, dependance upon that Church Catholique as parts uſe to
have in reſpect of the whole. And this holds true, not onely of ſound belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in reſpect of internall fellowſhip with Chriſt their head, and ſo one with
another; but of all men profeſſing the true and intire doctrine of faith and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in reſpect of them that hold and profeſſe the ſame faith of Chriſt, and
worſhip God according to his will; whereupon it followeth that neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
perſons, nor particular guides, nor particular Churches are to worke as
ſeverall divided bodies by themſelves, but are to teach, and be taught; and to do
all other duties as parts conjoyned to the whole, and members of the ſame
flock or ſocietie in generall: And ſo beleevers profeſſing the faith, and walking
in holineſſe, may and ought to be admitted to the Seales as actuall members of
the Church of Chriſt, and ſheep of his paſture, though not ſet members of one
congregationall Church.</p>
               <p>4. Not to inſiſt upon this here, that it hath and may fall out many times
through ignorance, raſhneſſe, or pride, of a prevailing faction in the Church,
that the true members of the Catholique Church, and the beſt members of the
Orthodox viſible flock, or Church of Chriſt, may be no actuall members of any
diſtinct Societie, and ſhall they for this be accounted men out of Covenant, and
their poſteritie be eſteemed aliens and ſtrangers: but if they be in Covenant, then
are they holy in reſpect of the Covenant, and their children holy as pertaining
to the Covenant,<note place="margin">Rob. <hi>againſt</hi> Ber. pa. 92.</note> and have right to the Sacrament of initiation.
Thus Mr. <hi>Rob.</hi> frameth the argument. The Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
is to be adminiſtred by Chriſts appointment,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19.</note> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
example onely to ſuch as are (externally,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 41. &amp; 8. 12 13. 37. and 10. 47. and 2. 39.</note> and ſo far as men
can judge) taught and made diſciples, do receive the Word glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
do beleeve, and ſo profeſſe, have received the holy Ghoſt, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59009:35"/>
to their ſeed.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 19.</note> And thus the Church of God ever ſince the Apoſtles
dayes underſtood the covenant and promiſe, and their practiſe in receiving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
and their ſeed to the Seales of the Covenant was anſwerable, as might be

               <p>VVHere the holy Ghoſt is given and received (which was the caſe of the
Centurion) and where faith is profeſſed according to Gods ordinance
(which was the caſe of the reſt) there none may hinder them from being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<hi>viz.</hi> by ſuch as have power to baptiſe them. In the Inſtances given baptiſme
was adminiſtred either by Apoſtles or Evangeliſts, not ordinary Paſtors: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
baptiſed, if they were members of Churches, had a right to baptiſme in
their ſtate, and the Apoſtles being Officers of all Churches might diſpenſe the
ſeales to them where ever they came, which yet will not warrant ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
to do the ſame. Nor is it improbable but that all theſe were in Church-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>Aret.</hi> on <hi>Act. 18. 1.</hi> is of opinion, that the Centurion had a conſtituted
Church in his houſe;<note place="margin">Act. 8. 27.</note> the Eunuches coming to Jeruſalem to worſhip,
argueth him to be a Proſelyte, and member of the Jewiſh Church not
yet diſſolved: and therefore upon the profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith capable
of Church priviledges at that time. As for <hi>Lydia</hi> and the Gaylor it appeareth
that in the beginning of the Goſpel there was a Church at <hi>Philippi</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
with <hi>Paul</hi> as concerning giving and receiving:<note place="margin">Act. 4. 15.</note> As he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſaith, before his departure was from <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was immediately upon the Gaylors converſion. In which reſpect what
ſhould hinder that <hi>Lydia</hi> and the Gaylor ſhould firſt be joyned to the Church,
and then to be baptiſed though it be not mentioned in that ſtory? As neither
there is mention of a Chriſtian Church, which <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth in his Epiſtle
to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> At leaſt it is probable that <hi>Lydia</hi> was a member of the Jewiſh
Church, becauſe ſhe is ſaid to be one that worſhipped God. But if any man think
they were not members of any Church yet baptiſed, though we ſee not how it
will be proved, yet if it were ſo, the object doth no whit weaken the argument,
which ſpeaketh of the ordinary diſpenſation of the ſeales, and not of what was
done in an extraordinary way. So that ſuppoſe that in the caſes alledged, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
diſpenſed to ſome that were not in Church-fellowſhip, yet the examples
of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts in ſo doing will not warrant ordinary Paſtors
to do the like. The reaſon of the difference why Apoſtles and Evangeliſts might
adminiſter Baptiſme out of Church-order, whereas Paſtors and Teachers may
not, is double. 1. Becauſe their calling gave them illimited power over all men,
eſpecially Chriſtians whereſoever they came. But we do not find that ordinarie
Paſtors and Teachers can do an act of power, but onely over their own Church,
which hath called them to watch over them in the Lord. 2. Becauſe they were
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59009:36"/>
aſſiſted with an immediate direction and guidance of the holy Ghoſt, in the
places of their adminiſtration in the caſes alledged. But ordinary Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
are to walke according to ordinary rules of the Scripture in the diſpenſation
of the Seales, and not to expect immediate inſpirations and extraordinary reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
for their helpe in ſuch caſes. This difference between Apoſtles and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Church-Officers muſt needs be acknowledged, or otherwiſe a man might
from their example juſtifie Baptiſme in private houſes.</p>

               <p>THis Anſwer ſtands of many parts, wherein things doubtfull are affirmed, and
that which more weakeneth the force of the conſideration before alledged,
and the Anſwer it ſelfe, then of the reaſon whereunto it is applyed. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, If where the holy Ghoſt is given and received, and where faith is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
according to Gods ordinance, there none may hinder them from being
baptized, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſuch as have power to baptize them: Then either men that
have received the holy Ghoſt, and profeſſe the faith, be members of the Church,
or Baptiſme is not a priviledge of the Church, then it is not eſſentiall to the firſt
Inſtitution of Baptiſme, that it ſhould be diſpenced to none but ſuch as were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into Church-fellowſhip, or were ſet members of a congregationall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
Then the Apoſtles in diſpenſing the Seales unto ſuch, or commanding them
to be diſpenced, did walk according to the rules of Scripture, and upon grounds
common to them and us, <hi>viz.</hi> they admitted them unto the Sacraments who had
right and intereſt to them, according to the minde and pleaſure of the Inſtitutor,
not extraordinarily revealed, beſides the common rules, or by ſpeciall diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and prerogative excepted from the common rule, but made knowne in the
Inſtitution it ſelfe. And then the difficultie remaining is onely this, whether a
Paſtor or Teacher hath authority from Chriſt to diſpence the Seales of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to one who hath right and title to them, and doth orderly deſire that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
becauſe he is not as yet received as a ſet member of that particular ſocietie
which your practiſe in admitting of ſet members of other Congregations unto
the Seales doth manifeſtly convince. For if both have equall intereſt unto the
Seales, the Paſtor upon lawfull ſuite and requeſt hath equall authoritie to receive
the one as well as the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the particular Inſtances given, it is not probable that Baptiſme
was evermore adminiſtred by Apoſtles or Evangeliſts; For before the death of

Apoſtles nor Evangeliſts:<note place="margin">Joh 4, 2, 3. &amp; 3. 27.</note> After the death of Chriſt (not to inſiſt
upon conjectures whether any aſſiſted the Apoſtles in the baptizing

<hi>Cornelius</hi> and his family,<note place="margin">Act. 10. 48.</note> or commanded others then preſent with

                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 17.</note> the other <hi>Paul.
Paul</hi> himſelfe baptized but a few as he teſtifieth of himſelfe, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to convince that others converted by his preaching were baptized by Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,
we know not any. And if <hi>Philip, Ananias,</hi> and others might baptize ſuch
as had right and title to the Seales, being as yet no ſet members of any particular
Congregation: and a Congregation deſtitute of their proper Paſtor, may deſire
another to baptize their Infants, and diſpence the Sacrament of the Supper to
them in that their neceſſitie. And if the members of one Congregation may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
communicate in another, then may the Paſtors of particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon occaſion admit to the Seales of the Covenant ſuch known and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Chriſtians, as have right and title thereunto, and duely and orderly require
the ſame; for of all theſe the reaſon is like and perpetuall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is very improbable that the perſons baptized, were in Church-ſtate
or order. If they were members of the Jewiſh Church not yet diſſolved,
this is not to the purpoſe; for men have not right to Baptiſme, becauſe they were
members of the Jewiſh Church, but becauſe Diſciples and (as you ſay) joyned
together in Covenant, and have fellowſhip and calling of their Miniſter, who is
to diſpence the Seales unto them. And Baptiſme is the Sacrament of initiation,
not into the Jewiſh but the Chriſtian Churches. Secondly, when you ſay, <hi>the
Seales in ordinary diſpenſation are the priviledges of the Churches. There are no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
but of particular Churches. Baptiſme and the Lords Supper are to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
onely to the members of the Church. No ſocietie may lawfully deſire the Seales,
unleſſe they have joyned in the choice and calling of their Minister. Beleevers not yet
joyned in Church-order are without.</hi> Doe yee not in all theſe underſtand a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
ſocietie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Againſt</hi> B. pa. 88.</note> united in a Church-way, &amp;c. which cannot agree to
the members of the Jewiſh Church, not yet diſſolved. Thirdly,
The conſtitution of the Church (ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robin.)</hi> is the orderly collection and
conjunction of the Saints into and in the Covenant of the New Teſtament; but
the members of Jewiſh Churches not yet diſſolved, were not in ſuch conſtitution.
If the Eunuch and Centurion were proſelytes and members of the Church of the
Jewes; The Samaritanes whom <hi>Philip</hi> baptized were not ſo. And that any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
or the Gailor whom <hi>Paul</hi> baptized in the Apoſtles times, were ſet members
of a Chriſtian Aſſembly before baptized, is very ſtrange. If there was a Church
at <hi>Philippi,</hi> yet the Gailor who was baptized and converted the ſame night,
could not be a ſet member by ſolemne admiſſion before Baptiſme. It is ſaid the
Apoſtles baptized theſe perſons in an extraordinary way. But in this practiſe of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59009:37"/>
the Apoſtles two things are to be conſidered. 1. The circumſtance of the action.
2. The qualitie or ſubſtance of the act. In ſome circumſtances the baptizing of
ſome of theſe perſons might be extraordinary, but the ſubſtance and qualitie of
the action was grounded upon rules perpetuall and common to us with them.</p>
               <p>1. That is done in an extraordinary way, which by peculiar priviledge of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
is made lawfull to ſome one or few men, which is unlawfull to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
not having the ſame diſpenſation, but where the ground and reaſon of the
action is common: we muſt not conceive the thing to be done in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way by ſpeciall diſpenſation. What was done by the Apoſtles upon ſpeciall
revelation and immediate direction, beſides the ordinary and common rule, in
that wee are not to immitate or follow them, becauſe we have not their warrant.
But what they did upon reaſons and grounds reaching unto us no leſſe then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, in that we have the ſame libertie, allowance, or commandement that
they did walk by. In one and the ſame action there may be and oft is ſomething
ordinary, ſomething extraordinary or peculiar to ſpeciall times or perſons. So
it was in the Apoſtles adminiſtration of the Seales: but in every place where they
came by illimited power (as you ſpeake) they did baptize Diſciples, if they did
baptize; this was proper to them, and could not be communicated to any others
by them; For there is no paſſage of Scripture which teacheth this, that one Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
may communicate his power to another, or doe that which particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to his office by a Deputie: But that they baptized beleevers profeſſing
their faith in the Lord Jeſus, and repentance towards God, ſuch as had gladly
imbraced the Word, and received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt: this was common
to them with all Paſtors and Teachers, becauſe they did it, not by power illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or ſpeciall diſpenſation, but upon this ſtanding perpetuall reaſon, that <hi>the
promiſe was made to them and to their ſeede, and to as many as the Lord ſhall call, that
they had received the holy Ghost, and the kingdome of heaven belonged to them.</hi> And
if the grounds and reaſons of their practiſe be common reaching to us, no leſſe
then unto them, the practiſe it ſelfe was not extraordinary. To ſay nothing that
this Anſwer will not ſtand with the former; for if the parties baptized were ſet
members of particular Societies, the Apoſtles did not baptize them in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way, they did it by the guidance and direction of the Spirit, that is true,
but not by guidance of diſpenſation, or prerogative, whereby that was made
lawfull without ſuch inſpiration had been unlawfull. But they were infallibly
guided to doe that which was according to the word of God, and might ſtand
for our direction: that in caſe it be orderly deſired a Paſtor hath authoritie
in his owne Congregation, to receive knowne and approved Chriſtians to the
ſeales of the Covenant, hath been proved before. If the Apoſtles diſpenced the
ſeales onely to the Church, Diſciples, faithfull, who received the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
with gladneſſe of heart, and were partakers of the holy Ghoſt, then they
diſpenced the ſeales in an ordinary way, for ſuch have title and intereſt to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59009:37"/>
ſeales by the Inſtitution and appointment of God. And every Paſtor by his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
may and ought to diſpence the ſeales unto ſuch, within the bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of his calling: But the Apoſtles diſpenced the ſeales onely to the Church,
Diſciples, faithfull, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. An Argument followeth neceſſarily from particular example to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;
when one particular is proved by another particular, by force of the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
common to the whole kinde, under which thoſe particulars are contained:
But the practiſe of the Apoſtles in baptizing Diſciples and faithfull, by force of
ſimilitude common to the whole kinde, agreeth with the practiſe of Miniſters
receiving to Baptiſme the ſeed of the faithfull, though as yet not ſet members of
any particular ſocietie, In ſome circumſtances there may be difference when yet
the reaſon is ſtrong, if the difference be not in the very likeneſſe it ſelfe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the reaſon is grounded. One circumſtance that is materiall to the point
may overthrow the likeneſſe pretended, and twenty different circumſtances, if
they be not to the point in hand make no diſſimilitude. Now in this matter wee
ſpeake of, no circumſtance is or can be named why we ſhould thinke it lawfull
for the Apoſtles to baptize Diſciples as yet being no ſet members of particular
ſocieties, and the ſame ſhould be unlawfull in all caſes for ordinary Paſtors in
their particular Congregations, though it be deſired.</p>
               <p>3. What is done by extraordinary diſpenſation, that is lawfull for them onely
who have received ſuch diſpenſation, and by them cannot be communicated to
others. But the Apoſtles baptized by others ſeldome by themſelves, as hath
been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>4. We might urge the rule which a reverend Elder among you, giveth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> J. D. Ap.</note> 
                  <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> Thoſe examples which are backed with ſome
divine precept,<note place="margin">Sect. 12. pa. 152, 153, 154.</note> or which are held forth in the firſt Inſtitution of an
ordinance, being part of the inſtitution, or which were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
lawfull actions of holy men in Scripture, not civill but ſacred ſo binde us
to imitation, as that not to conforme thereunto is ſinne. For the Aſſumption to
this Propoſition, it is plaine and naturall: But the practiſe of the Apoſtles in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the faithfull, Diſciples, &amp;c. is backed with divine precept, held forth in
the firſt Inſtitution, and was their conſtant lawfull practiſe, agreeable to the
practiſe of all others who were imployed in that ſervice; <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. In the firſt conſideration, you prove the Seales to be the priviledge of the
Church in ordinary diſpenſation, by this paſſage of Scripture, <hi>Then they that
gladly received the Word were baptized:</hi> but if Apoſtles baptize by extraordinary
diſpenſation in your ſenſe this teſtimony is inſufficient for that purpoſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>2 Reaſon.</head>
               <p>OUr ſecond reaſon. In due order, the Seales belong to them to whom the
grant is given, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſme to the ſeed of the faithfull, and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to beleevers, able to try and examine themſelves: But the grant is vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59009:38"/>
to the faithfull and their ſeed, forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, ſanctification, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and what other good things are promiſed in the covenant of grace are the
grant or good things ſealed in the Sacrament. But thoſe are granted to beleevers
according to the covenant; and they are ſo linked together, that under one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
all are underſtood; and if one be vouchſafed, none is denied. When God
promiſeth to circumciſe the heart, the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes is implyed. And
when Circumciſion is ſaid to be the Seale of the righteouſneſſe of
faith,<note place="margin">Deut. 30. 6.</note> the circumciſion of the heart by ſpirituall regeneration is
included.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> To whomſoever then the ſpirituall gift, or inward grace
of the covenant is given and granted,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> to them the Seales of that
gift and grant doth belong in their due order.<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 11, 12 and 26. 4.</note> But the ſpirituall
gift or grace which is the thing ſignified in the Sacrament, is freely
granted to true beleevers, who have received the doctrine of ſalvation, and walk
in the wayes of truth and righteouſneſſe, therefore the priviledges of the Seales
belong unto them. To this you anſwer.</p>
               <p>The ſcope of the Apoſtle in the place, <hi>Rom. 4. 11.</hi> is not to define a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor to ſhew what is the proper and adequate ſubject of the Sacrament; but
to prove by the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> that a ſinner is juſtified before God, not
by works but by faith. Thus as <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithfull was juſtified
before God, ſo muſt his ſeed be (that is, all beleevers whether Jews or Gentiles,
circumciſed or uncircumciſed) for therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> received circumciſion
which belonged to the Jews to confirm the righteouſneſſe which he had before,
while he was uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of both: but leſt any
one ſhould think his circumciſion was needleſſe if he was juſtified by faith before
circumciſion; he addeth that his circumciſion was of no uſe as a ſeale to confirme
to him his faith, and the righteouſneſſe which is by faith: yet as Juſtification is
not the onely thing that Circumciſion ſealed, but the whole Covenant alſo made
with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed was ſealed thereby; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be conſidered
in uſing circumciſion not ſimply, or onely as a beleever without Church relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but as a confederate beleever, and ſo in the ſtate and order of a viſible
Church. Though the Apoſtle maketh mention of the righteouſneſſe of faith as
ſealed thereby, which was not that which ſerved for his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now that Circumciſion alſo ſealed the Church-Covenant, may appear from
<hi>Gen. 17. 9. 10, 11.</hi> where you may find that <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
were not circumciſed till God called them into Church-Covenant; and
there is the ſame reaſon &amp; uſe of Baptiſme to us which ſerveth to ſeal our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
as circumciſion did,<note place="margin">Act 2. 38.</note> yet not that alone, but alſo the whole
covenant with all the priviledges of it,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 26. 27.</note> as Adoption, Sanctification,
and fellowſhip with Chriſt in affections,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 5.</note> and the ſalvation of our
ſouls,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 23.</note> and the reſurrection of our bodies. And not onely the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace which is common to all beleevers:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> but Church-Covenant
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59009:38"/>
alſo which is peculiar to confederates.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 19.</note> According to
that of the Apoſtle, <hi>By one Spirit we are baptized into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. And
by one bodie he meaneth that particular Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> whereunto he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and ſaith, <hi>Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular,</hi> ver. 27.
And <hi>ergo</hi> Church-memberſhip is required as well to the orderly partaking of
Baptiſme as it was of Circumciſion. Nor do we find that circumciſion was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
to all that were in the Covenant of grace (as all beleevers were) but
onely to ſuch of them as were joyned to the people of the God of <hi>Abraham.
Melchizedech</hi> was under the covenant of grace, ſo was <hi>Lot,</hi> ſo was <hi>Job</hi> and his
foure friends; yet we no where read that they were circumciſed, nor do beleeve
they were. So that if Circumciſion was adminiſtred to none but thoſe that were
joyned together in <hi>Abrahams</hi> familie, and to the Church of God in his ſeed,
then may not baptiſme in ordinarie courſe be adminiſtred to any beleevers now,
unleſſe they be joyned to the Church of Chriſt, for <hi>parum par eſt ratio.</hi> But the
firſt is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ſecond alſo.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Reply.</head>
               <p>THe particulars in this Anſwer hath been examined alreadie, and might have
well been paſſed over, becauſe it is tedious to repeat the ſame things againe
and againe. Two things are affirmed by you.</p>
               <p>1. That the ſcope of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 4. 11.</hi> was not to define a Sacrament,
nor to ſhew what was the proper and adequate ſubject of a Sacrament. But this
weakneth no part of the argument, for if the Apoſtle do not fully define a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor mention every particular benefit or prerogative ſealed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet he ſheweth ſufficiently to whom the Sacraments in due order do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine,
even to the heires of ſalvation, to them that are juſtified by faith, and
walk in the ſteps of our Father <hi>Abraham.</hi> And thus we argue from the text of
the Apoſtle. They that are partakers of the good things ſealed in the Sacrament,
to them belong the Seales of the Covenant, according to Gods Inſtitution. But
they that are juſtified by faith are partakers of the good things ſealed in the
Sacrament, to them belong the Seales of the Covenant according to Gods inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
If Juſtification be not the onely thing that Circumciſion ſealed, this is
nothing to the point in hand. For the gifts of the holy Ghoſt is not the onely
thing that is ſealed in Baptiſme: But you confeſſe in your Anſwer immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
going before, that they have right to baptiſme who have received the holy
Ghoſt; and the reaſon is the ſame of Juſtification. Beſides if Juſtification be
not the onely thing that is ſealed in the Sacrament, it is one principall thing
which doth inferre the reſt. For the bleſſings of the covenant of grace in Chriſt
are inſeparable; where one is named, others are implyed: and where one is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
no one is abſolutely wanting.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt is made of God wiſedome,
righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption:</hi> whom God doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59009:39"/>
them he doth ſanctifie, and them he will glorifie.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond thing you affirme is, that not onely the covenant of grace
which is common to all beleevers; but Church-Covenant alſo which is peculiar
to confederates is neceſſarie to the participation of the Seales. This ſenſe your
words muſt beare, or elſe they reach not the point in hand: but this is that which
ſhould be proved ſubſtantially, and not barely affirmed; and which (as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
is contrary to the firſt Inſtitution of the Sacrament, and the lawfull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, our Saviour Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and all others who
are recorded lawfully to adminiſter the Seales. In <hi>Gen. 17.</hi> we find the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of circumciſion recorded, and that it was the ſeale of the Covenant to
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, to them that were borne in his houſe, or bought with his
money: but we find no mention of any Church Covenant beſides the covenant
of promiſe which God made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> There is no mention of any
Church-order into which <hi>Abrahams</hi> family was now gathered more then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
God gave circumciſion to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed as a ſeale of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of faith; but that this family was firſt gathered into Church-order as
you ſpeak we cannot beleeve, becauſe the Scripture ſaith it not whether <hi>Lot,
Job, Melchizedech</hi> were circumciſed or not, we will not diſpute; but if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
not the ſeale, we cannot think the reaſon to be becauſe they were not in
Church-order as thoſe times required, if any ſuch thing had been required, we
cannot think that either they were ignorant of it, or that they walked againſt
their light: But according to the diſpenſing of thoſe times we judge as they were
viſible beleevers, ſo they walked in that Church-fellowſhip which God preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
and therefore if circumciſion had been the ſeale of ſuch Church-Covenant
as you conceive, it ſhould have been given to them no leſſe then to <hi>Abrahams</hi>
family. But of this ſufficient is ſaid before. As for Baptiſme it is the ſeal of the
whole Covenant, which the paſſages quoted prove it to be. Whether it be the
ſeale of our fellowſhip which Chriſt in affliction, and the reſurrection of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
we leave it to your conſideration: but that it ſhould be a Seal of a Church-Covenant
which is peculiar to confederates, that to us is very ſtrange. That it is
a ſolemne admiſſion into the Church of Chriſt, and that of neceſſitie it muſt be
adminiſtred in a particular ſocietie (though in the paſſage to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the
myſticall bodie of Chriſt be underſtood) will eaſily be granted. But that it is the
ſeale of any other covenant but the covenant of grace we cannot digeſt.</p>
               <p>The Sacraments are of God, and we muſt learne of God for what end and
uſe they were ordained. But by the Inſtitution or Baptiſme recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we have learned it belongeth to the faithfull, to diſciples, to them that are
called of God: and as for any other covenant neceſſarie to the right participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Seales, there is deep ſilence of it in the Inſtitution, in the lawfull and
approved practiſe of the firſt diſpenſers of theſe ſacred myſteries. Enough hath
been ſaid to this matter alreadie, but we will conclude it with the words of that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59009:39"/>
reverend Author whom we have cited many times before upon occaſion. <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>John the Baptiſt walked in the ſame ſteps, and by the ſame rule ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
baptiſme in the Church whereof he was a member,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 3. 6. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>required of
all that came to his baptiſme a profeſſion of repentance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 1. 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and amendment
of life for remiſſion of ſinnes whereof baptiſme was a ſeale,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 3 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and preached
Chriſt to them.</hi> This order our Lord Jeſus Chriſt after his reſurrection eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to continue in the Chriſtian Churches,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19, 20.</note> giving a commiſſion to
his Diſciples to preach the Goſpel to the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Mar. 16. 15, 16.</note> and to gather
all ſuch as ſhould beleeve through the world, as a teſtimonie to
them, that the righteouſneſſe of faith did belong to them alſo, and not to the
Church of the Jews onely. Accordingly the Apoſtles and ſervants of Chriſt
were carefull to obſerve this rule in their adminiſtring baptiſme. Thus <hi>Peter</hi>
when he ſaw thoſe three thouſand ſouls pricked in their hearts, preached unto
them concerning repentance,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 37. 47.</note> remiſſion of ſin, Chriſt, the promiſe,
baptiſme, faith, amendment of life, baptiſed thoſe that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his word, and teſtified the ſame by joyning together in the profeſſion
thereof.<note place="margin">Act. 8. 12. 14.</note> The ſame courſe <hi>Philip</hi> took with the Church that was
gathered in Samaria, where many were baptized, but none till they
profeſſed their beliefe of the Goſpel, and their receiving of the Word of God.
And therefore it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>When they beleeved Philip preaching the things
concerning the kingdome of God, and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptiſed
both men and women.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act 9. 11-17.</note> When <hi>Ananias</hi> was commanded to go and
baptiſe <hi>Paul,</hi> he objected againſt it at firſt, till the Lord aſſured
him that he was one to whom the Seale of the Covenant belonged, and then he
went and did it.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> and thoſe that came with him ſaw that the holy Ghoſt fell on
<hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 10. 43-48.</note> and thoſe that were aſſembled at that time in his houſe,
whileſt he ſpake theſe words, <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe,
that through the Name of Jeſus whoſoever beleeveth on him ſhall receive remiſſion of
ſinnes. Peter</hi> demanded, <hi>Can any man forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptiſed,
which have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> In this catalogue we ſee profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of faith and repentance required in them that were admitted to partake in
the ſeals; but there is not a word of Church-Covenant, either in the Inſtitution
or adminiſtration of the Seales before they were admitted to them. That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
are ſolemnly ingrafted into the body of Chriſt, and into particular Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by the Seales, is a truth acknowledged on all ſides: but that ever it was dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
neceſſarie, that a Chriſtian ſhould be a ſet member of a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall
Church before he were admitted to the Seales, or that by divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
any ſuch thing is ordained as neceſſarie thereunto, that upon the grounds
before mentioned we denie, and cannot account it leſſe then an addition to the
inſtitution. For if the Sacraments be ſeales of the Covenant of grace, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59009:40"/>
baptiſme by divine Inſtitution belong to Diſciples, faithfull, Saints, who have
gladly received the Word of grace, are juſtified by faith, ſanctified by the Spirit,
adopted to be the children of God by grace, and heires apparent to the kingdom
of heaven; then to debarre ſuch from the Seales, and their ſeed from Baptiſme,
becauſe they be not in Church-Covenant (as you ſpeake) is an addition to the
ordinance of grace, and many wayes injurious to the people of God.</p>

hereunto is alſo our practiſe, and wee hope your judgement and ours are not

that what the Major part doth allow that muſt be done, though the Paſtors

Our Anſwer is Negative, <hi>viz.</hi> that the power of Excommunication is not ſealed
in the Congregation, neither ought it to be ſo in any of the Churches of the
Lord Jeſus, who ought not to carry matters by number of votes againſt God,
as this Poſition implyeth, but by ſtrength of rule and reaſon according to God.
The power of the Apoſtles was not to doe things againſt the truth but for the
truth, <hi>2 Cor. 13. 8</hi> and not for deſtruction, but for edification, <hi>2 Cor. 10. 8.</hi>
And the ſame may be ſaid concerning the power which God hath given to the
Church, and if any Church among us have ſwerved from the rule (which is more
then we know) we doe not allow them in ſuch a practiſe, but ſhould be ready as
the Lord ſhould helpe to convince them of their ſin therein.</p>

But the communicated power of the keyes with the

the Church, or tooke it effect after the Churches were planted and eſtabliſhed by
the Apoſtles. Not the firſt, for then the Apoſtles themſelves ſhould derive their
power from the communitie and ſocietie of the faithfull,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 1.</note> which
they did not,<note place="margin">Ioh 21. 22.</note> but from Chriſt immediately, both in reſpect of gifts

               <p>It is ſaid the power of the keyes given to the Apoſtles was given to the Church,
<hi>In tuitu ejuſdem tanquam finis &amp; totius.</hi> And it is true the Apoſtles were given to
the Church, and the power they received was for the good of the whole; but
this is not enough. That power may be ſaid to be received immediately by the
Church, as the firſt receptacle of it, and from it derived to others. But this power
muſt be in the communitie as the firſt ſubject, from whom it commeth to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.
As the power of ſeeing is not onely given <hi>in tuitu hominis,</hi> as the end of it,

Chriſt for a gift to the Church, but not for a gift ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,

After the Churches were eſtabliſhed it tooke not effect; for then it muſt be
ſhewed where Chriſt committed the power of God, firſt to the Apoſtles, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the communitie of the faithfull. But that is no where to be found in holy

of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 8. 11.</note> from whom immediately they derive their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

Yea, Paſtorſhip is the gift of Chriſt no leſſe then Apoſtleſhip, and that the more
becauſe it is perpetuall in the Church; every Paſtor is not immediately called,

from the Church as the immediate receptacle. Thus Proteſtant Divines

by mandate, miſſion, and commiſſion from him, then
they derive it not from the Pope. And if Presbyters
receive their order juriſdiction and power of execution from Chriſt by his
mandate and Commiſſion, then they receive it not from the Biſhop. And by the
ſame reaſon, if the power of the keyes be the immediate gift of Chriſt to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
then they derive not their power and authoritie from the people. It is
uſually objected that the Church cannot convey what ſhe never had, but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may Elect their Paſtor. Whereunto the anſwer is direct and plaine. Nothing
can give that which it had not formally or virtually, unleſſe it give it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
miniſtring to one who hath it, but ſo it may give what it never had,
nor is capable of. A Steward may give all the offices in his Maſters houſe, as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterially
executing his Maſters pleaſure. Electors have not evermore authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
over him whom they elect: but power and authoritie onely to apply that
power to him whom they chooſe. The power and authoritie whereunto a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
is elected, is not in the people that elect him, but from Chriſt the King and
head of his Church, who out of power doth conferre that office upon him. If we

               <p>3. If Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall power be in the multitude and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59009:42"/>
community of the faithfull, the Church doth not onely call, but make Officers
out of power and vertue received into her ſelfe, and then ſhould the Church have
a true lordlike power in regard of her Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Church the Officers are the Miniſters of the people, whoſe ſervice the people is to uſe for adminiſtration and executing their judgements, that is, pronouncing the judgement of the Church (and of God firſt) againſt the obſtinate. <hi>Rob.</hi> againſt <hi>Ber. p. 136.</hi> The Officers in the Church are both Chriſts and the peoples Servants and Miniſters. <hi>Id. p. 165.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as he that will derive authority to the Church maketh himſelfe Lord of
the Church: ſo if the Church derive authoritie to the Miniſters of Chriſt, ſhe
maketh herſelf Lady and Miſtris over them in the exerciſe of that authoritie over
them. For all men know it is the property of the Lord and Maſter to impart au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.
Did the Church give power and authoritie to the Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
ſhe might make the Sacraments and preaching which one doth in order no
Sacraments, no preaching. For it is the order inſtituted of God that gives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and efficacie to theſe ordinances. And if the power of ruling, feeding, and
diſpenſing the holy things of God, do reſide in the faithfull, the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
in reſpect of diſpenſation and efficacie ſhall depend upon the order and
inſtitution of the Societie. If the power of the keyes be derived from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of the faithfull, then are Officers immediately and formally ſervants to
the Church, and muſt do every thing in the name of the Church, Rule, feed,
bind, looſe, remit and retaine ſinnes, preach and adminiſter the Sacraments, then
they muſt performe their Office according to the direction of the Church more

For from
whom are they to receive direction how to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their Office but from him or them from whom
they receive their Office, whoſe works they do, and from
whom they expect their reward? If their power and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
be of God immediately, they muſt do the duties of their
place according to his deſignement, and to be accountable
unto God: But if their power and function be from the
Church, the Church muſt give account unto God, and the
Officers unto the Church whom ſhe doth take to be her helpers.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that God will have the Church to chuſe Officers to execute the
power committed unto her. The anſwer is, either God will have her elect offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of his deſignement to do his work according to that power which he ſhall
give them, and by his direction, and then they are Gods ſervants, and not the
Churches, and receive their charge and function immediately from God, and
not from the people: or he leaveth it to the arbitriment of the Church, to chuſe
according to their pleaſure ſuch as muſt receive charge and authoritie from her.
And then they muſt execute their office in her name ſo as ſhall ſeeme good unto
the Church, and neither longer nor otherwiſe. For if the Miniſters of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59009:42"/>
Church be ſubject to God and Chriſt by the intervention of the people onely,
they have it from them, and not from God: but they preach or adminiſter the
Sacraments, rule, or feed, and if they depend immediately upon the faithfull,
<hi>viz.</hi> two or three gathered together in covenant, they muſt draw what in order
they are to preach unto them in the name of the Lord;<note place="margin">Omnis legatus in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sâ legationis ſuae im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatè pendet ab eo à quo mittitur, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumento mandato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in corrupto eſt indelebilis.</note> For

                  </note> confeſſions and reaſons of ſuch as maintaine this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the officers of Chriſt be both of and for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and that in relation as the officers are called ſervants,
the Church may be called Lord.</p>
               <p>4. Moreover if the power of the keyes be given firſt and immediately to the
community of the faithfull, what reaſon can be alledged why in defect of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
the Church might not rule, governe, feed, bind, looſe, preach and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the Sacraments, or if any faile in any office, why ſhe might not ſupply that
want by her power. For the power of the keyes doth containe, both authority
and exerciſe, power being given to this end, that it might be exerciſed as it is
vouchſafed. But the Church when ſhe is deſtitute of Officers, cannot exerciſe
thoſe acts of rule, nor by her power ſupply the want of any Officer. Onely ſhe
hath a miniſtery of calling one whom Chriſt hath deſcribed, that from Chriſt he
may have power of office given him in the vacant place. For theſe reaſons (not
to inſiſt on any more) we judge the multitude or community of the faithfull not
to be the immediate receptacle of Eccleſiaſticall authoritie, and ſo the power of
excommunication not to belong to them. If conſent of the Churches of God
be asked in this point (to omit others) the Churches of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſpeake fully
and expreſly for us, in the ſecond book of <hi>Diſci. cap. 1. The Church as it is taken
for them that exerciſe ſpirituall functions in the congregation of them that profeſſe the
truth, hath a certain power granted by God according to which, it uſeth a proper Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
and government exerciſed to the comfort of the whole flocke. Power is an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
authority granted by God the Father through the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt
unto his Kirke, gathered, and having its ground in the word of God, and to be put in
execution by them unto whom the ſpirituall government of the Church by lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is committed. The policie of the Kirke flowing from this power is an order or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
forme of government which is exerciſed by the members appointed thereto by
the Word of God, and therefore is given immediately to the office-bearers by whom
it is exerciſed to the weale of the whole body.</hi>

               <head>Anſwer.</head>
               <p>OUr Anſwer hereto is briefly this. We judge it expedient and moſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to rule, that ſuch brethren as are in covenant with the Church, and
ours as fellow-members, and have committed their ſoules to our charge as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
ſhould not forſake our fellowſhip, nor obruptly breake away from us
when and whither they pleaſe; but firſt approve themſelves therein to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
conſciences, and take their counſell in ſo weightie a matter. For which
we propound to conſider theſe two reaſons following. The former is drawne
from the nature of the Church-Covenant, which conſiſts in theſe foure parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>1. Every member at his admiſſion doth openly profeſſe, and ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
that by Chriſts helpe aſſiſting, he will not onely in generall give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
(as to the Lord to be guided by him, ſo) to the Church according to God
to be directed by it, which is no more then the members of the Church of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
did in a parallel caſe, <hi>2 Cor. 8. 5.</hi> but alſo in particular, that he will
performe all duties of brotherly love and faithfulneſſe to all the members of the
body, as of diligent watchfulneſſe over all his brethren, thereby to prevent ſin,
ſo of faithfull admonition after their falls to regaine them to the Lord, from
their ſinne, the former being injoyned, <hi>Hebr. 3. 13.</hi> And the want thereof deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemned in <hi>Cain,</hi> that would not acknowledge that duty of being his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
keeper, <hi>Gen. 4. 9.</hi> the latter given in charge to the Church-members of
Iſrael by the hand of <hi>Moſes, Levit. 19. 17.</hi> and ſo by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Matth.
18 15</hi> And by <hi>Paul</hi> alſo to the <hi>Galat. c. 6. 1, 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the ingagements are not made onely by the members admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, but by the Church back again to the member. So that thereby
the whole Church in generall, and every member thereof in particular, ſtand as
well in conſcience bound to performe all duties of love and watchfulneſſe to
him, as he doth to them; And this we do according to the golden rule of love
and equitie injoyned by our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 7. 12.</hi> fearing that contrary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of Scribes and Phariſees ſo much condemned by Chriſt, of laying greater
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59009:43"/>
burthens upon others, then we our ſelves are willing to undergo. <hi>Matth. 23. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Theſe promiſes thus lawfully and mutually made, that member, as alſo the
whole Church, are bound not onely every one for himſelfe, actively to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
them, but paſſively alſo to ſuffer his brethren to do thoſe offices upon and
towards himſelf: If he neglect the former, he ſhall falſifie his covenant ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before God, Angels, and men made, and ſo not onely breake promiſe to
his brother, contrary to <hi>Pſal. 15. 4.</hi> but alſo in ſome ſort commit the ſinne of
<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> in lying againſt the holy Ghoſt, condemned and puniſhed
ſeverely by Gods own hand, <hi>Act. 5. 3. 5. 10.</hi> If he faile in the latter, he ſhall not
onely be guiltie of the ſame ſinne of breach of Covenant with God and man as
in the former; but ſhall alſo be guilty of this folly of deſpiſing counſell ſo much
condemned, <hi>Prov. 12. 15.</hi> and 1. 7. and ſhall alſo proclaime this his folly and
pride by ſhewing to all the Church that he is wiſe in his own eyes, and leanes to
his own wiſedome both reproved, <hi>Prov. 3. 7.</hi> and 23. 4. Seeing need of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
light to be held forth by his brethren, then what he apprehends himſelfe,
which is one of the greateſt properties of folly.</p>
               <p>4. From all theſe things premiſed, it appears that we can do no leſſe (and yet
we do no more) then require a member before he depart according to our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
thus lawfully, deliberately, and mutually made, to expreſſe to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
his deſire of departing, and the place and ſocietie to which he tends, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to a godly Church where he may be edified; or to ſome corrupt Aſſembly
where he may be deſtroyed. And 2. his grounds and reaſons which move him ſo
to do, which if they hold good being ſcanned by the Word, he may be not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirmed in his way by the conſent and adviſe of many, but counſelled alſo
how to manage his departure for his beſt comfort. And ſo after all, ſolemnly
with the whole Churches prayers, and bleſſings in the name of Chriſt diſmiſſed:
But if his grounds either be none at all, or weake and ſinfull, and that his deſire of
departing ſavours of ſelf-will, inordinate love of gaine, raſh precipitancie, or a
ſpirit of ſchiſme, more ſtrongly then of ſound reaſon, then what can we do leſſe
without breach of Covenant, then in love and tenderneſſe ſhew him his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
diſſwade him from his purpoſe, and refuſe to conſent. Yet if after all this
we ſee his ſpirit ſtedfaſtly and ſtiffely bent for a departure, then though we dare
not act againſt our light by conſenting or counſelling, yet if his ſinne be not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
and danger eminent, we uſe rather (through indulgence in caſes of like
nature) to ſuſpend our vote againſt him, as not willing againſt his will to detain
him, abhorring to make our Churches places of reſtraint and impriſonment.
But if any ſhould object that this argument holds firme where this Church-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is allowed to be lawfull, but with ſome it is queſtioned, and with them it
avails not. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Some indeed have queſtioned the neceſſitie of our Church-Covenant,
but none (we hope) of theſe our reverend brethren that we write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
do queſtion the lawfulneſſe of ſuch a Covenant being nothing elſe for the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59009:44"/>
matter of it, but a promiſe of doing ſuch Chriſtian duties as the Goſpel of Chriſt
requires of all Saints in Church eſtate; for we doe not herein promiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
any new dutie to our brethren which was not before commanded us of
the Lord, but onely revive and renew our purpoſes afreſh of performing ſuch
duties unto that particular body into which we are then incorporated as were
before injoyned in the Word, as to love each other, and to watch over each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of love for their good, to be ready to give counſell to, and to take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
from each other,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 1.</note> to prevent ſinne in them, or to gaine them from
ſinne.<note place="margin">Pro. 12. 19. &amp; 1. 7. 23.</note> All which are plentifully and frequently held forth in the
Scriptures; for the defect of which care and watchfulneſſe, all the
body ſhall be wrapt in the ſame guilt &amp; puniſhment with the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that commits the ſinne,<note place="margin">Gen 4. 4. 9.</note> as the whole Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in
<hi>Achans</hi> ſinne and puniſhment.<note place="margin">Levit. 19. 17.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 15.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Its a thing very reaſonable, and a knowne fundamentall rule in all
ſocieties, that he that is incorporate thereto, and ſo participates of the priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
thereof, ſhould ingage himſelfe to conforme to all ſuch lawfull rites and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
as are expedient for the well-being of that ſocietie, the contrary whereto
will be a thing injurious in him to offer, and confuſion to themſelves to accept.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground is drawne from the neceſſitie that may fall upon the body
if every particular member ſhould depart at his owne pleaſure. For as every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie,
ſo much more a Church of Saints, both from principles of nature and
Chriſtianitie alſo, not onely lawfully may, but in dutie are bound to endeavour
the preſervation of it ſelfe, and <hi>Ergo</hi> timely to foreſee and wiſely to prevent all
ſuch things as would bring deſtruction to it ſelfe. Now if any member might,
when, whither, and wherefore he pleaſe without conſent of the Church depart
away from it, this may by unavoydable conſequence diſſipate the whole; for if
one man may ſo depart, why may not another alſo, though never ſo uſefull in
that body, and whoſe abſence might much ſhake the well-being of it: and if one
why not two, ſix, ten, twentie as well? For where will yee ſtop ſeeing any may
plead the ſame libertie, and if members may ſo doe why not the Paſtor and
Teacher alſo? Seeing they are tyed to him by the ſame relation that he is to them,
and ſo the principalls falling, the whole building muſt downe: and if this may
be ſo in one Church, why not in all, and ſo Chriſt ſhould have no ſetled Church
on earth.</p>

               <p>IT is one thing abruptly to breake away when and whither they pleaſe, and
forſake fellowſhip, another thing not to depart or remove habitation, unleſſe
the Congregation will give leave. Alſo it is one thing mutually to compound
and agree not to depart from each other without conſent and approbation,
another to require a promiſe of all that be admitted into ſocietie, that they ſhall
not depart without the Churches allowance. If ſuch a promiſe be required of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59009:44"/>
all members to be admitted, we cannot diſcerne upon what grounds your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
is warranted. Firſt, you exclude all ſuch as be not ſet members from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Supper, and their children from Baptiſme, and yet hinder them
from entrance into Church ſocietie, becauſe they cannot promiſe continuance
in the place where they are reſident for the preſent. Here we deſire to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from the word of God by what you require it. Did the Apoſtles ever ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
with ſuch as deſired to be baptized, that they muſt abide in particular ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and not remove thence without approbation from the Church? or did they
deny the ſeales unto them, becauſe they could not make any ſuch promiſe?
Was it ever heard of in the Church of God from the beginning thereof unto this
day, that any ſuch thing was propounded unto, or required of, members to be
admitted into Church-fellowſhip? That Church Covenant which is neceſſary
was not in uſe in the Apoſtles times, but the Covenant they entred into bound
no man to this condition for ought we reade. They did not preſcribe it, no
Church ever yet covenanted it as neceſſary to the preſervation of the body.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It pertaines not to the whole Congregation to take notice of, be
acquainted with, or judge of the cauſe of every particular members removall.
May not a ſervant remove from his Maſter to another Congregation? or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beſtow his ſonne or daughter in marriage to one of another Congregation,
but the whole Church muſt be called to counſell in this matter? If the Aſſembly
once grow to be populous, of neceſſitie they muſt be negligent in, or weary of
ſuch an heavy taske; and for the preſent, for every one to challenge ſo much au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
over other is uſurpation. Let it be ſhewed that ever by divine right this
power was committed to the Church, and then we will confeſſe it to be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and neceſſary. But till then we thinke the Church is over ridged in exacting
ſuch a condition of the members, and the members themſelves goe beyond their
meaſure as buſi-bodies in other mens matters, and things whereof they are not
well able to judge many times, if they arrogate ſuch power unto themſelves wee
allow not raſhneſſe, or precipitancy, pride or ſelf-conceitedneſſe, we know it is
meete that weightie matters ſhould be mannaged by Councell, but it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to bring every particular thing to the whole Church. <hi>In the multitude
of Councellors there is peace,</hi> but over many Councellors oft cauſeth diſtraction,
and different apprehenſions breed delayes. The nature of your Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
as you deſcribe it, inferreth not a neceſſitie of bringing every ſuch buſineſſe
unto the Church; for you binde your ſelves mutually to watch over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in love to admoniſh one another in the Lord, to prevent ſinne and to
encourage in well-doing, as it concerneth every man within the limits of his
place and calling. But this eſſentially tyeth not any man to a perpetuall reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in one place, for then even occaſionall abſence ſhould be a breach of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
unleſſe it be by conſent and approbation of the Church.</p>
               <p>You ſay in your Covenant you promiſe to performe no new dutie to your
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59009:45"/>
brethren which was not before commanded of the Lord, but onely revive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
your purpoſes afreſh of performing ſuch duties to that particular body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which you are then to be incorporated, as were before injoyned in the Word.
But in the word of truth, it is not commanded either expreſly or by conſequent,
that no member of a Congregation ſhould remove, or occaſionally be abſent
from the place of his habitation, before he have acquainted the Church whither
he goeth, and upon what occaſions, and whether the place be dangerous, where
he is likely to be infected; or ſafe, where he may be edified. Theſe things are
matters of weight and to be undertaken with advice, but the knowledge thereof
belongeth not to every particular member of the ſocietie. And the Church ſhall
burden her ſelfe above meaſure if ſhe take upon her to intermeddle in all ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.
Neither is it ſafe to commit the determination of ſuch matters ever to
the vote of the multitude, or weight of reaſons, as they ſhall apprehend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And if ſuch buſineſſe muſt be determined on the Lords day, and to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the adminiſtration of the Word,<note place="margin">Rob. <hi>ag.</hi> Bern. pa. 230.</note> Sacraments, and almes, leaſt
the holy things be polluted by notorious obſtinate offenders, wee
feare the time appointed for the exerciſe of Religion ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned
with unſeaſonable diſputes. Inſtances might be alledged, if it were a
matter to be inſiſted upon.</p>
               <p>As for the Covenant it ſelfe which you mutually enter into, if therein you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
nothing but what God requires both for tryall and ſtipulation, far be it that
we ſhould diſallow it, but if yee conſtraine men to meddle with things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
not to them, and winde them up higher then God would, and ſtraine every
thing to the pitch that you ſeeme here to doe in this branch a godly and ſober
minde may well pauſe before he make ſuch promiſe. All members of the Church
are not equally neceſſary to the preſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the whole body; &amp; if to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
of ſome, it were expedient to have the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent, not only of the whole ſociety,
but of neighbouring ſocieties, Miniſters eſpecially, it is very much to draw this
to the removall or abode of every particular member. And if any man ſhall not
intermeddle with every buſineſſe of this kinde, as queſtioning whether it doth
belong to him or no, or not aske the advice of the whole ſocietie, as knowing
the moſt to be unfit to counſell in ſuch a caſe, doth he break his Covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and ſo commit a ſinne in a ſort like the ſinne of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira?</hi> Judge
your ſelves if in other caſes you would not cenſure this to be an high incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon Chriſtian libertie, and a ſtrict binding of mens conſciences by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
conſtitutions. May you not expect to heare from your own grounds that
herein you have deviſed an expedient, or neceſſary rite or cuſtome to preſerve
the unitie, and prevent the diſſolution of the body, which never came into the
minde of the Lord Jeſus, the Saviour of the Church, and that in ſo doing (if
your expoſition will hold good) you breake the ſecond Commandement.
Rites and cuſtomes expedient to prevent confuſion for the time, let them be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59009:45"/>
as cuſtomes expedient, and what God requires in the examination or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of members, let that take place according to the preſidents given in the
Scriptures, and the conſtant practiſe of the univerſall Church in the pureſt times.
But to preſſe cuſtomes onely expedient for the time, as ſtanding rules neceſſary
at all times, and for all perſons, to put that authoritie into the hands of men
which God never put upon them, to oblige men to intermeddle further in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of men, then the Word doth warrant, to binde the conſcience, and that
under ſo heavy a penalty as the ſinne of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> where God hath
not bound it, and to debarre known and approved Chriſtians from the Seales of
the Covenant, becauſe they cannot promiſe as ſetled members to abide and ſtay
in the ſocietie, unleſſe they ſhall obtaine leave of the Congregation to depart,
and to charge them in the meane ſeaſon to be men, who againſt light refuſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the Goſpel; this is that which we cannot approve, which yet wee ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
will follow from your judgement, and deſire to be reſolved of in your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.
And here we intreat leave to put you in minde of that which you have
conſidered already, <hi>ſchil.</hi> That the Church and every member thereof hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into Covenant, either expreſly or implicitely to take God for their God,
and to keepe the words of the Covenant and doe them,<note place="margin">Exod. 24. 37.</note> to ſeeke the
Lord with all their hearts,<note place="margin">Deut. 2. 14. &amp; 4. 3. 4. &amp; 9. 7.</note> and to walke before him in truth and

of the worke of grace wrought in their ſoules, or that the
whole Congregation were appointed to be Judge thereof.<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 6. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>You ſtand

that <hi>Iſrael</hi> after ſome grievous fall and revolt,<note place="margin">Joſh 24. 1. 14. 23, 24, 25.</note> renewed their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,

<hi>Joaſh, Joſiah,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah, &amp;c.</hi> But no particular enquiry was

of every ſingular perſon.<note place="margin">2 Chr. 15. 12.</note> But the confeſſion and profeſſion of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
was taken.<note place="margin">2 Kin. 11. 17. &amp; 23. 3.</note> When <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> began to preach the Goſpel,

It appeareth many wayes that when the Apoſtles planted
Churches, they made a Covenant between God and the people
whom they received. But they received men upon the profeſſion of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59009:46"/>
faith, and promiſe of amendment of life, without ſtrict inquirie what ſound
work of grace was wrought in the ſoul. In after ages, ſtrangers from the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
were firſt inſtructed in the faith, and then baptiſed upon the profeſſion of
faith, and promiſe to walk according to the covenant of grace. Now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
at firſt required of all that were received to baptiſme was that
they beleeved in the Father,<note place="margin">Act. 8. 37.</note> Sonne, and holy Ghoſt. This was the
confeſſion of the Eunuch when he was baptiſed, <hi>I beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt is the
Sonne of God.</hi> The Creed is honoured of the ancients with glorious titles, as the
rule of faith, the ſumme of faith, the body of faith, the perſwaſions of faith:
but by the Creed they underſtand that rule of faith, and law of faith, and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Chriſt which was then given when he was about to aſcend into heaven,
and commanded his diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Go teach all Nations, &amp;c.</hi> It is true, that in
after times as occaſion required ſome other Articles were added as explanations
of the former, to meet with the hereſies of the times which began to trouble the
Church. But for ſubſtance of matter in things to be beleeved, the Church never
required other acknowledgement of them that were to be received into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of Chriſts flock, and admitted into her communion. And for things
to be done, or the practicall part, ſhe requireth of them that were to be received
to baptiſme an abrenuntiation of the devill, the world, and the fleſh, with all
their ſinfull works and luſts.</p>
               <p>The firſt principles then of the doctrine of Chriſt being received, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
profeſſion being made, the Apoſtles, and the Church following the example
of the Apoſtles, never denied baptiſme unto ſuch as ſought or deſired it. If this
be the Covenant that members admitted into Church-fellowſhip do enter into,
and this be all you require of them whom you receive, you have the practiſe of
the Apoſtles, and the whole Church in after ages for your preſident. But if you
proceed further then thus, and put men to declare what worke of grace God
hath wrought in their ſoul, in this or that way, which perhaps is not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the word of grace, at leaſt not agreed upon among your ſelves, we beſeech
you conſider by what authority you do it, and upon what grounds you ſtand.
But we will enter no further upon this matter, becauſe it comes not within the
compaſſe of theſe Poſitions, and to attribute ſo much to private letters, as to
make them the ground of another diſpute we may not.</p>

by the Church meerly through his own default. 2. By the Churches

default without any deſert of his. In the former caſe it is evident he ceaſeth to
be a Miniſter to them any longer, as appears in foure concluſions.</p>
               <p>1. It is cleare from the Word, that a Paſtor or Teacher in theſe dayes hath no
Apoſtolicall power over all Churches, but onely limited to that one Church
where God hath ſet him. <hi>Paul</hi> gives not the Elders at <hi>Epheſus</hi> a generall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to go teach all Churches, but to go feed that one flock over which the
holy Ghoſt hath made them over-ſeers. <hi>Act. 20. 28.</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> gives direction to
Elders to feed that flock of God onely which was among them, and take the
over-ſight thereof. <hi>1 Pet. 5. 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is as cleare that all this power of feeding which the Miniſter hath in that
Church is nextly derived to him from Chriſt by the Church, who hath ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called him to the work, and promiſed to obey him therein: for if he have it
elſewhere, it muſt be either from Chriſt immediately, or from ſome other men
deputed by Chriſt to conferre it on him, or he muſt take it up of himſelfe. Not
the firſt, for that was proper to the Apoſtles or Apoſtolicall men, therefore <hi>Paul</hi>
proving his Apoſtleſhip, ſaith he was called <hi>not of men, nor by men, but by Jeſus
Chriſt himſelf. Gal. 1. 1.</hi> Not the ſecond, for we never read in Gods Word that
any ordinary Officers, or other beſides the Church, that had any Commiſſion
given them from Chriſt to call Miniſters unto Churches. Not the third, for no
man taketh this honour, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Prieſt under the Law, or of a Miniſter under
the Goſpel, but he that is called of God, <hi>Hebr. 5. 4.</hi> Therefore it muſt needs be
from Chriſt by the Church.</p>
               <p>3. As the Church in the name of Chriſt gave this power to a Miniſter to be
what he is, and do what he doth amongſt them: when ſuch a Miniſter ſhall make
and manifeſt himſelf apparently, unworthy, and unfit to diſcharge the place,
which they thus called him unto, ſo that they may diſcerne that Chriſt the head
of the Church hath refuſed him, from being a Miniſter unto him. they may then
upon as good grounds depoſe him from it, as they called him to it.</p>
               <p>4. When a Church hath thus in Chriſts name put forth this power of ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as before it did of opening to a Miniſter, then he muſt ceaſe to be a Miniſter
unto them any more, for we know no ſuch indelible character imprinted upon
a Miniſter, that the Miniſtery ceaſing, the Miniſter ceaſeth alſo.</p>
               <p>2. In caſe the Church ſhall without cauſe, or ſufficient weightie cauſe, raſhly
or wilfully ſet him aſide whom Chriſt hath ſet over them, and whom they ſo
ſolemnly called, and promiſed before the Lord to ſubmit unto, and ſo abuſe
their power given them by Chriſt; it is deubtleſſe a very great wrong unto the
Miniſter, and ſinne againſt Chriſt himſelfe before whom it was done; and not
onely Chriſt himſelf will take it ill at their hands, for ſuch contempt done to
him in his Miniſters according to Chriſts ſpeech, <hi>Luke 10. 16. He that rejecteth
you, rejecteth me.</hi> And Gods ſpeech, 1 Sam. 8. 7. <hi>They have not caſt off thee but me.</hi>
But even other Churches alſo may admoniſh them. And if they prove obſtinate
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59009:47"/>
therein, withdraw the right hand of fellowſhip from them; and concerning the
Miniſter himſelf thus depoſed, ſeeing it is done not by Chriſt, but by the Church
without Chriſt, yea againſt the mind of Chriſt, we conceive though he be by
them deprived of the execution of his miniſtery among them, yet untill he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of a call to another people, he doth yet ſtill remain a Miniſter of Chriſt, in
whoſe account (notwithſtanding ſuch depoſition) he hath true right of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
among that people.</p>

               <p>THe queſtion is of Miniſters unjuſtly forſaken, or driven from the Church or
congregation: and your anſwer is for the moſt part of Miniſters ſet aſide or
deprived through their own default. We never purpoſed to ſpeak one word for
any unworthy Miniſter whom Chriſt hath put out of office, and therefore your
labour to prove that ſuch juſtly rejected by the Church are no longer Miniſters
might well have been ſaved. But ſetting them aſide, we will in few words examine
your concluſions upon which you bind the certainty of that ſentence you paſſe
againſt them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is certain and clear from the Word, that a Paſtor or Teacher neither
in theſe dayes hath, nor in any other age of the Church, ought to have Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
power over all Churches. The Apoſtles had onely power to ſerve the
Church with the perſonall ſervice of their Apoſtleſhip. But paſtorall power
of ordinarie Miniſters or Teachers they never had: and if the Apoſtles had not
the power of ordinarie Miniſters, much leſſe can Paſtors receive the power of
Apoſtles, for Chriſt gave both the one and the other order. But as the Apoſtles
were not Paſtors of that Church to which they preached, and among whom
they continued for ſome ſpace; no more do Paſtors become Apoſtles if they
preach the Word, or diſpence the Sacraments to another flock or people beſide
their own, whereof they have the ſpeciall overſight. But of this matter we have
ſpoken before, and of the texts of Scripture here alledged, therefore we will not
repeat what hath been ſaid alreadie: onely it ſeemeth ſomewhat ſtrange, that you
ſhould cited thoſe texts of Scripture, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, feed one flock, or
feed that flock of God onely. For we find the word (one) or (onely) neither in
the text expreſly, nor in the ſenſe for which it is here alledged, <hi>viz.</hi> as if he might
not perform any miniſteriall act in another Congregation upon any occaſion
whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the power of feeding which the Miniſter hath is neither confined
to one ſocietie onely, nor nextly derived to him from Chriſt by the Church.
The office and authoritie of a Paſtor is immediately from Chriſt. The deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the perſon which Chriſt hath deſigned is from the Church miniſterially,
but neither virtually nor formally. The conſent of the people is requiſite in the
election of Paſtors and Teachers we grant, the direction of the Elders going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59009:47"/>
or along with them;<note place="margin">Whit. de pont. q. 1. ca. 1. p. 14.</note> but the authoritie, office, and gift of a
Paſtor is not from the people or Elders, but from Chriſt alone.
When an Apoſtle was to be choſen in the place of <hi>Judas, Act. 1.
22, 23.</hi> no one had the handling of that buſineſſe, but <hi>Peter</hi> declared unto the
brethren preſent, what an one ought to be taken, and they preſent two, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
one was elected by lot. In this example ſomethings are extraordinarie, for
one onely was to be choſen, and that immediately by God himſelfe: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
ordinarie for our imitation. For if <hi>Peter</hi> would do nothing without
conſent of the diſciples, then may not ordinarie elections be paſſed without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and approbation of the Church, but it is not a popular election, not govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the fore-direction of Elders, which is concluded from this paſſage of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
but a Church election by the free conſent, and judgement of the faithfull
with the fore-leading of the Presbyterie. When Deacons were to be choſen, <hi>Act.
6. 1. 6.</hi> in the Church of Jeruſalem, it was done by the conſent of the Church.
The mutinie of the <hi>Helleniſts</hi> againſt the <hi>Hebrews</hi> occaſioned that election, but
was no cauſe why it was made by free conſent. The Apoſtles ſhew what perſons
muſt be choſen, and who ever thought the Church was left at libertie to chuſe as
ſhe pleaſe without direction. But in this election the people did firſt chuſe, the
Apoſtles onely directing whom the people ought to make choice of: when moſt
commonly the Apoſtles inſtructed the people, and went before them in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and they conſented. <hi>Act. 14. 23.</hi> The Apoſtles by conſent choſe Elders,
and ſo in every matter of great importance belonging directly to the whole
bodie of the Church, whether ſeverally in one congregation, or joyntly in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the conſent of the faithfull by obſervation of the Apoſtles was required. <hi>Act.
11. 22.</hi> and 15. 22. and 16. 4. <hi>1. Cor. 8. 19.</hi> But in the primitive times after the
Apoſtles, one Church might elect and chuſe a Paſtor for another. As <hi>Ignatius</hi>
exhorts the Phyladelphians, that they would elect a Paſtor for the Church of
Antioch. And ſo when the Eaſt Church was infected with Arrianiſme, <hi>Baſil,
epiſt. 69. 70. 74.</hi> though it a fit meanes to remove the hereſie, if the Biſhops of
Italie being ſent thither did condemne the hereſie,<note place="margin">Ep 13. li. 3.</note> and he imploreth
the aid of the Biſhops of Italy, France, and all the Eaſt. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
ſaith, all Biſhops <hi>ſunt mutuae concordiae glutine copulati:</hi> that if any hold hereſie
the reſt ſhould help. It would be too long to reckon up examples which in this
caſe might be produced. If here it be queſtioned whether your election of the
people be eſſentiall to the calling of a Miniſter: We anſwer. 1. A thing is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
two wayes. Firſt, as abſolutely neceſſarie, ſo that the thing can have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
without it. Secondly, as neceſſarie to the integritie of the thing, ſo that
it is maimed without it.</p>
               <p>Againe, either the people be few in number, and ſimple apt to be led aſide,
unable to judge of the ſufficiencie of their Miniſter, or they be more in number,
increaſed in wiſdome, ſound in faith, and able to diſcern betwixt things that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59009:48"/>
differ. In the firſt ſenſe the election of the people is not neceſſary or eſſentiall;
But in the ſecond we cannot ſay he is no Miniſter that is not choſen by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but his calling in that reſpect is maimed. If the people be few and ſimple,
apt to be deceived, they ſtand in more need of guidance and direction, both
from their own Elders, and other Churches. If the people be many in number,
full of wiſdome and underſtanding, their libertie to chooſe is the greater; and it
is the greater wrong to be deprived of it. The practiſe of the Apoſtles and the
primitive Churches for many ages will confirme this; for ſometimes men were
propounded to the Church to be choſen: Sometimes the choice was wholly left
to them: and was not that for our direction, that more libertie is given where
the danger is leſſe, and more reſtraint and caution uſed where the danger is more
apparent, that if they be left to themſelves, either an ill or unfit choice will be
made? In reaſon this is evident, for the childs conſent is required in marriage,
but the more able he is to chooſe for himſelfe, the more libertie may parents
grant, the leſſe able, the more watchfull muſt they be; and ſo in this buſineſſe.
Brotherly ſocietie requires that we mutually exhort, admoniſh, reprove and
comfort each other as occaſion requires, and as need requires. It is a dutie of
Neighbour-Churches to lend their helpe to their brethren in the choice and
election of their Miniſter.<note place="margin">Rom 15. 14.</note> When the Scripture willeth that one

policie.</p>
               <p>It is a blemiſh in the calling of a Miniſter, if either the people be not fit to
chooſe, or being fit they be ſhut forth from the choice, but this maime doth not
make a nullicie in his calling; for in every true Church where the word is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and received, and the Sacraments for ſubſtance rightly adminiſtred, there
is a true and lawfull Miniſtery, and a true and lawfull calling of that Miniſtery,
though in ſome things defective. In the Church of God all ſound and ſaving
truth is to be found, for it is the pillar and ground of truth, and where the true
profeſſion of all ſaving truth, with the right uſe of the Sacraments for ſubſtance
is to be found, there is the Church, which ordinarily cannot be had, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and continued without a lawfull Miniſtery, nor that without a calling. The
ſaving truth of God &amp; a lawfull Miniſtery, are both eſſentiall to a true Church.
Something of this remaines in every compleat ſocietie that hath any thing of
the Church; and for eſſence and ſubſtance they are true in every true, lawfull,
compleat ſocietie. The profeſſion of the truth may be true and ſound in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59009:48"/>
and fundamentall points, though mixed with diverſe errors, and the
Miniſtery for truth and ſubſtance lawfull, though many wayes deficient. In the
true Church there is a true Miniſtery, but the true Church hath continued there
by the bleſſing of God, where the election of Miniſters hath been given away by
the people, or taken from them. In the primitive Church, when the people had
a voyce in the choice of their Paſtor, oftentimes there were factions in the
Church, the people ſtood againſt their guides and challenged the whole power
of election to themſelves.<note place="margin">Theod. hiſt. l. 4. c. 6. Aug E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 110. &amp; 225. Socrat. hiſt. l 7. c. 34, 35. 39. Zozom. hiſt. l. 2. c. 18, 19.

among themſelves. Sometimes they gave away their
power, at leaſt in part, and ſometimes Miniſters were
ſet over them without their councell and advice,
whoſe Miniſtery notwithſtanding was not reputed
voyde and of none effect. If it be objected that many
things were amiſſe in thoſe primitive elections, what
will follow thence, but that the Miniſtery may be
lawfull and good, where there be many wants in the
manner of calling. If this be not granted, what ſhall
be done when the people and their Elders be divided in the choice of a fit Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.
If the people prevaile againſt their Elders, he whom they chooſe is no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
to them, becauſe not choſen by their ſuffrages: if the Elders againſt the
people, he whom they approve is no Miniſter unto them, becauſe not choſen by
their ſuffrage; And ſo if there be diſſention they muſt ſeperate from, or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

approve. The Orthodox Paſtors did profeſſe, ſo that the <hi>Donatists</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

               <p>As for the ſecond branch of your Anſwer, that in caſe the Church ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe, or without ſufficient weightie cauſe, raſhly or wilfully ſet him aſide
whom Chriſt hath ſet over them, yet he ſtill remaines a Miniſter of Chriſt (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he accepts of a call from another people) in whoſe account, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch Depoſitions, he hath true right of adminiſtring among that people.
We know not well your meaning; if this be your minde that a Miniſter lawfully
called and ſet over one Congregation, is to be eſteemed a Miniſter in the uſuall
Church, as the particular Church hath unitie with, and is part of the univerſall
or Catholique: and as a partie baptized is not baptized into that particular
Congregation onely, but into all Churches; and that the Miniſtery is one, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
à ſingulis in ſoliaum pars tenetur,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeakes; and therefore though
the Miniſter be unjuſtly caſt off by one Congregation, yet he is not to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as no Miniſter, we freely conſent. But if your meaning be that he is onely
by right a Miniſter of that particular Congregation, becauſe unjuſtly depoſed,
as formerly in the execution of his office he was a Miniſter to them onely, and to
none other ſocietie whatſoever, or in what reſpect ſoever; your opinion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the judgement and practiſe of the univerſall Church, and tendeth to
deſtroy the unitie of the Church, and that communion which the Churches of
God may and ought to have one with another; for if he be not a Miniſter in
other Churches, then are not the Churches of God one, nor the Miniſters one,
nor the flocke which they feed one, nor the Communion one which they have
each with other. And if the Paſtor derive all his authoritie to feede from the
Church, when the Church hath ſet him aſide, what right hath he to adminiſter
among that people. If they erre in their depoſition, it is true they ſinne againſt
Chriſt. But as they give right to an unworthy man to adminiſter among them,
if they call him unjuſtly, ſo they take right from the worthy if wrongfully they
depoſe him. The Miniſter is for his Miniſtery the office for the execution, and ſo
the Paſtor and the flocke are relatives: And therefore if their Election gave
him authoritie among them to feed, their caſting him off hath ſtripped him of
the ſame power which formerly they gave him. And his miniſtery ceaſing, he
ſhould ceaſe to be their Miniſter, if he ſtood as Miniſter onely to that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
