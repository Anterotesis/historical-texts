         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as be committed to their charges, according
to the truſte, whiche the Kynges maieſtie hath in

before vs, not onely of cuſtome, but rather of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie:
For hearyng daily and perceiuyng as we
do, the greate negligence, and the litle hede whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

ſtudie and oures, in ſettyng a good and moſte
Godly ſtaie, to the honor of God, and the quiet
of the relame, ſpent in vain, and come to nothing.
The whiche, as wee haue greate hope and truſt,
not to bee altogether ſo, yet ſo muche as it is, and
ſo muche as it lacketh, of kepyng the realme in a
moſte Godly ordre and ſtate: we muſte nedes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,

the Iuſtices of Peace in euery Shire: to whom,
we are wont to directe our writynges, &amp; to whoſe

the execucion of all his Proclamacions,
of his Actes, of Parliament, of his Lawes.</p>
            <p>We are infourmed that many of you, be ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent
and ſo ſlacke, in that, that it doth appere,
that you doo rather loke, as it wer through your

theſaied Lawes and Proclamacions: For if you
would accordyng to your dueties, to your othe,
to the truſte, whiche the Kynges maieſtie hath in

of theſame, moſt Godly Statutes and

            <p>Mary it is feared, and the thyng it ſelf geueth

that the people hath neuer hard, of diuerſe of

that you are content to wincke at it, and to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecte

and ſhall herafter appoynt to be kept, neither the

contempt of good and wholſome lawes, all diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre

ſhould be wilde and ſauage, and no man ſure of

How wee ſtande in Scotlande you knowe, and
that other forrein power maketh great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion

we do agree within our ſelfes, and be obedient to

wee maie bee ſure that God is with vs, and that

            <p>The lightnes of the rude and ignoraunt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

lewde men, and hide your ſelfes. For it ſhalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of you, if ſuche miſordre bee: and ſurely
without your aide and help, or your diſſemblyng
ſuche miſordre cannot bee. Nor we dooe not ſaie

is any ſuch thyng likely to chaunce, but we geue

haue had to muche experience in this Realme,
what inconuenience commeth of ſuche mattiers,
and though ſome light perſones, doo not in their
rage conſider it, yet wee doo not doubte but that
you weigh it, and knowe it well inough. And if it

And for that purpoſe, you
