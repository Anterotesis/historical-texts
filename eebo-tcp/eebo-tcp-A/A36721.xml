            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The ill Practices of this Age, have ſo far infected the Noblemen, and made them ſo ſolicitous of their private Intereſts, that it is to be feared, we may live to ſee thoſe times return again upon us, when Mens worth was meaſured by their Riches, and Perſons of Quality were proud of their ignorance.</p>
            <p>Ingenium quondam fuerat pretioſius auro,</p>

            </p>
            <p>But you, my Lord, are far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the advantages of Nature and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune can make amends for all other Defects, or

            <p>THE Duke of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> whom I had the Honour to ſerve as Chaplain, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Turin</hi> the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1691. He found the State of Affairs there in a bad Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and the People in a great Conſternation. The <hi>French</hi> had lately Fortified <hi>Carmagnole. Coni</hi> was Beſieg'd and given over for loſt. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52416:6"/>
               <hi>la Hoguette</hi> had forced the Paſſages of the Valley of <hi>Aoſte,</hi> which gave him entrance into the Country of <hi>Verceil</hi> and the Frontiers of the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi> Our Army inſtead of making ſome motion to diſturb the Enemy, Incamped upon the Deſcent of <hi>Mountcallier,</hi> being Spectators of the waſte and burning of the Plains below. <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> dreaded every hour being inveſted. There was an univerſal fear; and the retreat of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes to <hi>Verceil</hi> added yet more to the terrour of the Inhabitants. The Favourers of <hi>France</hi> gave out publickly that his Royal Highneſs would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably be ſtripp'd, this Campaigne, of all his Territories, and that he had no way left, but to ſubmit to the King's mercy.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that without that firmneſs and greatneſs of Soul which his Royal Highneſs ſhewed on this occaſion, all had then been loſt; and though the beginning of his Reign ſeems to prognoſticate a ſeries of Heroick Actions, yet this part of his Hiſtory will be none of the leſs Illuſtrious. <hi>Emmanuel Philibert,</hi> oppreſſed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Wars between <hi>Charles</hi> the V. and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the I. ſunk at laſt under the weight of his Misfortunes. He had the weakneſs to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Name of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Son; and that he might be aſſiſted by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to that Republick the prcedency he had in all the Courts of <hi>Europe.</hi> The Affairs of his now Royal Highneſs were almoſt as deſperate: Nevertheleſs a manly and undaunted Air did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appear on the Face, and in the meen of this young <hi>Hero.</hi> Neither the Propoſals of <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52416:6"/>
joined with <hi>Italian</hi> craft, the bad Condition of his Troops, the exhauſting of his Treaſury, nor the Enemies Army Incamping in the Plain of <hi>Millefleurs,</hi> a League diſtant from <hi>Turin,</hi> could ever raiſe in him the leaſt degenerate Thought. And it may be ſaid that his Conſtancy and ſteddineſs bore up againſt his ill Fortune, and that himſelf put a ſtop to the deſperate Condition of his Affairs.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi> came to him in this dangerous juncture; and did by his Example and Counſels confirm his Royal Highneſſes's Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Two or three days after his Arrival, waiting on the Prince on Horſe back to obſerve the <hi>French</hi> Army, which had then paſs'd the River <hi>Pô,</hi> and was incamped between <hi>Carmag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolle</hi> and <hi>Mountcallier;</hi> Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> ſpeaking High-German to one of the Guards of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Royal Highneſs declared his deſire to Learn that Language, adding that he had attempted it two or three times, but was always diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the difficulty he found in it; which gave occaſion to Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> to offer his aſſiſtance, and to be his Maſter. The Prince reply'd that others might Inſtruct him in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, but that it was the Art of War that he deſired to Learn of him. A viſible change was ſoon perceived in the State of Affairs. Our Infantry which was poſted on the riſing Ground of <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callier,</hi> came down to the Foot of the Hill. Our Horſe ſtretched on the Plain where the Enemies were Incamped, and cauſed the Siege of <hi>Coni</hi> to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52416:7"/>
be raiſed, and forced <hi>Catinat</hi> to retire, which freed the City of <hi>Turin</hi> from their Allarm.</p>
            <p>The Wiſdom and Valour of his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were juſtly praiſed. And publick Prayers were made to bleſs God for having averted the Storm, and removed in a great meaſure the ſad appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions they had lain under. And thus far all things went right. But to ſpeak freely, I could not ſee without grief, a part of that Incenſe, the Smoak whereof ought wholly to have aſcended to the Glory of the Lord of Hoſts, burnt to the Honour of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers. I was preſent at my return from the Compaign, at a Sermon Preached by a Jeſuite in the Church of the Old Colledge, on the Holy-day kept in Honour of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, <hi>Solutor, Adventor</hi> and <hi>Octavius,</hi> to whoſe Memory this Church is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated; and to whom the City of <hi>Turin</hi> pays veneration as to their Patrons: <hi>O People of</hi> Turin (ſaid the Preacher above a hundred times) <hi>O people of</hi> Turin, <hi>bleſs your deliverers! Bleſs theſe Sacred Martyrs who watch for your ſafety, and whoſe Merits and Prayers</hi> have preſerved your City, your Families, and Eſtates. I ſaw after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all the Religious Orders, and the Confra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities or Brotherhoods come to the Feet of the Altars, where the Reliques of theſe Souldiers are depoſited, to receive, what the Romiſh-Church calls, the Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>This occaſioned the firſt deſire I had to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> as ſoon as I could have both time and Books neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for that purpoſe. And that which further
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52416:7"/>
moved me to do it, was my being afterwards an Eye-witneſs of the Church-Service which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the Town ordered to be performed on the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1693. for the diſcharge of a Vow they had made in Honour of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, which, by reaſon of ſome difficulties, they had not been able ſooner to perform.</p>
            <p>The Reliques of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers were ſet in the Church of the Jeſuits, upon a Throne covered with a Golden Brocado, illuminated with an infinite number of White-wax-tapers. The Archbiſhop accompany'd with the whole Chapter, came and Officiated in his Pontifical Habit. The Court was preſent at this Solemn Service, and adored the Urn in which theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Corpſes were (for ſo they are Styl'd by the Jeſuit, who Printed a Relation of the Ceremony) <hi>Indi ſopravenne la Corte, e s'eſpoſe alla publica</hi>

Towards the Evening it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about from the Church on Mens ſhoulders under a rich Canopy of State, ſupported by four Perſons of the firſt Quality. The Canopy was attended by twelve Knights of St. <hi>Mauritius</hi> and of St. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> appointed by their Order for that performance. The moſt part of the Nobility and Gentry of the Town followed with lighted Wax-Torches, and almoſt all the People, of what Rank and Condition ſoever, flocked thither to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52416:8"/>
Worſhip the pretended Reliques of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors.</p>
            <p>I withdrew my ſelf, not a little concern'd to ſee the Devotion of all ſorts of People, applied to the Honour of the Saints, when it ſhould have been wholly directed to the Glory of God, the only Author of their Deliverance, and preſent ſafety. And my grief was heightned, by a Senſe of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to a People that had ſhewed ſo much good Nature to me a Stranger, and a Proteſtant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; which Character, though odious to all the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> yet was in nothing prejudicial to me during two Years that I Preached there. Though I confeſs the Kindneſſes I received were owing moſt to the great eſteem they had for the Duke of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and eſpecially to the great regard they have there for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, whoſe Valour and Power are as rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood there at this time, as in the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> But I cannot, without, ingratitude forbear here giving to the Inhabitants of <hi>Turin</hi> their due, which is, that they are extreamly Courteous and Civil to Strangers, and partake of the Politeneſs of the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which hath been for a long time lookt upon as one of the moſt Poliſhed and Civilized, and where Converſation is juſtly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, between the Liberties of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of <hi>Florencc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then it is neither out of unthankfulneſs, nor for want of reſpect for the City of <hi>Turin,</hi> but out of meer Love to Truth, and as a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on my Function, that I do Attack their Patrons in this Work of mine, no body I hope
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52416:8"/>
will take any offence at my deſign. Morever, as this whole buſineſs depends on Proofs; if they are frivolous, the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers will ſtill peaceably enjoy the Glory of their Martyrdom; but if they prove good, it will be ſome Service to have undeceived the World in this matter. Now I deſire this Juſtice may be done me, that my Thoughts may not be miſinterpreted, nor a conſtruction put upon them, which I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. For I know ſome Proteſtants do make uſe of the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion</hi> to back ſome other queſtions, which are not at all to my preſent Deſign, nor proper for one in my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to meddle with.

               <hi>Charles Emmanuel</hi> the Firſt, could not poſſibly have given a greater Teſtimony of his Devotion to thoſe Saints, than by freely giving up to the <hi>Valeſians</hi> the Town of St. <hi>Mauricius,</hi> and other
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52416:10"/>
places which they had Uſurped from him during the Wars between his Grandfather and <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt; upon Condition, that the <hi>Valeſians</hi> ſhould give him leave to Convey to <hi>Turin</hi> the Corps of St. <hi>Mauricius,</hi> Chief of the <hi>Thebean Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> one of whoſe Arms he had already gotten out of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> whither it was Tranſported in the Year of 1250. by King <hi>Ottocarus</hi> the Fifth.

               </note>his Lance, ſpoken of by <hi>Chromer,</hi> was brought to <hi>Cracovia,</hi> where it lyes yet expoſed to publick Veneration.

But <hi>Charles Emmanuel,</hi> in the Devotion he had for the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, did nothing but tread in the ſteps of <hi>Emmanuel Philibert</hi> his Father. When the Reliques of theſe Saints were conveyed from the Church of the Bleſſed Virgin into that of the Jeſuites, where they do reſt to this Day, <hi>Emmanuel Philibert</hi> honoured the Ceremony with his preſence, and was at a great expence towards the Magnificence of it.

            <p>
               <hi>Charles Emmanuel</hi> had ſo great a Zeal for the glory of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, that he imparted to <hi>Spain</hi> ſome of their Reliques, to the intent they might partake of their Merits and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

            <p>If general Approbation might be admitted as a Proof, there would be ſcarce any Opinion more
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52416:11"/>
Probable than that of the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> if we conſider the great number of grave and Learned Authors who have all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it as an undoubted matter of Fact. <hi>Rome, Geneva,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and generally all Chriſtian Societies have given Credit to the Hiſtory of this <hi>Legion;</hi> and that, no doubt, upon account of the Honour which they imagined the Martyrdom of it did to the Chriſtian Religion, by the wonderfulneſs of the Action, the greatneſs of Soul, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Characters of the Perſons that ſuffered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Lewis Fabritius</hi> relates the Example of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> in his Learned Diſſertation concerning the juſt Limits of humane obedience, in order to eſtabliſh this ſo important a Maxim in Morality; That we ought always to ſide with God, whenever there is more certainty and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Prohibitions of God, than in the Ordinances of Princes.

There is no preſcription againſt Truth; and a long prepoſſeſſion gives no right at all to Errour. <hi>I have ſeen,</hi> ſaith one of our Old Writers, <hi>the Birth of many Miracles in my time, and though they no ſooner ſaw the Light, but they were ſtifled, we do however foreſee the courſe they would have taken, had they happened to have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to their full Age. For the main buſineſs is to find out out the end of the thread, then you may wind as much as you pleaſe; and there is a greater diſtance from nothing to the leaſt thing that may be, than there is from that leaſt to the greateſt that can be imagined. A private Errour firſt cauſeth a publick one; and then that publick Errour occaſions other private ones. Thus the</hi>

And they have been for theſe Eight or Nine Hundred Years in a quiet Poſſeſſion of the glory of their Martyrdom, and do enjoy it peacably to this day, under the ſhadow and Authority of the greateſt Names, and the moſt renowned Doctors of all Chriſtian Communions. Now that we may diſtinguiſh the Romance from the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we muſt remove all the Miſts which the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendaries and Martyrology-makers have ſpread over it.

'Tis no leſs uſual to be deceived in matter of Statues and <hi>Baſſo-Relievos,</hi> then in Medals. We have a great many Examples of this kind; but it will ſuffice to give here only one ſingle inſtance: <hi>Vazari</hi> tells us, that <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> to convince ſome Vertuoſos and Antiquaries, who valued nothing but what was Ancient, of the raſhneſs of their Judgment in ſuch caſes, made a Cupid and buried it under the ruines of an Old Building, having firſt broken off one of its Arms which he kept at home. All the Lovers of the Art came immediately to look upon it, and no Body did ſo much as queſtion the Antiquity of the piece, till <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> ſhewed them the Arm which he had kept by him, to convince them of their Errour, and to ſhew them how eaſily they might be impoſed upon, in a matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they pretended to ſo much skill.</p>
            <p>But miſtakes of this kind, have been yet more frequently made by thoſe who have imployed their-Criticks upon thoſe Heathen Authors, which have been left to us either by the <hi>Grecian</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Antiquity.

Nevertheleſs, by what Misfortune I know not; theſe frauds have been more frequent in the Church, than any where elſe, and it is impoſſible to Summ up the miſtakes, they have occaſioned amongſt the Learned in all Chriſtian Societies. So many ſpurious Writings, and ſuppoſititious Facts were made and Publiſhed even in the three firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, that <hi>Amphilochius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> ſo much eſteemed by St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> one of the moſt worthy Fathers of the Church, compoſed a whole Book of them, which is cited in the Acts <note place="margin">

               </gap>e boldneſs in inventing Fables, and Forging falſe Lives of Martyrs and Saints, went ſo far, and became ſo common, that the Church thought it neceſſary to put a ſtop to it, by the Authority of its Canons. For in the Council of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> held in the Year 692, under <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Younger, the Church condemned, in the 63<hi>d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Canon, the falſe Paſſions, and Fabulous Lives of Saints and Martyrs.</p>
            <p>A great number of Learned Men have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in theſe latter times, to find out theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious Writings, and to aſcribe to every Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor the Works belonging properly to him. And they would undoubtedly have been more ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it, had they not been miſ led, as well as the People, by Intereſt or Partiality. For oftentimes both their Minds and Pens are ſway'd by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Paſſion: As if a Work were good or bad, Ancient or Modern, as it chanced to be look'd upon by Proteſtant or Popiſh Eyes; falſe and ſuppoſititious, if contrary to their Opinions, but Ancient, and of the true ſtamp, if it proved fovourable to them.</p>
            <p>But though they ſhould be allowed to have been free from Prejudice and Paſſion, yet it is no ſtrange thing to ſee Men differ in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This follows neceſſarily the different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and Natural inclinations of their minds.

Some view things only on one ſide, and ſome on another. The greateſt part fix themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have well examined all the Reaſons that are, and may be produced on both ſides. And ſometimes it happens that Men concern themſelves for ſome Works, as they do for ſome Perſons, without knowing why they are more for thoſe than for the others. Hence it is that the Writers of the ſame Church do not always <note place="margin">Ann. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.

               </note>agree in their Opinions. Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> ſpeaks of the Recognitions attributed to St. <hi>Clement,</hi> as of a ſink full of filthineſs and lies: Whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maintains that they are St. <hi>Clement's</hi> own, or of ſome other Author as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and as Learned as he. The ſame difference in Opinions is obſerved amongſt the Proteſtants concerning St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Letters, though theſe Letters are generally, and with good reaſon look'd upon as one of the faireſt Monuments of the Apoſtolick Age. And Mr. <hi>Dupin,</hi> in his <hi>Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theca nova,</hi> ſets aſide in a hundred places the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Authority of his Friends <hi>Poſſevinus, Sixtus</hi> of <hi>Siena, Rainaldus, Bellarmine, Labbe,</hi> and other Writers of his Religion, who have Criticis'd upon the Works of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>This ſhews that the moſt Learned may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be miſtaken in their Judgments upon the Works of the Ancients. Nor is this much to be wondered at, ſince the intricacy and confuſedneſs wherewith ſome Tranſactions are related, and the diſtance of the time wherein they happened, make it a very hard matter for us now to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Truth from Falſhood.

He tells us, that this Biſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> lived till the Year 499. and he grounds his conjecture upon a place in the Life of St. <hi>Ceſarius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> compos'd by <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Prieſt; where it is ſaid, that theſe two Biſhops, being in company together, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

a Woman to her former health, who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with a very ſore Diſtemper.

For it is certain that he was preſent at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Arles</hi> in 524 and at the ſecond Council of <hi>Orange</hi> in 529<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And to prove that he was alive in 528. we have a Letter that Pope <hi>Vigil</hi> wrote to him under the <hi>Conſulſhip</hi> of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Voluſian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though we ſhould grant Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>'s Conjecture not to be groundleſs, yet he would be but little the better for it. 'Tis not enough to prolong St. <hi>Eucherius</hi>'s Life to the Year 499. 'Tis to no purpoſe, likewiſe to prove that St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> might have ſeen St. <hi>Ceſarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles.</hi> King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> dyed about the Year 520. and they muſt make it appear that St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> out-lived him a great many Years, to make good the <hi>uſque hodie</hi> of the place we have before quoted. Now it is ſo far from being true, that St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> did out-live St. <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> that on the contrary, there is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-hood that he liv'd till the Year 499. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Conjecture.

               <hi>Orange,</hi> that he was Biſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> in 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>1; and conſequently he muſt have been then at leaſt thirty, or forty Years Old; for at that time it was not uſual to raiſe any perſon under that age to the Dignity of a Biſhop; Biſhopricks being not yet beſtowed as rewards upon Families, and the Holineſs of Canons holding yet out againſt the Vanity of the Clergy, and the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of Kings. Now ſince we are certain of this, can we think it probable that St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> ſhould live to ſee St. <hi>Ceſarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> who was not raiſed to that Dignity, till after the Death of <hi>Ennoius,</hi> about the Year 504 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I think a Man muſt needs be very bold in his Conjectures, who can allow St <hi>Eucherius</hi> to have lived above a Hundred Years, if he have no other Warrant for it, but that place of the Life of St. <hi>Ceſarius:</hi> Thoſe who ſhall carefully examine this Life of St. <hi>Ceſarius,</hi> will agree, that it ought not to be rely'd upon too much. 'Tis true, it is polite and judicious enough for that Age, and ſeems not unworthy of him who had been one of the Diſciples of St. <hi>Ceſarius,</hi> and who for his great Piety and Merits was raiſed to the Dignity of a Biſhop, as appears by his Name found in the Subſcriptions of the ſecond Council of <hi>Orange<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But if, inſtead of following this <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of St. <hi>Ceſarius,</hi> and who was afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Thoulon,</hi> Doctor <hi>Cave</hi> had given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the trouble to look over the Councils of <hi>Valence,</hi> he would have obſerved that in the firſt, which was held in the Year 734. their whole buſineſs was about <hi>Bigamy;</hi> that in the Second, which met in 599. (ſome place it in the Year 684, and ſome in 589.) they were wholly taken up with the great Donatives which <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tran</hi> King of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had beſtowed upon the Church: And that the Third, in which <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, Hinmark,</hi> and <hi>John Scot</hi> were Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52416:19"/>

Now St. <hi>Ceſarius</hi> was unborn at the time of the Firſt Council, ſince Doctor <hi>Cave</hi> brings him into the World, only in the Year 469. And he was Dead when the Second met, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame Doctor, who places his Death in the Year 542. And 'tis, I think needleſs to add that he was not concern'd in the Third, which was held in 855. and in which the <hi>Pelagian</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions were Condemned. This ſhort digreſſion, which we have thought neceſſary, to remove St. <hi>Ceſarius</hi> from St. <hi>Eucherius</hi>'s times, will not ſeem, I hope, unſeaſonable. It appears then that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for all his Conjecture, cannot bring St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> near enough to St <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> The diſtance is too great to admit of any means of reconciling the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.

not have made mention of them, ſeeing all do agree that he dyed about the Year 440.</p>
            <p>We may ſtrengthen this Argument with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother taken from the Acts of a Council, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been aſſembled by order of King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> at <hi>Agaunum,</hi> and in which Sixty Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops put it into his Head to gather the Bones of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, and to Dedicate a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilick,</hi> or ſtately Church to them.

But we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the makers thereof were not very skilful in their contrivance of it. The truth is, that in thoſe times People were ſo credulous, that they gave Credit to the groſſeſt tales. They were contriv'd and conceiv'd under the ſhadow of Monkiſh Holineſs, and were brought forth into the World without contradiction, or any Body to oppoſe them. The Monk who Forged this Council, makes both King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> and the Biſhops to ſay very ridiculous things. The Country Peaſants of <hi>Valeſia</hi> would now ſpeak better Senſe. <hi>Le Cointe</hi> obſerveth, that the Acts of this Council are Dated in the beginning of the laſt of <hi>April,</hi> and towards the end of the Ides of May: That it is ſaid at firſt, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was held at <hi>Agaunum,</hi> and again, that it was Aſſembled near that place. Which ſhews the poor Monk hardly knew what he did. He adds that Sixty Biſhops met together at <hi>Agau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and in <hi>Sigiſmond</hi>'s time there were not above Seven and Twenty Biſhops in all, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Kingdom of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> He ſaith, that <hi>Theodorus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sion</hi> in <hi>Valeſia,</hi> asked what ſhould be done with the Bodies of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bean</hi> Souldiers that laid yet unburied upon the Ground. And in St. <hi>Sigiſmond</hi>'s time, there was no Biſhops-See at <hi>Sion.</hi> The Biſhops-See was transferred thither, not till many Years after, it having always been before at a place which is called <hi>Martignac,</hi> or <hi>Martigni,</hi> which is the Ancient <hi>Octodurum.</hi> So that this <hi>Theodorus</hi> being
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52416:21"/>
contemporary with King <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> ought to have been call'd <hi>Octodurenſis Epiſcopus,</hi> and not <hi>Sedunenſis,</hi> as the Council-Forger hath done.</p>

               </note> But the thing we ought chiefly to obſerve, is, that both <hi>Labbe</hi> and <hi>Coſſart,</hi> place this Council in the Year 516. The Acts do expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that when it was held, the Buildings which King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> ordered to be made at <hi>Agaunum,</hi> were finiſhed, and wanted only to be Dedicated, and appointed to their uſe.

The Biſhops of this pretended Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, are there chiefly taken up with regulating the ſinging of Pſalms, the Offices, Obſervances, and whatever was to be Practiſed in that Monaſtery. Now the buſineſs is to know, whether the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> which we aſſert to be falſe, is anteriour to that Council, or happen'd after its ſitting. If they ſay it is anteriour, we ask, how could the Author of it ſpeak of a Monaſtery which was not yet Built, and of Rules not yet eſtabliſh'd? If it be anſwered, that this Paſſion was Written after the ſitting of the Council, which according to <hi>Labbe</hi> and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52416:22"/>
               <hi>Coſſart</hi> met in the Year 516. it follows, that St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> is not the Author of this Paſſion, ſince he died in the Year 440.</p>
            <p>If the Acts of this Council be compared with the Paſſion, one cannot but ſuſpect that the Impoſtour, who compoſed it, had before his Eyes the Acts of this Council. 'Tis ſaid in theſe Acts, that the Biſhops conſulted with King <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> what Diſcipline was to be ſet up in the Monaſtery of <hi>Agaunum,</hi> and that the Rules which ſhould be preſcrib'd to the Monks, might be ſo framed as to laſt for ever. And the Author of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, as it is related both by <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Surius,</hi> ſaith, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe, Day nor Night, to ſing Pſalms and Hymns in the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Monaſtery; this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice having been eſtabliſhed by the Bleſſed King and Martyr St. <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> and being ſtill in force there to this very day.</p>
            <p>But that the Acts of this Council, are forged, Father <hi>Le Cointe</hi> hath given infallible proofs. And whereas <hi>Labbe</hi> and <hi>Coſſart</hi> place this Council in the Year 516. we ſhould not fear being much miſtaken, if we charged the Forgery upon ſome Impoſtor of the Seventh or Eighth Century. For theſe and the like Writings are the Titles and Foundations both of the Worſhip, vaſt Power, and Immenſe Revenues of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis true, we are told that the Manuſcripts of theſe things are kept in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, or in that of <hi>Florence;</hi> and that they have all the Characters of an uncontroulable Antiquity.

            <p>'Tis ſtrange indeed, that Father <hi>Mabillon,</hi> one of the moſt Eminent Men in <hi>Europe</hi> in that kind of Learning, ſhould Condemn the Opinion both of <hi>Marſham</hi> and <hi>Papebrook.</hi> He thinks that theſe two Learned Men were miſtaken, and to prove it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he reports ſome Acts of the 6<hi>th</hi> or 7<hi>th</hi> Age; but this is nothing to the purpoſe; for <hi>Marſham</hi> and <hi>Papebrook</hi> did never deny but there were true Acts ancienter than<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Reign of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobert</hi> the Firſt; but they only affirmed, that theſe Writings are very ſcarce, and can hardly be found; ſo that Father <hi>Mabillon,</hi> to have an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to contradict theſe two great Men, makes them ſay abſolutely, what they only meant with a reſtriction. And beſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis one thing to go about to prove from the Words of ſome Authors, that there have been Kings before <hi>Dagobert</hi> the Firſt, who made Gifts in Writing to ſeveral Churches, and another to prove that theſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings do yet continue, and have been handed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52416:23"/>
down to us, and that they have not been worn out by time, loſt or deſtroyed by the Accidents and Revolutions which have happened in the courſe of ſo many Ages, nor falſify'd and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the covetouſneſs, ignorance, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of Men. The firſt of theſe two things, which is not in queſtion, Father <hi>Mabillon</hi> takes upon him to prove, but ſaith not one word of the ſecond which he ought to have proved. But here is the buſineſs. <hi>Papebrook</hi> is plain and downright, becauſe he, being a Jeſuite, is of an Order of a very new Date, and which therefore needs not go up and ſearch very high for Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: Whereas Father <hi>Mabillon</hi> is a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monk, of the Congregation of St. <hi>Maur.</hi> And St. <hi>Benet's</hi> Order hath a great concern to maintain the Antiquity of their rich Foundations. <hi>Papebrook</hi> confeſſes ingenuouſly, that moſt of the Acts in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries have been falſify'd by Monks, becauſe this reproach could not fall on the Jeſuites, who were not then in the World. But by reaſon there were at that time almoſt no other Monks in the Weſt but the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> 'tis worth the while to ſee, with what Zeal Father <hi>Mabillon</hi> ſtickles in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But while he endeavours to make their Cauſe too good, he betrays his own.</p>
            <p>He proves that the falſification of Acts, ought not to be laid only at the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mens Doors; that every Body had then a hand in the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; that Cheats and Impoſtours were as common at that time amongſt the Laity, as in the Church; and that both the watchfulneſs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52416:23"/>
and Authority of the Emperours were taken up in preventing and chaſtiſing theſe knaviſh tricks. This is juſt what <hi>Marſham</hi> and <hi>Papebrook</hi> do both mean and ſay. We have thought fit to make this Obſervation. For having a very great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for true Antiquity, we ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to have any Body allarm'd at our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> which hath obtained the Belief of ſo many Ages in the Church.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52416:24"/>
there being another door for the true Acts of their Martyrdom to come in at. The Jeſuites are very Crafty Men, I muſt confeſs. They find immediately a way to remove every difficulty. The World was ready to forſake the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers and their Paſſion, when juſt in the nick of time, Father <hi>Chifflet,</hi> hath found a Manuſcript in the Monaſtery of Mount <hi>Jura,</hi> which gives a faithful account of the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> and is free from thoſe falſities which are ſo palpable both in <hi>Surius</hi> and <hi>Baronius.</hi> Not a word there of <hi>Marcelline</hi>'s Pontificate, of King <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> nor of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of <hi>Aelius</hi> and <hi>Amandus,</hi> Authors of the <hi>Bagaudian</hi> Inſurrection in <hi>Gaul.</hi> You have all in it but this. Both the Paſſions are in every thing alike. Only two or three Events are wanting in that of <hi>Chifflet,</hi> which might ſerve as a ſure Epoche, whereby to diſcover exactly the time wherein it hapned. A perſon more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful than I, might eaſily believe, that it is not without ſome good reaſon, that theſe places are not to be found in <hi>Chifflet</hi>'s Manuſcript. There would be leſs cauſe to ſuſpect it, had other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances been left out of ſmaller conſequence, and ſuch as do not ſerve to mark out exactly the time and age of the Piece.</p>
            <p>But 'tis in vain for Father <hi>Chifflet</hi> to boaſt the antiquity of his Manuſcript. We have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Advice which <hi>Marſham</hi> and <hi>Papebrook</hi> have given us, not to truſt too much to Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, which have on them the moſt ancient dreſs. Were we admitted to compare <hi>Chifflet's</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:52416:25"/>
Manuſcript with that of <hi>Surius,</hi> we ſhould ſoon ſee whether of them has got the beſt looks of Truth and Antiquity. The Acts of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers were Printed at <hi>Ingolſtadt,</hi> under the Jeſuites inſpection, in the Year 1617. by the care of <hi>Stewartius,</hi> who was ſure he had Examined the beſt Manuſcripts he could find <hi>Peter Natalis</hi> and <hi>William Balde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> who in <hi>Italy,</hi> writ the Hiſtory they have left us of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> were not wanting to conſult the Manuſcripts, extant in the beſt Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that Country. Though Father <hi>le Cointe</hi> does diſown the Acts of <hi>Surius,</hi> nevertheleſs he acknowledgeth 'em to be conform to the greateſt number of the Manuſcripts that are kept in the Archives of the Church. Notwithſtanding, Father <hi>Chifflet</hi> will needs have his Manuſcript to be the only one that is true and ſincere, and thoſe of all the other Writers to be ſpurious and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. I would fain know who told him, that his own was not mended by ſome Monk, who underſtood Hiſtory ſo well, as to perceive the Anachroniſms and contradictions in the Acts of the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion.</hi> This is not without Example, and we might mention ſeveral; for the Monks formerly did what they pleaſed with the Writings of their Predeceſſors. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> compoſed the Life of St. <hi>Severine,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Agaunum,</hi> of whom mention hath been already made. An A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous Author, ſome Ages after, added to it ſome things, cut off others, and dreſſed it up after his own Fancy; as Father <hi>le</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:52416:25"/>
               <hi>Cointe</hi> complains in his Annals. He tells us <note place="margin">Le Cointe, An. <hi>609.</hi>
               </note>further, that another <hi>Fauſtus</hi> having Written the Life of St. <hi>Maurus,</hi> it was not lik'd by <hi>Odo,</hi> an Abbot in the Dioceſe of <hi>Angers,</hi> in the Year 863. and that he changed it in ſuch manner, that it were to be wiſhed he had never meddled with it at all. And now can Father <hi>Chifflet</hi> warrant that no ſuch hand hath ever made bold with his Manuſcript? The Acts of the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Souldiers, having no ſuch thing in them as Gifts to Monks and Monaſteries; 'twas no hard matter to find them corrected in ſome Old Manuſcripts But I queſtion much whether any ſuch Manuſcript can be produced, as will ſerve to rectifie the Acts of the Council of <hi>Agaunum,</hi> wherein ſo many conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues are beſtowed on the Monks of that place. Let any Body read Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi>'s Diſſertation upon the ſmall number of Martyrs, and he will ſee there what ſtreſs one ought to lay upon the Acts and the Manuſcripts from whence they were taken. 'Tis true, that <note n="*" place="margin">Theod. Ruin. Praef. in Act.

When it was firſt given out that <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomanus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Verona,</hi> was upon correcting the Acts and Old Legends of Saints, all good Men of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church were very glad at the News, hoping that he would have purged them from all the groſs lies which <hi>Metaphraſtes, Comeſtor,</hi> and <hi>Jacobus de Voragine</hi> had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. But <hi>Lippomanus,</hi> and <hi>Surius</hi> made all things worſe, inſtead of mending them. For before this, the Acts and Lives of Saints were look'd upon as pious Romances, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the ill-regulated zeal of the Legend-Writers. But then they were eſteemed quite another thing, after they had been Reviſed by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52416:26"/>
               <hi>Surius, Lippomanus,</hi> and <hi>Junius Mombritius,</hi> who contented themſelves with taking away on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt palpable and obvious falſities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thoſe which they thought were not ſo offenſive, and then proteſting that they had gone up to the head, and had conſulted the beſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts <hi>Roſweidus, Bollandus, Godfrey Henſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and <hi>Papebrochius,</hi> who are come after, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do ſome Service to the Learned, by gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all whether good or bad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have not given us a truer account of the Acts of Martyrs and Saints, but only have incumbred Mens Studies with their huge and bulky Volumes.</p>
            <p>'Tis not that we believe, that the Doctors of the Romiſh Communion are willing to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance lyes and Forgeries. We do them more juſtice than ſo They would undoubtedly have all this ſilly ſtuff taken out of their Church Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Breviaries, and Martyrologies, but they know not how it can be done. They fear to give ſome advantage to the Proteſtants, and to furniſh them with Weapons againſt the infallibility of their Church. And the Learned amongſt them are afraid to bring upon themſelves the hatred and perſecution of Monks and Fryers, who make a Trade of theſe Impoſtures amongſt ſilly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the more ignorant ſort of People. 'Tis known all over <hi>France,</hi> what troubles they brought upon the Biſhop of St. <hi>Pons,</hi> one of the moſt worthy Prelates of that Kingdom, for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of the Calendar of his Dioceſe ſeveral Saints, whoſe Saintſhip might be called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whoſe Suffrages he did not ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52416:27"/>
This is the reaſon why moſt of thoſe who are ſufficiently convinced of theſe abuſes, are contented to bewail them in ſecret, not having the Courage to undertake the redreſſing of them. There are ſome others, who, thinking it unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that their Religious Worſhip ſhould ſeem to have no other ground than the falſe Legends of Saints and Martyrs, have indeed taken away from the Story what was moſt fictitious, but yet have kept ſtill the Eſſential part of it. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chifflet</hi> was perhaps one of theſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he found juſt in time a Manuſcript of the Paſſion of the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Martyrs, more accurate, and truer than the Manuſcripts of <hi>Surius</hi> and <hi>Baronius.</hi> Finally, we might add; that Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, as well as other Books, are ſubject to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the <hi>Index Expurgatorius.</hi> And how ſhould they ſtick at maiming them when they fear they will give any advantage to the Proteſtants, ſince they make no ſcruple ſometimes of ſuppreſſing them wholly. We are not willing to ſet down here the Story of the Edition of <hi>Anaſtaſe,</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Jeſuits of <hi>Mayence</hi> in 1602. in which they cut off what we read in the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of <hi>Heydelberg</hi> about Pope <hi>John,</hi> and of the trick they put us upon <hi>Marquardus Freherus,</hi> who had diſcovered it to them. <hi>Fabrotus,</hi> in his new Edition of that Author, Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Year 1649. hath been ſo ſincere as to own the expunging that paſſage; but at the ſame time, was not ſo ingenuous as to reſtore it.

'Tis not of late Years that there have been <hi>Annius</hi>'s of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbo</hi> and <hi>Varilla's,</hi> eſpecially amongſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Antiquity, and Compilers of <hi>Anecdota,</hi> or Secret Hiſtories.</p>
            <p>But though theſe Remarks may not perhaps ſeem unſeaſonable, yet we have no need of them for clearing the matter of Fact now in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Father <hi>Chifflet's</hi> Manuſcript hath not brought us to ſuch ſtraits, as to reduce us to meer gueſſes and conjectures. For admitting his Manuſcript to be both as Ancient and Correct as he pleaſes; the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers would not be a jot the better for it. We ſhall, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, examine their cauſe without any regard to the Manuſcripts and Acts of their Paſſion, and ſhall deduce, from the very circumſtances of their Martyrdom, ſuch Arguments as will demonſtrate the falſity of it. And we muſt own our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Father <hi>Chifflet,</hi> that we ſhall now Fight no longer in the Dark, without either ſeeing or knowing our Adverſary. We know now
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52416:28"/>
whom we are to deal with, and who 'tis we are to encounter. Before this, while we attack'd the Acts which <hi>Surius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> have left us, and were proving that St. <hi>Eucherius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> could not be the Author of them, it might have been anſwered we took pains to no purpoſe; that we ought to have known that there have been two St. <hi>Eucherius</hi>'s, and that the Acts of the <hi>Agau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Paſſion were of the latters compoſing, who <note place="margin">Theoph. Raynal. in Ind. Sanct. Lugd. p. <hi>227.</hi>
               </note>was preſent at the Council of <hi>Orange</hi> in the Year 529. This very thing <hi>Theophilus Raynaldus</hi> hath endeavoured to prove in his Catalogue of the Saints of <hi>Lions.</hi> So that after all our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, we might chance to be in the ſame plunge with the <hi>Sofia's</hi> in <hi>Plautus,</hi> concerning the two <hi>Amphytrions,</hi> and with the Parliament of <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe</hi> in the caſe of the two <hi>Martins Guerra.</hi> But now we muſt return our thanks to Father <hi>Chifflet,</hi> for having help'd us out of theſe doubts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties. He agrees with <hi>Baronius,</hi> that there was but one St. <hi>Eucherius;</hi> and his Reaſons are ſo weighty and ſtrong, that it ſeems ſtrange, that the Learned Dr. <hi>Cave,</hi> who muſt needs have ſeen <note place="margin">Cave Ann. ch, <hi>434.</hi> p. <hi>335.</hi> quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plurimi Eucherio Juniori a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribunt, &amp; rectè qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note>them in the <hi>Paulinus Illuſtratus</hi> of that Author, ſhould yet be of the Opinion of <hi>Theophilus Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus,</hi> about the two Sts. <hi>Eucherius</hi>'s, and ſhould attribute to the <hi>Junior</hi> the Acts of the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers. We ſhall now go on with our proofs againſt the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and ſhall draw them from that Ancient and accurate Manuſcript, upon the Credit of which Father <hi>Chifflet</hi> hath reformed thoſe Acts, which both <hi>Surius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> have followed.</p>

In a word, there are few Writers, how able ſoever, that can bear up with a conſtant and continued evenneſs. Therefore the Learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> was in the right to condemn <hi>Maſſius,</hi> for denying <hi>Xenophon</hi> to be the Author of the Expedition of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe the Critick, forſooth, did not obſerve in it all the ſtrokes of that unimitable Eloquence, which is the Character of that excellent Writer. For although, for the Reaſons we have hinted at, an Author may
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52416:29"/>
ſometimes deviate from his Character, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there will ſtill be diſcovered in his Style a tincture, as it were of himſelf, and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Air that is proper to no other but him. <hi>Fannius</hi> pronounced publickly in <hi>Rome</hi> an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there being ſome who envied the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe he had got, they gave out, that he was obliged for it to his Friends, who had help'd him in the making it. But <note n="*" place="margin">Cicero in Bruto. unus enim ſonus eſt totius Orationis, &amp; idem Stylus.</note>
               <hi>Tully,</hi> on the contrary, maintained that it could not be ſo, becauſe in the diſcourſe of <hi>Fannius,</hi> both the Style, the turn, and Harmony all over the ſame.</p>
            <p>According to this ſuppoſition, we ought not to Father upon the true St. <hi>Eucherius,</hi> the Paſſion of the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Martyrs. For inſtance, let us but compare it with that excellent Epiſtle of his, upon the contempt of the World, and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Philoſophy. Wherein his way both of Thought and Expreſſion; and indeed every thing is quite different from the former. One would take this Letter to be the product of <hi>Auguſtus's</hi> Age, when the Latin Tongue was in its greateſt purity, whereas the Style of the Paſſion of the Martyrs of <hi>Agaunum,</hi> taſtes like that of the Empire in its declenſion, and of the Age of <hi>Caſſiodorus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Du Pin,</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo much to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended both for his diligence and ſincerity, hath without doubt, perus'd the Acts which Father <hi>Chifflet</hi> hath taken out of his Old Manuſcript.

Remember us likewiſe in your Prayers, when you come before God, and do attend the Services of the Saints.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral things very obſervable in this Letter. Firſt, that he who wrote it ſaith, that he is the Author of the Paſſion of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaunian</hi> Souldiers. Secondly, that the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Agaunum</hi> was Built a long time before, and was in great repute in the World, ſince Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were ſent thither from all parts. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this <hi>Theodorus,</hi> who is called there a Man of the former Ages, is in all probability the ſame <hi>Theodorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sion,</hi> whereof we have ſpoken on the occaſion of the Council of <hi>Agau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> which ſhews this Letter was written at leaſt in the Seventh Century, ſince that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, this <hi>Theodorus</hi> could not be called <hi>Vir an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terioris Temporis.</hi> Fourthly, that it mentions one <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Geneva,</hi> who is not to be found in the Catalogue, which <hi>Leti,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Spon,</hi> have made of the Biſhops of that place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which they have taken out of an Ancient Bible of that City. Fifthly, that whereas in the

               <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum,</hi> Printed at <hi>Lions,</hi> this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is placed immediately after the Paſſion of the Martyrs of <hi>Agaunum,</hi> the Editors who have taken care to advertiſe the Readers, that the Paſſion written by <hi>Surius,</hi> was not altogether Authentick, do not give the leaſt caution about this Letter, which is viſibly later by ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges than St. <hi>Eucherius.</hi> Sixthly, that this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Baron. an. ch. <hi>297.</hi> pag. <hi>734.</hi>
               </note>is inſerted at full length by <hi>Baronius</hi> in his Annals, as an irrefragable proof that St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> is the Author of the Acts of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaunian</hi> Martyrs, ſeeing it is brought there to ſerve as a Preface to it. Seventhly, that after you have read this Letter, when you come to the Acts of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Martyrs, you cannot perceive any difference. You find there much the ſame Matters, Style, and way of Expreſſion in both of them. Eighthly, that this Letter, in all the Editions of the St. <hi>Eucherius</hi>'s Works, is prefixed as a Dedication to the Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which have been compoſed by the Monks two Hundred Years after St. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherius,</hi> as appears by ſome places of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great being inſerted in them. Ninthly, that the Author of the Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> is very probably the Author of this Letter. And that he who wrote the Letter, compoſed likewiſe the Paſſion of the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Martyrs. Which leads us to this Obſervation, that perhaps we ſeek abroad for what we may find at home. I mean, that perhaps, the Acts of the <hi>Thebean Legion</hi> may be the growth of this Land, and the Work of

            <head type="sub">That in the Editions both of <hi>Surius</hi> and <hi>Chifflet,</hi> a Miracle is related which hath all the appearance of a feigned Story.</head>
            <p>IN the Acts of the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Martyrs, there is a Miracle ſet down that deſerves our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. This Miracle hapned on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a man, who in <hi>Surius</hi>'s Original was a Gold-ſmith by Trade, and in that of <hi>Chifflet</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aurifex. Faber.</note>a Black-ſmith or a Carpenter. 'Tis ſaid in theſe Acts that all the Chriſtians of <hi>Agaunum</hi> being Aſſembled at Church upon a <hi>Sunday,</hi> this Man, who was a Pagan, ſtayed alone in the new Church which was then a Building to the Honour of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Saints appearing to him in a bright and glorious Apparel, dragg'd him from the place where he was, ſtretched him as it were upon a rack, and having banged him ſoundly, reproached him with <hi>his abſenting himſelf from</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:52416:36"/>
               <hi>the Church on the Lords-day, and that he being a Pagan, had been ſo bold as to work upon a Church which was Erecting to them.</hi> It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible that a grave Author, as St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> was, ſhould have made the Bleſſed Martyrs to ſpeak ſuch Nonſenſe. For it is an eaſie thing to infer from their diſcourſe, that the <hi>Pagans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were obliged, even as <hi>Pagans,</hi> to obſerve the keeping of the Lords-day, and this is a Tenet which one can't by any means admit. For if the Fourth Commandment had obliged the <hi>Heathens,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> did, 'twould be a certain proof that the Duty enjoyned by the fourth Precept concerning the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> is a Duty Eſſentially Moral, of a Natural and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable Rectitude; and it would be a very intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate difficulty to juſtifie the Apoſtolick Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the tranſlation of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the Day of the Reſurrection of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. When we diſpute againſt the <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> one of the ſtrong Reaſons we bring againſt them, is, that the diſtinctive Character of the Laws Eſſentially Moral, is their extenſion and univerſality, that is, that they bind all ſorts of Perſons at all times, in all places, and under both Covenants. So that we conclude, that the obſervance of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day is not a Moral Duty, ſince the fourth Commandment did not oblige the Gentiles; and I do not know, if the ſame thing may not be ſaid of our <hi>Sunday,</hi> which hath ſuceeded to the Rights of the <hi>Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

'Tis true, that after Nature hath taught Men the exiſtence of a God, it may teach them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reaſonableneſs of Conſecrating a ſetled time to his Service: But it can lead them no further, and will leave the choice of that time to their Liberty. Let it be the Fourth, the Sixth, or the Seventh Day, 'tis all one in the main. And to render the <hi>Pagans</hi> guilty in not keeping the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> either according to the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> or Chriſtian Inſtitution, the <hi>Sabbath</hi> ought to be <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Lock <hi>of</hi> Hum. Underſt.</note>one of thoſe Duties that are as well known to us, as the firſt Principles inbred in our very Nature, at our coming into the World, and ingraved by the Hand of God in the Hearts of all Men. The <hi>Agaunian</hi> Saints were much in the wrong to uſe a <hi>Pagan</hi> ſo ſcurvily, under pretence of his not obſerving the <hi>Sunday.</hi> They ought firſt to have inſtructed him, to have ſet before him the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Holineſs of the Chriſtian Religion, and ſhewed him how juſt and reaſonable it is to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the <hi>Sunday,</hi> to the glory of Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator and High-Prieſt of this new Law: And after this, had he been ſtubborn and Rebellious to their Charitable inſtructions and admonitions, then in Gods Name let him fall under the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But to knock him down out of hand, this is a way of Converſion only known and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in our Days in <hi>France,</hi> and which cannot be attributed to Saints, without a great offence to their Charity. It was an ordinary thing indeed, at that time, to ſee the <hi>Pagans</hi> drag the Chriſtians by force to their profane Sacrifices, but not one Example of thoſe times can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52416:37"/>
of any Chriſtians, in places where they had the power to do to it, tormenting the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and compelling them to come and joyn with them in their Worſhip. Nay, it ſeems that in thoſe former times, they made ſome ſcruple of admitting <hi>Infidels</hi> into the places where their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Myſteries were Celebrated. For otherwiſe, to what purpoſe ſhould the fourth Council of <note place="margin">Con. Carth. <hi>4.</hi> can. <hi>84.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Carthage</hi> have Ordered the Biſhops to ſuffer the <hi>Pagans,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> and other <hi>Hereticks</hi> to enter their Churches, and hear the Word of God? 'Tis true, that it is added in that Canon, that they ſhall not be ſuffered to ſtay but to the Maſs for the Catechumens, ſo that after the Sermon and Prayer for the Catechumens, the <hi>Infidels</hi> were obliged to withdraw, before the Celebration of the Holy Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Another circumſtance againſt the credibility of it, is, that, the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Saints do reproach this <hi>Pagan, for his boldneſs in working upon the Church which was a Building for them.</hi> Is it poſſible than an Author, ſo wiſe and knowing, as Sr. <hi>Eucherius</hi> was, ſhould have put in the Mouth of his Saints ſuch unbecoming reproaches! Saints are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo nice as this comes to, I am ſure God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is not. For when <hi>Solomon</hi> was Building him a Temple, it does not appear that he found fault with him for ſending for Wood and Stones from <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Countries. And according to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> he would not have taken it ill, though all the <note place="margin">Aug.

                  </gap>endered their Necks of their own accord to the Executioners.</hi> This was not ſet down without ſome deſign; the Author had a mind to anſwer before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hand, a difficulty which might be objected by the Readers. He fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſaw that it would not well go down with ſome conſidering Men, that a whole <hi>Legion</hi> well Armed, had ſuffered their Throats to be cut without making the leaſt oppoſition, and that theſe brave Souldiers who fought like Lions in ſo many Battels, ſhould have permitted themſelves to be led as Lambs to the Slaughter. But now he thinks he hath removed the difficulty, by ſaying that they were
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52416:38"/>
poſſeſſed with a fiery heat, and a kind of fury for the glory of Martyrdom; as appears eſpecially, in that <hi>Victor,</hi> whoſe Death is related towards the end of the Acts of the Martyrs of <hi>Agau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> who ſought for Death, and brought it upon himſelf by his own indiſcretion. For being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by ſome <hi>Pagan</hi> Souldiers to come and make merry with them, with the ſpoils of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, he returned their kindneſs with a Thouſand Imprecations and Curſes, and declared, without neceſſity, that he himſelf was a Chriſtian. But theſe things are not perhaps ſo certain, as to leave no manner of ſuſpicion behind them. 'Tis true, that we find in <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Sulpitius Severus,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius,</hi> many fine things ſaid upon the Noble Ardour of Chriſtians (in the primitive Ages) for Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. It cannot be denyed neither, but in the Church Hiſtory there are particular Examples of ſome who had more zeal than knowledge, and who in the time of Perſecution, when they might have made their eſcape, or hidden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, choſe rather to run into the hands of their unmerciful Judges and Tormenters.</p>
            <p>But here the caſe is otherwiſe, for we are not ſpeaking of ſome ſimple ignorant People, whom a blind zeal might carry too far in the firſt heats of Chriſtianity, but of a whole <hi>Legion,</hi> which they ſuppoſe had been well inſtructed by a Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and confirmed in the Faith by Pope <hi>Marcelline.</hi> Amongſt theſe were a great number of Officers, who no doubt had a competent ſhare of Learning, and were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52416:39"/>
inſtructed in Chriſtian Morality, as not being Chriſtians by their Birth and Education, but by choice. In the Archives of the <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> Church of <hi>Turin</hi> is kept a Manuſcript-life of St. <hi>Second,</hi> one of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, wherein it is ſaid that he was of one of the beſt Families of the Province of <hi>Thebaide,</hi> brought up in all the beſt accompliſhments, and by his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Merit, raiſed to a conſiderable Office in the Imperial Palace. Now if notwithſtanding all theſe fine qualifications, this St. <hi>Secundus</hi> was left out in the Acts of <hi>Agaunum,</hi> we may well think that <hi>Mauricius, Candidus, Exuper, Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and <hi>Victor,</hi> who are mentioned there, ought to have been Men of tranſcendent Parts and Ability. Nevertheleſs, the Acts of their Paſſion do attribute to them, ſuch Thoughts as are quite contrary to the Principles and Morals of Chriſtianity. If the Author of theſe Acts was of opinion, that they ſhould have offended God by endeavouring to flye from the Orders and Cruelty of the Emperour, we need no other premiſes to conclude, that the true St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> is not the Author of this Relation. This Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Biſhop well knew that Chriſt did ſuffer his Diſciples, when they were perſecuted in one place to flee to another. He knew undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly very well, that true Religion ſtrengthned the Saints againſt dangers, but that it forbad 'em to ſtay for them, or to go meet them. A man that is throughly convinced of the truth of Gods promiſes, and hath experienced the Comforts of 'em, will certainly without any

change, or being in the leaſt daunted, look upon a fiery Furnace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet he will not run himſelf head-long into it.

               </gap>reach the Goſpel to the Gentiles, feared neither Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, nor Anguiſh, nor Perſecution, nor Hunger, nor Nakedneſs, nor Peril, nor Sword; he challenged Life and Death, Angels, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, Powers, things preſent, and things to come, the heighth, the depth, and all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together, to ſhake his unmoveable ſteadineſs and fidelity. But withal he never faced the dangers, whenever it was in his Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them, and made no ſcruple to turn aſide when he foreſaw ſome great miſchief in the way. An inſtance of which was his going out of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> as you ſee in the 9. <hi>Ch.</hi> of the <hi>Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was alſo a known Practice in the time in which 'tis ſuppoſed that the <hi>Thebean Legion</hi> ſuffered Martyrdom.

Biſhop does there Cenſure thoſe obſtinate Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, who having opportunity to make their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, ſought notwithſtanding for Death. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith, he, <hi>withdrew himſelf to ſhun the malice of the</hi> Jews <hi>who laid in wait for him; and though he knew that the time appointed in the Counſel of his Father was not far off, he went not in ſearch after his Croſs, but waited for it from the fury of the</hi> Jews <hi>in a ſolitary place, whither he did retire. And when he foretold his Apoſtles of all the Perſecutions they were to ſuffer for his Names ſake, he told them that they ſhould be delivered to the Councils and Synagogues. Whereupon this Biſhop obſerves that Chriſt ſaid, they ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, and not, Ye ſhall deliver your ſelves.</hi>

            <p>All the buſineſs is then to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, being informed of the Emperour's reſolution, might have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52416:40"/>
it by their flight; and for the clearing of this point, we need only read the Acts of their Martyrdom. The Army of <hi>Maximian</hi> having paſſed the defiles of <hi>Valeſia,</hi> the <hi>Thebean Legion</hi> which was in the Rear, underſtood at <hi>Agaunum,</hi> that this Army was deſigned to cut off the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in <hi>Gaul.</hi> They ſtopped at this News, and refuſed to March any further. Firſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body will agree that they might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded and betook themſelves to flight; for in ſuch caſes as this, Military Laws ought to yield to that of ſelf-preſervation, and then deſertion is not, it ſeems, a greater infraction of Military Diſcipline, than to refuſe to March at the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the General. 'Tis further ſaid in the Acts, that <hi>Maximian</hi> being informed of the refuſal of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, commanded them to be Decimated, hoping by the Death of ſome to terrifie the others into their duty. The <hi>Legion</hi> with an undaunted Courage ſuffered the Decimation, and the Miniſters who Executed the Emperours Orders, made their report to him, that the Rebellious <hi>Legion</hi> was nothing frighted by this Exemplary puniſhment, but perſiſted in their obſtinate reſolution not to March. During all this while, the Army is not ſeen to come back in Order to obſerve the Motions of this <hi>Legion;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it obſerved, that the Emperour did command any Troops to watch them, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the ill effects of their mutinous diſpoſition. 'Tis very natural to think that if the whole <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was not able to ſave all their Lives, part of them at leaſt might have got away, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52416:41"/>
yet 'tis ſaid in the Acts, that not ſo much as one of them did eſcape the Emperours Cruelty. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever care is now taken to hinder the Deſertions in an Army, all the diligence and watchfulneſs of the Officers cannot hinder a great many Souldiers to run away from their Colours every Campaign; and what is yet worth our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that the Situation of <hi>Agaunum</hi> afforded great facility to the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers to flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for their ſafety. I have paſſed my ſelf that way, when I went with the Corps of Duke <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> from <hi>Turin</hi> to <hi>Lauzane,</hi> where he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me to Bury him. And having then ſome Thoughts of this Diſſertation, I ſtaid a good while to conſider the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>venues and Situation of <hi>Agaunum.</hi> It is ſeated at the bottom, and further end of a very narrow Valley, and there is no acceſs to it but by continual Defiles, having on both ſides Woods and high Mountains. So that, had the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers taken advantage from the place, the whole Army of the Emperour had not been able to have hindred the greateſt part of them from making their eſcape. From this we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Author of their Acts hath not much obſerved the rules of Probability in the Romance he hath left us, ſince he ſaith, that all the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers were Maſſacred, not one of them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to make his eſcape, but all with one accord chearfully holding up their Necks, and wiſhing for nothing ſo much as the glory of Martyrdom.</p>

            <p>But our buſineſs is to Examine which was that <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> whereof it is ſpoken in the Acts of the <hi>Agaunians</hi> Martyrs The Copies both of <hi>Surius</hi> and <hi>Chifflet,</hi> do agree that <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> cauſed this <hi>Legion</hi> to come from the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> So that according to the pretended St. <hi>Eucherius,</hi> it cannot be either <hi>Prima Maximiana Thebaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or <hi>Tertia Diocleſiana Thebaeorum,</hi> theſe two <hi>Legions</hi> remaining in <hi>Thracia,</hi> appointed to Guard thoſe Frontiers of the Empire. This <hi>Legion,</hi> then muſt have been one of thoſe which were under the Command of the General of the Foot in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> But it is not very likely, that the Emperour ſhould have ſent for a <hi>Legion,</hi> ſo far to perſecute the Chriſtians in <hi>Gaul,</hi> or to quell a Sedition raiſed there. The <hi>Legions</hi> on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> on the <hi>Danube,</hi> in <hi>Moeſia,</hi> and in <hi>Illyria,</hi> were much nearer at hand.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52416:43"/>
refer the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion</hi> to the Year 286. 'tis like that at that time the State of Affairs did not permit that the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Provinces, ſhould be unguarded; ſince it was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>Achilleus</hi> took the Purple upon him, and that the <hi>Quingentians,</hi> or Inhabitants of the Five Towns, joyned their Forces againſt the Empire. And if this Martyrdom be placed in the Year 297. with Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion very much whether the War was not then raging upon the Frontiers of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperour <hi>Galerius</hi> had by that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the Loſs of that unfortunate day, in which all his Army was defeated, and he himſelf had much ado to eſcape.</p>
            <p>But now I come to ſomething more poſitive. The very Names which in the Book of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the Empire, are given to thoſe <hi>Thebean Legions</hi> which were in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> may ſuffice to ſhew that the Martyrdom here mentioned, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be applied to any of them. For one of theſe <hi>Legions</hi> is called <hi>Secunda Flavia Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Thebaeorum.</hi> Where we are to take Notice, that the <hi>Romans</hi> gave different Names to their <hi>Legions</hi> for diſtinction ſake, as Princes do now to their Regiments. Theſe Names are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken from the Order or time of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as the Firſt, Second, Third, and Fourth <hi>Legion.</hi> And ſometimes they were given upon the Account of ſome remarkable Action, whereby they had ſignalized themſelves, accordingly one was called the <hi>Victorious,</hi> another the <hi>Conquering,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:52416:44"/>
the <hi>Iron Legion,</hi> &amp;c. Now and then they took their Names from the Countries and Frontiers that were committed to their charge, as the <hi>Germanick,</hi> and the <hi>Pannonick Legions,</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Guard the Empire in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Some of them had alſo their Names from the Countries where they had been raiſed, as the <hi>Nervian,</hi> and <hi>Iſaurian Legions.

               <hi>Legion Maximian,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>having alſo taken upon himſelf the defence of</hi> Gaul, <hi>departed from</hi> Nicomedia, <hi>and took with him ſome</hi> Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>and amongſt them that of the</hi> Thebeans, <hi>ſo called from its having been raiſed in</hi> Thebais <hi>of</hi> Egypt. But moſt commonly the <hi>Legions</hi> bore the Names of the Emperours who had raiſed them; ſuch were the <hi>Ulpian, Trajan, Claudian, Diocleſian,</hi> and <hi>Maximian Legions.</hi> And it is moſt likely the two <hi>Thebean Legions,</hi> which were in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> were of this laſt Order. For one of them was called <hi>Flavia Conſtantia Thebaeorum,</hi> from the Name of the Emperour, <hi>Conſtantius. Pancirollus</hi> obſerves judiciouſly, that this ought to be underſtood of <hi>Canſtantius,</hi> Son to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and not of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: only the Reaſon he gives for it is falſe. He ſuppoſes then, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great was the Firſt Emperour who added to his Titles, that of <hi>Flavius;</hi> and that moſt of his Succeſſors after him took the ſame likewiſe, as a mark of the eſteem they had for his Virtues, and of their deſire to bear ſome reſemblance with him. Mr.

And Mr. <hi>Baluze,</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Lactantius</hi>'s Book of the Deaths of the Perſecutors, produces an Inſcription which he had from Mr. <hi>Vaillant,</hi> where this Emperour is inſcribed FLAVIUS VALERIUS CONSTANTINUS, ſo that we ſhould rather think that at the time when <hi>Maximian</hi> was raiſed to the Empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when he undertook his Expedition into <hi>Gaul, Conſtantius,</hi> Father to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> had not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authority to raiſe <hi>Legions</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and to give them his own Name. And ſince the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Legion</hi> was called <hi>Secunda Felix Valentis Thebaeorum,</hi> from the Emperour <hi>Valens</hi> his Name, it follows that neither the one nor the other could poſſibly ſuffer Martyrdom by the Order of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi> who was taken into a Partner-ſhip of the Government ſeveral Years before <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> came to the Throne.</p>

               <hi>Pancirollus</hi> will have it, that the Emperour <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> raiſed it to make up the loſs of the <hi>Legion</hi> which periſhed at <hi>Agaunum,</hi> on this ſide of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> for refuſing to take the Military Oaths with the <hi>Pagan</hi> Ceremonies.

Here <hi>Labbe</hi> and <hi>Pagi,</hi> put the Martyrdom of this <hi>Legion</hi> ſeveral Years before the Pontificate of <hi>Marcelline</hi> In the mean while we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the extraordinary fair dealing of this Jeſuite, who does not give us the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> as a thing whereof he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is very well aſſured, and of which he hath found any Authentick Records and Proofs, but only with an, <hi>It is ſaid, or given out;</hi> and this no doubt he does, as being unwilling to vouch for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52416:46"/>
a Relation which he found to be ſomewhat fabulous.</p>
            <p>Now if it be reply'd, that it is not fairly done to deny a matter of Fact, meerly becauſe its E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poche is uncertain; it may be anſwered, that there is a great deal of difference between one Tranſaction and another; that there are in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtory, ſeveral Relations of matters of Fact, concerning which this Argument would prove of no great force. But the Martyrdom of a whole <hi>Legion</hi> is a thing ſo extraordinary, ſo ſingular, and ſo remarkable in it ſelf, that the uncertainty of the time in which they ſay it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, makes it very ſuſpitious. And for the ſame Reaſon ſeveral Perſon doubt of the Diſpute of St. <hi>Peter</hi> with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and of the ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death of this wicked Man, whom the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils let fall to the ground, after they had born him up for ſome conſiderable time in the Air. 'Tis true that <hi>Euſebius, Sulpitius Severus,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> take Notice of this Memorable Event. But thoſe who believe it to be falſe, do reply that one ought not always to truſt to the Relations of the Ancient Eccleſiaſtical Authors, becauſe the Zeal they had for Religion, made 'em not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very Nice in the choice of Proofs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; and ſometimes they had a mind to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one Miracle to another, ſeeing that the whole <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion was Built upon the Belief of Miracles, and the Apparitions of their falſe Gods. They add farther, that had this Event happened, as it is reported, it would have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ſo much Noiſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> and through the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52416:47"/>
whole Empire, that ſome Footſteps thereof would have been preſerved in the Writings of <hi>Pagan</hi> Authors. And that after all, though it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by <hi>Euſebius, Sulpitius Severus,</hi> and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> this does not make it leſs dubious, ſince thoſe three Writers do not agree about the time wherein it happn'd. <hi>Euſebius</hi> puts it under the Empire of <hi>Claudius,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, under that of <hi>Nero,</hi> about the Year of our Lord 67. and <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> refers it to the time when St. <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> towards the Year 57. And this is the very argument we urge againſt the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>

            <p>THE Character of Forgery which we have diſpatched in the Precedent Chapter, will appear yet more Evident, by conſidering fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that 'tis ſuppoſed that the <hi>Thebean Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſuffered Death by Order of <hi>Maximian;</hi> whereas there is no room for this Martyrdom, either in the Life or Years of this Emperour. The Copies of <hi>Surius</hi> and <hi>Chifflet,</hi> and all the Legend-Writers who have followed them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, that this Emperour cauſed the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers to be put to Death in an Expedition which he made into <hi>Gaul.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly then a place muſt be found for their Martyrdom in ſome of <hi>Maximian's</hi> Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, on the other ſide of the <hi>Alpes. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Deaths of the Perſecutors, makes mention of three of them. The Firſt, was occaſioned by the Marriage of his Daughter <hi>Fauſta</hi> with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> to whom he gave the Title of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> he having had only that of <hi>Caeſar</hi> before. He was forc'd to undertake the Second to ſhun the fury of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52416:50"/>
his Souldiers, who were extreamly incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, for deſigning to deprive his Son <hi>Maxentius</hi> of the Empire, by whom he had been reſtored to the Purple, which he had freely Abdicated before. And he came the third time into <hi>Gaul,</hi> at his return from his Journey into <hi>Hungary,</hi> whither he went, but unſucceſsfully, to Sollicite <hi>Diocleſian</hi> to reſume the Government; and it was then that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> perceiving the ill Deſign he had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſtory him, thought it neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him, and cauſed him to be ſtrangled. But the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> does not anſwer to any of theſe Expeditions, ſince they are all poſterior to the Year 306. and all Hiſtorians agree, that the General Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution at that time began to abate in the <hi>Weſt.</hi> Beſides, it is certain that <hi>Maximian</hi> in none of theſe Progreſſes paſſed the <hi>Alpes</hi> with an Army, and that his Fortune and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of his Affairs at that time, did not put him into a condition to deprive himſelf of a whole <hi>Legion.</hi>

            <p>Where ſhall we then find a fourth Expedition of <hi>Maximian</hi> into <hi>Gaul,</hi> in which this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour might be ſuppoſed to have Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole <hi>Thebean Legion?</hi> There is none left but that which is mentioned by <hi>Eutropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and <hi>Aurelius Victor.</hi> Theſe two Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans agree that ſome Troops of <hi>Banditi</hi> or <hi>Rapperees,</hi> who were called <hi>Bagauds,</hi> having raiſed a Tumult in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and put themſelves

But this difficulty the famous Mr. <hi>Cuper,</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Lactantius</hi> hath removed. Where he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that this Medal ought to be referred to <hi>Galerius Maximianus,</hi> by reaſon that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his are found with the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52416:52"/>
which are not upon any of the Medals of <hi>Herculeus Maximianus,</hi> Collected by <hi>Counte Mezabarba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Subject we have before us does not require that we ſhould trouble our ſelves about theſe Chronological queſtions. We are in ſearch of the time when <hi>Maximian</hi> took another Journey into <hi>Gaul,</hi> not mentioned by <hi>Lactantius.</hi> Now the difficulty is not to find out that time, ſeeing it is circumſtanced both in <hi>Eutropius,</hi> and <hi>Aurelius Victor,</hi> by two Memorable Events; one of which is his Exaltation to the Empire, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Bagaudian</hi> Revolt under their Leaders <hi>Amandus</hi> and <hi>Aelianus.</hi> Both which do ſhew, that he undertook the <hi>Gallican</hi> Expedition in the Year of our Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 285. to Wit, at the beginning of his Reign, and above Eighteen Years before he took his other Journies ſpoken of by <hi>Loctantius.</hi> But our buſineſs is to examine, whether we can fix the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion</hi> to that time. And the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is at an end, if we give Credit to thoſe Acts of the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Martyrs, which both <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> have followed. For there mention is made of the <hi>Bagauds,</hi> of <hi>Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and <hi>Aelianus,</hi> of <hi>Maximian</hi> s Aſſumption to the Empire, and of his Expedition into <hi>Gaul</hi> with the <hi>Thebean Legion.</hi> All which does agree well enough with the time we have aſſigned for the ſame Expedition. And
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52416:52"/>
it is ſtrange, that Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> who hath followed the Acts of <hi>Surius,</hi> and ought conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to have joined the time of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaudian</hi> Revolt, with that of the Death of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, hath, notwithſtanding this, placed their Martyrdom in the Year 297, <hi>viz.</hi> Twelve Years after <hi>Diocleſian</hi> had taken <hi>Maximian</hi> into the Government, and ſent him into <hi>Gaul</hi> to ſuppreſs the Rebellion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandus</hi> and <hi>Aelianus.</hi> And ſince theſe two Events fell out ſo well to the purpoſe, one would wonder Father <hi>Chifflet</hi> ſhould be ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, upon his finding a Manuſcript in which there is not a word ſpoken of the <hi>Begauds,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Amandus</hi> nor <hi>Aelianus,</hi> if it were not that King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> unluckily appeared there alſo amongſt the reſt. For as theſe two concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Events very much favoured the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> ſo what is there related of St. <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> made it evident, that St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> could not be the Author of the Acts of that Martyrdom, ſince he Dyed ſeveral Years before this Prince came into the World. <hi>Bollandus</hi> thought he might ſave the Credit of this piece, prove it to be the work of this Holy Biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> and remove the Anachroniſm, by ſaying, that there was formerly a Monaſtery at <hi>Agaunum,</hi> and that King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> only repaired and beautified it. But becauſe it is but a poor ſhift, deſtroyed both by the Acts of <hi>Surius,</hi> and the Accounts which all the Hiſtorjans give of that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52416:53"/>
Father <hi>Chifflet</hi> was overjoyed upon his finding a Manuſcript, wherein not the leaſt mention is made of King <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> or of the <hi>Bagaudian</hi> Inſurrection. We have already declared how good an Opinion we have of Father <hi>Chifflet</hi>'s integrity, which we don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to retract. Nevertheleſs, if he be not the Man who hath helped this place out of the Acts of the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> no Body ought to find fault with us, if we ſuſpect that ſome others might have conjured it away.

            </p>
            <p>But let us come now to the Matter it ſelf, and examine whether the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> can be made to fall in with <hi>Maximian's</hi> fourth Expedition into <hi>Gaul,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Eutropius,</hi> and <hi>Aurelius Victor.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> fearing leſt the <hi>Gallican</hi> Revolt ſhould be of dangerour conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, aſſumes him into the Government, to the end, that by his aſſiſtance he might with more eaſe to himſelf undergo the weight of it; He raiſes an Army with all ſpeed to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52416:53"/>
ſuppreſs this threatning Inſurrection in its Birth; then it is ſuppoſed that he ſent for the <hi>Thebean Legion</hi> from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to ſerve in the Expedition. And yet they needs will have it, that having paſſed the Mountains with them, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner facing the Enemy, ſuch a Frenzy of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition on a ſudden ſeized him, as made him weaken his Army by the Martyrdom of this whole <hi>Legion.</hi> We took Notice before, that the Author of this Romance was not very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in obſerving the Rules of probability, But becauſe ſome things may be true, though they do not ſeem very probable, we ſhall therefore add ſomething of more weight than meer Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, for the proof of our Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, let a Man be never ſo little ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, he will find no ground there to believe, that <hi>Maximian,</hi> being but lately admitted to a ſhare in the Empire, ſhould by his own ſingle authority cut off a whole <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> For though <hi>Diocleſian</hi> had made him <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi>

               <hi>many Churches were Erected in every City, and in what Crowds came People to pay their Homage to God; inſomuch, that the Ancient Buildings proving too narrow to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, it was neceſſary to have others built more large and capacious.

'tis not likely the latter would have ſaid, that the Emperours did only at firſt Caſhier the Souldiers, and the former would not have called this Perſecution a light and gentle Puniſhment.

Such ſlaves as were hardly uſed by their Maſters, joyned with them; ſome came into this Party of their own accord, and others were ſurpriſed into it, ſeveral were ſollioited, but moſt of them ſcorned the invitation. This Riſing was call'd <hi>Bagaud,</hi> and the followers of it <hi>Bagauds</hi> or <hi>Bagaudians.</hi> Which word (as ſome ſay) ſignifies Revolt, and perhaps a Revolt of ſuch as lived in <note place="margin">

For it is likely that thoſe People having no other Fortreſſes and Places to retire to but Woods, they there intrenched themſelves after the manner of the <hi>Germans</hi> and Ancient <hi>Gauls.</hi> There were many Woods without doubt in ſeveral places of that Countrey, but the chiefeſt and biggeſt of them was two Leagues from Paris on the River <hi>Marne,</hi> in a place where now ſtands the <hi>Abbey</hi> of St. <hi>Maur,</hi> called <hi>des Foſſez,</hi> or of the Ditches, becauſe they had digged up a very ſpacious <hi>Trench</hi> to incamp there. Most of them were Chriſtians. And who knows, but that after ſo many horrid Perſecutions which they had ſuffered, their patience did turn at laſt into a juſt fury in arming them both againſt the Torments, and their Tormentors. <hi>Maximian</hi> taking a review of his Troops near the Town of <hi>Aoſte</hi> on this ſide of the <hi>Alpês,</hi> the <hi>Theb.</hi> Legion refuſed to take the Oaths with the Ceremonies uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and being encouraged by the Speeches of their Tribune <hi>Mauritius,</hi> choſe rather to undergo two or three Decimations, and at last to be all cut to pieces, then to deſite themſelves by thoſe abominable
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52416:58"/>
Rites. The whole Legion was not there, ſome Cohorts having been detached, who, as we ſhall ſee hereafter in another place, ſignaliz'd themſelves by a like Victory. So many brave Men who deſpiſed Death would have ſold their lives to the <hi>Romans</hi> at a very dear rate, if it had not been more glorious to die for the Faith, which they profeſſed, than to fight for it. I ſay further that they would have ſtrengthened very much the <hi>Bagaudian</hi> Party, had their Religion permitted them to diſſemble till they had joined them. However <hi>Maximian</hi> having defeated ſome of theſe <hi>Bagauds</hi> and received others into his favour, and by this means having divided them, he beſieged their great Intrenchment both by Land and by Water, with ſo great Vigour and Reſolution, that at laſt he took it. All thoſe who were found in it were put to the Sword without exception; and their ſtrong works were ſo entirely ruin'd and demoliſh'd, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them but ſome few Ditches remained We are to believe, ſaith the Author of the Life of St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boulene,</hi> that theſe Men being Christians, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their lives for the ſake of their Religion, paſſ'd through Martyrdom to the Kingdom of Heaven; and though we have not their Acts in writing, nevertheleſs their Memory and Names ſhall never be blotted out of the Book of Life. <hi>Theſe are the new Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons wherewith M.</hi> de Mezeray <hi>furniſhes the Aſſerters of the Martyrdom of the</hi> Theb. <hi>Legion. Now all theſe difficulties we are very deſirous to remove, the better to clear this piece of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Hiſtory. Firſt then it is ſuppos'd in the Objection, that moſt part of the</hi> Bagauds <hi>Army were Chriſtians, and that the Emperour</hi> Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52416:59"/>
cauſed the <hi>Theb.</hi> Legion to be cut off, for fear ſo many brave Men ſhould joyn with and ſtrengthen the Rebels. Then it is ſaid, that this Objection is taken out of an Ancient Anonymous Writer, who hath given us the Life of St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boulene,</hi> and who ought therefore to be credited, by reaſon that theſe Tranſactions happened in an Age nearer to his, than to our times. Our Anſwer to this will not a little contribute, I hope, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Falſhood of the Martyrdom of the <hi>Theb.</hi> Legion.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt</hi> in this Account of <hi>Mezeray,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Authority of that Anonymous Writer, we find the Chriſtians divided in their Practice upon a very conſiderable point of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. For ſome of them leaving the Plow take up Arms againſt their Sovereign, and others on the contrary being up in Arms lay them down, and patiently ſubmit to the Execution of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Orders of their Prince. Now to what ſhall we aſcribe this difference in their Judgment and practices? Was it that the Morality on the other ſide of the <hi>Alps</hi> differ'd from that of the <hi>Gauls?</hi> Or muſt we attribute the cauſe of this difference to the diverſity of their Climates, Educations, Tempers and Manners?

Chriſtianity would rather looſe than get by it. The Martyrdom of the <hi>Theb.

time of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> the Apoſtles and their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had publiſhed it in the moſt diſtant parts of the World; we will oppoſe nothing to this Anſwer, that may any way detract from the Antiquity of the <hi>French</hi> Churches. For beſides, that this would carry us too far beyond our purpoſe, the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, which their unworthy Poſterity have raiſed againſt us, ſhall never leſſen that high and juſt reſpect and veneration, we have always had for the firſt Churches of the <hi>Gauls.</hi> But ſuppoſe it were True, that St. <hi>Luke,</hi> St. <hi>Philip,</hi> St. <hi>Paul, Creſcent,</hi> and ſome other Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did Preach the Goſpel in <hi>Gaule,</hi> and let it be ſuppos'd likewiſe, That it is not without ground that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna, Lions, Aix, Narbonne, Sens, Paris, Reims, Limoges, and Toulouſe,</hi> do boaſt of having received the Chriſtian Religion from the Apoſtles, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Men, yet all this would not ſuffice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we ſhould alſo further ſuppoſe, that theſe firſt Preachers left there both Succeſſors and very great numbers of Converts. Nay, indeed it ought to be made out, That their Preaching proved very effectual, and made conſiderable progreſs every where. But if none but well approved Acts muſt be truſted, this matter will prove of greater difficulty than may at firſt be imagined. The Aſſembly of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy having orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>all the Biſhops to ſend</hi> Memoirs <hi>to the Meſſicurs of St.</hi> Marthe, <hi>concerning the Foundations and Antiquity of the Churches of their</hi> Dioceſes; theſe learned Men made to theſe Memoirs ſeveral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Diſcoveries of their own, and at
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52416:60"/>
laſt cauſed thoſe large Volumes of theirs, of Chriſtian <hi>France,</hi> to be Printed: 'Tis true we find in them, that the Chriſtian Religion was Preached in <hi>Gaule</hi> very early by the Apoſtles and their Diſciples; and we believe, That in that reſpect, the Titles of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Churches are as good as thoſe of many other Churches that flatter themſelves with the like belief of their having been honoured with the Preſence, and the Preaching of ſome or other of the Apoſtles, who came there in Perſon. But if you ſtrictly and <hi>impartially</hi> conſider the Works of <hi>Meſſicurs de</hi> St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi> after the Apoſtolick Age, you fall into a kind of Wilderneſs, a large waſte of almoſt 250 years, fill'd up with nothing but fabulous Legends and uncertain Traditions, except the Relations of ſome few Martyrs, as thoſe of <hi>Lions,</hi> who ſhine as Stars, in ſo profound and long a Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all the reſt being made up of nothing but groundleſs Suppoſitions, or Acts that may eaſily be proved to be ſpurious. I have by me the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Copy of the Memoirs, which <hi>Artus de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gap</hi> ſent to Mrs. <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Marthe,</hi> written by himſelf, and ſigned with his own hand. Where he proves, that St. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Diſciple of the Apoſtles, was Biſhop of <hi>Gap;</hi> and gives two Reaſons for it; the <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That before the Proteſtants had pull'd down the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Palace in the year 1577, there were ſeen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Walls of the great Hall, the Images of the Biſhops of <hi>Gap,</hi> and that St. <hi>Demetrius was at the head of them with theſe Words, Saint</hi> Demetrius <hi>the</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:52416:61"/>
               <hi>Firſt Biſhop of the Church of</hi> Gap, <hi>and Diſciple of the Apoſtles:</hi> And that by the Grace of God they had yet an Eye Witneſs of it in their Chapter, namely Mr. <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Bauvais,</hi> who when he wrote theſe things, was in the hundredth year of his Age. The other Authority he produces is taken out of a Berviary, which <hi>Bertrand</hi> of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaux</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gap,</hi> cauſed to be Printed in the year 1499, where St. <hi>Demetrius</hi> is placed in the <hi>Calender</hi> on the 26th of <hi>October,</hi> with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter <hi>of Biſhop and Martyr,</hi> and the Word <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Duplex,</hi> which according to the uſe of the Church of <hi>Gap</hi> ſignifies the ſame as <hi>(according to the uſe of the Council of</hi> Trent) <hi>Duplex primae Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> which is proper to the Feſtivals of <hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Titulars</hi> of Churches. After theſe ſo ſpecial and convincing proofs, who would venture now to deny that St. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Diſciple of the Apoſtles, did plant the Faith in the Dioceſs of <hi>Gap?</hi> That <hi>Breviary</hi> of <hi>Gap,</hi> Printed in the Year 1499. is a curious Piece indeed. We read there in the. 8th Leſſon of St. <hi>Demetrius's</hi> Office, ſpeaking of the <hi>Etymology</hi> of that Saint's Name, <hi>that</hi> Demetrius <hi>ex eo dictus, quia de Medio, id eſt, de Mundo triumphavit:</hi> And in the fourth Leſſon, that the City of <hi>Gap,</hi> having been taken by the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> Count <hi>William beat them out of it, and gave the half thereof for the Redemption of his Soul, to God and to the Bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>in the Year of our Lord</hi> 86, <hi>on the Kalends of January, in the fifth Indiction.</hi> Though it is well known to every body that the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52416:61"/>
uſe of the <hi>Indictions</hi> did not begin till three Hundred Years after Chriſt, and that the <hi>Sarazens</hi> did not make Inruptions into <hi>Gaule</hi> till ſeveral years after. Should we come to Examine nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly the traditional <hi>Origins</hi> of moſt <hi>Gallican</hi> Churches, we ſhould not, I think, find much more ſolidity in any of them. And eſpecially we may obſerve that after the Firſt Age, there happened to that kind of Traditions ſuch an Eclipſe, or Diſcontinuation, that they do'nt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear again till after the time of the General Perſecution. And yet notwithſtanding, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Mezeray</hi> and take his Anonimous Writer's bare word for it, the Chriſtians made a figure great enough at that time in <hi>Gaule,</hi> to raiſe whole Armies againſt the <hi>Emperours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, there is no need of ſtraining very much for to preſerve to the Churches of <hi>France</hi> their Antiquity, and to <hi>Sulpitius Serverus</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he deſerves in a matter of this nature. For though the Apoſtles and their Diſciples had preached the Chriſtian Religion in <hi>Gaule</hi> very early, yet this bleſſed Seed, as well as that in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, was ſoon after choak'd by thorns, and ſprung not up again till a long time after, ſo that it was very late before it came to any conſiderable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity there. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> gives us this way of ſaving both the Authority of <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> and the Antiquity of the <hi>Gallick</hi> Church, who ſaith, <hi>that about the Year</hi> 250, <hi>under the Reign of</hi> Decius, <hi>the City of</hi> Toulouſe <hi>had</hi> Saturnine <hi>for its Biſhop, and that he came from</hi> Rome <hi>with ſix</hi>

               <hi>others to preach the Goſpel in</hi> Gaule, <hi>Viz.</hi> Gatian <hi>at</hi> Tours, Trophimus <hi>at</hi> Arles, Paul <hi>at</hi> Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne, Dionyſius <hi>at</hi> Paris, Aſtremonicus <hi>at</hi> ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, <hi>and</hi> Martial <hi>at</hi> Limoges Theſe are then the new <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſent in the time of <hi>Decius,</hi> to re-kindle the Light of the Goſpel in <hi>Gaule,</hi> which had been ſo long extinguiſhed there. From whence it may be gathered that the Chriſtian Religion had not then made any great progreſs amongſt the <hi>Gauls,</hi> ſince in the Year of our Lord two hundred and fifty there was need to preach <note place="margin">Pagl. <hi>214.

            <p>But Thirdly, They are at a very great loſs for Arguments to prove the Martyrdom of their <hi>Theb.</hi> Legion, when they are forced to this ſhift of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thoſe <hi>Bagauds</hi> to have been Chriſtians.

            <p>That Prieſt of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> who wrote about the year of Our <hi>Lord</hi> 495, adds ſeveral other things, whereby the Crimes and Violences which were imputed to the <hi>Bagauds</hi> are laid to the Charge of the Governours of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> of their Judges and of the Collectors of the Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.

And beſides let the ſay what they will, they ſhall never perſwade us that in the <hi>Church</hi> of the Third Century, there were ſufficient numbers of theſe goodly <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to make up an Army. So that upon the whole it ſeems much better to reject as we do, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of the <hi>Theb.

in publick calamities, <hi>Salvian</hi> repreſents them as Perſons of a Spirit and Principles quite different from thoſe which <hi>Mezeray</hi> attributes to the <hi>Bagauds. VVhat place is there</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>where the Magiſtrates and Governours of Towns do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the entrails of the</hi> Widows <hi>and</hi> Orphans, <hi>nay and even of the Saints too, with whom they deal in like manner, becauſe either the love they have for their Religion hinders them from making any reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or their innocence and humility does not leave them the power to do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the true Spirit of the Ancient <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> Church, and we ought rather to follow <hi>Salvian,</hi> who lived nearer to thoſe firſt times of Chriſtianity, then <hi>Mazeray</hi> and the Legend-Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who ſay that the Chriſtians in <hi>Gaule</hi> roſe up in Arms, and that <hi>Maximian</hi> cauſed the <hi>Theb.</hi> Legion to be put to the ſword, for fear they ſhould joyn with and ſtrengthen that Party.

But the truth is, that though they were the moſt Submiſſive and Trueſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Princes, Nevertheleſs, becauſe they did not prefer them to God himſelf, they were deemed to fall from the duty of their Allegiance.</hi> In fine, this Anonymous Writer of <hi>Mezeray</hi>'s relates the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of the <hi>Theb. Legion</hi> very differently, both
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52416:68"/>
from the counterſeit St. <hi>Eucherius, Surius,</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chifflet.</hi> For he ſaith, that <hi>Maximian</hi> having ordered, that all the Souldiers of his Army ſhould ſwear upon the Altars of his Gods, Sacrifice to them, and oblige themſelves by an Oath, that they would perſecute the Chriſtians where-ever they ſhould meet with any of them: <hi>Mauritius</hi> anſwered for the whole <hi>Theb. Legion</hi> under his Command. <hi>We know, O Emperour, how to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Rebels and Wicked Perſons; but we know not how to make War upon Good Men, and our own Fellow Subjects: Though we are all well Arm'd, yet we do'nt make any reſistance, as being more willing to have our own blood ſhed, than to ſhed that of others. So without any more ado they ſtretched out their necks to the Executioners, and were raiſed by their Torments to the glory of Paradiſe.</hi> And thus this Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous Author leads us immediatly to the end of his Romance, whereas the ſuppoſed St. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherius,</hi> after <hi>Maximian</hi> hath given his barbarous Orders, makes the <hi>Theb. Legion</hi> to withdraw; ſuppoſes, that it refuſes to march; ſaith, that it was only decimated at firſt; makes the Emperour to reiterate his Orders, relates their Speech to this Prince; and ſo entertaining his Reader with a great number of intervening particulars, he at laſt brings him to the Cataſtrophe of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy. Whence it follows, that the Martyrdom of the <hi>Theb.

               </note>true, that this Cardinal being afterwards ſenſible of this groſs blunder, hath corrected it in his Notes on the <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrology, where he ſaith, that inſtead of <hi>Verona,</hi> we ought to read <hi>Bon,</hi> which is a Town of <hi>Germany</hi> ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate on the <hi>Rhine</hi> near <hi>Colen.</hi> But does he eſtabliſh this his correction by the authority of any more authentick Manuſcript?

            <p>Beſides, if <hi>Eutropius</hi> repreſents the <hi>Belgicks,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by the <hi>Franks,</hi> he obſerves at the ſame time, that they were Pirates who kept the Seas, and conſequently whoſe places of abode might have been at a great diſtance. ut if any body will undertake to defend <hi>Helinaud</hi>'s Relation, he will do us a kindneſs to mark us out the Province, where, he ſaith, that the <hi>Franks,</hi> when driven a ſecond time out of their own Country, came to ſettle near the Confines of the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and whereby it is ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> were Neighbours. This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular we ſhall examine no further, but leave it to the conſideration of thoſe that are better ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ancient Geography.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> what does <hi>Helinaud</hi> mean by that Town of the <hi>Franks,</hi> to which the Inhabitants gave the Name of <hi>Troy,</hi> or <hi>Xanthus,</hi> in remembrance
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52416:71"/>
of the Ancient <hi>Troy,</hi> from whence their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors came? Unleſs one ſhould imagin it to have been the ſame with <hi>Troy</hi> in <hi>Champaine,</hi> as ſome ignorant Writers have done; who were led into that miſtake by that <hi>French</hi> Name: For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently that Town was not call'd <hi>Troja,</hi> but <hi>Trecae,</hi> as appears by <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus.</hi> But <hi>Mezeray</hi> is not to be excuſed, when he pretends to find any tolerable Senſe in this Diſcourſe of <hi>Helinaud;</hi> eſpecially, when he himſelf diſcover'd ſo great a blunder in it; and which made him in his Tranſlation of this place of <hi>Helinaud,</hi> at large, to leave out the Word <hi>Xanthus,</hi> which is the Name of the River, that ran near the Walls of <hi>Troy,</hi> and which the <hi>Franks,</hi> as <hi>Helinaud</hi> ſaith, gave to their Town in remembrance of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Troy. Mezeray,</hi> who in his Hiſtory of <hi>France</hi> before <hi>Glovis,</hi> does affect to appear well verſed in the old <hi>Gallick</hi> Geography, would have been hard put to it to have produced any good Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher or exact Hiſtorian, that makes any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that <hi>Troy,</hi> built by the <hi>Franks,</hi> after they were driven the ſecond time out of their own Country. This is exactly the Fable, that was revived by the Abbot <hi>Trithemius,</hi> and is by all the Learned rejected as a Dream, though he would fain have perſwaded the World, that he collected it out of the two Famous Authors <hi>Vaſtaldus</hi> and <hi>Hunibaldus,</hi> whom he makes to ſay, That after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſome <hi>Trojans,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Francion,</hi> fixed their abode near the <hi>Palus Moeotis,</hi> from whence being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the neighbouring Nations, they retired
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52416:72"/>
into <hi>Hungary,</hi> where they built the Town, <hi>Sicam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria,</hi> which they forſook afterwards to make an Irruption into <hi>Germany,</hi> where they conquered the Country of the old <hi>Sicambrians,</hi> which they poſſeſſed till the year 420, when following the Example of the <hi>Vandals, Viſigoths</hi> and <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> they ſpread firſt into <hi>Gaule,</hi> and came to ſettle into <hi>Gueldria;</hi> but that after having got ſeveral Victories and driven the <hi>Burgundians</hi> and <hi>Viſigoths</hi> from their Conqueſts, they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the greateſt part of <hi>Gaule.</hi> All which agrees with the Romance which the <hi>Cistercian</hi> Monk hath given us, <note place="margin">Baron. <hi>tom.</hi> 2. <hi>an.</hi> 297. <hi>n.</hi> 18.</note>and wherewith he hath alſo ſet off another Romance, to wit, the <note place="margin">Celebris Temporum ſuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Scriptor, qui eadem om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ex Antiquioribus Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis accepta brevi Sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne contexuit.</note>Martyrdom of <hi>Gerion</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Theb</hi> Soldiers. Now ſhall we after all this depend upon Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> who cites <hi>Helinaud</hi> with ſuch high Commendations, calling him a Famous Writer, who took every thing he wrote out of very Ancient Monuments, and drew them up into a Compendious Hiſtory?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We have formerly obſerved, that it is very ordinary for Impoſtours to thwart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict one another; and we muſt here again make the ſame Remark, becauſe in the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Tragedy, we ſee none but Liars and Cheats appear upon the Stage. The counterfeit St. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherius</hi> ſaith not one Word there of thoſe <hi>Cohorts</hi> of the <hi>Theb. Legion,</hi> detached from <hi>Maximians</hi> Army, and ſent down the <hi>Rhine</hi> to joyn the Body which was aſſembling againſt <hi>Carauſius.</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:52416:72"/>
But according to his Acts, the whole <hi>Theb. Legion</hi> was at <hi>Agaunum,</hi> and ſuffered there. For he ſaith, that <hi>Maximian</hi> by one ſentence condemned <note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n â Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiâ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfici om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes decrevit, &amp;c.</note>all the <hi>Theb.</hi> Souldiers, and the more effectually to put his ſentence in execution, he cauſed them to be ſurrounded by ſeveral Bodies of his other <note n="*" place="margin">Sic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfecta est illa plane Angelica Legio.</note>Souldiers, and thus, ſaith he, that truly Angelical Legion was ſlain. But if we believe <hi>Helinaud,</hi> the whole Legion was not at <hi>Agaunum;</hi> for a great Detachment had been made out of it againſt <hi>Carauſius,</hi> and <hi>Gerion</hi> was Martyr'd near <hi>Colen</hi> with three hundred and eighteen Souldiers, while <hi>Victor</hi> had in another place the ſame deſtiny, with the three hundred &amp; thirty, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd him. Add to theſe, the nine who ſuffered Martyrdom near <hi>Bonne,</hi> and you ſhall find, that after <hi>Helinaud's,</hi> own reckoning ſix hundred fifty nine ſuffered in other places then at <hi>Agaunum,</hi> where the ſuppoſititious St. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherius</hi> affrms the whole Legion to have been barbarouſly ſlain.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Sixthly,</hi> becauſe theſe two Cities, <hi>Colen,</hi> and <hi>Bonne,</hi> deſirous to maintain the reputation of their Martyrs, and the worſhip which is paid to them, may replay, that St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath followed the ordinary uſe of giving the name of the whole to the moſt conſiderable part of it, and therefore that what he ſaith does not deſtroy the account given by <hi>Helinaud, Viz.</hi> That <hi>Maximian,</hi> upon his march into <hi>Gaule</hi> to ſuppreſs the <hi>Bagaudian</hi> Inſurection, underſtood, that <hi>Carauſius</hi> had revolted and threatned the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the Empire; which was the reaſon why
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52416:73"/>
he divided his Army and ſent part of it with all ſpeed againſt this Rebel: We object, that this Anſwer, and the account of <hi>Helinaud</hi> ſuppoſe, that the Revolts of the <hi>Bagauds</hi> and of <hi>Carauſius</hi> happened both at one and the ſame time, which ſuppoſitions cannot be proved. For <hi>Eutropius</hi> and <hi>Oroſius,</hi> who without doubt were better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed than <hi>Helinaud</hi> concerning theſe two Events, do exactly diſtinguiſh them; both of them ſaying, that <hi>Carauſius</hi> did not begin to move till after the <hi>Bagaudian</hi> Inſurrection was over <note place="margin">

               <hi>Theodoret,</hi> or the Reaſons which induced <hi>Baronius</hi> to change his Opinion. It is enough that by this Learned Cardinal's own Confeſſion, we know that there was a time when he thought that <hi>Mauritius</hi> and his Companions were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred at <hi>Apamea;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, that he look'd upon <hi>Eucherius</hi>'s Relation to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous; and that the <hi>Latin</hi> Writers deſigning to do Service to the Weſtern Churches, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd the Scene of this Tragedy from <hi>Syria</hi> into the <hi>Alps.</hi> We cannot pretend to know certainly the motives which <hi>Baronius</hi> had then to call in queſtion the Martyrdom of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bean</hi> Legion. Nevertheleſs, there is ſome reaſon to believe, that one of thoſe which made the ſtrongeſt impreſſion upon him, was the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſilence of the Eccleſiaſtical Writers for above Two Hundred Years after the time in which it is ſuppos'd that this Legion was cut to pieces at <hi>Agaunum.</hi> For indeed the Martyrdom of a whole Legion is ſo conſiderable an Event, that had ſuch a thing ever been, it muſt needs have been taken notice of, in above a Hundred Places of Church Hiſtory. And can any pertinent Reaſon of this general Silence be aſſigned? Thoſe who believe that a Woman poſſeſſed the <hi>Roman</hi> See, between the time of <hi>Leo</hi> the IV, and <hi>Bennet</hi> the III, have ſomething to anſwer to thoſe, who, as an Argument againſt it, preſs the Churches ſilence for above Two Hundred Years, <hi>viz.</hi> to the time of <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> who was one of the firſt who ſpoke of Pope <hi>Joan.</hi> To which they reply, that thoſe were very ignorant and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52416:75"/>
barbarous Ages, wherein Writers were very ſcarce; and that though ſome few of them may be found, yet the matters they handled had no relation to the ſucceſſion of Popes: That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thoſe who treated of it were by the care and induſtry of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wholly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, or elſe have periſhed by the ſame miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, that hath raviſhed from us ſo many other Works; That <hi>Hincmarus, Photius</hi> and the Defenders of the cauſe of the Emperours, againſt the Uſurpations of the Popes <hi>Hildebrand</hi> and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> have always ſpared the Chair of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles. What other reaſons they give for this ſilence, may be ſeen in that excellent Treatiſe concerning Pope <hi>Joan,</hi> lately publiſh'd by Mr. <hi>Spanheim.</hi> But now there is no ſubſtantial reaſon, can be given for the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Eccleſiaſtical Writers concerning the Martyrdom of the <hi>Theb.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52416:76"/>
it cannot be imagin'd he would have left it out, ſpecially when he was deſcribing the Cruelties of the Emperor <hi>Maximian,</hi> and the dreadful Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which God inflicted upon him. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore ſhall weigh with an unprejudiced Mind this ſilence of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> will doubtleſs be perſwaded, that the Martydom of the <hi>Thebean Legion</hi> is nothing but a Fiction.</p>
            <p>Though the Sufferings of Confeſſors in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral do afford a rich Field of Eloquence to Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet it muſt be granted, that there is no Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom more capable of receiving Ornament from the Pulpit, and of elevating the genius and thoughts of a Chriſtian Orator, than the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this Legion. How comes it then to paſs, that of ſo many Fathers, who have writ Homilies in the praiſe of Martyrs, none of them have ever made uſe of ſo pathetick and powerful an Example as this would have been. <hi>Ephrem,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Syria,</hi> wrote <hi>Encomiums</hi> on all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Chriſt, about the Year 360. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> hath handled the ſame Subject much about the ſame time. We have the Sermons of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> upon Martyrs in general. <hi>Aſterius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Amaſia</hi> in <hi>Pontus,</hi> who lived at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Fifth Age, hath made likewiſe a Panegyrick on all Martyrs, but none of theſe Fathers, nor any other who treated of the ſame Matter, have made the leaſt mention of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion.</p>
            <p>If any had mentioned it, it muſt have been <hi>Maximus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Turin,</hi> who died under the Reign of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> Junior: For he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52416:76"/>
wrote in the Country, where it is ſuppoſed that this Martyrdom happened, and the Memory of it would therefore have been freſh in his Days; but in all his Works there is not one Word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it. We read, amongſt his Writings that are yet extant, a Sermon, <hi>De Sanctis Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> which <hi>Gennadius</hi> hath taken notice of, and call'd, <hi>Generalem omnium Sanctorum Homiliam.</hi> But in this Sermon, there is not the leaſt ſtroak in reference to the <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion. 'Tis true, that amongſt his Works, there is another Sermon with this Title, <hi>In Natali Sanctorum Taurinorum</hi> Octavii, Aventitii &amp; Solutoris. Theſe are the ſame Saints, whoſe Names are ſeen in Capital Letters, on the Frontiſpiece of the Jeſuites Church at <hi>Turin.</hi> In which Church; there is a Chappel where the Reliques of theſe Saints are kept in an Urn, which Madam <hi>Chreſtiene</hi> of <hi>France</hi> cauſed to be made on purpoſe, with this Inſcription in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved on it, <hi>Auguſtae Taurinorum Patronis Chriſtiana à Francia.</hi> Theſe Saints have done many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, if we may believe the Vows and Offerings hung up in their Chappel; but we may obſerve, that this Sermon which we ſpeak of, is to be found amongſt thoſe of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Baſil,</hi> in the Year 1555, with this Note in the Margent, <hi>A Sermon of St.</hi> Maximus. The <hi>Benedictines</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> in their new Edition of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> do likewiſe reſtore it to that Biſhop of <hi>Turin,</hi> and ſay, that St. <hi>Maximus</hi> had been ſo converſant in the Works of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that he ſometimes uttered long Paſſages out of them in his own Sermons; the doing whereof, occaſioned
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52416:77"/>
great Confuſion in the Homilies of theſe Two Fathers; and they likewiſe judge St. <hi>Maximus</hi> to have been the Author of the Book of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments attributed to St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> However, <hi>Gennadius</hi> does not mention that Sermon in his Catalogue of <hi>Maximus</hi>'s Works. And Father <note place="margin">

But if we look for it in the Body of that Sermon, we ſhall looſe our labour. I have read it ſeveral times over, but never could find one word in it relating in the leaſt to the Martyrdom in queſtion. Should any pretend to make his beſt of the Inſcription, <hi>In Natali Sanctorum Taurinorum</hi> Octavii, Aventitii &amp; Solutoris; this Title does not import theſe Three Saints to have been <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers: For thoſe People whom the ancient Geographers called <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi> were extended far into the <hi>Cottian Alps,</hi> and into <hi>Liguria;</hi> ſo that we ought not therefore to conclude that <hi>Octavius, Aventitius</hi> and <hi>Solutor,</hi> were Three Saints particular to the City of <hi>Turin,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are called <hi>Sancti Taurinorum.</hi> In St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>'s Works, printed at <hi>Baſil</hi> in the Year 1555, there is <hi>Sanctorum Tauricorum.</hi> In the Geographical Manuſcript of <hi>Selden,</hi> there is likewiſe <gap reason="foreign">

and who can tell but <hi>St. Maximus</hi> might mean ſome Saints whoſe Zeal and conſtancy had been remarkable amongſt thoſe People called <hi>Tauriſci,</hi> who are placed by ſome Geographers in the Fifth <hi>Rhetia.</hi> If we had that Manuſcript of <hi>St. Maximus,</hi> mentioned by the <hi>Benedictine Monks,</hi> in their new Edition of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> we might perhaps make ſome other Remarks on the Title of that Sermon: But without examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Titles of St. <hi>Maximus</hi>'s Sermons be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and writ by himſelf, here is a Proof, that <hi>Octavius, Aventitius,</hi> and <hi>Solutor,</hi> were not <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, and ſuch a Proof that nothing can be replied againſt it. The Counterfeit St. <hi>Eucherius,</hi> does not mention any of thoſe in his Relation; but ſaith, that in his time none of them were known by Name, except them following, <hi>viz. Mauritius, Exuperius, Candidus, Victor,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Victor</hi> who ſuffered Death at <hi>Soleur,</hi> with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſus;</hi> adding that the Names of the others were unknown to him, but were written in the Book of Life. As we believe the Author of the Acts of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers more modern than St. <hi>Maximus,</hi> this ſufficeth to convince us, that the Three Saints whoſe Piety this Biſhop of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> did formerly celebrate, were not <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers. But to prevent all cavilling about the time in which St. <hi>Eucherius</hi> might have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, we ſhall produce other Writers, who lived ſome Ages after St. <hi>Maximus. Ado,</hi> died about the Year of our Lord, 875. This <hi>Ado</hi> who was Arch-biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> hath collected all the Names of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers that were

               <note place="margin">Ado Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. <hi>7.</hi> Kal. <hi>7.</hi> bris.</note> heard of in his Time, thirteen whereof he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons in his Martyrology, to wit, <hi>Mauritius, Exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perius, Candidus, Moloſſus, Victor, Innocentius, Vetalis Gerion, Victor, Orſus, Alexander, Secundus</hi> and <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Amongſt which we find not either <hi>Octavius, Aventitius,</hi> or <hi>Solutor.</hi> Now <hi>Vienna</hi> being but fifty Leagues diſtant from <hi>Turin,</hi> had theſe Saints, whoſe Memory was celebrated in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> been generally thought to have been <hi>Theb.</hi> Souldiers, there is no Likelihood, that <hi>Ado</hi> would have left them out of his Catalogue. This reaſon is yet more confirmed by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuard</hi>'s ſilence upon it, who was a <hi>Monk</hi> of St. <hi>Germains,</hi> and contemporary with <hi>Ado</hi> He formed the deſign of making a <hi>Martyrology</hi> both more exact and copious than any that had appear'd before: For he thought, that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> had handled this matter too careleſly; and it is even reported, That the Emperor <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> the <hi>Bald,</hi> to whom he dedicated his Book, had ſet him at work. And therefore it is more likely, that he did every thing anſwerable to the Zeal of his Age for Martyrs and Reliques. Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, his diligence and all the care he took, could effect no more than the Diſcovery which he made of two other <hi>Theb. Souldiers,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Florentius,</hi> who are alſo recorded by <hi>Helinand,</hi> But further, had it paſſed for current, at that time, that the three Saints in St. <hi>Maximus</hi>'s Sermon were <hi>Theb. Souldiers,</hi> 'tis very improbable, that they could have eſcaped the diligent Search of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuard.</hi> If after this, any one ſhould alledge to us the Lives of Saints, as the Legends of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, Aventitius</hi> and <hi>Soluter,</hi> we have no other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52416:78"/>
for them, but that there are none ſo blind, as they that will not ſee. But ſince it hath ſo fallen out, that <hi>Maximus</hi> his Sermon hath given us an occaſion to ſpeak of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> we ought not to paſs by, without ſome Reflection, the Silence of this Father in this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the <hi>Theb.

The time he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved was not long after that, wherein it is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the <hi>Theb. Legion</hi> was cut off. He was Biſhop at <hi>Milan,</hi> not very far diſtant from <hi>Agau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> where this Martyrdom is ſaid to have happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and he had converſed ſometimes with <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Octodurum</hi> or <hi>Martigni,</hi> where <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaunum</hi> is ſituated Both theſe Biſhops were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Council of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> aſſembled to give a deciſion in the cauſe of <hi>Palladius</hi> and <hi>Secundianus, Arrian</hi> Biſhops in <hi>Illyria.</hi> They met again at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> where <hi>Theodorus</hi> ſigned the Letter, which St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and the other Biſhops wrote to Pope <hi>Siricius,</hi> concerning the condemnation of <hi>Jovinian,</hi> who had uttered blaſphemous Expreſſions againſt the Virginity of the Bleſſed Mother of God. And though the falſe St. <hi>Eucherius,</hi> in the Letter already related, does write to the Biſhop <hi>Salvius,</hi> That <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> whom he calls <hi>vir anterioris Temporis</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>Iſaac Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> of all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Martyrdom of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> it does not appear, that he ever ſpoke of it to St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſeeing there is not the leaſt notice tak'n of it in all the Works of this Father.</p>

But let us come now to another ſort of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ask the Fathers, who have compoſed Chronologies or Church-Hiſtories.

of <hi>Euſebius</hi> in collecting the Acts of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. It is ſaid in that Letter, that the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> at his arrival at <hi>Ceſarea</hi> permitted <hi>Euſebius</hi> to ask him whatever he had moſt a mind to, and that <hi>Euſebius</hi> deſired him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that they ſhould ſend him from all the Courts and Tribunals of Judicature throughout the Empire, all the Proceſſes, Tryals and Sentences concerning Martyrs, that ſo he might be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly inform'd of their right Names, Qualities and Numbers, and alſo of the different kinds of their Torments and Death, and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, Towns, and Days of their Excecutions, and laſtly with what Patience and Courage they had ſuffered their Torments. Therefore <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Boſtra</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> thinking to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the Glory and Reputation of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> ſaid in his confutation of <hi>Origen's</hi> Apology. <hi>I allow</hi> Euſebius <hi>to be excellently vers'd in Hiſtory,</hi> and that there is nothing in the <hi>Monuments</hi> of Antiquity which he is unacquainted with; but the Emperours Authority favouring his deſign, it was an eaſy thing for him to gather up whatever Writings were ſcattered all over the World. So that <hi>Euſebius</hi> having ſo many ways of being imformed of the Truth, of the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Martyrdom, no body can deny but he is a well qualify'd Witneſs, to be call'd and heard upon this Matter of Fact. And ſo much the rather, becauſe he not only was alive at the time of this Martyrdom, but of age to know what was then tranſacted. In the firſt Book of <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> Life he ſaith, that in his youth he firſt ſaw this

The Learned Doctor <hi>Cave</hi> conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, that he was born about the Year 270. As to the time of <hi>Gallienus</hi>'s Death we are under great uncertainties.

But it is not our buſineſs here to caſt the Horoſcope of this Father, or to make an exact Calculation of the time of his Nativity, it is ſufficient to our purpoſe that the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances here ſpecify'd will make it appear that <hi>Euſebius</hi> was at leaſt fifteen or ſixteen Years old, when <hi>Maximian</hi> went into <hi>Gaule,</hi> in the Year 285, the very time wherein the <hi>Theb.

We are then much in the right to produce <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in this cauſe as a Witneſs very fit to inform us about the Truth of Falſehood of the Martyrdom of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52416:80"/>
               <hi>Theb. Legion.</hi> But in all his Works there is not one Word ſpok'n either of this <hi>Legion,</hi> or of this Martyrdom.

His Eighth Book is nothing but an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Narrative, both of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Cruelties, and of all the great Examples of Zeal and Conſtancy, which the Chriſtians of all Orders and Conditions ſoever gave in thoſe times.

Now to let you ſee the very Foundation on which <hi>Gregories</hi> own belief of this matter was eſtabliſh'd, I ſhall only tranſcribe the Place where he ſpeaks of it in the Tenth Book of his Hiſtory of <hi>France. I found,</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:52416:82"/>
ſaith <hi>he, a little Cheſt in St.</hi> Martin's <hi>Treaſury in which our Fathers had depoſited the Reliques of the</hi> Agaunian <hi>Martyrs, as I was informed by ſome very aged Prieſts. The very Seal which their Piety had put to it, was by old Age and Rottenneſs quite worn away; and it happened, that during the ſolemn Office that was celebrated to their Honour in the Eve of their Feſtival, it came into my thoughts to take a Torch, and view them more carefully. Now while I was a ſearching with great attention, one of the Porters told me, Here is a Stone with a Cover upon it, what may be in it, I cannot tell, neither did my Predeceſſors, to whoſe Cuſtody theſe things were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, know any more of it than my ſelf; if you pleaſe, I will bring it hither, that we may ſee what it contains; and when he had brought it, I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and found a little Silver Trunk, wherein were not only ſome Reliques of the Martyrs of the Bleſſed Legion, but alſo of ſeveral Holy Martyrs and Confeſſors. We found likewiſe in the ſame Trunk, ſeveral other hallowed Stones, with ſome Reliques of the Apoſtles and other Martyrs.</hi> From which Words, we may judge not only of the Character of this <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> but alſo of the genius of his Age. However, both he and <hi>Venantius</hi> were without doubt great Men, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the time they lived in; nor do we ſuſpect either of them of Fraud or Impoſture, but only ſay, that they were too credulous, and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> were then ſtrangely affected and hankering after Reliques and Miracles. Do but read the 30th Epiſtle of the Third Book of <hi>Gregory,</hi> the 28th Chapter of St. <hi>Austin, de Opere Monachorum,</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:52416:83"/>
the 62d Canon of the Council of <hi>Lions,</hi> and the 7th Act of the Second Council of <hi>Nicea,</hi> and you may ſee what a ſcandalous Trade was then droven with the Limbs and Bones of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, which were broke in Peices, and tranſported from Town to Town, and from one Province into another, under pretence of Devotion. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> even then lamenting, ſaid, <hi>That the Bodies of ſeveral Perſons were had in veneration upon the Earth, whoſe Souls were tormented in Hell-fire.</hi> And it was not without reaſon that he thus complain'd, for do but read St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Life, in <hi>Sulpitius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> who ſaith there, <hi>That the People of</hi> Tours <hi>ran in great Grouds to a Place where they thought ſome Martyrs had been buried. That the common Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was, that the Altar there had been erected by the ancient Biſhops of</hi> Tours. <hi>But that St.</hi> Martin <hi>having not been able to learn any thing for certain from the eldeſt Prieſts of his Clergy, concerning the Names of thoſe Martyrs, and the time of their Death, was in great perplexity and doubt about this matter, fearing on the one ſide to cauſe ſome prejudice to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if he ſhould forbear his uſual coming to that Place, and on the other to increaſe Superſtition, if he had authorized it by his preſence. But one day being gone thither with ſome of his Brethren, and having pray'd to God to diſcover to him who it was who was there buried; he ſaw on his Left-hand a frightful and deformed Spectre, which he commanded to tell what it was. Whereunto the Shade anſwered, I am a Robber condemned formerly for Crimes to an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Death. The Error of the People makes me here to be honoured, but I have no part with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:52416:83"/>
               <hi>they being in Glory, and I in Torments. After which, St.</hi> Martin <hi>cauſed the Altar to be thrown down, and freed the People of</hi> Tours <hi>from that groſs Superſtition.</hi> This Example alone may ſuffice to ſhew, that in matter of Reliques, Impoſtures are no new Device. Moreover, it ſerves to diſcover the falſe Zeal of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of the Sixth Age, and the ignorance and baſe connivance of the Biſhops and Prieſts, in not repreſſing the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of it. <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> hath told us juſt now, that it was the common Opinion that the Altar upon the Grave of that Robber had been erected by the ancient Biſhops of <hi>Tours.</hi> Now after this, is it ſo much to be wondred at, for the Good-Man <hi>Gregory,</hi> who a Hundred Years after was made Biſhop of <hi>Tours,</hi> to be deceived himſelf by ſome uncertain Tradition, or that he ſhould give ſo much Credit to an Inſcription upon the little Truck, in which were ſuppoſed to be ſhut up the Reliques of the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs? Now from St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s time, the evil was ſo far from diminiſhing, that it increaſed more and more. Religion and Piety did then it ſeems chiefly conſiſt in ſearching the Graves, looking for the Bodies of Saints, erecting Altars, and contriving all ſorts of ways to honour them. The Sixth Age having brought into the Church, St. <hi>Bennet</hi> and his Rule, his Children departed very ſoon from the Inſtitution of their Holy Founder, applying themſelves wholly to get plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Poſſeſſions, and large Revenues. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, their Reliques and Miracles, were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt means in the World for that purpoſe, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52416:84"/>
God knows how they improv'd the knack they had already got of making uſe of them; for it is certain, that they owe moſt of their vaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes and Eſtates to meer Dreams and <hi>Chimaeras</hi> like that of the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Martyrs. Then the Old Saints grew out of date, and new ones came in Faſhion, being reputed to exceed the others in multiplicity of Miracles. Therefore they found the way to dig every Day a new one out of the Ground, as if the Prieſts of thoſe times had made uſe of a <hi>Divining Rod,</hi> to find out Bodies of Saints. No wonder therefore if ſome Martyrs of the Second and Third Age, unknown to <hi>Euſebius, Oroſius,</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> were diſcovered ſince by ſome Monks of the Eighth and Ninth Century.</p>
            <p>It is very probable, if I may give my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Acts of the <hi>Agaunian</hi> Martyrs were forged towards the end of the Sixth Age, or at the beginning of the Seventh, the Author of them ſaith, <hi>That the Names of the</hi> Thebean <hi>Souldiers are written in Heaven, and that only theſe following were come to his knowledge,</hi> viz. Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Exuper, Candidus, Orſus, <hi>and the Two</hi> Victors. But it ſeems not long after, ſome others began to peep out; <hi>Ado,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> who wrote towards the middle of the Ninth Century, adds to theſe <hi>Maloſius, Victor, Innocent, Vitalis, Gerion, Alexander, Secundus</hi> and <hi>Antoninus. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuard</hi> a Benedictine Monk of St. <hi>Germans,</hi> had the good luck to find out Two more, namely <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Florentius.</hi> In the <hi>Archives</hi> of <hi>Treves</hi> is kept the Hiſtory of <hi>St. Thirſus,</hi> wherein is mentioned

               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to ſeek the things that are above, but the Monks of the Tenth Century, preſſed them to nothing ſo much, as to look into the things that are below, and to ſearch into the Graves. And though Chriſt had ſaid, ſpeaking of himſelf, that <hi>where the Body was, there the Eagles ſhould gather alſo;</hi> yet the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did now, no longer with <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> frequent the Sepulchre of our Lord.

But above all, the Town of <hi>Turin</hi> brags of having been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd with their Spoils. In the Abbey of <hi>St. Solutor</hi> are kept ſome Reliques with this Title, <hi>Reliquiae Sancti Benigni</hi> Thebenſis. They ſhew in the ſame Abbey, a Manuſcript, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are recorded the Lives of <hi>Solutor, Adventor</hi> and <hi>Octavius,</hi> ſet off with all thoſe incidents and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, which generally adorn the common Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends. The Jeſuites of <hi>Turin</hi> have made a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den diſcovery all at once, of <hi>Ciro, John, Cacuſat, Chryſogon, Cyriacus, Felix, Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Achilles,</hi> as they inform us in the Hiſtory which they have publiſhed of the Holy Martyrs, <hi>Abondius</hi> and <hi>Abondantius.</hi> When you have paſſed the Bridge of <hi>Turin,</hi> and taken your way towards the Mountain that leads to <hi>Chiers,</hi> you find on the ſide of the River <hi>Pô,</hi> a little Chappel, where there is an Inſcription which I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt my Papers, but by miſchance it hath been almoſt blotted out; however here is the remainder of it. <hi>D.

               <hi>excitavit . . . . an</hi> 1654. I remember that the Names of two <hi>Theb.</hi> Souldiers are to be ſeen there. And it is certain, that if in travelling through <hi>Italy,</hi> One would be at the trouble to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Saints of every particular Place, and to read both the printed and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript Lives of Saints that are kept in the Archives of the Cathedral Churches, there would great numbers of <hi>Theb.</hi> Souldiers ſtart up from behind the buſhes, who had no other being but what they received from the Monks of the laſt Ages, in order to ſerve their turns and promote the Trade they made of the poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's ſuperſtition. However it be, as the caſe ſtands, I have in this Diſſertation ſtruck of from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church 6666 Saints, as the learned Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> with one daſh of his Pen had taken lately from them eleven thouſand.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Mr. <hi>Menage</hi> tells us, that <hi>Francis de Harlay,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> having choſen ſome of the moſt underſtanding Men of his Clergy in 1680, to reviſe and reform the Breviary for the uſe of the Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors thought fit to expunge the Life of St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine,</hi> looking upon the Acts of her Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as a meer Fiction. The Biſhops of St. <hi>Pons,</hi> in the year 1684, took from the Calendar of his Dioceſs about ſixty Holy-days, amongſt which were St. <hi>Amarante,</hi> the Immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52416:86"/>
of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> &amp;c. He is a Prelate, who has very much diſtinguiſhed himſelf both by his Learning and Piety, but who had the misfortune to incur the hatred of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits as being a Diſciple of the famous Biſhop of <hi>Alet;</hi> and alſo to diſpleaſe the Court for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to perſecute the Proteſtants of his Dioceſs, and not following Cardinal <hi>Bonzi,</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of his Cabal, in Voting in the States of <hi>Lauguedoc</hi> the Subſidies that were demanded by the <hi>French</hi> King. Therefore the Jeſuites looking for an occaſion to bring him into Trouble, the Abbot of <hi>Aulergues,</hi> his Archdeacon, devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſerve their Revenge. So that if an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon is call'd in the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church <hi>Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Epiſcopi,</hi> it may be well ſaid, that here the Light of the Body became darkneſs. This Abbot appealed from his Biſhop againſt the Reformation of his Calendar to the Parliament of <hi>Toulouſe.</hi> The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites who cared but little for the other Saints, but reſented very much the diſgrace put upon their St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> procured an Order from the Court to that Parliament, that they ſhould favour the Abbot's Cauſe without further delay. I was then at <hi>Toulouſe,</hi> where I was oblig'd to ſtay during the Months of <hi>July, Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> at which time the Cauſe was Pleaded. I was preſent at the hearing, and the Kings Attorney broke into a furious paſſion againſt the Biſhop of St. <hi>Pons,</hi> and taking occaſion from the Feaſt of the Immaculate Conception, to ſpeak of the Honours due to the Bleſſed Virgin, he carry'd

                  </gap>.</hi> But at laſt the Archdeacon's Appeal was declared frivolous and faulty. The Biſhop of St. <hi>Pons,</hi> was maintained in the power which the Councils of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church gave to their Biſhops of making a Calendar, and regulating the Church Service of their Dioceſs. And this Sentence was the effect of the Virtue and Honeſty of the firſt Preſident, who without contradiction was a Great Magiſtrate and worthy of a better Age.</p>
            <p>I have related theſe Facts upon this Account only, that they of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, who may read this Work of mine, may ſee, that I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to queſtion the Truth of the Acts of ſome of their Saints, ſince ſome of the greateſt Men of their Communion have done the ſame, and do agree that many falſe ones are found amongſt them. And if ſome Preachers ſhould not like our Endeavours in expoſing the Falſhood of the Martyrdom of the <hi>Theb.

            <head type="sub">That the Fabulous Relations of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Agaunian</hi> Martyrs, and other fictitious Saints, are ſufficient to destroy all the Reaſons brought by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to justify the VVorſhip they pay to Saints.</head>
            <p>THE firſt ſhift of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church in this matter, is, to diſtinguiſh Worſhip into Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and Relative, Mediate and Immediate. They ſay, that God alone ought to be the Object of abſolute and immediate Worſhip, but that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52416:88"/>
and Mediate Worſhip, may be paid to Saints and Angels, ſince it paſſeth only through them, and terminates in God. That this is but a mere Evaſion, our Writers have ſhewed a thouſand times. And more than that, they have proved, that upon Examination of the Matter of Fact, it is not true neither, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church renders to the deceaſed Saints, only mediate and relative Honours. For this diſtinction hath place only in their Schools, being no way diſcernible in their Practice. They make no diſtinction as to Place, ſince they worſhip both God and the Saints in the ſame Churches; nor in reſpect of time, for as God hath his, ſo the Saints have likewiſe their Holy-days; nor yet in the Church-Service, ſince the Saints are mentioned four or five times in the Service of the Maſs, which they offer moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to God; nay, not ſo much as in the bodily Poſtures of the Worſhippers, ſince they fall down on their Knees, and make the ſame bodily Proſtrations before God and his Saints. Neither can it be diſtinguiſh'd in the quality of their Petitions, ſince they who pray to Saints, ask pardon of them for their Sins, and the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt; No more is it in the multitude of their Prayers; for they will ſay ten <hi>Ave Maria</hi>'s to one <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> So that the Saints do, if I may ſo ſay, reap all the Worſhip of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and God, who ſhould gather the whole, hath only the Tithe of it. This diſtinction therefore hath place no where but in Diſputes, no real difference being perceivable between the Honours paid to God, and the Saints. Our Writers have likewiſe diſcuſſed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52416:88"/>
the Queſtion, <hi>de Jure, viz.</hi> whether it be lawful to beſtow upon the Creatures a Worſhip which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in God. Their Writings are full of good Reaſons ſhewing that religious Worſhip is the Glory of God's Excellency, and that not ſo much as the leaſt portion of this Glory can be beſtow'd upon the Saints, without provoking the anger of that Jealous God. 'Tis true, that in coming near to God to know him, we may make uſe of the Creatures as ſteps to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Him: But when we approach God in the duty of Worſhip, all our Thoughts, Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Affections ought wholly to be fix'd upon him alone. We ought then to baniſh the thoughts of all created beings out of our Minds, and ſo to Bleſs, Pray to and Worſhip him, as if there were none but He and We in the World. But when all is done, what uſe ſoever they may make in their Diſputes of the diſtinction of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip into Abſolute and Relative, 'tis certain the Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church can make none of it, when we charge them with calling upon ſuch Saints, as never had any being in the World, ſuch for inſtance, as <hi>St. Longinus, St. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher, St. Catharine,</hi> the eleven thouſand Virgins, and the Souldiers of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion. They cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſurely have the face to ſay, That the Worſhip paid to theſe pretended Saints, hath any relation to God, or terminates in him. And therefore they ought to confeſs, that their Church hath erred, and is yet in errour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors, to juſtifie the Worſhip they pay to the Saints, ſay, that all
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52416:89"/>
their Prayers to them do amount to no more, according to the intention of their Church, than barely to deſire them that they would pleaſe to pray to God for them. To which it hath been replyed and abundantly proved, that the Uſe and Form of the Terms, do determine the quality of Prayers, and not the Intention of the Church; that if the Matter, or the Form of Prayers be faulty, it is not the Intention of the Church that can rectify them; and that the Common People mind only the literal ſignification of Prayers, and never think while they are pronouncing them, of giving a Catholick ſenſe to Idolatrous Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Why then do they put ſo many ignorant People in danger of making unlawful Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? Why do they give Proteſtants ſo great an occaſion of Scandal? Why do they not take out of their Prayer-Books and Breviaries all thoſe Forms of Prayer in which they ask the Saints <hi>to have mercy on them, to cleanſe them from their Sins by their Merits, to illuminate their hearts, and to excite in them a true Repentance?</hi> If this Principle of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church had any good foundation, I don't ſee why ſhe might not as well have put an <hi>Arrian Creed</hi> into her <hi>Liturgy,</hi> with a warning to her Children to follow her Intentions, and give an Orthodox ſenſe to that <hi>Heretical-Creed.</hi> It would prove a hard matter to reduce to an <hi>Orate pro nobis</hi> that Prayer uſed at the Conſecration of their Altars; <hi>Sanctify O Lord this Stone to thine Honour, to the Honour of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and to the Honour of all Saints.</hi> You ſee here the Saints and the Bleſſed Virgin joyn'd equally with God.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52416:89"/>

And from hence we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church pays to the Saints a Religious. Worſhip of the ſame nature with that which ſhe gives to God; For otherwiſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> does not argue well when <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellarm.</hi> lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Chr. cap. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note>he proves from the Form of Baptiſm, that the Holy Ghoſt, being joined therein with the Father and the Son, ought therefore to be eſteemed, God, as well as the Father and the Son. <hi>Go and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe all Nations in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But what can the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church reply, when it is objected that ſhe prays to Saints who never had any being, as <hi>St. Chriſtopher, St. Catharine,</hi> the eleven thouſand Virgins, and the Souldiers of the <hi>Theb. Legion?</hi> Let theſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be reduced as much as they pleaſe to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Spirit of the Church, yet ſhe cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify them, and therefore ſhe muſt confeſs that ſhe hath erred, and is yet in error.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Worſhip they pay to the Saints, ſay, That they pray to them in the ſame manner as we pray our living Brethren to intercede for us. But had they not thus explain'd their meaning by the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux's</hi> Pen, we would hardly believe that they were in good earneſt. What! Is there then no difference between the Prayers which the Sick Proteſtants deſire to be made for them in their Churches, that God would comfort and relieve them in their ſeveral neceſſities, and thoſe which the Papiſts direct to their Saints? When the Proteſtants deſire theſe Offices of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52416:90"/>
of their Brethren, do they ask them after the ſame manner, and in the ſame order as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church implores the Interceſſion and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of her Saints? Do they conſecrate Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days and Altars to them? Build them Churches? Make Vows and Pilgrimages to their Honour? Do they light Wax-candles before their Images? Approach them with Cenſers? Preſent them with Offering? And make Proceſſions and Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities in honour of their Memories? Quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Our Brethren are there preſent with us, where they ſee our neceſſities with their own Eyes, and we deſire them to joyn with us in Prayer. We don't look upon them as if they were of a ſuperior Order to us, but as Fellow Labourers, ſubject to the ſame weakneſſes and infirmities as we are, and thereby ingaged to compaſſionate our ſufferings. Our practice is authorized by the Example of the Faithful of all Ages, and by <note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> James <hi>cb.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note>the expreſs command of the Apoſtle <hi>St. James,</hi> who exhorteth us to Pray one for another. But the <hi>Romiſh</hi> practice is very far from having a Title to any of theſe advantages. Under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament no Prayers were ever made to the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saints, though the Faithful prayed one for another, as we do. Notwithſtanding they had at that time Saints whoſe Holineſs could not be call'd in queſtion, ſince God himſelf had, if I may ſo ſpeak, canonized <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Enoch.</hi> All theſe Anſwers are ſolid and good. But how can they apply this? Or what other Anſwer can they make, when we charge them with praying to ſuch Saints as never were in the World, ſuch
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52416:90"/>
as <hi>St. Chriſtopher, St. Catharine,</hi> the eleven thouſand Virgins, and the Souldiers of the <hi>Theb.</hi> Legion, ſeeing theſe Saints were only meer fictions and the invention of <hi>Legend</hi>-Writers? They cannot ſure anſwer that they Pray to theſe after the ſame Manner, as we do to our living Brethren; and therefore they ought to confeſs that they have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and do remain ſtill in error.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Evaſion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church is to have recourſe to the equivocal Senſe of the Terms Worſhip and Adoration. They ſay, that there is a Supream Worſhip and Adoration of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi> and that God alone deſerves this Worſhip and Adoration; but that there is an inferiour Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and a Service of <hi>Dulia,</hi> which we ought to pay to Angels and Saints. But this Diſtinction is not in, nor is it grounded upon, Scripture. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of the Term <hi>Dulia,</hi> when he ſpeaks of the Supream Worſhip, telling the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Theſs. 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.</note>
               <hi>That they turn'd to God from Idols to ſerve the Living and True God.</hi> And the <hi>Septuagint</hi> have uſed it in the ſame Senſe, 1. <hi>Sam. c.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 3. and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 11. and on the contrary, they have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by that of <hi>Latria,</hi> the Services which Men do one to another in that Threatning, which God makes to his People, <hi>That they ſhould ſervetheir E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 29. <hi>verſ.</hi> 48.</note>
               <hi>which God would ſend againſt them in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and in thirſt and in nakedneſs.</hi> But beſides, this Diſtinction is very inſignificant; for let the Terms be never ſo Equivocal, yet the things expreſſed by them are not ſo. For Churches, Feſtivals, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Vows, Offerings, Lights, and Proceſſions are not Equivocal things, but determined to the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52416:91"/>
higheſt ſort of Religious Worſhip. To prove this, let an <hi>Indian</hi> or a <hi>Chineſe</hi> go into a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church, tell him, That this Temple is conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Aſſiſe;</hi> that this is his Holy-day, and that they are going to make a Proceſſion to his Honour; That the Image which he ſeeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with ſo many flowers, and illuminated with ſo many Torches is his Repreſentation. And let him ſee afterwards all the People proſtrating themſelves before it, in order to the Addreſſing their Prayers to it: And then ask him, what this People is a doing? He will anſwer, that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore St. <hi>Francis,</hi> or his Image, the ſimple Notions of Nature leading him to that Anſwer, becauſe all the Actions of this People are determined to Religion, which being taken altogether are the formal and diſtinct Signs of the Supreme Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And therefore it is in vain for them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to palliate the Matter by a pretended e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal uſe of Words. Had the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors been pleaſed to expreſs themſelves more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there would have been no wrangling about the Terms. We acknowledg, that the Acts of Religion are not all of the ſame Weight and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. The <hi>firſt</hi> are thoſe that are call'd <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite</hi> and <hi>Immediate,</hi> which are referred only to God. The <hi>ſecond</hi> are grounded upon the reference or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which certain Things and Perſons have to Religion. In this Rank we place the reverence due to Paſtors, to Churches, Holy Veſſels, to the Elements of the Sacraments, to Saints, to Angels, to the bleſſed Mother of God; That is, That there are ſome Degrees of reſpect due to each of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52416:91"/>
theſe, in proportion to the Rank which they hold in Religion, and to the Account which God makes of them. The laſt Sorts of Religious Acts are thoſe that are commanded by Religion it ſelf, as for Example, the Submiſſion and Honour we owe to Parents and Magiſtrates. But if theſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies were fairly manag'd, all the Diſpute would be about the firſt Sort of theſe Acts of Religion, which are call'd in the Language of the Schools, <hi>Elicite</hi> and <hi>Immediate,</hi> and ſuch as God reſerves pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly to himſelf, with excluſion of the nobleſt and moſt exalted Rank of Created Beings, ſuch, for inſtance, as <hi>Invocation, Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>v.</hi> 15 <hi>Truſt and Affiance Jer.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Vows, Iſa.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Worſhip, Sacrifice and Adoration, Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 50. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. Theſe are the Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which we accuſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Saints. Thoſe amongſt them who pretended to devotion, make Vows to the Saints upon every occaſion, though St. <hi>Thomas</hi> hath ſaid, that a Vow is an Act of <hi>Latria.</hi> But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this be, the Equivocal Senſe of the term Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, can do them no ſervice, where they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of paying a Religious Worſhip to Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Saints, ſuch as <hi>St. Chriſtopher, St. Longine, St. Catharine,</hi> the eleven thouſand Virgins, and the Souldiers of the <hi>Theb.</hi> Legion. They cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they pay theſe Saints only a Worſhip of <hi>Dulia,</hi> &amp; Honours much inferior to the Supream. They ought therefore to confeſs that they have erred, and do ſtill perſiſt in their error.</p>

But to this have not we juſt reaſon to reply, that God alone knows the Affections of the Heart, and that we cannot judge of them but by Mens Words and Actions? We don't pretend to uſurp the Prerogative of God, and ſhould be very unwilling to paſs a raſh Judgment upon Men. <hi>Moſes</hi> hath taught us, that <hi>ſecret things belong to the Lord our God;</hi> and Chriſt hath told us, that <hi>we ſhall know Men by their Fruits;</hi> that is, by their Words and Actions. This way of paſſing Judgment upon Mens Hearts, is ſo common a notion, and ſo univerſal a Principle, that all Men in the World do follow it in the judgments they make of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

               </note>of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy, who accuſe us of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in finding fault with their Church for its paying to Saints a prohibited Worſhip, ſince our Accuſation is founded upon their Words and Actions. For let them ſay what they pleaſe, that they do not form the ſame Idea of the Saints, as they do of an Infinite and Supream Being, and that their Prayers to God are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Affections far more lively, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and humble, than thoſe they addreſs to the Saints: This is known to none but God, and diſcernable only by his all-ſeeing Eye. And all that we ſee and hear of their Performance
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52416:92"/>
towards the Saints, as Prayers, Temples, Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, Illuminations, Burning of Incenſe, Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Proſtrations; all theſe things, I ſay, are the proper and formal Characters of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Worſhip, which God hath in a peculiar manner reſerved to himſelf. Are we then in the wrong, to conclude that they carry the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours they render to the Saints too far? The <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> in that Book of theirs, intituled the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Hereſie, charged the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> with making the Pope a God by their Tenet, that the Pope is infallible, becauſe Infallibility is a property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing only to God. But we have yet more reaſon to reproach the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for dealing with Saints as if they were Gods, not only upon account of the external Worſhip ſhe pays to them, but alſo becauſe of the good things ſhe asks of them, which ſuppoſe that they know the Hearts of Men, are preſent every where, and have an unlimited power; all which, are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties belonging only to the Supream being. But after all, ſuppoſe it ſhould be true, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church puts a great difference between the Thoughts that accompany the Prayers to God, and thoſe addreſſed to the Saints, we leave every wiſe Man to conſider, whether this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Thoughts, does not raiſe in the Mind troubleſome Scruples, and hinder its due applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and adherence to God. Theſe Theological Principles leave one always unquiet and uneaſie, for fear of going beyond, or ſtopping ſhort of the Mark. Thus far in their Opinion the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is lawful and right, but to go ever ſo little
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52416:93"/>
further, is Idolatry. When thoſe who repeat after the Prieſt the Confeſſion of Sins at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Maſs, hear him ſay, <hi>I confeſs to God Almighty,</hi> they muſt mind to do an Act of <hi>Latria,</hi> but when he adds, <hi>and to the Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> they muſt take care to deſcend lower to <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulia,</hi> and when he goes on ſaying, <hi>to the Angels, and to the Saints, to the Holy Apoſtles,</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul, &amp;c. it would be a Crime, ſhould they offer to them any of the Two former kinds of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and therefore they muſt paſs to that of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi> If an Image be preſented to them, they are to offer but a relative honour to it; but let it be a little piece of the true Croſs, they may go as far as the indirect <hi>Latria.</hi> And becauſe theſe different Worſhips are often mix'd in the ſame Service and Litanies, we leave it again to Wiſe Men to conſider, whether all thoſe who are preſent at theſe Church-Services, have in that inſtant of time all theſe diſtinctions preſent in their Minds; whether they be all capable of theſe nice and refined ſubtilties of the Schools; and whether all this be proper to raiſe the heart, and to inflame true piety. At leaſt, our Religion hath this advantage above theirs, that God alone being propoſed to us as the Object of our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Prayers, we need not buſie our Minds about any of theſe Diſtinctions; no ſcruple ariſes to diſturb our Zeal, we embrace the Divine Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with all our Heart, and with all our Soul, free from fears and danger of running beyond the Mark. But after all, this difference of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52416:93"/>
Thoughts in their Prayers, will do them no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as to the worſhip which they render to Saints that never exiſted, ſuch as St. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> the Eleven Thouſand Virgins, and the Souldiers of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion. Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mere <hi>Chimeras</hi> and groundleſs fancies, which deſerve not any the leaſt reſpect; they who pay any ſort of Religious Worſhip to them, ought to confeſs, that they have been, and are, yet in Error.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> Subterfuge of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is, that they make great difference between Chriſt's Mediation, and that of the Saints. For, ſay they, Chriſt is a Mediator of Redemption, and the Saints are only Mediators of Interceſſion. But in anſwer to this, all the Functions of the Mediator of Redemption, may be reduced to theſe Three principal ones. Firſt, Chriſt hath taught Men the true and only way that leadeth to Heaven, <hi>having brought Life and Immortality to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10.</note>
               <hi>light, through the Goſpel.</hi> Secondly, Chriſt by his Death, hath reconciled God to Men, and the Merits of his Croſs, are the ſource of their Peace and Righteouſneſs, <hi>God having made him to be ſin</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 21.</note>
               <hi>for us, who knew no ſin, that we ſhould be the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God in him.</hi> In the Third Place, Chriſt is the Diſpenſer of all thoſe good things which are the effects and conſequences of that eternal and new Covenant which he hath brought into the World, and ſealed with his own Blood upon the Croſs, <hi>all power being give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him, both in Heaven</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</note>
               <hi>and Earth, that he might ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God by him.</hi> Now we think we have
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52416:94"/>
great reaſon to accuſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the Saints theſe Functions of the High Prieſt of the New Covenant. For as if the Goſpel were not a ſufficient Rule to direct us the way to Heaven, the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church teaches, that her Dominicks, <hi>Francis</hi>'s, <hi>Loyola</hi>'s, &amp;c. have received from Heaven, Rules more certain and powerful to raiſe thoſe who follow them to a higher Perfection, than thoſe of the Goſpel it ſelf. And for the proof hereof, they produce the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Viſions, Divine Apparitions, and other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wherewith they pretend God hath honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the calling of theſe Founders of Orders. Moreover, the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church holds, that by Chriſt's Death, only our Mortal Sins, and the eternal puniſhment due to them were expiated; ſo that Men muſt have recourſe to other ways of Expiation, both for their Venial Sins, and the temporal Puniſhments due to their Mortal ones. Therefore was Purgatory invented; and to that purpoſe are likewiſe applied the Faſts, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplining Whips, the Obits or Offices for the Dead, the pious Foundations, the Maſſes, and the Canonical Penances injoyned by the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors at the Tribunal of Penitence (as they call it.) But the moſt powerful Machine, is the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of Indulgences, that Treaſury which hath drawn ſo much Money into the Pope's Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and which, they ſay, is ſilled up with the Overplus of the Satisfactions and Merits of Saints; which ſuperabundance is by Indulgences applied either for the expiation of Venial Sins, or for a compenſation for the temporal Penalties due to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52416:94"/>
Mortal Sins. This is the ground of that Prayer which the Prieſt ſaith in the Maſs, when he asks of God the forgiveneſs of Sins, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thoſe Saints whoſe Reliques are at reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar. Finally, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church makes her Addreſſes to the Saints, as to the Diſpenſers of Heavenly Graces; and we might obſerve a Hundred Places in their Prayer-Books, Rituals, Breviaries, and other Books of their Religion, where it plainly appears, that they ask of them the forgiveneſs of Sins, the Grace of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and good Diſpoſitions for Dying well. But here perhaps it may be objected, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes a great difference in its Practice, between Chriſt's Mediation, and that of the Saints; which is ſo far from being true, that one of her moſt famous Writers, ſadly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>that it is evident, that moſt of the People put</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Alexand. <hi>Al. quaeſt.</hi> 93. <hi>num.</hi> 1. <hi>Artic.</hi> 4.</note>
               <hi>more truſt in the Interceſſion of the Saints, than in Chriſt's Interceſſion; and that they have recourſe with more zeal to their Protection, than to the Patronage of that great Redeemer.</hi> And after all, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Mediator of Redemption, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of Interceſſion, is very injurious to Chriſt, and to the fulneſs of his Prieſthood. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle willing to condemn the partialities of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſome ſaying they were of <hi>Paul,</hi> and others of <hi>Cephas,</hi> asked them with indignation, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13.</note>
               <hi>Have</hi> Paul, Apollos <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>been Crucified for you?</hi> And may not we then with more reaſon, ask the Doctors of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, have <hi>Francis, Dominick,</hi> or <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> been Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for you? For Chriſt's Prieſthood compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52416:95"/>
two parts, namely Sacrifice and Interceſſion, one upon the Earth, and the other in Heaven, one on the Croſs, and the other beyond the Vail in the true and incorruptible Sanctuary, that's to ſay, that his Interceſſion is nothing but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of his Prieſthood; and that the reaſon why he is our Advocate, is, becauſe he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifi'd for us. But in what order of Mediators can the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church put <hi>St. Chriſtopher, St. Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, St. Catharine,</hi> the eleven thouſand Virgins, and the <hi>Thebean</hi> Souldiers, ſince it is plain, that at the beſt they are nothing but meer figments? They will not ſure offer to own them Mediators of Interceſſion, and therefore they muſt confeſs that they have err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, and are ſtill in error.</p>
            <p>The Seventh device of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to excuſe the Worſhip they render to Saints, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, That they would fain perſwade us, That the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath not determined this Worſhip to be neceſſary, but only ſimply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that it was a good and profitable practice. To which it will ſuffice to oppoſe this Argument. That Practice muſt needs be held neceſſary to Salvation for the not obſerving of which People are declared to be damned: Now it is evident, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> damns all thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Saints ought not to be prayed to, from whence it ought to be inferr'd, that the Worſhip of Saints, is, according to the Principles of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church a practice neceſſary to Salvation. The proof for the Minor of this Argument is found in the 25th Seſſion of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> where is a Canon that Anathematizeth all thoſe who deny the lawfulneſs of calling upon Saints
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52416:95"/>
conformably to the uſe and practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: Unleſs they would ſay, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> did pronounce theſe Anathemas, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, they were of Opinion that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping of Saints is not a practice neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But while they go about to ſet off the Wiſdom of the Fathers aſſembled in that Council, they are not aware, that they accuſe them both of Levity, and want of Charity in damning Men, for things that may be either done or let alone without prejudice to Salvation. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church are hardly put to it to know what things the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath judged Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, and what Dogmatical and Eſſential to Religion. That which gives occaſion to theſe Diſputes is, That in ſome States that ſubmitted to the Pope's Authority, the Deciſions of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> have been recieved as to the Dogmatical part of Religion, though they will not acknowledge them as to Rites and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſcipline. I ſhall obſerve by the by, that the Illuſtrious <hi>Peter de Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

However, we find in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Cardinal Duke of <hi>Joyeuſe,</hi> compos'd by <hi>Haberi,</hi> a Bareſter at the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> a Brief of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the V. ſent to the Cardinal of <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> above five and fourty Years after the time when M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>unſ. <hi>de Marca</hi> ſaith, That <hi>France</hi> received the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein this Pope complains very bitterly of the refuſal, which they ſtill made in <hi>France</hi> to approve
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52416:96"/>
this Council, and to ſubmit to its Deciſions. Whatſoever it is, moſt of the Doctors of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church do agree, that to know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things dogmatical, pertaining to Religion, and things meerly ritual and belonging to Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, the moſt certain Rule to judge by, is the Anathemas that are faſten'd on them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince that Council hath Anathematiz'd all thoſe who do not approve the Worſhip of Saints, it follows, that the Fathers of that Council did look upon this Worſhip as a thing of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and neceſſity in Religion, and not as one of thoſe Practices and Ceremonies, which though they be allowed to be very good and profitable, yet may be left out or changed at the will and pleaſure of the Pope and Church. But let them ſay what they pleaſe, certain it is that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church does not only believe, that it is neceſſary to Salvation to call upon Saints, but is moreover bound to believe ſo. And their Doctors pretend, that this piece of ſervice to Saints is commanded in the Scripture, wreſting I know not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Texts to make them apparently comply with their fancy, and utter what they would be at. Now if we believe, that God hath commanded a Worſhip, there is no doubt but we ought alſo to believe that we cannot omit the peformance thereof, without puting our Salvation to ſtake. But what can they ſay for thoſe Services that are eſtabliſhed in ſo many places to the honour of ſuch Saints, as owe all their being to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries of a parcel of Monks, and the credulity of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52416:96"/>
a deluded People? Whereas inſtead of declaring theſe Practices to be neceſſary, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ought to acknowlege that they fall ſhort of being even good and profitable. And therefore that Church muſt confeſs that it hath erred, and is yet involved in error.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eight</hi> Shift is that of ſome Doctors of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, who do deplore the exceſs that the Worſhiping of Saints is grown to, and proteſt altogether, that if in ſome places ſome Saints that never were are Worſhiped, they are but local practices tolerated, though not approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Church. This is the Rock on which do ſplit every day the Learning, Piety, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Conſcience of many Eccleſiaſticks in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who being deſirous of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and having made a conſiderable ſtudy in Religion, yet comparing the miſchief of that falſe Worſhip, with the conſequences of a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, think it much ſafer for their Souls to live in a corrupted Church, and to groan under its Errors, than to make a breach of Charity by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from its Communion. In which they are like thoſe cowardly and unworthy Citizens, who while a generous Deliverer hazards his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and his Life, to preſerve to them both their Laws and Country, are content with fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Arms to wiſh him good ſucceſs and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if he chances to fail in the attempt, will alſo bewail and pity him. Of which ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Rohan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

things, which we find fault with in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are but local Practices, or Exceſſes only tolerated, and not approved by the Church? Thoſe very things which we diſallow, are of ſuch a nature, that a bare toleration of them, hath the force of an Approbation. For they are not Dogmatical Errours, nor empty Speculations, but Errours in the Practice, and Falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>worſhip, in the publick Service of Religion: Which, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Chriſtian Society does tolerate, it gives thereby a ſufficient ground to believe, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them likewiſe. Yet had not all our juſt Complaints upon this matter, power enough to induce the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Index Expurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,</hi> to expunge the ſcandalous Exceſſes of their <hi>Bonaventure, Bernardine</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> and <hi>Gabriel Biel.</hi> The Congregation of the <hi>Holy Office,</hi> and that <hi>de Ritibus,</hi> are very well informed of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours paid in divers Places to the Souldiers of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion.

            <p>A Ninth evaſion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party is, that we cannot, they ſay, condemn their worſhipping of Saints, without involving both the Fathers, the Church of the firſt Ages, and the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians in the ſame Condemnation.

But however the Veneration they had then for them, came nothing near to the Worſhip which the Romiſh Church pays to them now adays. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt, who died in the Seventh Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, began in his time to innovate in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of the Church, by inſerting in the Litanies, the Name of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> thoſe of the Saints having not been introduced till a long time after.

but what is very juſt, conſidering the Zeal and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Love they had for their own King and Maſter.

               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Father <hi>Malbranche</hi> is without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, one of the greateſt Wits of our Age, did he not too much affect to be an Original. His Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem concerning the Worſhip of Saints, and the way he takes to defend the Practice of his Church is as follows. <hi>Firſt,</hi> he lays down for a <note place="margin">Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche <hi>Moral. c.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 156.</note>Foundation, that all our good things come from God, and that he is the only cauſe and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſaith, That when we receive from him any thing that is good, Chriſt is the occaſional Cauſe thereof, God by an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law having decreed not to communicate any Good to Mankind, but at Chriſt's Deſire and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Which Tenet of his is ſet forth more largely both in his Chriſtian Meditations, and his Treatiſe of Nature and Grace. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, That it is not in the Power of the Saints to impart any of theſe Goods unto us, and that we ought not ſo much as to ſay, That they are the occaſional Cauſes of them, it being a Privilege, that belongs to none but Chriſt, as he is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52416:102"/>
of the New Covenant, and the High Prieſt of Things Eternal. It is at the Deſire of Chriſt, and not at thoſe of the Saints, that God by an Eternal Law hath bound himſelf to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Graces. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Nevertheleſs he adds, that the Saints do excite and incline the Deſires of Chriſt toward us, in which chiefly he makes the force of their Interceſſion to conſiſt. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and laſtly, He believes, that they have the Power to heal Sickneſſes, and to bleſs with fertility our Fields, becauſe the Order of the Univerſe ſeems to require, that inferior things be made Subject to the Power of the Superior Beings. I know not how Father <hi>Malbranche,</hi> with all the Sagacity and Sharpneſs of his Wit, can reconcile theſe Principles of his both with the Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of his Church. For having Eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God is the only Diſpenſer of all good things, hence it follows, that the asking the Saints for Graces, which come only from the hand of God, is down-right Idolatry. And when he ſaith, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That God does not diſpenſe his Graces but at the Deſire of Chriſt, who is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by him the Mediatour of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the High-Prieſt of Things Eternal, and that he alone can make Interceſſion for us to his Father in determining and contracting by his deſires the general Laws of God's Mercy to ſome particular Sinners, whom he hath more kindneſs for, we may eaſily conclude, that the imploring the Mediation of Saints, and asking them to pray directly and immediately to God for us, is a high Injury offered to the Prieſthood of Jeſus Chriſt.

Now as to his <hi>third</hi> Tenet, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Saints have not the Power to convey to us thoſe Graces which we want, and that we ought not ſo much asto look upon them as the occaſional Cauſes of them, if this opinion of his be true, what will become of ſo many Litanies and Prayers ſet down in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Breviaries, and in their Prayer and Maſs-Books, in which they ask the Saints to cleanſe them from all their Sins, to preſerve them <note place="margin">

We may pray to the Saints, that they be pleaſed to ſtir up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and the Charity of Jeſus Chriſt. One Saint perhaps is more in Favour, and hath more Acceſs to Chriſt upon his own Holy-day than at another time, or than another Saint. It may be alſo that they have the power of healing our Sickneſſes, or of procuring us a plentiful

Year. We ſee by theſe ſhy and uncertain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, how hard he is put to it to reconcile his Opinions with the Doctrine and Practice of his Church. For indeed there is a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable incompatibility of his Principles, with that Religious Worſhip which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church pays to the Saints. And we need only to examin the Principles, which he had already laid before, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church by praying to the Father through the Son, does acknowledge the Son to be equal and of one ſubſtance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For if he were not ſo, ſaith he, we could not call upon him. And likewiſe he had already ſaid, that the Father hath tyed his Bleſſings and Treaſures to Chriſt's Deſires, and that this is the Reaſon why we ought to adore the Father, and to call upon Chriſt. But what he after adds deſerves eſpecially our conſideration, namely, that theſe Deſires of Chriſt are the deſires of his human Will, that his Fleſh is the Principle of theſe Deſires, which make all the riches of the Church and the Sanctification of the Elect: And that this is the reaſon why Religion teaches us to Addreſs ſometimes our Prayers to the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if we never did invocate any but Chriſt, by reaſon of thoſe Priviledges which God hath by an eternal Decree adapted to his Deſire, to thoſe human deſires, he ſaith, which do proceed from the Child of the Bleſſed <hi>Mary,</hi> we ſhould be in danger of adhering to Chriſt as he is a Man, and of truſting in his Fleſh with the ſame kind of Love and Truſt, which we owe only to the Infinite and Soveraign Being.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52416:103"/>
We may eaſily perceive that this way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning is quite contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and to that Worſhip it renders to Saints. The Eſteem indeed, which I have for Great Men is ſuch, that I cannot forbear ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo a kind of reſpect even for their odd fancies, and by-ways of Writing, which made me take notice by the by of Father <hi>Malbranch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> his Syſtem concerning the worſhipping of Saints, though I know in the bottom of it there is no more reality than in a ſhadow or dream. But after all, ſhould we ſuppoſe his Opinion to be not altogether groundleſs, who would venture to ſay, that ſuppoſititious Saints, ſuch as we have proved thoſe of the <hi>Theb.</hi> Legion to be, can move and excite Chriſts deſires? Therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ought to confeſs, that ſhe hath erred in permitting and approving the Worſhip which is paid to them.</p>
