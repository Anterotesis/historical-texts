            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>What ſhould I tell you of that change that is wrought by <note place="margin">6. Afflictions.</note> afflictions? Will not the wicked in their troubles ſeeke the Lord diligently? Muſt not the vileſt forbeare when they cannot otherwiſe chuſe? And is it any maſterie, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, when power is not in our hands? Will not the ſwine that is now cleanſed, returne to the mire againe? Is it cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, then to forgiue the world, when we ſee no <hi>time</hi> left for <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 2. Pet. 2.</note> execution of malice? Is it patience, to forbeare when wee can neither will nor chuſe? Is it obedience, to tremble vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:16837:6"/>
the whip? to feare God only for his iuſtice, and not to loue him for his mercie?</p>
            <p>Oh but wee are deliuered out of trouble, and reſtored to <note place="margin">7. Proſperitie.</note> 
               <hi>great happineſſe.</hi> Behold, wee are bleſſed on the earth: and are not we then truly bleſſed? Is not this a marke of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, to be proſperous in the world? Would God bleſſe our labours, if we did not ſerue him? May not this change from affliction to proſperitie be a certaine euidence of an inward change, from worſe to better, and ſo prooue vnto the fleſh a conceit of conuerſion?</p>
            <p>Surely, if the world bee Iudge, the caſe is quickly ruled. Who is the good man, but the rich man? Either his riches ſhall be the cloke to hide his faults by greatneſſe, briberie, cunning packing, friendſhip, &amp;c. or his euill <hi>by the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> of the world ſhall be accounted good: hee will not doe ſo for his credit: he needs not ſteale, oppreſſe: he hath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall: his couetouſneſſe is thrift; his pride, cleanlineſſe; his prodigalitie, bountie; his looſeneſſe, libertie and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue. Hath hee not power of all in his hands? And may he not doe what he liſt? Is not his luſt a law, his example a rule and warrant? He feares no trouble; therefore hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues none. Who can ſay, <hi>Blacke is his eie?</hi> becauſe, who dares ſay ſo? Nay, who will not ſay, blacke is white, if it may pleaſe him? Thus proſperitie makes a conuert, if the world may giue in euidence.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially if our fulneſſe in the world be graced with ſome <note place="margin">3. Ciuill calling.</note> ciuill calling, whereby wee are honoured of the people, and taken vp with imploiments; is not idleneſſe now much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, and ſo ſuch ſinnes as doe accompanie the ſame? Doth not credit now reſtraine, where conſcience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not? Is there not now a cloake for ſinne, and countenance for iniquitie? What defenſe is fathered hence for neglect of ſpirituall duties? What opportunity offered, to colour oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb facs="tcp:16837:6"/>
and deceit? What pretence for licentiouſneſſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in the abuſe of the creatures? What wrapping vp of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, where there is fellowſhip in euill? Is not here a glorious maske for ſinceritie and religion, where outward honeſtie in a ciuill calling becomes a warrant of vprightneſſe, ſeeing our faith is ſhewed by workes? And what more obuious and commendable then our ciuill imploiments, ſo beneficiall to the Common-weale, ſo neceſſarie for our priuate, ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfull in the iſſue, as who (in opinion) more bleſſed? What is it, if not godlineſſe, that is ſo plentifully recompenced in this life? If now the wicked eat the labours of their hands, and drinke their wine in bowles, may they not ſacrifice to their nets? May they not cry ayme vnto their ſoules, Oh well is thee, and happie ſhalt thou bee? Thus ciuill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment with worldlings is accounted religion: and to bee morally iuſt and true in contracts and bargaines, goes cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant with men for ſtanch and ſound holineſſe.</p>
            <p>But if we enter into Gods ſanctuarie, and by the rule of the word determine heereof; is not the proſperity of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">Prou. 1. Pſal. 55. Ier. 48. 11.</note> their deſtruction, and not their conuerſion? Doth not the old ſent remaine in <hi>Moab,</hi> becauſe he was not changed from veſſell to veſſell, but enioied conſtant proſperity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, was ſetled on his l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Can the change of the outward eſtate <note place="margin">Oſ. 4. 7. Pſal. 78. Oſ. 5.</note> change the inward man from worſe to better? As they were increaſed, ſo, did not Gods people rebell againſt him, who in their afflictions ſought vnto him deceitfully? Is not heere a change from better to worſe? An hypocrite in affliction, as being bridled and reſtrained, prooues a deſperate enemie, when by proſperitie he hath power in his hands.</p>
            <p>As for walking in a ciuill calling, howſoeuer this (being ſanctified by the <hi>ſpirituall)</hi> may bee a meanes to lay vp a <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 5.</note>

good foundation againſt the day of Chriſt, <hi>1. Tim. 6. 19. 20.</hi> yet to the naturall man there is not a more dangerous out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes to exclude grace, then the greateſt meaſure of honeſtie that is ſeene therein. For is it not the grace of this calling to reſt in it ſelfe for good ſucceſſe, without inuocation of Gods aſsiſtance, or reference to his bleſsing? Is not our purſuit heereof a priuilege to exempt from holy duties? We muſt liue, and therefore we cannot be bookiſh. We haue no leaſure to the Church, &amp;c. Nay, is it not a price, propoſed to incourage diligence in theſe worldly buſineſſes, euen li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to prophane the Sabbaths, to deſpiſe the word? &amp;c. And what if men keepe touch and day in paiments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts? What if a little eie-ſeruice be vſed in the outſide of their wares? Is it for conſcience to God, to whom they deſire to approoue the truth of their hearts; or only a care for the maintenance of trading, and mutuall commerce, which without this outward equitie muſt needs be aboliſhed? Who will truſt, or ſhall be truſted, if word be not kept? But is it kept any further, then may cleere from touch of mans law? Is promiſe kept heere to our hindrance, ſo we may winde out by the arme of fleſh? Is the ſubſtance of our wares any thing leſſe then anſwerable to the ſhew? Is not God robbed of his glorie, while we ſacrifice to our labour and wit? and <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babel, <hi>which I haue built for the honour of my name?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Surely as theſe outward things are common to all, ſo no man knoweth loue or hatred, either by proſperity or aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 1.</note> Well may a good man (by right vſage) make theſe good vnto him; but theſe of themſelues may wel make him worſe: otherwiſe they haue no power inwardly to better him: Only it belongeth vnto God (through the miniſterie of his word) to conuert the ſoule, as tendring (to this end) vnto vs, not <note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> corruptible things, as ſiluer and gold, which make outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

Nay doth not this neceſsity lie vpon the hypocrite, that howſoeuer for a time he muſt gloſe and fawn vpon the truth, while it is his pack-horſe to further him to promotion, riches, &amp;c. yet when by plunging himſelfe into worldly courſes, hee muſt neceſſarily croſſe in his outward actions the power of that truth, muſt he not now for his credit abaſe and vilifie that truth which before hee ſo magnified? as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either too ſeuere and preciſe, becauſe hee cannot reach it: or being <hi>fooliſhneſſe</hi> and madneſſe; and therefore he is <note place="margin">1.

Thirdly, this ſerues for comfort, &amp; that many waies. As,</p>
            <p>1. In that God hath left infirmities in vs: therfore haue <note place="margin">3. <hi>Vſe.</hi> Of comfort. That we haue right in Chriſt.</note> wee hence aſſurance of our right in Chriſt, who came to ſaue ſinners, and ſhall haue experience of the power of Chriſt, in the daily ſubduing, and maſtering of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And therefore</p>
            <p>2. Let vs not deſpaire in our greateſt tentations, ſeeing <note place="margin">To preuent deſpaire.</note> the greater miſerie the greater mercie. As it is God our father that hath left ſinne in vs, yea in the deareſt, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance his free and conſtant loue: ſo hath he giuen his Son to reueale this loue vnto vs by the operation of the Spirit, <note place="margin">1.

Cor. 10. 13: but will giue an iſſue with the temptation, that ſo wee may be able to beare it.</p>
            <p>4. Laſtly, though we haue infirmities; yet let this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs, that our God will not let them feſter in vs, but by <note place="margin">That infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall not feſter in vs. <hi>Iob 33. 15.

As hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends her for her good parts: ſo he reproues her for that euill of her decay.</p>

            </p>
            <p>We muſt reproue our brother plainly for his ſinne: ſo doe we teſtifie, and approue;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:16837:12"/>
1. The faithfulneſſe of our calling and dutie vnto God, <note place="margin">Reaſons.</note> in deliuering the whole counſell of God, as well reproofe for ſinne, as praiſe for well doing. 2. Tim. 3. 16. 2. Tim. 4. 2.</p>
            <p>2. Our loue to our brother, both in preuenting Gods iudgements by our reproofes, or elſe ſanctifying them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſinner. At leaſt wee iuſtifie God, and make the ſinner without excuſe: Ezech. 33. and ſaue our owne ſoules. As alſo hereby we prouoke him to repentance, and ſo by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed repentance to perfection: Leuit. 19. 17.</p>
            <p>And this 1. condemneth the flatterer, that either will ſee <note place="margin">

            <p>2. They are here reprooued, that iuſtifie the wicked and condemne the righteous: Eſay 5. 21. whereas our Sauiour <note place="margin">2.

            <p>We learne here by our Sauiors example how to reproue
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16837:13"/>
for ſinne: namely,</p>
            <p>1. Plainly: <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> 2. Sam. 12. <note place="margin">Sinne how to be reproued.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. Particularly: Letting him ſee his particular ſinne.</p>
            <p>3. Powerfully: To humble him for his ſin, by denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the wrath of God againſt the ſame. <hi>I haue ſomewhat against thee:</hi> that is, I haue a controuerſie with thee, I am angrie, I will be auenged of thee for it.</p>
            <p>4. Conſtantly and ſeaſonably, not letting him lie in it, taking the fit time, &amp;c. as <hi>Abigail</hi> did, 1. Sam. 25.</p>
            <p>5. Impartially and ſincerely, not ſparing the greateſt nor deareſt vnto vs; no not the houſe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> Eſay 58. 1. <note place="margin">Amos 7. 8. 1. Sam. 12. 1.

            <p>Laſtly, heere is great comfort, that being reprooued for ſinne, we are iudged in this life; and ſo by the grace of God <note place="margin">3. Vſe, of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
               </note> being brought to repentance, we ſhal not be iudged in the life to come: 1. Cor. 11. 31. 32.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in that the holy Ghoſt teſtifieth here that Chriſt doth come againſt his Church for this ſin: here we learne, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 3. The leaſt ſin in the Saints is ſufficient to make the Lord to come againſt them as an enemie.</note> That though God loueth alwaies the perſon of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; yet hee is diſpleaſed with their ſinne: he will come againſt them for it, and chaſtiſe them for the ſame: Pſal. 89. 2. Sam. 8. &amp;c. Ezech. 18. And that becauſe he is,</p>
            <p>1. Righteous, and hateth iniquitie, Pſal. 5. 4. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not endure it in his owne.</p>
            <p>2. He is mercifull, and therefore will not ſuffer ſinne to dwell in his children: but by his corrections will clenſe them: Eſay 1. 25. Eſay 27. Ierem. 19. Pſal. 89.</p>
            <p>3. The ſinnes of his children doe more grieue him, and indeed are more grieuous: firſt, becauſe</p>
            <p>4. They haue more grace to reſiſt. Secondly, doe giue more offence to the weake. Thirdly, open the mouth of the wicked more to blaſpheme God and his truth.</p>
            <p>5. That the wicked may haue their vengeance hereby ſealed vp, in that the Lord ſpareth not his owne children: Prou. 11. 32.</p>
            <p>6. That his children might not be condemned finally.</p>
            <p>7. That he might weane them from the world, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16837:13"/>
them to draw neere vnto him in prayer, and ſo haue further experience of his loue in the iſſues thereof.</p>
            <p>8. Their ſinne is not theirs, but proceeds from Satan and the old man, which he therefore remoueth by his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> that ſo he might manifeſt and confirme his loue more and more to their perſons in fitting them to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>

            <p>Secondly, here is inſtruction: 1. To teach vs how to keep God to be our friend: namely, by keeping our ſelues from ſinne, or elſe by renued repentance, daily renouncing, and reforming the ſinne.</p>
            <p>2. To beare patiently the hand of God, ſeeing wee haue deſerued hell; and this affliction which is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wil procure vnto vs an ineſtimable weight of glory: 2. Cor. 5. 16.</p>
            <p>3. To trie our eſtate vnder the rod, namely, if wee feele the Lord to be angrie, and ſo feare and depart from euill: Prou. 14.</p>
            <p>And thus doth the holy Ghoſt amplifie the ſinne of this Church, by ſignifying that the Lord is angrie with her for the ſame.</p>
            <p>1. But let vs conſider what this ſinne is, namely, That
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16837:14"/>
ſhe hath left her firſt loue, a ſinne of omiſſion, ſhe hath fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in that zeale, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>2. She might faile in the outward action, though not in the inward purpoſe.</p>
            <p>3. She might not be ſo zealous as ſhe was, and yet haue ſo much zeale as not to giue ouer finally; for a time ſhe might be cooled, but not quenched in her zeale, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whence we learne, that though the Lord accept the purpoſe of the heart, and will not quench the ſmoaking <note place="margin">Doctrine 4.</note> flaxe; yet would hee haue vs grow in grace, and follow hard after the marke; we muſt abound in grace, and be <note place="margin">The elect muſt goe forward and perſeuere in grace.</note> plentifull in good works; we muſt thriue in well doing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing outwardly when we inwardly deſire, and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole man to the obedience of the ſpirit: 1.

This moderation, howſoeuer with the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts it be traduced as luke warmneſſe, and temporizing with the world, to auoid affliction: yet indeed it is an holy rectifying and ordering of our zeale by humilitie and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that ſo it may hold out, and be perfited through pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and that from the commandement of the Lord our God: Rom. 13.</p>

As if becauſe proſperitie is apt to coole, by making vs ſecure, and forgetfull of our God: therefore it muſt needes follow, that whereſoeuer there is outward abundance, there is inward leannes and barrenneſſe: Pſalme 106. 15.

            <p>1. Both becauſe the Saints of God haue increaſed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and thriuen inwardly too; as, <hi>Abraham, Dauid,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Or by changing our habits and features we ſo auoid the furie of the aduerſarie: if by any of theſe, through the bleſſing of God wee eſcape ſuch troubles, which others, for want of this wiſedome, are ouertaken with; preſently wee are charged with want of zeale; we are condemned to be luke warme, to haue left our firſt loue: and, &amp;c.</p>

Therefore let vs feare the cooling of our loue, in the vſe of this libertie, ſo that our conſciences bee perſwaded and practize warranted by theſe rules: namely, firſt,</p>

That the Saints ſhall not loſe, though they leaue their <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. The Saints ſhall not loſe their firſt loue. <hi>Reaſon 1. Oſe. 2. 19. Eſa 49. Eſa.</hi> 27.</note> firſt loue: Luk. 11. Pſal. 92. 2. Tim. 4. 19.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the Lord hath promiſed to continue his loue towards them: Ioh. 13. 1. Ioh. 17.</p>
            <p>2. Their afflictions doe tend to their perſeuerance, as purging out their ſinnes: Eſay 1. 25.</p>
            <p>3. Their ſins turne to their continuance in grace: 1. as making them afraid of ſinne: 2. and more expert to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the ſame: 3. more fit for grace, by making them more humble, and hungry after it: 4. more mercifull to others, and therefore moouing the Lord to haue more compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on them.</p>
            <p>4. Their Sauiour liueth and triumpheth, to make them more then conquerours: Rom. 8. 36. 37. Ioh. 12. 32.</p>
            <p>5. The ſpirit and word ſhall abide in them to hold them on in grace.</p>
            <p>And therefore</p>
            <p>1. This condemneth the blaſphemie of Papiſts, who teach that the Saints may fall finally, and therein doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach <note place="margin">Vſe.</note> the power and faithfulneſſe of God.</p>
            <p>2. It checketh the inſolencie of the wicked that reioice at the fals of the Saints, and inſult ouer them, ſeeing that though they fall, they ſhall riſe againe: Mich. 7. 9.</p>
            <p>3. As alſo it reprooueth the infidelity of the Saints, who doubt of their recouery, and wrong the faithfulneſſe of God, and power of their faith, greeue the bleſſed ſpirit, and deny in a ſort the merit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>4. Heere is firſt for the world to iuſtifie Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſeeing he doth not forſake for euer; Lam. 3. 24. 25.</p>
            <p>5. Heere the Saints are leſſoned, as to feare their falles, and not to ſinne vpon preſumption of recouerie; ſo not to diſtruſt of Gods mercie in their greateſt failings, ſeeing the Lord is faithfull, and they ſhall recouer, though not ſo forcible a meaſure as before they had, yet ſufficient to the enioying of that happineſſe that the Lord Ieſus hath purchaſed for them. To this end, for the further ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforting of the conſcience, obſerue wee theſe two things:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:16837:26"/>
Firſt, that it is one thing to leaue our firſt loue, and to be luke-warme, neither hot nor cold.</p>
            <p>2. That there is great oddes betweene leauing our firſt loue, and loſing it altogether: we may leaue, in regard of a former meaſure, and yet hold a true graine which ſhall cleere vs of luke-warmneſſe: and though we leaue a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet wee loſe not all, becauſe the leaſt remaining will be a meanes to recouer againe, if not ſo much as we haue had, yet ſo much as ſhall ſerue both to keepe from finall apoſtaſie, and further to eternall glory.</p>
            <p>6. And therefore heere is matter of exceeding conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the elect of God, not to truſt their owne vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing hearts, much leſſe Satanslies; but to reſt on the faithfulneſſe of God, not iudging themſelues by what they are in their decay, but by what they were in their firſt loue: and ſo preſſing the Lord in his faithfulneſſe, and their former experience, they ſhall bee vpheld in their greateſt failings, by a ſecret power; and in good time the Lord will appeare vnto them to bring foorth their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe as the light, and their weldoing as the noone <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 5. Luk. 12.</note> day, that ſo their latter end may be better then their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
            <closer>Glory be to the Lord Ieſus.</closer>
