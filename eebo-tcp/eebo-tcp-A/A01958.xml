            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Concerning the firſt, as requiring more of the head, I leaue to thoſe learned pens and ſelected ſoldiers, whom God hath endowed with greater meaſure of vnderſtanding to fight his battels. But for the ſecond, that aske more of the heart, I preſumed, with the poore widow in the Goſpel, to cast my mite into the donaries of God, to the vſe of the godly. A ſubiect I am well aſſured as neceſſarie, as diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for theſe times: For whether it be that gaine hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turated mens eares, or guilt hath obdurated their hearts, I find abroad men much recalcitrant to this doctrine: yet how

               <p>Now are we to examine, for as much as it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable but this of Ananias is ſuch, which of all theſe three it is, that is here inflicted.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3480:34"/>
let me firſt retort this argument, as he did, who when his aduerſarie had ſaid, <hi>Si ſatis eſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare, quis erit nocens?</hi> replied, <hi>Si ſatis eſt accuſare, quis erit innocens?</hi> but I will ſhew why.</p>
               <p>Firſt, verie many matters, that touch the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paſſe vnmentioned, but not vnmeant; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantialitie of the Sonne, which the Arrians did oppoſe; particular faith, which the Papiſts; pedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which the Anabaptiſts; and the Sabbath, which the Antiſabbatarians do obiect, are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, of which it is hereſie to doubt or deny; therfore the reaſon is rotten, to ſay they are not named, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Synagogue was yet ſtanding, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by diuine preſcriptions Tithes were tied; which though by the death of Chriſt, ſhe receiued her deaths wound, yet then was not dead; &amp; when dead, not preſently buried, but with reuerence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as the Fathers ſay, to be put into the graue; ſo that till after her funerals, there was no paying of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſtate of the new Church was ſuch as yet had neither peace nor prince, ſo that this was no time to put in her claime, but to expect till God ſhould ſtirre her vp ſome foſter Fathers, to order her right.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, for feare of ſcandall: for as Chriſt did forbeare a time to tell of his paſſion; and at his death, I haue many other things to ſay vnto <note place="margin">

The matter ſorted ſo well to the tyrants minde, that the Poet for gaine, and the people for game, gaue way to the cup of hemlocke, and <hi>Socrates</hi> death.</p>
               <p>The enemie of our ſaluation doth beare the like ſplene to the miniſters of the Goſpel, thorough whoſe ſides he ſeekes to wound, and worke out true religion, as men that indeed do marre his markets. The Pope in the deuils pageant hath acted the Poet, to ſcandalize their profeſſion, by withdrawing their ſuſtentation; perſwading the world, that high pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is the way to high perfection, and that a freeze gowne is habit enough for holy profeſſors, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I wonder ſo holy a father doth not goe before, or at leaſt accompany vs in the way to holineſſe) and to poſſeſſe nothing, the onely way to happineſſe.</p>

               <p>THere is an other ſort of men, that albeit they lurch not the Church lands, nor count them Antichriſtian, yet enfranchiſe themſelues with a falſe priuiledge; that they are as free from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God in this caſe, or any other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man concerning that matter, as from the reſcripts of the Sheriffe of the out-ſhiere; to pay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the maintenance of the Miniſter, more then their owne mind ſhall voluntarie condeſcend vnto, or order taken vpon their agreement at the Hall, ſhall make them liable vnto. And therefore it
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3480:48"/>
ſeemes a thing moſt abſurd, and verie vnreaſonable, that Perſonall Tithes of Artificers, trades-men, and Merchants, ſhould be demaunded. By which meanes they ſad and dull the hearts of their Miniſters, by a couetous and vnconſcionable preſcription, to allow him nothing, but his two-pennie offrings at Eaſter, and a verie ſmall quillet not to be accounted of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. But they muſt vnderſtand, that firſt at leaſt a perſonall Tithe is due, which that poore portion no way doth counteruaile by a thouſand part. Secondly, if not in act, yet in equitie, ſome proportionate ſumme vnto that which God, and man hath indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently ſet downe. And of this aſſertion I haue theſe reaſons, beſide thoſe I haue ſet downe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the dictate of nature, and poſitiue law of <note place="margin">Why Cities and Townes ſhould pay perſonall Tithes. Pro. 3. 9. Gen. 14. Gen. 2. Num 31.</note>God, to honour God with our riches, and the good things of this life as is Gods ordinance, and as the holy men of God haue done, <hi>Abraham, Iacob,</hi> and all the holy nation, and all our countrie beſide. What charter then or charitie, what cuſtome or conſcience can be pretended, to free vs from that which all the Chriſtian world, nay all the Vniuerſall world are bound vnto?</p>
               <p>They may obiect, that one man may ſerue that turne for a whole Citie or Towne, and for one man their maintenance may be ſufficient. Firſt it is not credible or poſſible, that any one ſhould feed more thouſands with a morſell of bread, then euer Chriſt fedde with 7. loaues, and 2. fiſhes. Beſides, what <hi>Stento<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> voice, or <hi>Eolus</hi> lungs, or iron ſides, may be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3480:49"/>
ſufficient to ſtretch to ſo many thouſands? but that is as groſſe as all the reſt, that he that ſhould take ſo much paines, ſhould haue no more then that ſlender reward.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Will not God at his generall Audit obiect this vnto ſuch; that labourers in the Countrie, and fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in poore Townes of the coaſt, whom he neuer honoured with the tenth of their eaſe, the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of their opportunity, the hundreth part of their happines, yet returne him by Tithe a couuenient portion of their labours, &amp; his bleſſing: but theſe that ought to haue been manie miles before them in godlines, come ſhort of them many leagues in grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe. <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 14.</note>The parable of the talents is well knowne and remembred, but not euer practiſed: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God many times ſends vs other remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: Pirats at ſea, and prowlers at land, to conſume our ſubſtance, bringing men ofttimes from the wealth and pride of the Cittie, to the want and drudgerie of the Countrie, for ſuch forgetfullneſſe and contempt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſeruice vnder the law was a coſtly ſeruice, where men were to allocate the third part of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to the miniſtration of the Tabernacle, what by ſacrifices of all ſorts, what by peculiar charges riſing on ſome occaſions: but vnder Poperie, this charge was doubled and trebled, where the third part of the land went to the blinde and the lame Clergie. From the firſt we are freed by Chriſt; from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by Chriſtian Princes. What? to be exempt as by a <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> from all ſuit and ſeruice that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3480:49"/>
to God? No: but wee are ſtill tied to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to God an honorable ſeruice, that his Goſpel may be continued, his praier perpetuated, his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters maintained, his houſes repaired, his members comforted, his infanterie nurſed, his ſeruants ſaued. What pittie is it then to ſee ſo many ſheep without ſhepheards, ſo many ſhepheards without meanes, that of ſo many pariſhes as are many times found in ſuch places, all the wages of ſingle and double halls together, not able to amount to one ſufficient ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of a good Miniſter; that is to ſay, where the moſt houſholders ſhal giue a matter of two ſhillings two pence to his Miniſter by the yeare, and the beſt but fowre ſhillings fowre pence, (I ſpeake within compaſſe) vnder 5. ſhillings, and yet ſome of theſe men by their owne eſteem, and other mens, worth many thouſands; and as they are merchants, may gaine many hundreds of pounds that yeere. And where I may be challenged, that euen this in all the Towne and Citie through, may riſe to more then a competent liuing for one man, though I ſpake of no more then the pariſh maintenance, I will put all the Lecturers wages in beſide, it will not ſo bee more then enough or competent: when all can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew hardly to 200. pounds by the yeare; and that to ſuch a man as I ſpeak of, and they ſhould labour for, yet ſcarce competent: for why ſhould we not value a godly, learned, well borne man and Miniſter, in equal ranke with the beſt merchant, when as in ſuch an one the ſumme would be but beggerie, yea no way but in wealth qualified like the other.</p>

4. And becauſe I haue mentioned the Miniſters perſon, let that be another motiue, the loue we are to ſhew vnto them. Now what kindnes can this be, to defraud him of his true allowance, and to mince him out ſuch mites, and <hi>micas</hi> (crumbs as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men do, and count him highly beholding to them for that alſo? I will not ſay as <hi>Tullie</hi> doth in like caſe, that it is <hi>latr onis beneficium,</hi> who thinke the traueller is much bound vnto him for his life, which hee might haue taken as well as his purſe: But this I ſay, I feare me thoſe men that now in the libertie of the Goſpel deny vs our owne; if any other colour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould turne trumpe, wil hardly giue vs their owne.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another cauſe why ſuch places ſhould pay perſonall tythes, or like liberall maintenance, is the ſecuring of their owne eſtates: for this ſmall tribute that we doe ſo returne our God, is <hi>ſepes diuitiarum,</hi> the fence of our fortunes, and cauſeth the legittima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our other goods.

The charge which they pretend daily to grow vpon them for impoſt, &amp;c. are meere cauillations: for that they fetch vp againe vpon the poore countrie, and themſelues grow rich the while.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, would they doe as the mother Citie, where they pay not by the hal, but by the rent of the

By theſe reaſons I am induced to miſlike the courſe that runnes common in great places, and to reuoke men to the right and prime inſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obiections.</note> But guiltineſſe is neuer without gain-ſaying, and mans nature is ſtubborne not to yeeld to the word.

                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 12.</note>
                  <hi>to that we haue, not according as we haue not,</hi> to vſe liberalitie, much more gratuity to God and their Miniſter. Yet it is not equall, that men not hauing to their minds, ſhould therefore pay nothing, but eate or ſpend Gods part as they doe their own. And who in theſe places is ſo poore, that hee doth not feaſt once or ofter, in the yeare, in ſuch ſort that the very reuerſion of their riot, would not be a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table refreſhing to his miniſter, if he had it in mony.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:3480:51"/>
But pouertie is not alwaies truely pretended: for compare the husbandman with the citizen, in diet, apparell, houſe, furniture, building expences; and then tell me which is the poorer? there I am ſure the Towneſman will haue all things excellent, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it coſt, ſo that he is rich at home, &amp; poor at the <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note>Church: as one ſaies, <hi>Etſi in domibus ſunt auro diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, tamen in Eccleſia ſunt mendici:</hi> for their own occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they will find mony, but for Gods they cannot ſpare it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are ſubiect to many charges, and greater loſſes, then thoſe of the Countrie: and is that any cauſe to denie God his tribute? that is, the Miniſter his due? I ſhould thinke that binds them to be more thankefull for his fauour, mercie, and prouidence: as <note place="margin">Numb. 31. 26.</note>we ſee in the Iſraelites, beeing but a ſmall band, yet vanquiſhed fiue Kings of Madian: firſt parted with one halfe of the prey vnto their fellowes that went not into the field; and of the other moitie gaue a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to God, one of 500. and further for Gods vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected deliuerance, hauing not miſſed one man, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto him of their owne accord another obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the iewels and ornaments of the pillage, to the value of 16750. ſhekels of gold.</p>
               <p>But we can be content to offer vnto God, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good words as he will, but no mony; but then we <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note>verifie the ſpeach of the Father, we do not offer <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulos labiorum,</hi> but <hi>labia vitulorum,</hi> not the calfs of the <note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. He would ſo be too rich, and too well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with our eſtates. 1. This is to bee wiſer then God; for he made no ſuch prouiſo. 2. What hurt if thy Miniſter knew in generall, nay in particular the bleſſing or curſing of God vpon thee? were that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny harme to thy ſoule? thou ſhalt be ſure of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to haue one that will ſimpathize with thee, and one that will ſupplicat for thee.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for I will not follow theſe foxes to any more holes: If miniſters would not challenge it of debt, but take it as almes, or contribution, or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence, they ſhould fare better.

Or what comfort is it to impropriate in this manner, that which God and all good men haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed? Is it diſhonour to acknowledge a debt to our better, a duty to our Prince, a tribute to our God? is

it diſhoneſt for the Miniſter that in Gods behalfe doth require the ſame? why then ſhould we be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him, that tells vs what is due, or to raile on them that refute our falſhood? this ſnarling againſt the preacher, is but recalcitrating againſt the word. It is not the man, but the matter, to haue our coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes detected, our oppreſſion checked, our vſury reprooued, our extortion ranſanked: it is Mammon that ſtings vs, not the miniſter that offends vs: but beware what ye ſhall doe in this caſe; to bee pricked in heart for our fault is one thing, but to pricke his heart that diſcouers our ſins; is not to ſtomacke him but his ſender: to omit a truth or duty vpon igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is one thing; but to oppugne the truth out of malice is an other.

               </p>
               <p>There are two kinde of cuſtomes that are not good: 1. <hi>Conſuetudo peccandi, quae tollit ſenſum (non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum) peccati:</hi> 2. <hi>Vetuſtas erroris, quae quo magis obtinet, magis grauet.</hi> There is a cuſtome of ſin, which takes away the cuſtome, but not the guilt of ſinning: and there is an antiquity of errour, the which the more it is in requeſt, the more it offends.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Decretals.</note> But to ſay all in a word, the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> haue well confined the valitidie of Cuſtomes: <hi>Conſuetudo non derogat iuri naturali, ſeu diuino:</hi> therefore all ſuch cuſtomes as are derogatorie to the Church, are to be reuerſed.</p>
               <p>Now what are the cuſtomes that are laid in our diſh, for the moſt part, but impious, iniurious, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, abſurd, vnconſcionable, and vnnaturall?</p>

The law of nations ſaith, the labourer is worthie of his hire, and Chriſtendome hath determined this portion of wages; but cuſtome ſaith, we haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie cuſtomes to all the world, late exemptions, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpenſations: and thus in effect we ſill vp the meaſure of thoſe auncient hypocrits, <hi>tranſgreſſing</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But of this point I will ſpeake no more, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the reader to the writings of Ma. <hi>Eburne,</hi> that <note place="margin">Eburne.</note>in 2. or 3. treatiſes hath taken good paines in this point, and conclude;</p>
               <p>If this plea will not be taken in Weſtminſter-hal, that we had a cuſtome in our pariſh not to come to ſeruice, nor to receiue the Sacraments, nor to keepe the Kings peace: how doe we thinke it will be taken at Gods tribunall ſeat at the dreadfull day of iuſtice, to plead the cuſtome was ſuch, where we had abode, to be impious, ſacrilegious, prophane, vnconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cruell to God, and man; to abridge the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of his due, God of his ſeruice, our ſoules of their comfort? therefore <hi>be not deceiued, God is not</hi>

               <p>But beſide cuſtome (which then when it tooke beginning, might haue ſome reaſon, though time hath now eat out thoſe letters,) there is coſenage al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, pretending cuſtome, and it is not ſo; or detaining that which is moſt due, by palpable wrong, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured forgerie: in all which caſes the world is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

prone to fauour themſelues; and the beſt cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler againſt the Parſon, is reputed the beſt pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner.

And founders of new erections reſerued no other power in themſelues, but the bare Aduocation and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the place.

And therfore as I ſaid while ere, the Church is little beholden to ſuch patrons: for theſe reſemble the beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful gate of the Temple, or faire porches of the poole of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> where lie a great number of Lazars, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the waters next motion, the Churches next promotion: wherein they haue faire occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merite both of God and men: for God, who ſees not how much he might be glorified, if that care were taken in the choiſe of a worthy preacher, that ought to be: and as for men, it is equally apparant, what
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3480:58"/>
profit would redound to the world for inſtruction and edification. But in my poore vnderſtanding, in the neglect of this ſo pious ſeruice to God, and to his Church, as they are faultie and defectiue to both them, ſo no way more preiudicious then to themſelues; not onelie in the account that they ſhall one day giue of that ſtewardſhip, but in depriuing themſelues in the meane time, of a learned friend, a godly aſſociate, and a ghoſtly aduocate: for who is ſo fit to conuerſe familiarly with a gentle or noble man, then ſuch a miniſter, who both for his honeſt birth, and liberall breeding, ſweete learning, and wiſe counſelling, may be both an adiuvant for his ſoules health, as an ornament to his worldly ſtate. For if it be true, that <hi>ſcientia</hi> be <hi>vitae ſol,</hi> and <hi>amicitia vitae ſal,</hi> knowledge the light, and freindſhip the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of this life; how darke and vnſauorie muſt his life needes be, that depriues himſelfe in the place where he doth or ſhould liue, of a learned counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and friendly comforter.</p>
               <p>But how euer their owne occaſions may be to be called to higher places in their owne perſons, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery noble minded <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould labour to remooue this ſtone, which the enuyous <hi>Madianites</hi> haue row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon the wells mouth, that the Lords flockes may be ſeaſonably watered; leaſt that both for the preſent, the world be peſtered with idol-ſhepheards, that haue eies and ſee not, eares and heare not, tongues and ſpeake not, of which the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <note place="margin">Pſal. 115.</note>

               <p>Wo be to this generation becauſe of the leauen of the Phariſies, which is hypocriſie, at leaſt if that may be called hypocriſie, which for the generalitie cannot, for the impudencie cares not any longer to be concealed. There is at this day a diſeaſe ſpread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the whole bodie of the Church, and the further the more deſperate, the more ſecret the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. If it were an open enemie that had riſen vp againſt her, he might haue beene caſt out, and haue withered: if a violent perſecutor, ſhe could haue hid her ſelfe from him: now whom ſhould ſhe caſt out, or from whom be hid? all are friends, but all vnfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;

all of kind, but all vnkind; all of a houſe, yet none at peace; all neere neighbours, but neereſt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; they adorne themſelues with the holy inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet honour not the holy of holies.

                  <hi>D. Luther</hi> of the places and times of reformation, <note place="margin">In Gal. 6. 6.</note>ſaies thus; I haue often wondered why the Apoſtle ſo oft and earneſtly exhorteth the Churches to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh their teachers: for in the time of Popery, I ſaw all men giue frankly to the building and the guilding of their gorgious temples, to the liberall maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the idolatrous ſeruice; ſo that the Clergie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where poſſeſſed the moſt and beſt lands of all countries; in ſo much that I thought it ſuperfluous for God to giue any ſuch commaundement, for as much as they abounded and ſuper-abounded with plentie of all things. I thought it more needefull to perſwade men to hold their hands, then to giue any more: for I obſerued how by this exceſſiue liberality, the couetouſneſſe of the Clergie did but more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and the reſt of the world grew very poore. But now I ſee the reaſon why they did abound in that meaſure, and wee on the contrary ſuffer ſo much want. In former time, when nothing elſe was taught but error and idolatrie, they grew ſo wealthy, that of Peters patrimonie (when himſelfe had neither ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nor gold) the Popes had aduanced themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue Emperours, Cardinals aboue Kings, Biſhops
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3480:65"/>
aboue Princes: but ſince the time that the Goſpell came in, preachers haue euer been as poore as euer Chriſt was. We finde then by lamentable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how neceſſarie this precept of well maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the miniſters, is in the world: which Paul both here and elſewhere ſo inſiſts in, and beates vpon. Therefore when I read this exhortation of <hi>Paul,</hi> I both muſe and bluſh, that ſo great an Apoſtle ſhould vſe ſo many words about this matter. I would bee loth to ſlaunder and defame this countrie, which is nothing in compariſon of Corinth, which hee ſo much ſhamed by begging for the miniſters and the Saints. But this I ſee is the lot of the Goſpel, that not only no man is forward to giue to ſchollers and the Clergie, but euery man is ready to ſpoyle and take away that which they haue. In briefe, men ſeeme to degenerate to ſauage and cruell beaſts: for all the while that men did teach and preach vnto them the doctrine of deuills, they were open-handed euen to prodigalitie to thoſe deceiuers; but to thoſe that deale the word of God ſincerely, they enuie that they haue, and thinke euery thing too much.</p>
               <p>By which we perceiue how neceſſarie this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, euen to true profeſſors: Sathan can abide nothing worſe then the light of the Goſpel; which when he ſees to breake forth, hee labours tooth and nayle to hinder it, both by falſe ſpirits, and bloodie perſecutions, and famiſhing vp the teachers. And becauſe he could not here ſuppreſſe it by any of the former meanes, of falſe doctrine, or oppoſition, he attempteth it by the latter, by withdrawing the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3480:66"/>
of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, to cauſe them by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie and neceſſitie to forſake their ſtanding; and ſo the people wanting inſtructors, to grow wild and wicked. This deuiſe the deuil ſets forward by wicked magiſtrates in cities and townes, noblemen and gentlemen in the country, who take away the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reuenewes, whereby the miniſters ſhould bee maintained, and conuert them to profanenes; as the <note place="margin">Micah. 1. 7.</note>Prophet Micah complaineth, <hi>from the hire of an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot it came, and to the hire of an harlot it ſhall returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> Some other he diuerteth from the Goſpel with too much abundance: for when the word of God is plentifully taught, many fall a loathing and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of it; and fewe will ſet their ſonnes to ſchoole, or to diuinitie, but apply them rather to more gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trades.</p>
               <p>It is not then without need that Paul warnes all Auditors, to communicate with their Paſtors in all their goods, it being ſit and equal to requite ſpiritual things with temporall. But both Court and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, towne and citie, doth abuſe this doctrine at this day, vnder colour thereof to inrich themſelues.</p>
               <p>In Poperie great ſummes were giuen vnto the Prieſts for maſſes, dirges, trentals, and ſuch traſh: begging Friers had likewiſe their ſhares, beſides that which pardons, indulgences, and other Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an merchandize carried away: from theſe and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more the like extortions, we are freed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell: but we are ſo farre from thankefulneſſe to God, that of prodigall giuers, we are become ſacrilegious takers, and grow lame-handed for beſtowing any
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3480:66"/>
thing vpon the religion and Saints of God; which is an infallible token, that men haue loſt both the word, and ſaith, and all goodneſſe together: for it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for ſuch as are religious indeede, to ſee their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors liue in want and neceſſitie. For as much then as they ioy to ſee their miniſters bare and poore, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their liuings from them, or not paying them ſo ſincerely as they ſhould; it is more then manifeſt that they are worſe then the very heathen. But they ſhall feele ere long, what will followe vpon this in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, by the loſſe both of temporall and ſpirituall bleſſings: for it is impoſſible but this ſinne muſt bee both ſpeedily and heauily auenged: and I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Churches of Galatia, Corinth, and the reſt were ſo peſtered with falſe Apoſtles, for no other cauſe but the ſmall account they made of their true teachers: for it is a iuſt reward, that they that wil not giue a penie to God, the author of all bleſſings and goodneſſe, ſhould giue pounds to the deuill, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all euill, and euerlaſting miſerie: and that hee that will not ſerue God with a little to his owne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall renumeration, ſhould ſerue the deuil with much to his vtter and ineuitable confuſion.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe it is not the Apoſtles meaning that men ſhould giue away all that they haue, but onely ſuch liberall maintenance, that their Miniſters may liue in honeſt and decent faſhion. And this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteth further, adding a fearefull commination to his former reproofe and exhortation, ſaying, <hi>God is not mocked:</hi> where he toucheth to the quicke the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeneſſe of men, who proudly and profanely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3480:67"/>
their miniſters, and make themſelues ſport with their miſeries: as great men for the moſt part doe, that make their Paſtors their very abiects and vaſſals; ſo that if we had not a godly Prince, we had long ere this been driuen out of the Country. For when the Paſtors demaund their dues, or complaine of their wants, the faſhion of men is to exclaime, that Prieſts are couetous, and would haue they know not what; no man is able to ſatisfie their asking: if they were true Goſpellers indeede, they ſhould poſſeſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but in great perfection follow their maſter Chriſt. Therefore the Apoſtle grieuouſly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſuch mockers and blaſphemers, ſo deſpitefully and inhumanely ſcorning and inſulting on their poore miniſters; yet forſooth will ſeem great goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: as if hee ſhould ſay, Beware you deſpiſers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God deferre his puniſhment for a ſeaſon, yen in his good time he will finde you out, and puniſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you for this profaneneſſe, and hate againſt his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: you deceiue not him but your ſelues; and your wrong will not pertaine to him, but returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your boſome.</p>
               <p>And yet our proud Gentlemen, and Citizens, are little mooued with theſe dreadfull threats, who at their death ſhall well vnderſtand, that they haue not mocked vs but themſelues: in the mean time, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſuperciliouſly they laugh at our preſent admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, we will ſpeake this to our owne comfort, knowing it is better to receiue, then to infer wrong: for patience is euer ioyned with innocence, and God will not ſuffer vs to want, but when the Lions

Luther,</hi> whoſe pen and paines God did ſo powerfully vſe and bleſſe in the worke of the reſtauration of the world.

                  </hi> whoſe name hath terror attending on it in the Kingdome of Poperie to this day. Where let me obſerue one thing very remarkeable, that theſe great Saints, ſo mightie in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>word and deed, yet hauing done what was in men to doe, againſt falſe doctrine, yet could neuer put out this inbred irreligion: as if this ſinne were in the Church, as it is written of the heart in the bodie, <hi>primum viuens &amp; vltimum moriens:</hi> or like death, the firſt and laſt enemie we ſhould encounter. But what ſaith M. <hi>Caluin,</hi> we muſt needs confeſſe <note place="margin">in Act 4. 34.</note>that our bowels are of iron, and our hearts of braſſe, that are no more touched with the reading of this ſtory, where the faithfull giue ſo bountifully that which they had: whereas we at this day cannot be content, to hold our owne hands from giuing any thing onely, but moſt iniuriouſly take away alſo that which is giuen by other: they did ſimply and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly dedicate their owne; we deuiſe a thouſand euill ſhifts to hooke and catch, that which other haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed: they laid downe theirs at the Apoſtles feete, we take from thence that which is giuen to God: there men ſold their poſſeſſions to giue to godly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, here wee buy and purchaſe all we can: then eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one gaue ſomewhat to the Church and the poore, now men are ſo inhumane, that they enuie

This hath bin the practiſe of the world, and the condition of the Miniſters in all times. 400 falſe prophets were well and plentifully prouided for at Iezabels table, when the true Prophets of God in the meane time were driuen to hide their heads, hauing ſcarce bread and water to liue vpon, and that alſo not without danger of their liues: her practiſe ſhall condemne a number of our profeſſours: Nay, our forefathers zeale and forwardnes, notwithſtanding their great blindnes, ſhal condemne our coldnes in this behalfe. The very ſtones and rubbiſh of the ruined Abbies,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3480:68"/>
aud other religious houſes ſhall riſe vp againſt vs: for they maintained 30. or 40. idle bellies moſt of them, which did nothing but nuzzle them in idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and ignorance, where now the ſame place will not mainetaine one competent Preacher to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their ſoules vnto ſaluation: for we take from the Church faſter then they gaue it.</p>
               <p>In the old time the ſaying was, what ſhal we bring to the Seer or man of God? but now the wicked rob-gods ſay, come let vs take the houſes of God for our poſſeſſions. The Iewes were euen prodigall in their contributions to the tabernacle, offring more then enough, ſo as they needed to be inhibited with the ſound of the drumme and proclamation, (as our forefathers alſo were by the ſtatute of Mortmaine:) this lauiſh giuing to the materiall temple, ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt our little giuing to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall miniſtrie, the liuing temple of God; nay our taking away from it, being far better then the Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Prieſthood: for looke by how much God hath diminiſhed the coſt of the altar, and the charge of the ceremonious worſhip of the old Teſtament, ſo much more liberally doth he looke to haue the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie maintained, and the ſpirituall worſhip fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the new.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if they that helpe not to vphold the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie ſhall be condemned, what ſhall become of them that rob the Church of her reuenewes, and deuoure the holy things? And thus much of that matter.</p>

vowed to God, if he did recouer, to make ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends: which he faithfully performed according to the deuotion of thoſe times, erecting churches, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Colledges, founding monaſteries, alwaies and openly confeſſing, that the iudgements of God had been ſent vnto him, principally for his outrages commited that way.</p>

               <p>Be it therefore knowne, that after my Father <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius</hi> was dead, I tooke vpon me as next heire, the gouernement of the kingdome, but being tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with errors and lightnes of youth, I neglected the duty of a good Prince, diſcharging neither iuſtice nor conſcience, but as I was carried by humour and fauour.

If then we finde our charges ingrate, our Superiours ſiniſtrous, our neighbours iniurious, our auditors ſacrilegious, not reſpecting our labours, nor requiting our cares; neither reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing our perſons, nor abſtaining from our penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pet. Mart.</note> It is written in the late hiſtories of the Indian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that if they finde in their Temples and Sacraries of their ſuperſtitions, any horrid or abhorred crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as owles, or backs, or toads, or ſerpents, which men account as hatefull and ominous, they diſpoſe themſelues to all the ſhewes of humilitie, that their holieſt ceremonies can declare, to expiate the anger of their diſpleaſed Zemes and furious Deities, which they hold preſaged by ſuch impurities. The like I take it are we to doe, and make collection of theſe vnclean vermine in the ſanctuaries of God, that God is moſt highly offended with vs, and that theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure monſters, and prodigious Harpies doe really prognoſticate the threats of heauen, as to the whole land in generall, ſo to vs of the holy miniſterie in particular, whoſe the Temple is, and the ſignes por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended there more peculiar appropriate to our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we ſhall doe well to ſearch and diue into the true reaſon, and howſoeuer their creeping

in or ſculking vnder ſome groundſell or threſhold, makes them nothing the holier, but helps their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as deſperate hypocrites, yet the deſert is from our ſelues: ſo that as we denounce his iudgements to them, ſo are we to deſcrie his iuſtice to vs, ſo to ſuffer vs to looſe our reuerence and rights, that are fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his feare, honouring our ſelues more then his Sonne, more reſpecting our riches then our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and more caring for gold then wee doe for God.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you then, right reuerend and renowned Fathers and Brethren, giue me leaue with a light finger, if not to lance this ſore, yet not blanch the ſearch: for I take it it is no dead fleſh that needs any boiſterous rifling, but tender and ſenſible to iudure the ranſacking, <hi>nec vt verenda retegam, ſed vt in vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda confutem,</hi> as ſweet S. <hi>Bernard;</hi> rather with Sem to awake your drowſineſſe, then with Cham to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplay your nakedneſſe.</p>

               <p>When a ſymonizing Scholler, agrees with a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hezying Patron; and a Iudaizing Biſhop, to make a diabolizing impropriation: or as <hi>Malmburienſis</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of one halfe Biſhop of Norwich: when there meetes in one indiuiduall, a Scholler, a Courtier, &amp; a flatterer; a Symoniake, a Biſhop, and a Pirat.
