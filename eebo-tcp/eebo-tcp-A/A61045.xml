         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
SPEECHES
OF THE
Five JESUITS
That were Executed at TYBURN on <date>Friday the
20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of this inſtant June 1679.</date>
            </head>
            <p>Theſe Speeches which I have here publiſhed, being moſt exactly taken <hi>verbatim</hi>
from the mouths of the Condemn'd perſons who ſpoke them, I thought I could do no
leſs then make them publick to the World, as well for the ſatisfaction of the Curious,
as to let the World ſee how little Faith is to be given to any of that Religion, wherein
Lying is ſo much more prevalent than Repentance, and where to commit a ſin, and
deny it, is more meritorious than not to ſin at all. I could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were it to my purpoſe, give
you a thouſand inſtances of what Lyes have been ſuffer'd by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be
made uſe of as lawful, under the helps of Equivocation, mental Reſervation, &amp;c. but
this is not time of day for ſuch things, when they have ſo lately had the Impudence to
deny, that there was ever born alive ſuch a man as Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> becauſe
he was neither Knighted nor Chriſtned at the hour of his Birth. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Prieſt (conditionally that they ſhall deny ſuch and ſuch things) abſolves
them of all things from the time of their Birth, which makes them as Innocent as the
Child unborn, the very expreſſion they ſo often uſe:</p>
            <q>Tantum Religio potuit ſuadere malorum.</q>
            <q>
               <floatingText xml:lang="unk">

                        <head>Mr. Whitebread's Speech.</head>
                        <p>I Suppoſe it is expected I ſhould ſay ſomething as to the Matter for which I
am Condemned, and am brought hither to Suffer. It is no leſs then the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
and Plotting His Majeſties Death, and Alteration of the Government
of the Church and State: You all either know, or ought to know, I am to make
my Appearance before the face of Almighty God, and with all imaginable cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and evidence to receive a final Judgment for all the thoughts, words and
actions of my whole life.</p>
                        <p>So that I am not now upon terms to ſpeak other than Truth, and therefore
in his moſt Holy Preſence, and as I hope for mercy from his Divine Majeſty, I do
declare to you here preſent, and to the whole World, that I go out of the World
as Innocent, and as free from any Guilt of thoſe things laid to my charge in this
matter, as I came into the World from my Mothers womb.</p>
                        <p>And this I do, renouncing from my heart all manner of Pardons, Abſolutions,
or Diſpenſations for Swearing, as occaſion or Intereſt may ſeem to require, which
ſome have been pleaſed to lay to our charge, as matter of our Doctrine and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105635:2"/>
Practice: but is a thing ſo unjuſtifiable, that I believe, and ever did, that no
Power on Earth can Authorize me, or any body elſe ſo to do. And for thoſe who
have moſt falſly accuſed me, (as time either in this World, or the next, will make
appear) I do heartily forgive them, and beg of God to grant them his holy
Grace, that they may repent of their unjuſt proceedings againſt me; otherwiſe
they will in concluſion find, they have done themſelves more wrong, than I have
ſuffered from them, though that hath been a great deal.</p>
                        <p>I pray to God to bleſs him Majeſty both Temporally and Eternally, which hath
been my daily Prayers for him, and is all the harm I ever intended or imagined
againſt him. And I do with this my laſt breath, in the ſight of God declare, That
I never did learn, teach, nor believe that it is lawful, upon any occaſion or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
whatſoever, to deſign or contrive the Death of his Majeſty, or any hurt to
his Perſon; but on the contrary, that all are bound to obey, defend and preſerve
his Sacred Perſon, to the utmoſt of their power.</p>
                        <p>And I do moreover declare, That this is the true and plain ſence of my Soul,
and as I hope to ſee his bleſſed Face, without any Equivocation, or mental Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation:
That is all I have to ſay concerning the matter of my Condemnation.
That which remains now for me to do, is to recommend my Soul into the hands
of my bleſſed Redeemer, by whoſe Merits and Paſſion I hope for Salvation.</p>

                        <p>THe words of dying Perſons have always been eſteemed of greateſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
becauſe uttered then, when ſhortly after they are to be cited before
the high Tribunal of Almighty God.</p>
                        <p>This gives me hopes that mine may be look'd upon as ſuch: Therefore I do
here Declare in the preſence of Almighty God, the whole Court of Heaven, and
this numerous Aſſembly, that as I ever hope (by the Merits and Paſſion of my
ſweet Saviour Jeſus Chriſt) for eternal Bliſs, I am as innocent as the Child un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
of any thing laid to my charge, concerning the Matter for which I am here
to die: And I do utterly renounce, abhor and deteſt that abominable and falſe
Doctrine laid to our charge, that we can have licence to commit Perjuries, or
any other ſin, to advantage our Cauſe, being expreſly againſt the Doctrine of
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying <hi>(Non ſunt facienda mala ut eveniant bona)</hi> Evil is not to be
done that good may come thereof; and therefore we hold it in all caſes unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to kill or murther any Perſon whatſoever, much more our lawful King now
Reigning, whoſe Perſon and temporal Dominions we are ready to defend againſt
any Opponent whatſoever, none excepted.</p>
                        <p>I forgive all thoſe that contrived my Death, and beg pardon of Almighty God,

that what I ſay is true, that I am as innocent of what is laid to my charge, of

Perjury, killing Kings, and other the moſt enormous Crimes: I do hereby utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

malicious and moſt wicked Calumny caſt on them, who do with all their hearts
and ſouls hate and deteſt ſuch wicked and damnable practices, and in the words
of a dying Man, and as I hope for mercy at the hands of God, before whom I

                        <p>I Am now come to the laſt Scene of Mortality, to the hour of my Death; an
hour, which is the Horizon between Time and Eternity; an hour, which
muſt either make me a Star to ſhine for ever in the Empire above, or a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand
to burn everlaſtingly among the damned Souls in Hell below; an hour, in
which if I deal ſincerely, and with a hearty ſorrow acknowledge my Crimes,
I may hope for mercy; but if I falſly deny them, I muſt expect nothing but
Eternal damnation: and therefore what I ſhall ſay in this great hour, I hope you
will believe. And now I do ſolemnly ſwear, proteſt and vow by all that is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
in Heaven or on Earth, and as I hope to ſee the face of God in Glory,
That I am as innocent as the Child unborn of thoſe Treaſonable Crimes which
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwore againſt me in my Tryal, and for which Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Death was paſs'd againſt me the day after my Tryal: And that you
may be aſſured, I do in like manner proteſt and ſwear, as I hope to ſee the face
of God in Glory, That I do not, in what I ſay unto you, make uſe of any Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
mental Reſervation, material Prolocution, or any ſuch ways to palliate
Truth; or if I do make uſe of any Diſpenſation from the Pope, or any body elſe,
or of any Oath of Secrecy, or any Abſolution in Confeſſion, or out of Confeſſion,
to deny the Truth; but I ſpeak in the plain ſence which the words bear: And
if I do ſpeak in any other terms, to palliate, hide or deny the Truth, I wiſh with
all my Soul that God may exclude me from his Heavenly Glory, and condemn
me to the loweſt place of Hell fire: And ſo much to that point.</p>
                        <p>And now, dear Countrymen, in the ſecond place, I do confeſs and own to the
whole World, that I am a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, and a Prieſt, and one of that ſort of
Prieſts which you call <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now, becauſe they are ſo falſly charged for holding the King-killing
Doctrine, I think it my duty to proteſt to you with my laſt dying words. That
neither I in particular, nor the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in general, hold any ſuch Opinion, but
utterly abhorr and deteſt it: And I aſſure you, that among the vaſt number of
Authors, which among the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have printed Philoſophy, Divinity-Caſes, or
Sermons, there is not one to the beſt of my knowledge that allows of King-killing
Doctrine, or holds this poſition, That it is lawful for a private perſon to
kill a King, although a Heretick, Pagan, or Tyrant: There is (I ſay) not one
<hi>Jeſuit</hi> that holds this, except <hi>Mariana</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Jeſuit,</hi> and he defends it not
abſolutely, but Problematically, for which his Book was called in again, and the
Opinion expung'd and cenſured.</p>

                           <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105635:3"/>
And is it not a ſad thing, that for the raſhneſs of one ſingle man, (whilſt the
reſt cry out againſt him, and hold the contrary) that a whole Religious Order
ſhould be ſentenced? But I have not time now to discuss the point at large, and
therefore I refer you all to a Royal Author, I mean the wiſe and victorious King
<hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. of <hi>France,</hi> the Royal Grandfather of our preſent gracious King,
who in a publick Oration which he pronounced himſelf in defence of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
(among other things) declares, That he was very well ſatisfied with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
Doctrine concerning Kings, as believing it conformable to what the beſt Doctors
of the Church have taught.</p>
                        <p>But why do I relate the Teſtimony of one particular Prince, when the whole
Catholick World is the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Advocate? For to them chiefly <hi>Germany, France,
Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> truſt she Education of their Youth, and to them in a
great meaſure they truſt their own Souls to be governed in the Sacraments.</p>
                        <p>And can you imagine ſo many great Kings and Princes, and ſo many wiſe
Statiſts, ſhould do or permit this to be done in their Kingdoms, if the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> were
men of ſuch damnable Principles, as they are now taken for in <hi>England?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the third place, dear Countreymen, I do Atteſt, That as I never in my
life did machine or contrive either the Depoſing or Death of the King, ſo now I
do heartily deſire of God to grant Him a quiet and happy Reign upon Earth, and
an everlaſting Crown in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>For the Judges alſo and the Jury, and all thoſe which were any ways concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either in my Trial, Accuſation, or Condemnation, I do humbly ask of God
both temporal and eternal Happineſs: And as for Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi>
who (I call God to witneſs) have brought me by falſe Oaths to this untimely
end, I heartily forgive them, becauſe God commands me ſo to do, and I beg of
God in his infinite mercy to grant them true ſorrow and repentance in this World,
that they may be capable of eternal Happineſs in the next. And ſo having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
my Duty towards my Self, and innocence to wards my Order and its
Doctrine, to my Neighbours and the World, I have nothing elſe to do now my
great God, but to caſt my ſelf into the Arms of thy Mercy, as firmly as I judge
that I my ſelf am, as certainly as I believe that you are one divine Eſſence, and
three divine Perſons, and in the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, you became Man
to redeem me; I alſo believe you are an eternal Rewarder of good, and a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſer
of bad: In fine, I believe all you have revealed, for your infinite Veracity,
I hope in you above all things, for your infinite Fidelity, and I love you above
all things, for your infinite Beauty and Goodneſs, and I am heartily ſorry that
ever I offended ſo great a God; with my whole heart I am contended to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
an ignominious Death for the Love of you my dear Jeſus, ſeeing you have
been pleaſed to undergo an ignominious Death for me.</p>

            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> he ſpake twice, much to the ſame purpoſe and effect with his
Brethren; whoſe Speech being too long to be contain'd in this Sheet, I thought
fit to omit it: But in ſum, <hi>He profeſſed that he was wholly innocent as to
any Plot, or Conſpiracy againſt the Life of his Sacred Majeſty, or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the Government;</hi> which he declared with great earneſtneſs and
aſſeveration, praying God to forgive his Judges, Jurors, Witneſſes and Accuſers.
And ſo laying all their heads to <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s, after ſome ſecret conference,
they made their final <hi>Exit</hi> and <hi>Cataſtrophe.</hi>
