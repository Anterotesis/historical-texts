         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>MY Lord <hi>ANG<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi>'s Death is generally Regrated by all, which occaſions ſome
that are better acquaint with his Circumſtances to Reflect a little more freely
on his going to this Campaign to ſerve under King <hi>William;</hi> And on that
part you are ſuppoſed to have had in it: For they ſay, that my Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
and his Family were particularly obliedged by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and King
<hi>James</hi> his Succeſſour: For ſuch was King <hi>Charles</hi> his Concern and care of that Noble
and Ancient Family, that in the year, 1682. He wrote to the Lord Chancellour, and
Theaſurer of <hi>Scotland</hi> to know it's preſent condition, ſhewing that in regard of many
ſignal ſervices performed by that Family to his Royal Predeceſſours, he would not
only ſee to its ſtanding, but to its continuance, in a ſplendid and plentiful condition.
And that in the mean time he would take care of the breeding of the Marques's Son:
For which effect in the Year, 1684. There was realie granted to my Lord <hi>Angus</hi> a
Penſion of two hundred Pound Sterling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this penſion King <hi>James</hi> in the Year,
1686. Was pleaſed to continue, and alſo to order all the Arrears thereof to be payed,
with two hundred pound Sterling more, by way of advance: Which were certainly
ſingular marks of the Royal Bountie of theſe two Kings: And a very promiſing ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
of far greater things, that my Lord Marqueſs might have expected from them.
To this it is alſo added, That my Lord <hi>Angus</hi> himſelf was not ſo forward to have gone
to this Campagne, but did rather incline, to proſecute his Travells; and that he wrote
to you to obtain his Father's leave: Which as the Event hath happened, had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his wiſer and better Courſe. However, theſe things do a little burden both the
Marqueſs and you: And ſome are pleaſed to expreſs themſelves more freely, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
that they cannot comprehend what could have moved the Marqueſs to be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in this Affair; ſeing that notwithſtanding of the eminent Character of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and that he himſelf was amongſt the firſt to advance King <hi>William</hi>'s Intereſt in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and did both venture his Son to the Army, and put himſelf, without regard
to the low condition of his Fortune, to a conſiderable expence for his Equippage: Yet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33952:2"/>
it is viſible enough, that ſince the late Revolution to this day, the Marqueſs hath been
acknowledged in nothing, and neither Place nor Penſion conferred upon him. It's
like the Marqueſs may be unwilling that this laſt part ſhould be noticed, as knowing,
That King <hi>William,</hi> a Stranger, cannot be blamed for this Omiſſion: And that the
diſtribution of Favours depends often as much upon the Miniſters, as upon the Prince. But
ſeing theſe things do furniſh diſcourſe, I ſhould be content to hear from you ſuch a
clear and ſatisfying Account, as might inable me to do my Lord and you the ſervice in
this occaſion, that you may very juſtly expect from,</p>

                  <p>I Take it very kindly, that you do ſo far concern your ſelf in this Affair, touching
my Lord <hi>Angus,</hi> his Loſs, if he be loſt, (which you may be ſure we are loath to
believe) is indeed irrepairable, and never enough to be regrated: And thence
you and all Equitable Men, may very well conclude, That my Lord, his Father,
had never ventured him, if the thing could poſſibly have been evited: But as he was
the only Son, and hope of the Family, and had from his Fathers extream Care and
Tenderneſs, received a ſutable Education; So you ſee that his Ripening years, with
the concurrence of other things, did preſent to him this occaſion, which not only he
himſelf, but all acquainted with the condition of his Family judged very proper, to
recommend him to the Kings Notice and Favour, And to introduce him to thoſe
Advantages, which his Family ſtands ſo abſolutely in need of. The only demurr that
ſtood in his Fathers way, was the hazard of his Perſon; And that did weigh ſo much
with him, and the principal Friends of the Family; That tho my Lord <hi>Angus</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
earneſt to have made the laſt Summers Campaigne; Yet his Father did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
him: But as that Reſtraint could not be made effectual without ſome inſinuation
of Hope for the enſuing year, from thoſe that were imployed to deal with him: So
both together wought ſo powerfully upon his boyling Spirit, Aſpyring ſo Vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſhew himſelf worthy of his Noble Progenitors, That at the Return of this
Campaign, it was utterly impoſſible to make him defer any longer. And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that had the ſevereſt of his Friends known his Earneſtneſs in this matter, as
well as his Father and I did, They would this day have been very far from adding to
his Fathers affliction, the leaſt cenſure of his proceeding. I cannot tell you all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
But here is one, I think may anſwer for all, Which is the coppie of the Letter he
wrote to his Father with his own hand, in <hi>January</hi> laſt, which indeed broke his Father
to a conſent, and without which it is probable, he had never been broke. This Letter
I do therefore tranſmit to you, Not doubting, but ſince it was ſo powerful upon a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Father, and all that ſee it, to prevail for their conſent; it will now be ſatisfying, to
anſwer all the murmuring that may ariſe on ſo ſad an Event. I could acquaint you with
other Letters and Paſſages, whereby you might be convinced, that his Deſire, if not
complyed with, had certainly broke out into ſome more deſperate Reſolution: But
this Letter alone was too perſwaſive to need any other ſupport. It hath pleaſed GOD,
in his high Soveraignty, to Diſpoſe otherwayes nor was hoped: But this only requires
our Submiſſion. And I am perſwaded, when all things ſhall be conſidered, all Men
will conclude, That my Lord <hi>Angus</hi>'s Conduct in this whole Affair, was ſo Rational
in every Reſpect; That it remains only to be lamented, That ſo fair Appearances
ſhould have been prevented by a Death, which, thô moſt Honourable, could never be
too late. And thus I leave you, to peruſe his Letter herein incloſed;</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot expreſs the Extreme Trouble and Grief it is to
me, to be ſo long without hearing from your Lordſhip,
ſince it is now near four moneths, that neither Mr. <hi>Cranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi>
nor <hi>I,</hi> have had the honour of one Letter, tho we
have wrote ſeveral times both of us; So I'm aſſured our
Letters muſt have been miſcarried, ſince the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>I</hi> am now under, are ſo difficult, and of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
both to me, and (if I dare ſay) to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
alſo, and the Family, I have the Honour to belong
to; That if you had got my Letters, you would not have
been ſo long of letting me know your Commands: This
made me take the Reſolution ſome dayes agoe, to write
to my Lord <hi>Drumlangrig,</hi> and the Maſter of <hi>Stair,</hi> and to intreat that they together
with the Duke of <hi>Queensberry, Melvil, Tarbat,</hi> and <hi>Carmichael,</hi> being all at Court, would
conſider upon my Caſe; And upon what might be the propereſt courſe for me to
take; Give your Lordſhip Advice of their Opinion in a Letter. My Lord, I know too
well your Lordſhips Goodneſs and Kindneſs to me, beyond moſt of Fathers, and much
beyond what ever I ſhall be able in my life to acknowledge, with that dutifulneſs that
becomes me; And therefore can proteſt to you, that <hi>I</hi> had no other, neither Deſign nor
Proſpect in Writing to <hi>London,</hi> than ſimply this, That theſe Perſons being the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Relations of our Familie, and theſe whom I have alwayes obſerved moſt concerned,
both in your Lordſhip and in me: I was perſwaded that being all at Court, they would
have a further view of things, and be more able to Judge truely what would be fitteſt
for me to do, then either they themſelves, or your Lordſhip could do, being only in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> where they could not ſo narrowly ſee the ſtate of things. I know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will be ſo good as to do what I deſired of them; But I'm ſure, my Lord,
That all that I can ever expect or pretend to hereafter, my honour in the eyes of all
the World, and all that ought to be dear to a Gentleman, are moſt deeply concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in my Conduct at this time. I have been aſſured both by my Lord <hi>Drumlangrig,</hi>
and others, That if I had been in the Campaigne laſt year, when Leiutenant General
<hi>Dowglas</hi> died, I had gotten the Regiment of Guards: And tho thats a Poſt more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and lucrative, than any I can expect to get in many years to come; Yet, my
Lord, if you knew the cenſures paſt upon my abſence. I'm perſwaded you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
my miſſing of that preferment is not the greateſt loſs <hi>I</hi> ſuffer by it. The Mr. of
<hi>Stair</hi> particularly can inform your Lordſhip, how much to my diſhonour, all the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Officers of the Army, all the Court; And I may ſay, all perhaps that knew me in
the Army, ſpoke of my being here; while others that were both younger, Men of
Qualitie, and only Sons as well as I, were there ſerving as Volunteers, tho they had
not half the Obligation to do it that lyes upon me, conſidering my Regiment was
there in actual ſervice: And how theſe Reflections went ſo far as to be ſpoken in the
Kings Bed Chamber, and even in his Majeſties own hearing, till the King had the
goodneſs to take it upon himſelf, and to tell the Company, That he had commanded
me for this year to follow my Studies. Tho this was a great goodneſs in the King to
me. Yet my Lord, I may ſay, it ſav'd but little of my Honour, ſince even my Lord
<hi>Portland,</hi> the Kings own Favourite; Notwithſtanding he both knew at the <hi>Hague,</hi> the
King had diſcharged me, and heard his Majeſty own it again in the Campt; Yet after
that ſpoke ſeriouſly of it both to my Lord <hi>Drumlangrig,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Dalrimple,</hi> and fell
a laughing at their alleadging the Kings Commands, as a thing either procured ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
by my Friends from the King, or at beſt commanded by his Majeſty out of
meer Bounty and Goodneſs; Becauſe he obſerved my Relations averſe from my ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him. And <hi>Portland</hi> told them further, that theſe ſort of Commands were not
to be obeyed by a Young Man like me. And that however the King had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me not to make the Campaign; Yet to be ſure, He would not be ill pleaſed to ſee
me diſobey him, and that I would find it would be my great Intereſt as well as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to do it. Beſides when the King ſpoke to the Maſter of <hi>Staire</hi> laſt Spring, at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> to diſcharge me from coming to the Fields, he told him expreſly, he would
not hinder me the next Year; Which coming from the King, any Man will interpret
as a poſitive command, Lievtenant General <hi>Dowglas,</hi> tho but few Dayes in the Campt,
was pleaſed both to his Nephew, and Sir <hi>Robert Dowglas</hi> in that time, to ſhow a great
concern in me, and ſpoke of my abſence in ſo ſtrong Terms, that he told them it had
been better for me to have been there, tho I ſhould have come bare-foot, and without a
whole Coat; And was pleaſed to ſay, that the next year, he would come himſelf, and
pull me from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> to the Campt, tho he ſhould be obliged to ſeek a Contribution
from my Friends that are Officers in the Army for my Subſiſtence there, ſince it was
the only way I had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both to make my own Fortune, and Contribute to the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
<pb facs="tcp:33952:3"/>
of the Family I belonged to. And Major General <hi>Talmaſh</hi> ſpoke of my abſence
with great heat to my Lievtenant Collonel, And told him, I would ruin my ſelf and
Family by it: Notwithſtanding, he knew that the King had commanded me to ſtay
here.</p>
                  <p>When theſe People who are all my Friends have ſpoke of my being from the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,
your Lordſhip may be pleaſed to conſider, what other perſons, both Princes and
General Officers of the Allyes Army, to moſt of whom <hi>I</hi> have the Honour to be known
at the leaſt, in a general acquaintance, will ſay of it; And with what freedom they will
paſs their Cenſures on me. I'm not capable to make thoſe deep Reflections upon my
own Intereſt that your Lordſhip and others of your Relations, who are much wiſer
then I, can do; But it ſeems obvious to me, that conſidering the low Circumſtances
of our Family, it will be impoſſible for me ever to raiſe my ſelf, or indeed to live as
your Son ought to do, unleſs I have the Kings Favour, and be able to obtain both His
Majeſties Protection, and ſome Penſion or place, to help me, and releive your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the burthen of maintaing me hereafter. And I find that the wiſeſt of thoſe about
the Court, think not only, that the making a Campaign will be the ſureſt way to get
ſome part in his Majeſtie good Graces; But that unleſs I do it, I can never have the Face
to pretend hereafter at Court to any thing, nor any of my Friends the confidence to
ſolicite for me. And for my own part, if I can make but this Compaign, as I hope it
will remove the foule Cenſures that have paſt on my laſt years abſence, So if I do not
make it, <hi>I</hi> do not ſee, that <hi>I</hi> can ever without Shame and Confuſion look any Man of
Honour in the Face hereafter, either at Home or Abroad; And <hi>I</hi> have reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.
I'le bee looked upon by all Men as a Coward, and one that is a diſhonour to your
Lordſhip, and to the Family: And I believe, the only part that will be left fitteſt for
me after it, will be, that your Lordſhip ſhould call me Home, and let me ſpend my
Life as a private Geutleman in the Countrey. I hope your Lordſhip will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
me for it, if the ſenſe of this touch me ſo near, ſince all that ought to be dear
to a Man upon Earth ſeems to be lying at the Stake with me in it: And when People
conſider the Race <hi>I</hi> am come off, and the Illuſtrious things done by our Predeceſſors; It
will ſerve to heighten my ſhame and confuſion, and increaſe the Worlds contempt of
me. Therefore I earneſtly beg, my deareſt Lord, by all your Lordſhips goodneſs to
me, and by all the kind Affection you have been pleaſed to ſhew to me all my life hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto;
That you would conſider on this as a thing concerns your own Honour, and
the Honour of the Family of DOWGLAS, as well as mine in particular; And that
if it be poſſible in any way of the World, you would let me wait upon the King this
Summer, tho I ſhould do it in never ſo poor and mean a way.</p>
                  <p>I know your Lordſhips ſtraits, &amp; the difficulty you may have to live, much leſs to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
me money upon this Occaſion; And I confeſs I do not ſee well how it can be
done, but if there were any poſſibility of it, I am perſwaded it will be laying out
money the moſt profitable way that ever I can ſpend it, even in point of intereſt; And
that it will be a fair, if not certain way of giving me Acceſs to obtain things hereafter
of the King: that may do much more then make up what has been given out on this
Occaſion. And beſides, I have heard both my Lord <hi>Drumlangrig</hi> and the Mr. of <hi>Stair</hi>
ſay, as well ſince the Campaigne, as laſt Spring, while we were upon this ſubject,
That if your Lordſhip conſented once freely to my making a Campaign, they were
perſwaded there might be ſome ſum of money got from the King, to help to put me
in a Condition to do it with; And I perſwade my ſelf, that both they two, and my
Lord <hi>Carmichael,</hi> would need but to be deſired by your Lordſhip, to do ſomething for
me in it. But the Seaſon is now ſo far advanced, that I know not what to do, ſince its
very like the King himſelf will be in the Fields before eight or nine weeks at the fartheſt;
And however ſmall an Equippage I have, there will be ſtill many things that will be
of an abſolute neceſſity for me, in caſe you allow me to go, and which I will have but
a very ſhort time to prepare. I intreat therefore, your Lordſhip will let me know
your Commands ſo ſoon as poſſible, for there is now no time to loſe; And I'm ſure
you will be ſatisfied, that it is neceſſary I be determined to one thing or another before
the King comes over here; ſince if I be not to make the Campaigne, I can neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at Court, nor ſtay at this place, without the Kings knowing himſelf that I am
here: If I am to make the Campaigne, I believe it will not do ill, ſo ſoon as your
Lordſhip comes to a Reſolution in it, if you ſhould write to the Secretary and <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langrig,</hi>
to ſee if they can fall upon a way to obtain any thing from the King, to help
me to make an Equippage. I only long to hear from your Lordſhip, I know you will
command me nothing but what ſhall be the fitteſt for me to do; ſo I truſt to it, and
ſhall ſtrive above all things while I live, to Carry alwayes as becomes,</p>
