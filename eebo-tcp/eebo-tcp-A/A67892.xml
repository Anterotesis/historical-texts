            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>The craftie god had stole away his wheeles.</l>
            <l>Which when he did perceiue, he downe did slide,</l>

            <l>To seeke the Nymph that <hi>Bacchus</hi> so did Ioue,</l>

            <l>VVhich when he had receiu'd, he left the land,</l>

            <l>Or else at least they would haue rested still.</l>
            <l>When he had done, he tooke his whip of steele,</l>
            <l>Whose bitter smart he made his horses feele:</l>

            <l>But the Sunnes wheeles one day disordred more,</l>
            <l>Were thrise as long amending as before.</l>
            <l>Now was the Sunne inuiron'd with the Sea,</l>
            <l>Cooling his watrie tresses as he lay,</l>

            <l>Paynted her chaste cheeks with a blushing red,</l>

            <l>And did deserue to be accounted fayre.</l>
            <l>And thus much spake she while the boy abode:</l>
            <l>O boy, most worthy to be thought a god,</l>
            <l>Thou mayst inhabit in the glorious place</l>
            <l>Of gods, or maist proceed from humane race:</l>
            <l>Thou mayst be <hi>Cupid,</hi> or the god of wine,</l>
            <l>That lately woo'd me with the swelling vine:</l>
            <l>But whosoe're thou art, O happy he,</l>
            <l>That was so blest, to be a sire to thee;</l>
            <l>Thy happy mother is most blest of many,</l>
            <l>Blessed thy sisters, if her wombe bare any,</l>
            <l>Both fortunate, and O thrise happy shee,</l>
            <l>Whose too much blessed brests gaue suck to thee:</l>
            <l>If any wife with thy sweet bed be blest,</l>
            <l>O, she is farre more happy then the rest;</l>
            <l>If thou hast any, let my sport be sto'ne,</l>
            <l>Or else let me be she, if thou hast none.</l>
            <l>Here did she pause awhile, and then she sayd,</l>
            <l>Be not obdurate to a silly mayd.</l>
            <l>A flinty heart within a snowy brest,</l>
            <l>Is like base mold lockt in a golden chest:</l>
            <l>They say the eye's the Index of the heart,</l>
            <l>And shewes th'affection of eche inward part:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:8089:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>There loue playes liuely, there the little god</l>

            <l>O barre him not from playing in thy heart,</l>
            <l>That sports himselfe vpon eche outward part.</l>
            <l>Thus much she spake, &amp; then her tongue was husht.</l>
            <l>At her loose speach <hi>Hermaphroditus</hi> blusht:</l>
            <l>He knew not what loue was, yet loue did shame him,</l>
            <l>Making him blush, and yet his blush became him:</l>
            <l>Then might a man his shamefast colour see,</l>
            <l>Like the ripe apple on the sunny tree,</l>
            <l>Or Iuory dide o're with a pleasing red,</l>
            <l>Or like the pale Moone being shadowed.</l>
            <l>By this, the Nymph recouer'd had her tongue,</l>
            <l>That to her thinking lay in silence long,</l>
            <l>And sayd, Thy cheeke is milde, O be thou so,</l>
            <l>Thy cheeke, saith I, then do not answere no,</l>
            <l>Thy cheeke doth shame, then doe thou shame, she sayd,</l>

            <l>Men are but mortals, so are women too,</l>

            <l>For sure they doe aspire: Else could a youth,</l>
            <l>Whose count'nance is so full of spotlesse truth,</l>
            <l>Be so relentlesse to a virgins tongue?</l>
            <l>Let me be woo'd by thee but halfe so long,</l>
            <l>With halfe those tearmes doe but my loue require,</l>
            <l>And I will easly graunt thee thy desire.</l>
            <l>Ages are bad, when men become so slow,</l>
            <l>That poore vnskilfull mayds are forc't to woo.</l>

            <l>That she had wonne his loue, but that the light</l>
            <l>Of her translucent eyes did shine too bright:</l>
            <l>For long he look'd vpon the louely mayd,</l>
            <l>And at the last <hi>Hermaphroditus</hi> sayd,</l>
            <l>How should I loue thee, when I doe espie</l>
            <l>A farre more beauteous Nymph hid in thy eye?</l>
            <l>When thou doost loue, let not that Nymph be nie thee;</l>
            <l>Nor when thou woo'st, let that same Nymph be by thee:</l>
            <l>Or quite obscure her from thy louers face,</l>
            <l>Or hide her beauty in a darker place.</l>
            <l>By this, the Nymph perceiu'd he did espie</l>
            <l>None but himselfe reflected in her eye,</l>
            <l>And, for himselfe no more she meant to shew him,</l>
            <l>She shut her eyes &amp; blind-fold thus did woo him:</l>
            <l>Fayre boy, thinke not thy beauty can dispence</l>
            <l>With any payne due to a bad offence;</l>
            <l>Remember how the gods punisht that boy</l>

            <l>Her long wisht pleasure; for the peeuish elfe,</l>

            <l>He nightly kisseth <hi>Thaetis</hi> in the sea:</l>
            <l>All know the story of <hi>Leucothoe.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>His cheeke is red; so is the fragrant Rose,</l>
            <l>Whose ruddie cheeke with ouer-blushing gloes:</l>
            <l>Then that's the cause; and yet that cannot bee:</l>
            <l>Eche blushing Rose is farre more bold then he,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:8089:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>Whose boldnesse may be plainely seene in this,</l>
            <l>The ruddy Rose is not asham'd to kisse;</l>
            <l>For alwayes when the day is new begun,</l>
            <l>The spreading Rose will kisse the morning Sun.</l>
            <l>This sayd, hid in the grasse she did espie him,</l>
            <l>And stumbling with her will, she fel down by him,</l>
            <l>And with her wanton talke, because he woo'd not,</l>
            <l>Beg'd that, which he poore nouice vnderstood not:</l>
            <l>And, for she could not get a greater blisse,</l>
            <l>She did intreat at least a sisters kisse;</l>
            <l>But still the more she did the boy beseech,</l>
            <l>The more he powted at her wanton speech.</l>
            <l>At last the Nymph began to touch his skin,</l>
            <l>Whiter then mountaine snow hath euer bin,</l>
            <l>And did in purenesse that cleare spring surpasse,</l>
            <l>Wherein <hi>Actaeon</hi> saw th'Arcadian lasse.</l>
            <l>Thus did she dally long, till at the last,</l>
            <l>In her moyst palme she lockt his white hand fast:</l>
            <l>Then in her hand his wrest she 'gan to close,</l>
            <l>When through his pulses strait the warme bloud gloes,</l>
            <l>Whose youthfull musike fanning <hi>Cupids</hi> fire,</l>
            <l>In her warme brest kindled a fresh desire.</l>
            <l>Then did she lift her hand vnto his brest,</l>
            <l>A part as white and youthfull as the rest,</l>
            <l>Where, as his flowry breath still comes and goes,</l>
            <l>She felt his gentle heart pant through his clothes.</l>
            <l>At last she tooke her hand from off that part,</l>
            <l>And sayd, It panted like anothers heart.</l>
            <l>Why should it be more feeble, and lesse bold?</l>
            <l>Why should the bloud about it be more cold?</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:8089:19"/>Nay sure, that yeelds, onely thy tongue denyes,</l>
            <l>And the true fancy of thy heart belyes.</l>
            <l>Then did she lift her hand vnto his chin,</l>
            <l>And prays'd the prety dimpling of his skin:</l>
            <l>But straight his chin she 'gan to ouerslip,</l>
            <l>When she beheld the rednesse of his lip;</l>
            <l>And sayd, thy lips are soft, presse them to mine,</l>
            <l>And thou shalt see they are as soft as thine.</l>
            <l>Then would she faine haue gone vnto his eye,</l>
            <l>But still his ruddy lip standing so nie,</l>
            <l>Drew her hand backe, therefore his eye she mist,</l>
            <l>'Ginning to claspe his neck, and would haue kist;</l>
            <l>But then the boy did struggle to be gone,</l>
            <l>Vowing to leaue her and that place alone.</l>
            <l>But then bright <hi>Salmacis</hi> began to feare,</l>
            <l>And sayd, Fayre stranger, I wil leaue thee here</l>
            <l>Amid these pleasant places all alone.</l>
            <l>So turning back, she fayned to be gone;</l>
            <l>But from his sight she had no power to passe,</l>
            <l>Therefore she turn'd, and hid her in the grasse,</l>
            <l>When to the ground bending her snow-white knee,</l>
            <l>The glad earth gaue new coates to euery tree.</l>
            <l>He then supposing he was all alone,</l>
            <l>(Like a young boy that is espy'd of none)</l>
            <l>Runnes here, and there, then on the bankes doth looke,</l>
            <l>Then on the cristall current of the brooke,</l>
            <l>Then with his foote he toucht the siluer streames,</l>
            <l>Whose drowzy waues made musike in their dreames,</l>
            <l>And, for he was not wholy in, did weepe,</l>
            <l>Talking alowd and babbling in their sleepe:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:8089:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>Whose pleasant coolenesse when the boy did feele,</l>
            <l>He thrust his foote downe lower to the heele:</l>
            <l>O'recome with whose sweet noyse, he did begin</l>
            <l>To strip his soft clothes from his tender skin,</l>
            <l>When strait the scorching Sun wept teares of brine,</l>
            <l>Because he durst not touch him with his shine,</l>
            <l>For feare of spoyling that same Iu'ry skin,</l>
            <l>Whose whitenesse he so much delighted in;</l>
            <l>And then the Moone, mother of mortall ease,</l>
            <l>Would fayne haue come from the <hi>Antipodes,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To haue beheld him naked as he stood,</l>
            <l>Ready to leape into the siluer flood;</l>
            <l>But might not: for the lawes of heauen deny,</l>
            <l>To shew mens secrets to a womans eye:</l>
            <l>And therefore was her sad and gloomy light</l>
            <l>Confin'd vnto the secret-keeping night.</l>
            <l>When beauteous <hi>Salmacis</hi> awhile had gaz'd</l>
            <l>Vpon his naked corps, she stood amaz'd,</l>
            <l>And both her sparkling eyes burnt in her face,</l>
            <l>Like the bright Sunne reflected in a glasse:</l>
            <l>Scarce can she stay from running to the boy,</l>
            <l>Scarce can she now deferre her hoped ioy;</l>
            <l>So fast her youthfull bloud playes in her vaynes,</l>
            <l>That almost mad, she scarce her selfe contaynes.</l>
            <l>When young <hi>Hermaphroditus</hi> as he stands,</l>
            <l>Clapping his white side with his hollow hands,</l>
            <l>Leapt liuely from the land, whereon he stood,</l>
            <l>Into the mayne part of the cristall flood.</l>
            <l>Like Iu'ry then his snowy body was,</l>
            <l>Or a white Lilly in a cristall glasse.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:8089:20"/>Then rose the water-Nymph from where she lay,</l>
            <l>As hauing wonne the glory of the day,</l>
            <l>And her light garments cast from off her skin.</l>
            <l>Hee's mine, she cry'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so leapt spritely in.</l>
            <l>The flattering Iuy who did euer see</l>
            <l>Inclaspe the huge trunke of an aged tree,</l>
            <l>Let him behold the young boy as he stands,</l>
            <l>Inclaspt in wanton <hi>Salmacis's</hi> hands,</l>
            <l>Betwixt those Iu'ry armes she lockt him fast,</l>
            <l>Striuing to get away, till at the last,</l>
            <l>Fondling, she sayd, why striu'st thou to be gone?</l>
            <l>Why shouldst thou so desire to be alone?</l>
            <l>Thy cheeke is neuer fayre, when none is by:</l>
            <l>For what is red and white, but to the eye?</l>
            <l>And for that cause the heauens are darke at night,</l>
            <l>Because all creatures close their weary sight;</l>
            <l>For there's no mortall can so earely rise,</l>
            <l>But still the morning waytes vpon his eyes.</l>
            <l>The earely-rising and soone-singing Larke</l>
            <l>Can neuer chaunt her sweete notes in the darke;</l>
            <l>For sleepe she ne're so little or so long,</l>
            <l>Yet still the morning will attend her song.</l>
            <l>All creatures that beneath bright <hi>Cinthia</hi> be,</l>
            <l>Haue appetite vnto society;</l>
            <l>The ouerflowing waues would haue a bound</l>
            <l>Within the confines of the spacious ground,</l>
            <l>And all their shady currents would be plaste</l>
            <l>In hollow of the solitary vaste,</l>
            <l>But that they lothe to let their soft streames sing,</l>
            <l>VVhere none can heare their gentle murmuring.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:8089:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>Yet still the boy regardlesse what she sayd,</l>
            <l>Struggled apace to ouerswimme the mayd.</l>
            <l>Which when the Nymph perceiu'd, she 'gan to say,</l>
            <l>Struggle thou mayst, but neuer get away.</l>
            <l>So graunt, iust gods, that neuer day may see</l>
            <l>The separation twixt this boy and mee.</l>
            <l>The gods did heare her pray'r and feele her woe;</l>

            <l>She felt his youthfull bloud in euery vaine;</l>
            <l>And he felt hers warme his cold brest againe.</l>
            <l>And euer since was womans loue so blest,</l>
            <l>That it will draw bloud from the strongest brest.</l>
            <l>Nor man nor mayd now could they be esteem'd:</l>
            <l>Neither, and either, might they well be deem'd,</l>

            <l>Let your poore offsprings latest breath be blest,</l>
            <l>In but obtayning this his last request,</l>

            <l>His parents hark'ned to his last request,</l>
            <l>And with that great power they the fountaine blest.</l>
            <l>And since that time who in that fountaine swimmes,</l>
