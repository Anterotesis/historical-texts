         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to your deſires and the duty of
an honeſt man, I have endeavoured to
ſearch and find out the corruptions of
the Grandees and truſtees in thoſe parts
which have tended to the great blemiſh
and prejudice of the Integrity of the
Parliament and Armies proceedings,
and to the great oppreſſion of the poore
people. Sr. I formerly gave you intimation in generall, the
deſired particuler whereof I deferred till this time, aſwell for
that the greater affaires of the Kingdome being then in hand,
and I know your leyſure would not yet admit to preſent them
ſeaſonably to the Councell of the Army, as alſo longer time
was advantagious unto me, that I might preſent unto you a
perfect and faithfull account, ſince now the ſtumbling block
is removed the peoples feares will be ſooneſt ſecured, and their
love moſt intirely united unto us, when they ſee Iuſtice run
with ſo cleare a current on our parts, that their aggrievances
ſhall be queſtioned and righted againſt ſuch (though once tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
as Committees or in what Authority ſoever) who have
acted their owne wills and arbitrary Government upon the
people, for their owne private ends. Sr. I acquainted you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
with the Names of the Committees in the ſeverall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
in <hi>York-ſhire;</hi> what I writ then concerning Sir <hi>Henry
Cholmley,</hi> his actions ſince have rendred ſufficient proofe.</p>
            <p>For the Weſt-riding J find theſe men predominant, Sir
<hi>Robert Barwick,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Roades,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stockdale,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arrer.</hi> The firſt a mutable man, and to the judgement of all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49934:3"/>
honeſt men a meer-time-ſerver, upon every overture change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in his Principles, which troubles the well-affected that
ſuch an one ſhould be Chaire-man in their Committee; hee
being a Lawyer, the place is ſerviceable to him to make any
buſineſſe he will (if before-hand he receive a liking Fee) goe
well by his opinion. For the ſecond Sir <hi>Edward Roades,</hi> when
he was made Governour of <hi>Cawood</hi> Caſtle under <hi>Hotham,</hi> he
was alwaies ſubſervant to his ſelfe-end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; by Plunder to the
diſhonour of our cauſe it being the Originall example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the firſt occaſion of Scandal the enemy everhad, to
caſt dirt upon our undertakings; Beſides this way, to enrich
himſelfe he became Farmer of Delinquents eſtates (contrary
to the Ordinance of Parliament, that no Committee man
ſhould farme Sequeſtrations at low rates, to the great loſſe of
the Publike. Now in this late Warre, his aſſociates in the
Committee of the Militia appointed him Colonell (as indeed
they preferred none to chiefe Commands but their own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
the better to command their owne Army (they terming
it ſo) to fight the Independant, if the <hi>Scots</hi> had been in a way
ſuccesfull; by which truſt he raiſed horſe and money at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
without limitation, having a Major byaſſed for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and have got cleere into their purſes without fighting
one ſtroke 3000. l.</p>
            <p>For the third, Mr. <hi>Stockdale</hi> a perſon of a boundleſſe ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
(though a Parliament man) drives on an intereſt for his
owne benefit with the Committee, for there is profit hoped
for without acaount, he hath much enriched himſelfe as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
a warre, yet beſides all this he hath received repaire for
his loſſes to a much greater value then ever hee ſuſtained, very
undeſerving of ſuch reſpects; for ſince the time of tryall, his
Faith could not ſupport his Courage, but ſought for ſecurity
by ſhaking hands with <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> and getting his goods by
them protected, yet upon pretence as his wives Act, who gave
forth ſhee had procured a Protection from <hi>Langdale.</hi> Iudge
by this how the good cauſe of the Kingdome was diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
by him, who ſhould have been one of the chiefe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49934:3"/>
For the fourth, Mr. <hi>Farrer</hi> one who is no leſſe then the former ayming
at his private intereſt, hath turned his Houſe into the Committee Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
making his place like a trade of benefit, pitty hee hath any Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of truſt, for it is well known his readineſs to comply with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in the beginning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt War, informing daily the other party what
paſſed at their boord, and ſo zealous for the <hi>Scots,</hi> that he oppoſed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
of the Miniſters of <hi>Scotland</hi> Remouſtrance to their Parliament,
which was thought a moſt neceſſary thing by the well affected for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the County, that it might more plaine appeare, wee had a
party in <hi>Scotland</hi> notwithſtanding their threatning Army, it is evident
what we might have expected from them (if they had reached an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity)
the major part of the <hi>Militia</hi> adhering.</p>
            <p>For the North-riding, Sir <hi>Henry Cholmley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Darley,</hi> Mt. <hi>Iohn
Waſtell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ralph R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mer.</hi> For the firſt, his wayes &amp; actions are knowne
unto you already, and ſo I leave him to bee buried in the ruines of his
owne diſgraces. For the ſecond, by his power in Sequeſtration and
priviledge as a Parliament man, hee hath well ſtopped his Creditors
mouthes, and offers for the preſent 15000. l. for a Purchaſe; if this were
well examined no doubt it will appeare, hee hath been very ingenious
for himſelfe in the North, and no leſſe at <hi>Goldſmiths</hi>-Hall, by his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to ſerve Delinquents. His trade at <hi>Goldſmiths</hi>-Hall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Habber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſhers</hi>-hall,
and at Committees in the North will witneſſe his gaines,
and many frauds he uſed; having by ſeverall Orders from himſelf one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
taken upon him the whole power of the aforeſaid Committees. But
his practiſes with Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmley,</hi> whoſe Priſoner hee was, though
releaſed by Contract between themſelves; Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> giving him 200. l.
in Gold and foure Horſes, which Mr. <hi>Darley</hi> (moſt lovingly) ſhortly
after requites; procuring a Ceſſation for Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> in Harveſt-time,
which hee made good uſe of; for he victuals the Caſtle with all Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Beefe and Pork caried 300 load of Corne and Hay from the next
adjacent Villages into the Caſtle. Hee kept ever after Iutell<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gence by
Character with Sir <hi>Hugh;</hi> and when the Caſtle came to be diſtreſſed
by Sickneſſe and Scurvie, hee gave a warrant to <hi>Iohn Goures</hi> wife to goe
into the Caſtle with as much Medicaments as was more then enough to
have cured all the diſeaſes in the Caſtle, but was hindered by the then
Beſiegers. Hee hath procured 5000. l. for his Fathers and his ſufferings,
though both of them before theſe late times was ſcarce worth ſo much;
he is a great Enemy to the Army, and never ſent in or appeared at the
laſt Aſſizes at <hi>Yorke;</hi> notwithſtanding hee is continued a Truſtee for
the State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49934:4"/>
For Mr. <hi>Iohn Waſtell</hi> a man armed Cap-a-pee, a Colonell, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
man, a Committee man, a Lawyer, a Iuſtice of Peace, a favourite
of all ſides, plaufible to all whom hee can deceive or make uſe of by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finuation,
none can be more properly called a <hi>Nuter,</hi> or rather a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Actor on all ſides; for it is well knowne his complyance with all
Intereſts <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Kings party, for there a Compoſition was payd for
him to the Lord of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and came downe to <hi>Hull</hi> to compleat his
peace; but that the Siege then and the ſucceſſe thereof prevented his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
progreſſe. And for the <hi>Scots</hi> party, his aſſurings and affections are
plainly viſible, he giving them Protections ſince our victory. His wayes
to our owne parties appeare zealous, but it is time to bee cautious of a
man of ſuch ſiniſter dealings; No man yet hath been ſo bold or watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to protect Papiſts and other Delinquents, notorious in ſo high a
manner nor ſo open handed for gratuities, that ever I heard of, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
himſelfe; For being guarded with thus much power hee inſures all
his Actions unqueſtionable; As Colonell hee inſlaves the Countrey as
having impoſed taxes beyond all meaſure of former Preſidents the
laſt raiſing of his Regiment, having coſt the Countrey 5000. l. (and yet
himſelfe never in any Service.) As Parliament man, hee ſeldome
appeares, for his gainfull trade is in the Countrey; As Committee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Lawyer, and Iuſtice, what hee pleaſeth to conclude, is law.</p>
            <p>Hee made his Brother, and Brother in law <hi>Weſtall</hi> and <hi>Wadnell,</hi> Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators
(though they were then beggers) both which have inriched
themſelves to Thouſands, hee got the Lead Mines at <hi>Marryke</hi> into his
hands, worth cleerly in Rent 1500. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> which he payd little or
nothing for. <hi>(Whoſoever is the Miller hee will be his Dog;)</hi> he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
dangerous to the State, hath got much by the aforeſaid wayes, which
hath much increaſed his Eſtate, and one if further truſted will moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
betray the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Rymer,</hi> hee is Treaſurer for that Riding, though his credit
could not ſecure before theſe times 20. l. being indeed (as I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
worſe then nothing, And the Country accounted it a Paradox,
that a begger ſhould become a Treaſurer; yet notwithſtanding his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderableneſſe,
he is one of the chiefe of the Committee, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
repreſents the whole by divers Orders (hee makes of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,)
with the Clarkes hand to it, carries the authority of an Order (as
they two compact); make uſe to impoſe, grant, receive, or remit what
they pleaſe; the like unlimited proceedings are now paralell'd (as they
ſay) in any Committee. Lately made a Juſtice of Peace, though before
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49934:4"/>
ſo inconſiderable, that hee had not one foot of Land any where, except
lately bought with the States money; His Landlord Sir <hi>Edward Osborne</hi>
would have declared of this Gent: abilities, by what he was in arreare
to him in rent, but whatſoever hee was then, hee hath thouſands now.</p>
            <p>For the Eaſt-riding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is Mr. <hi>Thorpe</hi> the Lawyer, Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher
Ledgert,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Darley,</hi> with his youngeſt Brother; in thoſe parts
my ſtay was not long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but at <hi>Hull</hi> I met with a Charge which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and ſworne before Sir <hi>Mathew Boynton</hi> and divers others, then in
power to act for the Parliament, which renders him diſaffected; It
conſiſts of many Articles, materiall enough to forfeit the honour lately
conferred upon him, and make him as grand a Delinquent as any who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
No marvell that Committees are ſo cryed forth on (though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uſefull in their kind) ſo long as Vipers are nouriſhed in their boſome.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Ledgers,</hi> his actings have not been great at their Boord, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his Martiall imployments, being a <hi>Militia</hi> Colonell, choſen as a
fit ſervant for them. Hee hath obtained 5000. l. for his arreares, though
he never did ten groates worth of ſervice, he was caſhiered before upon
Iealouſie of the confederacy with <hi>Hotham;</hi> hee is much againſt the
Army, but he is one can doe little hurt; For his valour, or credit, caries
little commendations in his Countrey. Thoſe that procured him the
5000. l. made him late Colonell, the Forces rayſed by him was to put
him into a condition to make good tearmes; for his Patrons the <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
Anlibyes,</hi> and <hi>Thorp;</hi> In caſe Lieutenant Gen. <hi>Cromwell</hi> had been
overthrown; then it would have appeared whom he would have fought
for; it were well if theſe things were timely looked unto; For there
were more Birds of that County, that wore the ſame feathers, which
would all have flowne together, if any diſaſter had hapned to the Army.</p>
            <p>For the two laſt, I thinke both Tradeſmen (if not broke) their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in their Country is not much more then the ayre they were borne
in; They have by-friends got to bee of the Committee; Mr. <hi>Richard</hi>
was made Treaſurer, but ſince hee became a Member of the Houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for want of conſtant Reſidence uncapable of the place; yet loath to
part with ſo ſweet a profit, obtained for a Kinſman to be his Subſtitute;
But the younger Gentleman being none of the Committee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not generally reſented, by all meanes hee pulls in his Brother (one
would thinke as by intayle) unto him and his Kindred for ever. Its ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
decerned, there is more in it then a direct benefit, when Treaſurers
was never yet called to an Accompt (their continuance in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
tribble have been ſo long.) Beſides hee is much ſuſpected, being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49934:5"/>
both needy and crafty; Little rumour'd yet, concerning the Cariage of
the other, having but lately crept into the ſervice. A notable Artiſt, his
originall was a crackt Draper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee ſeemingly acted for the Parliament,
his wife, for the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> with whom ſhe ever held intelligence.
At the rendition of <hi>Yorke</hi> hee got imployment, broke all Articles, ſeized
Trunkes, rifled Houſes, cut downe Woods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> got to bee Treaſurer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the beſt things to be found for his owne uſe, got great ſummes
into his owne hands of the Publiques, and to ſhrowd himſelf from Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts,
and from his Debts which hee was very able to pay out of the
Common-wealths money, and to keep Thouſands; he combined with
one <hi>Blackwell</hi> another Aſſociate, to chuſe him Burgeſſe of <hi>New-Malton</hi>
(it being the cleare right of <hi>Old-Malton</hi> to elect) though now decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<hi>Old-Malton</hi> having the mother Church and Priory belonging to it.
Neither hath there been any Burgeſſe served in Parliament this 350
yeares for <hi>Malton</hi> before this preſent Parliament, which was 200 yeares
before any of <hi>New-Malton</hi> was builded. All his other indeavours ſince
have tended to get Monies, cheat the Common-wealth; and how hee
behaved himſelfe at the Kings Tryall (being in Towne all the time, and
a Member of it) is very notorious.</p>
            <p>Thus according to my Intelligence, J have preſented unto you the
cryes of the Country, which I am conſident, are not ſo loude as they
would be, being timerous to bee liberall with ſuch Tax-maſters, untill
they may receive ſome incouragement from Iuſtice to examine the
Complaints.</p>
            <p>The relation of the County of <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> Petition, to diſcover cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
men in Authority, (having had ſo favorable acceptance) perſwades
their mention in ſome like way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe being communicated to the
Generall Councell of the Army, no doubt but ſome redreſſe will be by
their meanes, afforded; untill then, honeſt men will bee unwilling to
act in Committees; by reaſon of that Ignominy and reproach, is caſt
upon them for theſe mens ſakes; So<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> none but theſe who are neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to beg imployments, are willing to attend the ſervice.</p>
            <p>From the Leaguer my Orders were for <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where I muſt
make ſome ſtay, having ſome buſineſſe of this nature; from thence I
ſhall make returne, unleſſe otherwiſe, ordered to <hi>Lnodon</hi> where I long
to bee, for the happineſſe of yours and the reſt of my Comrades ſociety;
hoping that God will give you all wiſdome to carry things righteouſly,
ayming at the great end the glory of God, in all your undertakings.</p>
