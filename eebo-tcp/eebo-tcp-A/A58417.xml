            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IF ever was a Relation, whose truth might be indubitable, it is questionlesse this which I give you at present. It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on the Publick Acts, drawn from the Registers of the Estate, and exposed to the eys of those who were ey-witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the things whereof it treateth, and made the speeches which are inserted there, and which are so faithfully related, that except one onely, there is none which was not pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the same manner as you see them here written. After this; one cannot doubt, that it may not one day serve advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiously the History of the time, whose mervellous revolution of the affairs of England, shall make one of the principal parts. It is requisite the world should know the particularities, which you shall not find but in this discourse, and I think to oblige my Country, in publishing the marks of affection and good will, which one of the first Kings of Christendom hath left it. The Relation is French, because the King would use that tongue, during the residence, whereof you have here the recital, though he that composed it, hinders it not to be extant in other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but would that all people of the Universe should know it. I confess, it would have been more proper to have put it forth as soon as it was made, immediately after the Kings departure, and I would have given you this satisfaction if the diligence of those men that graved the Plates, had answered my desire; But I cease not to hope, that it will not be ill received, and that this production, though tardive, will have its agreements, as well as the fruits, which though given by nature but in a late season, please notwithstanding, and are carefully preserved. I confess also, that some faults are escaped in the Impression, which all the diligent care of the Corrector could not avoid. There is not any though, that I know, which alters the sense, and which your discretion may not either correct, or excuse.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Parliament began at London, the fourth day of May, in this present Year 1660. <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> it was no new thing in the noble breast of his Excellence the Lord General Monck, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief of the English Army in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as sensibly touch'd with the calamities, wherewith he saw his poor country so long afflicted, to think of the means to establish there the Monarchal government, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the old and primitive Laws of the Estate. This could not be a free Parliament, and such a one as the whole Kingdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, if it were not composed of two Houses, viz. the Higher House of Lords or Peers, and the Lower House of Commons, or Deputies of the Provinces. For the same violence which had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the essential form of the estate, had so disfigured that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Body, in cutting off one of its principal members; that being incapable to act for the important affairs, which made the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55347:4"/>
convocation of that great assembly to be judged absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary if it opened not the Higher house which tyranny had shut up, it must of necessity find it fit to repeal the Lords, who had voice and place there for so many Ages; I say many Ages, because it may be truly affirmed, that this custom is no lesse an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then Monarchy it self, since that from the time that it came out of the hands of the Britans and Saxons, to passe into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of those that possesse it at present, the Estates of England never assembled but the Peers were called, as well as the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from the towns of the Kingdom. The resolution which was taken on this occasion was not so soon executed; and scarce had the two Houses began their assemblies to labour in regulating the government, which the pass'd disorders had perverted into a miserable Anarchy; but there appeared, on the twelfth of the same moneth of May, at the dore, one of the Gentlemen of the King's Bed-chamber, named Sir John Greenvil, who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">The King's Letter to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> permission to present Letters to the House from his Majesty. That Sacred name, which not long since was the aversion of var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and fanaticks, was heard with veneration, and inspired into that illustrious assembly such extraordinary and advantagious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the King, that it was impossible for it to expresse them, as we also will not undertake to represent them here upon paper. It sufficeth to say, that not above three or four months before, it had been a crime of high treason to speak in Parliament in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the King; but now no sooner is that great name pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd, then one sees a general joy in the countenance of all the commons, and observes a most high respect for that divine character. They caused the Gentleman to enter: The Speakers of the two Houses receive the King's Letters from his hand, and make the Secretary to read them, every one, in the meane time, with the greatest expressive submission of the world, standing bare headed.</p>
                  <p>The two Houses compose but one sole Parliament, and they are two members of one and the same body; so that the King in writing to each of them, upon one and the same subject, might well make use of one Letter, and addresse it not only under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55347:4"/>
inscriptions, to the two Houses; but also to General Monck for the Army; to Admiral Montague for the Fleet; and to the Major of London for the Capital town of his Kingdom, which were all united with one and the same affection, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured unanimously to make one and the same design to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. His Majesty added thereunto an excellent Declaration, <note place="margin">The King sends a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion.</note> for the safety and repose of those, who tortured in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, for having partaken in the rebellion, might fear the punishment of it, and in that fear might oppose the tranquility of the Estate, and the calling in of their lawful Prince. It is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and published, as well as the Letter: but that shall not hinder me to say, that there was never seen a more perfect assemblage of all the most excellent natural qualities, and of all the vertues, as well Royal, as Christian, wherewith a great Prince may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, then was found in those two wonderfull productions. They breath but piety and zeal for the glory of God and for Religion, but tendernesse for the afflictions of his people, but esteem for the Parliament, but firmness for the conversation of the King's rights, an admirable prudence for the regulating of affairs, an inexemplar conduct for the re-establishment of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in its former estate; love for the good, indulgence for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and a more then Christian clemency for criminals, or rather for crime it self: for a crime, I say, so black, and so abhominable, that as there hath not been an example in history, since the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, so it is to be hoped that the goodnesse of his Majesty, will not make it serve for example to the following ages. Both one and t'other wrought the effect, which the King promised to himself from them, since they fully gained the hearts, which the miseries of the time pass'd, had already very much disposed to acknowledge their Prince. For the Letter and Declaration were no sooner read, but the Parliament declared that the sentiments of the King were good, lawful, generous, and conformable to the fundamental laws of the Estate, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof ought to be composed of a King, of Lords or Peers, and of Commons; and judging that the people would be well satisfied in the Declaration which the King had granted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55347:5"/>
them; the Parliament ordained, at the same time, that most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thanks should be returned to his Majesty for the favourable Letter which he graciously had written to them: That to disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his Majesty from the place where he was, and to facilitate his passage, they ordered him presently a sum of fifty thousand pounds sterling, which was increased with another of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, by the inhabitants of the City of London<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Admiral Montague should go, with his Fleet, to attend the King's orders on the coast of Holland: That the two Houses, and City of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, should send to beseech him, by their Deputies, to come forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to take possession of the Kingdoms, which God and his Right had given him; and that, in the mean time, Sir John Greenvil should be dispatched with the Parliaments answer, and should carry to Breda the resolutions and prayers of the two Houses, or rather the just impatience which all England had to see again their Soveraign, after a sad absence of so many years.</p>
                  <p>But that which is most remarkable in these resolutions, is, that they were not taken after a long contestation, nor upon a simple acquiesment of the assembly, but by the expresse suffrages and upon the universal and unanimous consent of all the Deputies of the two Houses, who laboured in emulation of each other, which should give the most proofs of affection. The Parliament also permitted General Monck to send M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Clarges, his brother-in-law, accompanied with some Officers of the Army, to assure his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty <note place="margin">The Army declares it self.</note> of the fidelity and obedience of the Army; which had made publick and solemn protestations thereof, after the Letter and Declaration was communicated unto them by the General.</p>
                  <p>But to the end one may see plainly, what the sentiments <note place="margin">The Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Lower House his discourse to Sr. Iohn Greenvil.</note> were of all the English on this occasion, I will not fear to report here the very words which the Speaker of the house of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons said to the Gentleman, which had delivered him Letters from his Majesty. <q>It is impossible for me, said he, to expresse the acknowledgment and submission with which the Commons assembled here in Parliament, have received the Letter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his Majesty was pleased to honour them: The thing speaks it self, you have seen it with your eys, and heard it with your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55347:5"/>
ears. Our Bels, our Bonfires, and the report of our Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, have already begun to proclaim the King, and to publish our joy. We have made known to the People, that our King, the glory of England, is returning unto his Kingdom, and have heard resound in our ears these agreeable protestations, that they are ready to receive him, and their hearts open to lodge him; and as well the Parliament, as People have already cried aloud together with one voice in their prayers to the King of Kings, <hi>Long live King Charls the second.</hi> I have also to tell you, continued he, that the Parliament, not willing that you should return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some mark of acknowledgment to the King, your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and ours, hath ordained you the sum of five hundred pounds sterling, to buy you a Jewel, to make you to remember the honour which his Majesty hath done you, in charging you with a Commission of this nature, whereof you have so well acquitted your self, that the Parliament hath commanded me to give you thanks.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must confesse, that there is something very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in this marvellous revolution; but it is also certain, that there is nothing miraculous in it. The King was not surprised thereat. God used him in the conduct of this great work. He had laboured therein; he had observed the dispositions and knew the progresses thereof; and in this foresight he departed from Bruxels the last of Mareh, to go to Breda. And though since in the same month, he went sometimes to Bruxels and to Antwerp, he was resolved notwithstanding not to remain there, but to betake him to the Princess Royal his sister.</p>
                  <p>Many considerations obliged him to depart the Territorres under the obedience of the King of Spain in this conjuncture of affairs; but the sole convenience which he had at Breda, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at all times Posts from England, which passed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed every day and hour, and to go from thence unto Holland, to expedite the return into his Kingdom, might invite him to transfer his Court there for a while. He arrived there the 14. of April, and was the same day complemented by M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Snel, old <note place="margin">The King arrives at Breda.</note> Burgemaster, in the name of the Magistrate, who would likewise
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55347:6"/>
oblige the Town to make a solemn entrance to his Majesty, but the Princess Royall hindred it for most considerable reasons. The 17 the Lord Mordant arrived there, with full assurances of the good will of the Parliament, and that it would labour indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably for the re-establishment of the King as soon as it should be compleat, and that the entrance into it should be made the day that had been named for it.</p>
                  <p>From that time forward, there passed not a day almost that the King received not some remarkable news, upon which he might ground infallible hopes of his re-establishment. The 25. of April Sir John Greenvil, since Earl of Bath, and <note place="margin">Lambert's defeat.</note> Sir John Boys, brought him intelligence of the defeat of General Lambert; he had been prisoner in the Tower of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by vertue of an Ordinance of the Councel of Estate, and made an escape thence with design to put himself in the head of those that would oppose Monarchal government; but he was beaten, and taken by Colonel Ingoldsby, and brought back unto his former Prison, before he could assemble troops enough, to form the body of an Army. He received the same day Letters from Admiral Montague, which continued to assure him of the good estate of the affairs of the Kingdom, and of the sincerity of his intentions, of which he had already given proofs many months before when Sir George Booth took up Arms for the King, under the name of good Englishmen, which demanded the convocation of a Free-Parliament. The <note place="margin">The Prince of Orenge comes to Breda.</note> Prince of Orenge, his Nephew, was at Breda the 16. of the same moneth, and every day some Prince, or person of quality, came to rejoice with his Majesty for the happy change of his fortune, whereof they began to have almost infallible assurances. Prince <note place="margin">As also Prince Frederic of Nassau.</note> Frederic of Nassau, brother to Prince Maurice, of whom we shall have occasion to speak hereafter, arrived there the 2. of May, with the Prncess his wife, from his government of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen op Zoom; and the Duke of Brunswic Lunenburg, who <note place="margin">And the Duke of Brunswic Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</note> resides at Hannover, came there four daies after. The visit of this Prince, which is no lesse considerable through the excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which he possesseth, then through the Extent of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55347:6"/>
was so agreeable to his Majesty, that he could not forbear to testifie it to him on all occasions, and in a most obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: insomuch that he would voluntarily sup with his Highness, accompanied with the Dukes his brothers, and live with him in a confidence, which might make him to hope for a very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular good will for the future.</p>
                  <p>The 14 of May, a day fatal to the most potent Kingdom of <note place="margin">They know at Breda the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Christendom, for the death of the two last Kings, was that which fully assured the King of the revolution of the affairs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, through the advertisement which came to Breda of what was done in Parliament the eleventh of the same month, as we have spoken of it before; and the next day, after the news was brought, being the 15, they being of great importance, were sent <note place="margin">The news whereof is carried to the Hague.</note> to the Hague, by Letters from the Princesse Royal, which were seen in the Assembly of the Estates General. The Estates of the Province of Holland, who were at that time assembled in a body, and had by their wisedom foreseen, in the disposition of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of England, the change which would apparently arrive there, had also foreseen by their prudence, the advertisement which was given of the Declaration of the Parliament. For on <note place="margin">The Estates of Holland send Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the King.</note> thursday the 13 of May, before it could be known what passed at London, that illustrious Senate, making reflection upon the present constitution of affairs, and on the apparences of the neer and indubitable re-establishment of the King, resolved that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Beverweert, Strevelshouck, Vlooswijck, and Teylingen, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties at the Assembly from the Nobility, and from the Towns of Dort, Amsterdam, and Alckmaer, should depart immediately after they knew the intention of the Parliament, to make known to the King of great Britain the affection of this Province for the person of his Majesty, and for all the Royall Family, to testifie unto him the joy and satisfaction they had to see infallible dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, almost ready to place him in the Throne of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors; and to assure him of the strong inclination which they had to make with him, and with the Kingdoms under his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, a firm, and indissolvable alliance, for the mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the common interests of his Estate, and of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55347:7"/>
But chiefly to make him offers of service, and to beseech him to do this Province the honour to reside there, as in a place most commodious for communication with his Subjects for his passage into England; and to receive there the effects of the most sincere protestations of respect and amity, which they caused to be made unto him by their Deputies. They had also order to insist particularly upon this last point, as on the most important of their commission, and to use to this purpose the most civil and most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging terms, that interest of Estate, and affection for the good of their country could dictate to them. They enjoined also the same Deputies to officiate with the Dukes of York and Glocester, the King's brothers, and with the Princess Royall, his Sister, and that instance should be made in the Assembly of the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that the same offices might be made of their part with his Majesty, and with all the Royal persons.</p>
                  <p>The last point of this Resolution was executed the next day, <note place="margin">The Estates General send Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the King.</note> when M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Wit, Pentionary Councellor, Keeper of the great seal, and Lieutenant of the Fiefs of Holland, was in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the States General, where it was resolved, that M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Ripperda Lord of Buirse, Deputy to the States Generall of the Province of Gelderland; M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Merode, Lord of Rumme, Deputy from the Nobility of Holland to the Assembly of the same States General, named to the extraordinary Embassage of Spain; and Guldewagen of Holland, Vrybergen of Zealand, Rens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woude of Utrecht, Velsen of Frieseland, and Isbrants of Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning should go to Breda to congratulate the King for his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous re-establishment, and do with his Majesty, with the Dukes of York and Glocester, and with the Princesse Royall, the same office which the Deputies of the Province of Holland had order to do with him, in the name of their Superiours.</p>
                  <p>The States of Holland pretended, that their Deputation would have no effect, until they should have advertisement of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Parliament; not, that they doubted of its inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but because they judged, that it imported the service of the King, so to use it whereby not to prevent the Parliament, and to do nothing rashly in an affair of this consequence, where ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55347:7"/>
done out of season, was both incommodious and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Notwithstanding forasmuch as it was necessary that his Majesty should know the sentiments of the Estates, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that he should have assurance thereof under hand, by offices efficacious and capable to express them well; and to this purpose, they judged it fit that the person of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Lewes of Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau, <note place="margin">Mr. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verweert goes to Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note> Lord of Lecque and Beverweert, &amp;c. Serjeant Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Armies of the United Provinces, and Governour of the Bosch, should be so much the more proper for that, as the devoirs which he was obliged to render to the King, in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, might serve for pretext to his voiage. And, indeed, the person of this Lord should be extreamly agreeable, not only because of the affection which he had witnessed for the affairs of his Majesty during his persecution, and because of the alliance which the Lord of Ossery, eldest son of the Marquess of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Lord Deputy of Ireland, of the illustrious House of But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and now Lord Steward of England, hath taken in his House; but also, and principally, because of the great imploiments which he hath in his country, and of the excellent qualities which are found in his person. All considerations, which obliged him to see the King before he did the functions of publick Minister. He arrived at Breda on Saturday morning, the 15 of May, and executed his Commission so happily, that the King, reserving but the open declaration of his good will for the Deputies when they should be arrived, disposed himself to receive the offers and civilities which they had order to make him, with so much the more advantage and glory for this Estate, and for M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weert in particular, as Don John de Monroy who arrived the <note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of Caracene desires the King to pass into Flanders.</note> same day at Breda, had prayed his Majesty, from the Marquess of Caracene, General of the King of Spains Armies in Flanders, to take his way through the Provinces under the obedience of his Catholick Majesty, and to embark in one of the ports of those quarters, to return to his Kingdoms. Some report at that time, and even those, who took pains to observe what passed at Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, during the abode which the King made there, as sure, that Don John de Monroy had also made known to the King, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55347:8"/>
the arrears due to the troops, which the King of Spain entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the service of his Majesty, were at Bruxels, and that he might cause them to be paied as he passed. But this appeared not, no more then what passed in the conference, which the Duke of York had some daies before, with the Marquess of Caracene him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in the town of Antwerp, by order of the King, who would not go there in person, though he was pressed thereunto through the consideration of the important affairs, which he said he had order to communicate to his Majesty. The King defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the same firmness from the civilities which he sent to be made unto him, in excusing himself upon the facility which he found for his passage in the place where he was at present. I know that two reasons, principally, obliged the King to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himself, at first, to the request which M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Beverweert made him in the name of the Lords the Estates of Holland: The first, that having had advertisement, that the Parliament, and City of London sent a great number of Commissioners, he would not they should lose time in going from the Sea to Breda; and the other, that the Court was already so great, and the town so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated of provisions, that it would be impossible to lodge there; and diet the Deputies and their train, which were said to be three or four hundred Gentlemen, besides other Domesticks.</p>
                  <p>We have said that the news of the Parliaments Declaration, of the Army, and of the City of London, was carried to Breda, the precedentday, by Posts express, and that from thence it arrived the next day at the Hage, where the estate of affairs being changed since the resolutions of the former daies, as well the Estates General of the United Provinces, as those of the Province of Holland, pressed their Deputies to depart: And those last in particular, writ to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Beverweert, and gave him order to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to the King, that they had nominated already some of their body, which should be gone forthwith to congratulate his Majesty; and in the mean time to dispose him to honour that Province with his presence and abode, during the time that his affairs should oblige him to stay in the Country. They writ also, at the same time, to the Magistrates of the towns where
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55347:8"/>
the King might passe in his way, that they should make necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preparations to receive his Majesty with all the honour and magnificence that was due to so great a Monarch.</p>
                  <p>The devotion of the day of Pentecost, which hapned the <note place="margin">Order of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the Estates of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Holland.</note> 16 of May, was cause that the Deputies departed not that day; but it hindered them not from labouring in the regulation of a most important affair, and which was judged, by the Province of Holland, to be of the greatest consequence. This Estate is composed in such manner, that notwithstanding the Soveraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of al the United Provinces in one body, every Province ceaseth not to be Soveraign in particular; and they are all so jealous of their Soveraignity, that they suffer not the Generality to have other advantage in the Provinces, then that which is due unto them by vertue of their union, and of the perpetual alliance, which is, in some kind, more streight even then that of the Cantons Suizzers. So that the Deputies of the Estates Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, being to meet with those of the Estates of Holland, in the place where these pretended to represent the Soveraignity of their Province, which acknowledgeth no superiour at home; the difficulty was to order the rank between them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to each that which belongeth to it. The Estates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who had caused the King to be prayed, in particular, to honour their Province with his presence, would have him to be received and saluted, in their name, upon the Fronteer, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the charges on his way from the time he entred into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and till the first day he should arrive at the Hage, as making part of his Voiage. The Estates General, who represent not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in general, but what every Province possesseth in particular, acquiesced therein, left to the Province of Holland, all the marks of Soveraignity, and consented to this, that their Deputies, after they had congratuled the King, and conducted his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to the entrance into Holland, should remain without fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; conditionally notwithstanding, that the Deputies of Holland should do the honour of the House, and treating them of the Generallity with civility, should give them precedence in the places, where they might meet together. The Estates
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55347:9"/>
General resolved, the same day, that the King's charges should be defrayed during the whole time he stayed in the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; and ordained likewise that provision should be made for it; but at first they met with so many difficulties, that it was absolutely impossible to execute this resolution. For the Town of Breda being already starved almost, because of the great number of persons of quality which came there every day, and the hot season permitting not provisions to be brought there from other places, there was no body would undertake to treat the King; and those that would have undertaken it, could not have accomplish'd it; so that the Estate would have had the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure to see their substance dissipated, at the expense of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
                  <p>We think to relate here, as a thing most remarkable, that the same day M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Moorland, chief Commissioner under M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Thurlo, <note place="margin">Thurlo's Secretary comes to Breda.</note> who was Secretary of Estate unto Oliver Cromwel, his chief and most confident Minister of his Tyranny, arrived at Breda, where he brought divers Letters and Notes of most great importance; forasmuch as the King discovered there a part of the intricate plots of the interreign, and likewise the perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of some of those, who owed him, without doubt, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test fidelity of the world. The King received him perfectly well, made him Knight, and rendred him this publick testimony, that he had received most considerable services from him for some years past.</p>
                  <p>The 17. the Deputies of the Estates General, whom we have <note place="margin">The Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Estates General, and of Holland, depart.</note> named, departed from the Hage, about two a clock after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and embarked themselves, the same day, at Rotterdam, where the Jachts or Pinnaces, which the Estate had caused to be in readiness, attended them. Those of Holland departed in the morning, but they made not the same haste, as well because they, would not be the first in the place where the Estates were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, as because they had divers orders to give in the places of their passage.</p>
                  <p>The Deputies of the States General arrived at Breda the 18. <note place="margin">The Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Estates General arrive at Breda.</note> of May after dinner; and were met with neer the village of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55347:9"/>
Terheida by four Cornets of Horse of the Garrison, and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the Town, they found there 12 Companies of Foot drawn up in battalia; which saluted them with their shot, whil'st the Artillery thundred from the walls and bulwarks. As soon as they were come to the house which was prepared for them, they gave notice thereof to his Majesty, and next to the Dukes of York, and Glocester, and to the Princess Royal; and towards the evening the King, and their Royal Hignesses, sent them most civil salutes by Gentlemen of their House. They understood that M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Clarges, brother-in-law to General Monck, was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there the same day, and that he had brought the protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of fidelity and obedience from the Army; and the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what they had already heard of the Declaration of the Parliament: Until then the Major of the Garrison had taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Princess Royal; but the Deputies of the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, being arrived at Breda, would transfer that honour to the King, who gave the word, <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> not so much for that he considered this Town as the most powerfull of all these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, but for as much as he could not silence the resentiments which he had for the Magistrate; which had given him most il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious, and most agreeable marks of its affection.</p>
                  <p>The next day there came a Post to Breda, bringing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 paragraph">
                           <desc>〈1 paragraph〉</desc>

                     </note> that the Garrison of Dunkerck, declared for the King, and had witnessed its joy by the fire of its Cannon and Muskets. The King had the goodness to invite the Lord Lockart, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the place, to express some inclination for his service, and to give him an occasion for it by the advance he had made, and the assurances he had given him, but it could gain nothing upon that spirit prepossessed, and tied so by particular interests to the house of Cromwel, untill he was constrained to leave himself to be carried away by the general motion of the whole Army, and of the Garrison it self.</p>
                  <p>The next day being the 19. the Estates General having had advertisement by publick Letters, from their Ambassadour at London, of what passed in Parliament in behalf of the King, redoubled the orders which they had given to their Deputies,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55347:10"/>
touching the complement and offices which they were to do; to the end to acquit themselves thereof with zeal and affection; and certified them, by an express, that they had sent commissions to Arnham, Heusden, Bergen op Zoom, and Gercum, for the Troops of Horse of Prince William of Nassau, of the Count Christian of Dona, and of M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> de Buat, de Wassenaer, and de la Lecque, son to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Beverweert, with order to march with all speed, night and day, towards high Swaluwe, to attend there the King of great Britain, and to execute the commands which should be given them by the Deputies of the Estates of Holland. The last arrived this day at Breda, and the Deputies of the Estates <note place="margin">The Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Estates General have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the King.</note> General had their audience. The King sent unto them about eleven a clock in the forenoon, the Lord Gerard, one of the Gentlemen of his bed-chamber, whose quality and functions are answerable to those of the chief Gentlemen of the Chamber of the King of France, who was to take them at their lodgings with four Coaches, each drawn by six white horses, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them to the Castle where the King was lodg'd. The Marquess of Ormond came to receive them, at the top of the stairs, and caused them to enter into the King's chamber, where they found his Majesty standing in the mid'st of the chamber, and covered; but as soon as he saw them, he uncovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and came two or there paces to meet them. After they had made most low reverences, and were come unto the King, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Ripperda, Lord of Buirse, one of the Deputies, would begin to speak; but his Majesty would oblige them to put on their hats, in making semblance that he would be covered. They had not the character of Ambassadour, and could not have it at home with them; therefore would they not be in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but remained in their duty, and obliged thereby his Majesty, who could not overcome their modesty, though innocently, and against their intention, to remain also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, whil'st the first Deputy spake. The substance of his discourse was, that the States General of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces had understood, with an extream joy, the chang of the affairs of England; That they knew the good God had so well
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55347:10"/>
touched the heart of the inhabitants, that there was not any Person, almost, that cried not on the name of the King, and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed passionately to see him returned into his Kingdom; that upon certain advertiements, which the Estates General had had thereof, they thought it fit to send their Deputies to this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, to witness unto him the part they take, to congratulate him in so important an occasion, and to wish him, and all his Royal Family all the blessings of Heaven, and all the prosperity that he might hope from God, after so long and such bitter afflictions; that the Estates General made those prayers with so much the more ardour, as they knew that the repose of this Common-wealth, depended in some kind on that of its neighbours; and that they would not willingly enjoy the amity of the English, but under the Monarchal Government of his Royal House; that they pretended to enjoy it still for the future under the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py government of his Majesty, and for this purpose, they hoped he would have the goodness to renue with the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the alliance which they alwaies considered here as one of the chief points of Estate, and as the foundation of the conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the common interests of the two Nations; That they had order also from their Superiours, to remonstrate to his Majesty that the residence of Breda, was inconvenient and distant, and to beseech him most humbly to chuse one in their Provinces, that he should judge more proper for his affairs, for his residence, and for his embarkment. That the Estates General had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to follow his Majesty in his voiage, and to serve him with whatsoever the United Provinces possessed. The King thanked the Lords the Estates for their civility, and for the testimonies of affection which they caused to be made him by the mouth of their Deputies; and assured them of his amity, in such strong and obliging terms, that knowing one shall be very glad to remember often the goodness of the King, we fear not to relate here the same words which he used, to conclude his discourse. <q>I love this Common-wealth, said he, not only because the Princess Royal, my Sister, and the Prince of Oreng, two persons who are extreamly dear unto me, remain here; but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55347:11"/>
also through interest of Estate, for the good of my Kingdoms, and through a very strong inclination towards their good. I love truly, SIRS, these Provinces, and so strongly, that I should be jealous if they gave greater part in their amity to another Prince then to me, who think that I ought to have much more therein then any other Prince, since I love them more then all the other Soveraigns together.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After dinner the Deputies did reverence to the Dukes of York and Glocester, the King's brothers, and to the Princess Royal, <note place="margin">Have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of their Royal Highnesses.</note> his sister, where M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Ripperda made again the complement. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> German, Gentleman of the Horse to the Duke of York, came to take them at their lodging, and conducted them to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his Royal Highness. At coming from whence, he conducted them to the audience of the Duke of Glocester, and coming forth of his appartment, they met with Sir Alexander Humes, Steward to the Princess, who conducted them to his Mistress chamber, which was not above fifteen or twenty paces from thence. The two Princes made them a full civility, in conducting them even to the dore almost of their apartments. Thursday, the 20. of May about eleven a clock in the fore-noon, <note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of Holland have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the King.</note> the Deputies of the Estates of Holland had their audience of the King, unto which they were brought in by the same persons, and with the same ceremonies, wherewith that of the Estates Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was accompanied. The Marquess of Ormond, who had the conduct of it, giving them the hand, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Beverweert, Chief of the Deputation, carried the Word, and spake in these terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>SIR, It is now the third time, that, My Lords, the Estates of Holland have congratulated with your Majesty upon your coming to the Crown. The first was, when you attained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by vertue of the fundamental law of your Estate, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the decease of the late King your father, of most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and eternal memory; and the other, when the Scots came; to this place, to invite your Majesty to go to take possession of one of the Crowns of your Ancestours. It is but with great grief, SIR, that we remember those two disastrous encounters; but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55347:11"/>
on the contrary, it is with a transport of joy, that we come now from the Estates of Holland, our Superiours, to congratulate your Majesty upon the present happy estate of your affairs. We may say, that they see already your Majesty seated in the Throne, and so that they take the part which they ow to the satisfaction which you are to have thence, and this with so much the more reason, as they know that the reciprocal amity between England and this Republick, hath never suffered the least alteration un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of her Kings. So promise they themselves, that it shall be better conserved then ever it was, under that of your Majesty, with whose alliance they shall feel themselves alwaies extreamly honoured, as well as with the Royal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will which your Majesty expresseth unto them. They also most humbly beseech your Majesty to give them a proof thereof, at present, in transferring your Court into their Province, for the litle time which your Majesty will have to stay in these quarters and to suffer, that they cause to be rendered, and render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in person unto you, during that time, all the services which they ow to so great and potent a Monarch, whose amity is so precious and necessary to them.</q>

                  <p>The King made them very neer the same answer, which he did the day before to the Deputies of the Estates General; in saying, that he was very much obliged to the Lords the Estates of Holland for the affection they expressed to him; that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused not the offer they made him of the commodity of another residence, in a Province for which he had alwaies had a most particular inclination; as well because of the dear pledge of the Princess Royal, his sister, and of the Prince of Oreng, his nephew, which they kept; as trhough a secret motion, and an interest of Estate indispensable. This the King said, with so much goodness and tenderness, that the Deputies, finding themselves insensily engaged in a discourse more particular, and his Majesty, making known that he heard speech of the affairs of the North with pleasure, opened himself fully therein; and feared not to say, that he was obliged to assist the King of Denmark, not only because of the neer affinity, and affection which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55347:12"/>
King, as well as the deceased King his father, had expressed for his interests; but also, because he judged that it extreamly imported England, and all Europe, to stop the progress of the Swed's Arms in those quarters. The Deputies were, after dinner, with their Royal Highnesses, where they were brought in by the same persons, and received in the same manner that the Deputies of the Estates General had been treated and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the day before. About five a clock in the evening, the Estates General had a particular audience of the King, in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution <note place="margin">Particular audience of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the States General.</note> of the express order which they had to make known to his Majesty the inclination of the Estate for a most streight and perpetual alliance with his Majesty; to which the King answered with much freeness and affection, saying in most strong, and most obliging terms, That not one of the Kings, his predecessors, had ever had for this Common-wealth, the affection which it should find alwaies in him; not only because of the interests of the two persons so neer as the Princess Royal and the Prince of Oreng; who live in the Estate, and make, as one may say, a part thereof, as he said unto them the day before; but also through inclination, and many reasons of Estate, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to make with these Provinces a most streight alliance.</p>
                  <p>The same day the Estates General having understood, by Letters from their Deputies, that the King's design was to come into Holland by water, gave order that all the Pinnaces, and other Barks, capable to transport the King, the Princes and Princess of the Royal House, with all their Court, Train, and Baggage, should immediately repair to the higher Swaluwe in Brabant, to attend there the orders which the Deputies of the Estates of Holland should give them for that purpose. They caused also to be written to all the Colonels, and other Major Officers, as well of Foot, as of Horse, who were quartered in the neighbour-hood of that Town, that they should be the first day at the Hague, to serve the Estate there, and to appear splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly at the Ceremonies of the reception, and treatment which they had resolved to make to his Majesty. As for the Deputies of Holland, not only M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Beverweert, who knew the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55347:12"/>
of the King, by the Marquess of Ormond, had one the 18 sent an express to the Hage, to advertise the Deputy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours therewith, in the absence of the Estates of Holland, who brake up from the evening of Pentecost, but they dispatched also themselves a Post, immediately after they arrived at Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, praying urgently, that without delay necessary orders might be given, for the reception and entertainment of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty at the entrance into this Province, and during his voiage to the Hage; and to that purpose the Deputy Councellours, who do in the Province of Holland, what the Councel of Estate doth in regard of the United Provinces, imployed the three daies following, after having required M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Wimmenum, President in their Colledge, to take upon him the whole conduct of this affair, as also the order of all the expence which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to make for the King's table, and for the Lords which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him as his attendance, whereof they left unto him the full disposing, during the voiage and first day that his Majesty arrived at this Town. The Deputies had also written to the Magistrate of the Town of the Briel, to advertise him of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution which the King had taken to pass into Holland; to the end that if there arrived there Posts from the Commissioners of Parliament, he should send them to the Hage, where the King made account to arrive in a very short time.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the same day, the Deputies, as well of the Estates General, as those of the Estates of Holland, knew that the King had resolved to depart from Breda on Munday, the 24 of May; and to this purpose, to embark himself the same day at Moordike; to the end to be at the Hage the next day, by water, about four a clock in the evening. Upon the advertisement which they gave thereof, the same day, to their Superiours, the Estates Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral resolved, Friday the 21, that M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> the Count de Flodorp, de Wimmenum, d'Amerongen, and de Ripperda de Hengelo, should give order, conjunctively with two Councellours of Estate of the United Provinces, that his Majesty, and the Princes his brothers, should be sumptuously treated and defrayed, with all their Train, during the whole time that his Majesty should remain
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55347:13"/>
in the Country of their obedience, from Wednesday the 26 of May, to the day of his embark'ment.</p>
                  <p>The same advertisement, which had been carried, at one time, into divers Towns of the Province, made to return, to the Hage, the most part of the Deputies, which compose the Estates of Holland; and which (as we have said) brake up the eve of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost; so that the most part being returned on Friday in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they began their Assembly the next morning, being the 22 of May; and fixed on this, that Tuesday following, the 25 of the said moneth, they should send towards Delf, at a place convenient to make the complement, all Coaches of four and six horses that could be gotten, for the Convoy with which they intended to receive his Majesty; and should cause also as many pinnaces and other Barks to beready as was necessary to transport the train and baggage. They ordained also, that besides the Deputies which they had sent to Breda, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Buckhurst, Lord of Wimmenum, Deputy Ordinary from the Noblity to the Colledge of the Deputy Councellours or Councel of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of Holland, should join himself to the other Deputies at Delf; and forasmuch as he was charged with the conduct of the whole treatment which the Province intended to make to his Majesty, aswell on the way, as in this town, as Deputy from the Estates, that in this quality he should stay by the King, whil'st he dined, to receive the honour of his commandments, after the other Deputies should be retired.</p>
                  <p>The Estates General, of their side, required M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> d'Ameron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, <note place="margin">Mr. d'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merongen goes to Breda.</note> of the House of Rhede, one of the chief Nobles of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Utrecht, Deputy, in their assembly, from the Nobility of the same Province, lately extraordinary Embassadour in Denmark, and now nominated for Spain, to go to Breda; and to report from thence an exact estate of the Kings whole Court, and train of the Princes; as also of the number of the Lords, of the Councel, and of his Majesties House; to the end, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary proportions might be taken for the lodgings pointed out for the Lords; for the Tables which were to be furnished; and for the mouths to be fed, during the residence which the King
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55347:13"/>
should make at the Hage. And to the end, not to come short, they made, the same day, a foundation of three hundred thousand gilders for the expence that should be made for it.</p>
                  <p>They had the same day Letters from Breda, which signified, that the day before S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Peter Killegrew, brother to him who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands an English Regiment of Foot, in the service of the Lords the Estates, and who so gloriously fought in the Battel of Funen, that it is his merit, rather then the alliance which he hath with General Monck, that makes him to be considered, was arrived there from London; from whence he had been dispatched ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, to carry to the King the news of his proclamation; which was done the 19 of the same moneth, with great ceremonies, and extraordinary testimonies of joy and affection, not only in the City of London, but also in divers other neighbour Towns. But forasmuch as these particularities are of the History of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, which will not fail to publish all the wonders of this great revolution, we will not make our relation of it, which in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of all that passed in the Country, is obliged to make known here the affection of the Magistrates of Dort, of Delf, and of Rotterdam, who sent to beseech the King, by Deputies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, to do them the honour to pass through their Towns, and to refresh himself there by the way. But his Majesty excused himself, as well upon the present estate of his affairs, which permitted him not to stay any where; as because that his passage could not but incommodate the inhabitants, unto whom he should not cease to find himself sensibly obliged, for the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they expressed to him.</p>
                  <p>Sunday the 23, there was nothing remarkable, if not, that at Breda solemn thanks were rendred to God, in all the Churches, on the revolution of the affairs of England, in behalf of the King: all the Ministers of the Churches, English, Dutch and French, expounding Texts proper for the matter. After the Sermons, the Magistrate and Consistory were incorporated to make their complement to his Majesty, and to their Royal Highnesses; and at evening, bonfires of joy were made through the whole Town; all the Bels rung, and many volleys were discharg'd from all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55347:14"/>
the Artillery; the Deputies of the Estates General, those of the Estates of Holland, the Magistrate, and the particular persons, emulating one another which should express most joy and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this great day. They began, in the mean time, to load, and to send away the baggage, whil'st they finished, at the Hague, to furnish Prince Maurice his House, designed for the King's lodging; to appoint lodging for the whole Court, and to make necessary provisions, for its subsistance when it should be come, and whil'st it should remain there.</p>
                  <p>Munday the 24, there hapned, at the Hague, a thing very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and which might be of great importance, in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, if they had taken councel of ambition, rather then of prudence. By the fix'd resolution of the Estates General, of the 16 of this moneth, it was said, that the Estates of Holland might cause the King to be received, and complemented, at the entrance of the Province; and that they might make the honour of the House, as being the Masters of it. But the former had made <note place="margin">Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Estates Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and those of Holland for prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</note> known since, that their intention was to cause the King to be received, either by a greater number of Deputies, then there had been from them at Breda, or if the Estates of Holland went, in a body, to receive his Majesty by Delf towards Rotterdam; in this case, the States General would go, also in a body, to complement his Majesty between Delf and the Hage, at the place where they are accustomed to receive Embassadours; and that in conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him their Coaches should follow immediately the King's. The Estates of Holland being advertised hereof, likewise that the Estates General would send Deputies to their Assembly; and pretending that formerly there passed too many things to the prejudice of the right of their Soveraignity, they named the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Towns of Dort, Harlem, Amsterdam, Alckmar, and Horn, to enter into conference with the Deputies of the Estates General; to the end, to dispose fitly this affair. And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they negotiated so happily, that they were agreed, at last, among themselves, that if the Estates of Holland caused the King to be received at Delf, by Deputies, they should remain both in the terms of the resolution of the 16 of this moneth; by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55347:14"/>
vertue of which, the Lords, the Estates of Holland, might alone do the honours in their Province, and cause the King to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented wheresoever he pleased; and that the Deputies of the Estates General, which were by his Majesties person; should continue to be treated with respect, as representing strange So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns; and that in this quality, their Coach, or Coaches, if they judged fit to encrease the number of their Deputies, (which notwithstanding they promised, by mouth, that they would not do) should follow immediately the King's, and precede those of the Deputies of the Province. After this the Estates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ordained, that M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Wassenaer, Lievtenant Admiral of Holland, should be joined to the Deputies named in the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the 13 of May, and to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Wimmenum, who had been named the 22; and that every Town should depute one, of its body, to go to make the complement, together with the Pentionary Councellour, at the disbarkment of his Majesty by Delf.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as there was reason to fear, that there might <note place="margin">The Estates send to pray the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours not to send their Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to meet the King.</note> happen some disorder about the rank of the Coaches that should be sent to meet the King; not so much because the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours were not well agreed among themselves about precedence; but chiefly, because there were some of them, that would make their Coach, to go before that of the Prince of Oreng; who ought to be considered here, not only because of his quality of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince, but also as Nephew to the King; and consequently, as chief Prince of the blood of England, after the two Dukes; as well the Estates General, as those of Holland, judged fit to cause the Embassadours, of the Crowned-heads, to be prayed, by their Agent, not to send their Coaches, but to leave the conduct and whole honour of this ceremony to the Estate; to the end, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the confusion, which otherwise would be unavoidable. They all acquiesced therein, without repugnance, and would fain have that respect for the King, and condescendence enough for the desire of the Lords the Estates, not to trouble the publick joy, which the whole world indeavoured to make resplendent on this occasion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:55347:15"/>
The whole Court, in the mean time, departed from Breda the same day, being the 24 of May. The Deputies of the Estates of Holland departed thence, at four a clock in the morning, to the end to have the leasure to chuse a fit place to put the five troops of Horse, which were commanded into Battel, and to give necessary orders for his Majesties embarkment. The Deputies of the Estates General departed about two hours after, and the King took coach with the Dukes of York and Glocester, and the Princess Royal, about 8 or 9 a clock in the morning. But before they went out of the Hall of the Castle, the Burgemasters, and Councel of Ten, presented themselves again to the King, and caused to be made unto him, by the same M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Snel, who made him a speech when he arrived at Breda, this following discourse; for which the publick is oblig'd to a Gentleman of the King's House, who had a care to write word by word, and to communicate to the authour of the relation, all the orations, where he was present, when they were spoken.</p>
                  <q>SIR, The Magistrate and Councel of Ten of this town of <note place="margin">The speech of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemaster of Breda.</note> Breda, present themselves, again, with a most low reverence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Majesty, to render you most humble thanks for the honour it hath pleased you to do the town, by the residence you have made here; and to bring you a last proof of the perfect joy, which the wonderfull success of your Majesty, as it is the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hand, and infinite providence of God, which hath drawn your Majesty out of a Gulf of dangers, and conducted you through a desert of afflictions, even unto the entrance of the greatness, which the right of your Predecessours hath gained to all their posterity. This is the subject of our joy, Sir, but that after the success of many battels, Victories gained at the price of the blood of Subjects, may content the ambition of a Prince transported; but a good Prince, whose thoughts are generous and magnanimous, prefers an innocent triumph, before all other advantages of the world. We praise with all our hearts, that great God, who hath began this work in the person of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; and pray him ardently, that it will please him to hear the devotions which we shall continue to make incessantly, for the prosperity of the voiage and reign of your Majesty.</q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:55347:15"/>
The King answered, that he thanked the Magistrate and Councel for the affection they expressed to him, and should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to acknowledge it, on all occasions that should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto him. Whereupon the Burgemaster having taken the liberty to reply, that since his Majesty had the goodness to accept the affection and zeal which they had for his service, he besought him most humbly to remember the grace which he had made them to hope for, when he concluded in that place his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Deputies of Scotland, some years since; that he would honour the town of Breda, and its inhabitants, with all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which the Laws of his Kingdom would permit him to grant them. The King answered, that he remembred it very well; and that he was obliged to do it for a town, where he had received such agreeable news, and which had rendred him so many testimonies of respect and affection.</p>
                  <p>The King took coach, after this audience, and came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eleven and twelve a clock at Moervaert. He found there some squadrons of Horse in batalia, and the Deputies of the Estates of Holland, who presented themselves at the boot of his Coach, and made him their complement, in the name of their Superiours, at the entrance of their Province. His Majesty staied but to hear the quaint and obliging words of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Beverweert, who spake for all the other Deputies, and to answer to that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility: After this, he persued his way to the end of the Causey, <note place="margin">The King embarks himself.</note> or Dike, where they had made a bridge, from the Dike to the Pinnace, to facilitate his embarkment.</p>
                  <p>The Estates General, to give no jealousie to some persons of quality, who have coaches with six horses, make use ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, for the entrance of Embassadours, and for other publick Ceremonies, but of the Coach of the Princess Dowager of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range, which represents that of the Estates in those occasions. Hence was it they desired that the pinnace or barge of the same Princess, which she had lent for the same purpose, should have the same honour on this occasion, and had enjoined their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to indeavour to make it acceptable to his Majesty: But the King, after he had considered them all, chose another, as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55347:16"/>
well because he knew it was very commodious, as having used it formerly; as because, indeed, that of the Princess Dowager was not great enough, to lodge the King, and the Princess Royal, who would pass the night, by the King her brother, with persons necessary for their service. That whereinto the King entred, was made formerly for the Prince of Orenge, but it is now in the Colledge of the Admirality of Rotterdam; and was, without doubt, the greatest of all that little Fleet, which was composed, besides other Barks, almost innumerable, of thirty great Barges, commonly called <hi>Yachts,</hi> and are a kind of little Frigats, whereof persons of condition make use upon the Rivers, in passing from one Province unto another, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, or for divertisement. And indeed, the King found his Yacht so fit, and so well fashioned, that he said, in discourse with the Deputies, that he would cause one to be made of the same manner, as soon as he should be arrived in England, to serve him upon the Thames above the bridge. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Vlooswick, Burgemaster of Amsterdam, and one of the Deputies of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Holland, taking occasion from thence to render a very considerable service to this country, said to the King, that lately they had made one in their town of the same bigness, at least as commodious every way, which he took the liberty to offer <note place="margin">The town of Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> makes a present of a fair Yacht to the King of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> to his Majesty, beseeching him to grace the Magistrate of the town of Amsterdam to accept it. The King accepted it not absolutely, but declined not so strongly, that upon the advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Vlooswick gave to the Magistrate of what passed on this occasion, he caused not that Yacht to be bought, which the Colledge of the Admiralty had gotten of the East-India Company, and put it in condition to serve for the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement of this great Prince: And to give it the more lustre, the Magistrate caused the outside to be richly gilt, whil'st some of the best Painters of the country, wrought upon the fair Pictures, wherewith they have since adorned the inside.</p>
                  <p>No person would undertake the commission to distribute the Yachts among the Lords of the Court, because it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to oblige them all equally, and to disoblige none: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55347:16"/>
M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Beverweert besought the King to be so gracious, as to cause the distribution to be made, since the Deputies had no other order but fully to obey the commandments of his Majesty, which were absolutely necessary for them on this occasion. The King would fain take the pains thereof himself, and ordained that the Duke of York, should ont his occasion perform the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Admiral, in distributing the Yachts, under his authority, and in his presence; so that his Royal Highness gave himself the Yacht of the Princess Dowager of Oreng: The Duke of Glocester had that of the Estates of Holland: The Princess Royal, one of the Yachts of the Councel of Estate. The Deputies of the Estates General had the other: The Deputies of the Estates of Holland went into the Yacht of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Beverweert, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived also Don Estévan de Gamarra; (who went to meet the King at Moordijck, not in quality of Embassadour of Spain, but as particular servant of his Majesty) the Rhinegrave, the Lord Craft, and many other English Lords. The Chancellour of England, with his family, and S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Edward Nicholas, principal Secretary of Estate, and of the King's commands, and one of his most affectionate Ministers, embarked themselves in a Pinnace, called the Maid of Zealand: The Marquess of Ormond, Lord Deputy of Ireland, of the House of Butler, one of the chief, and most ancient of that Kingdom, had the Pinnace of Captain Brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: The Marquess of Worcester, Edward Sommerset, embarked himself, with his Family, in the Pinnace, named the Postillion of Zealand: The Lord S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> John, and Bellasis had that of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senaer. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Clarges, brother-in-law to General Monck, and his company, composed of the Deputies of the Army, had the Yacht of the town of Dort. The Lord Gerard, and many other English Lords, entred into that of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Noortwick, Governour of Sluce, and the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Yacht, which was that of the Prince of Oreng, was reserved for the Chamber and Wardrobe of the Princess Royal. Every Yacht had its Steward, and all other Officers necessary for the Kitchin, and buttery; and they which had not the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to have their Kitchin aboard themselves, were accompanied with other Barks, where chimneys were made for the Kitchin,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55347:17"/>
and ovens for the pastery, and provision of so prodigious a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of all sorts of meats, of foul, of sweet meats, of wine, that all the tables were perfectly served therewith; and in so great aboundance, that the English Stewards, though very much accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to aboundance, were astonished thereat; and confessed that they could not comprehend, how they could make ready in Boats and agitation, twenty or five and twenty great dishes for every Table.</p>
                  <p>The intention of the King was to dine at Noon, in entring into the Yacht; and indeed, the Steward, who was appointed there by the Estates of Holland, had caused the meat to be made ready; but the wind was so strong, and the water so tossed, that the Princess Royal, not able to endure the violent motion of the vessel, lost her appetite, and finding her self incommodated with the sea-sickness, was enforced to lie upon the bed. Hence was it that the King caused the Captain to be asked, if there was means to shelter them, somewhat, under some rising land, or trees, to ease the Princess a little; but the Captain having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that there was no rest to be hoped for, but at Dort, where they might arrive in an hour and a half, or there about, they went on upon this hope. Notwithstanding, they came not in sight of Dort, till between three and four of the clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon. The Rampart, and Key, were bordered with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, which were put into arms, and with a battery of great Cannon, which made many volleys, as well as the Muskets, (whil'st the Fleet passed there, during, and after the repast, which was taken in sight of the town) and as long as they could discover the flag of the ship, which carried the person of the King, with all the Royal family, they thundered.</p>
                  <p>The Fleet stopped, a quarter of a league, below the town, with design to cast anckor that evening, and to stay, the whole night following, at the mouth of the river of Leck, which gives its name to one of the fairest territories of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Beverweert, and which is very well known through the great number of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which are taken there every year. But there happened two things, which obliged the King to change resolution.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55347:17"/>
The first was, the return of Sir John Greenvil, who arrived from England, whil'st the King dined; and reported, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was resolved to beseech his Majesty, to come to take possession of the Crown, without any condition or reserve; and that Admiral Montague was at sea, with a good number of ships, to come to receive him in Holland, to transport him unto his Kingdom. The other was, the advertisement which his Majesty received, almost at the same time, by an express, that that Fleet appeared, in the morning, in sight of Scheveling, and at nine a clock, had cast anckor in the Rode, about half a league from the shore. The King presently imparted it to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Beverweert, as to the chief of the Deputation of Holland, and caused the Duke of York to tell him, who was in person in the Deputies Yacht, which joined side by side with his; that it was true, he had made accompt not to arrive at Delf till the next day, about noon; to the end, to be able to make his entrance into the Hague, at the hour which he had appointed for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; but that he had received intelligence, which obliged him to change his design, and to anticipate the hour that was resolved on; because it was of the highest importance for him, to speak, as soon as might be, with the Officers of the Fleet; and so, that he should be constrained to go the whole night; to the end, to arrive at Delf at the break of day; whereof he prayed him to give advertisement to the Lords the Estates, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by an express; to the end that the Coaches, designed for his reception, might be there at seven a clock precisely. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Beverweert remonstrated, to his Royal Highness, the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that would accur in the change of the orders which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given; in telling him, that the Poste, which he was to dispatch, could arrive at the Hague but very late; and, perhaps, at an unseasonable hour, when it would be almost impossible to make the Estates to assemble, and without that, they could not change the time, which it pleased his Majesty himself to appoint. Notwithstanding if the King desired it absolutely, the Deputies would not fail to write immediately; and to advertise their Superiours therewith, since they were there, but to obey
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55347:18"/>
his Majesty, and to serve him. The Duke of York replied, that it was through an invincible necessity, and with an extream re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, that the King did thus; but that he hoped the Lords the Deputies would consider the estate of his affairs, and oblige very much his Majesty, in losing no time to dispath their Poste; and in contributing, by that means, to the advancement of his voyage, and embarkment, in this pressing conjuncture.</p>
                  <p>The Letters went away about five a clock in the after-noon, the King caused anckor to be weighed, and passed, at evening, <note place="margin">The King passeth in sight of Rotterda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> before the town of Rotterdam; where the contrary wind enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Fleet to board, or tack about, and by this means to draw neer the haven, two or three times gave the town leasure to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute his Majesty, by the musket shot of the Burgers, who were all in arms, with flying colours, on the rampart and port, and with all the artillery of the town, as well as with all the Cannon of the Ships which were there in the rode. He passed next to Delfs-haven, where they had made a battery of sixteen peeces of Cannon, and staied not till he came to Owerschie, a village scituate between Delfs-haven and Delf, where he would attend the day.</p>
                  <p>The Estates of Holland had resolved to cause his Majesty to be received, at the powder Magazin, upon the channel, which serves for line of communication for the two towns, Delf and Rotterdam; for the town of Delf, having been partly ruined by an accident of fire, which met with the powder some years since, they thought it fit to lodge it without the walls, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cannon shot of the town. But the King having caused the Fleet to set sail, as soon as the Sun began to appear on the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, they were at the suburbs of Delf, by five a clock in the morning, before the Deputies could give order to make the Fleet to stay at the place designed for the reception. All the Citizens of the town were in arms, from three a clock in the morning, and <note place="margin">The King arrives at Delf.</note> a part had their poste upon the Key before the port, where the King was to dis-imbarck, and the Magistrate came there, in body, to do reverence to the King in the Yacht; as soon as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood he was arrived, and to beseech him to do them the honour
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55347:18"/>
to repose and refresh in their town, whil'st his Majesty should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Deputies of the Estates of Holland; but the King excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himself on the Estate of his affairs, which was so far from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to stay by the way, that it had obliged him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the hour, which he had taken and appointed for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Letters of the Deputies were brought to the Hage, at midnight; and immediately after the Estates assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and caused the orders to be changed, which were given for the King's reception, at four a clock in the afternoon, into others more pressing; and they sent word to the Deputies, by the same Poste, that they might assure his Majesty, that they would not fail to receive him, at the hour he had appointed them, or at eight a clock in the morning at furthest. And, indeed, about two a clock after midnight, they caused the drums to beat, to summon to arms the six Companies of Burgers, and the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Guards of the States of Holland, of which there is but four garrisoned in the Hage, and the other six in the neighbour towns, from whence they were made to come, and at six a clock they were all at their Rendezvous: The first on the Viver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, and the others in the outward Court of the Palace, where the Coaches assembled almost at the same time. Those who took the most pain in causing these orders to be executed, and who have, without doubt, the most part in the honour, which is due unto those who had the conduct of this affair; (as they have that of the most important of the Province) are M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> of Wimmenum and the Pensionary Counsellour, who were seen to act every where, each in his functions, with so much assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity, care and judgment, that if the King drew any satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the honour they rendred him here, this Estate is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to the pains of these two great Personages.</p>
                  <p>The Coaches began to file towards Delf about seven a clock in the morning; and immediately after the Burgers, who stood in Battalia in the great Place, marched towards the way which goes to Delf; and the souldiers went to take their Poste on the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberg, where they made a guard even to the house of Prince
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55347:19"/>
Maurice of Nassau, which was prepared to lodge his Majesty. The Estates Deputies being arrived at Delf, and having spoken with those who had complemented the King at Breda, and had had the conduct of his person in the voyage, informed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of the order they had given for his entrance, for his lodging, and for his treatment; to the end, that as their intention was to submit wholly to the absolute will of his Majesty, they made that to be changed therein, which might displease him. And after that the King had given them his approbation, and that they had invited the Deputies of the Estates General to honour this ceremony with their presence, and to take place immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the King's Coach; they gave order that the Coaches should be drawn into a file along the Key of the Suburb.</p>
                  <p>This done, the Deputies of Holland entred all into the King's <note place="margin">The King is comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented at Delf by the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member.</note> Yacht, and said unto him, in very few words, by the mouth of the Pensionary Councellour, that they were there from the Estates of Holland, who had sent there a Deputy of each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Province, to offer their most humble services to his Majesty; to expresse unto him their respectfull passion for his person; and to conduct him to the place designed for his lodging at the Hage. The King thanked the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with words full of goodness and civility, for the pain which they had taken, and for the proofs of affection and zeal which the Lords the Estates of Holland, caused to be given him. They staied in the Barge or Yacht, but to discourse a moment with the company, which was composed, besides the King's person, of the Dukes of York and Glocester, of the Princess Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, of the Prince of Orange, who was come there from the Hage early in the morning, of the Deputies of the Estates General, and of some English Lords; and immediately after the King went forth thence, to go into the coach of the Princess his sister, which had that day the honour to carry all the Royal Family. The King put himself in the mid'st with the Princess, the Duke of York and the Duke of Glocester sate before, and the Prince of Orange in one of the boots; and as soon as they were placed, the whole company began to advance to enter into the town of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55347:19"/>
Delf. The King but passed there; the Citizens, who were in arms with displaied colours, from break of day, marched on both sides of the Coach, more then a musket shot from the gate which leads to the Hage, where they staied and saluted his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty with their volleys, whil'st all the bels rung, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery thundred from the bulwarks and rampires of the town.</p>
                  <p>It was neer ten a clock when he departed thence, and past <note place="margin">The King arrives at the Hage.</note> eleven when he came at the Hage; where the six Companies of Citizens, which could hardly be distinguished from the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, because that being born in war, and bred in exercises of arms, they could not be known from the Military men, but by their cloaths, their plumes, and their scarfs, wherewith they were covered, had in the mean time taken their post, and made a guard on the way towards Delf, even to the bridge, which serves for a gate to this illustrious Village, which hath, without doubt, an advantage over all the fairest towns of Europe, and may be put in parallel likewise with some of the greatest. In the head of the whole train, marched some trumpets of the Estate, clad in their coats of crimson velvet, embroidered with gold and silver. After them came a long file of Officers, belonging to the war, of Young Lords and Gentlemen, very gallant, and brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mounted. Next to that, marched a great number of English Gentlemen and Officers of the King's house, of the two Dukes, of the Princess Royal, and of the Prince of Orange. After them came M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Wimmenum, who performed here the function of Master of the Ceremonies, in his coach, where were also some Lords, preceding immediately that of the Princess Royal, which carried his Majesty, and all the Royal House, as we have said. The Deputies of the Estates General filled the two first after the King's: Those of the States of Holland, the six following; and the other Coaches, which amounted in all to the number of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty and odd, each having six and four horses, were filled with English and Dutch Lords.</p>
                  <p>It must be confessed, that this entrance was not made with an extraordinary pomp and glory, worthy so great a Monarch, but it was impossible to make greater preparations, in the time the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55347:20"/>
King had appointed for it; and even when they were constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to change, in a manner, the first orders; which, without doubt, would have rendred it much more resplendent, had it not been for this change. And yet the crowd was so great, because the curiosity to see this miraculous Prince, had drawn a great part of the inhabitants of the neigbour towns to this entrance, that they were constrained to go very softly; so that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Citizens, who had the van-guard at the entrance into the Hage, had the leisure to cut some little streets, and to come to put themselves behind, and so to make a guard, from the Highstreet, and along the great Place, even to the Viverberg, where the Regiment of the Guards had taken its Post, and made a guard on both sides, even to the House of Prince Maurice of Nassau, which the Estates of Holland had caused to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, and accommodated for the King's lodging. As soon as the first coaches were entred into the Court, and the King aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Deputies of the Estates General retired, and left the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the reception and entertainment, for that day, to the Estates of Holland.</p>
                  <p>The King being gone up, found on the top of the stairs the Queen of Bohemia his Aunt, led by the Duke of Brunswick Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburg, <note place="margin">The Queen of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him.</note> who had the honour to salute, and to entertain the King at Breda, and the Princess Dowager of Orange, led by Prince William Frederick of Nassau, her son-in-law, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the two Princesses her daughters, Madam the Princess of Nassau, and the young Lady of Orange. The King saluted them all, and being entred into the chamber, where he was followed by the Deputies of the Estates of Holland, he received there another small complement from them, by the mouth of the Pensionary Councellour, who said no other thing, but that the Estates of Holland would give themselves the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to come in full body to render their duty to his Majesty, when they might do it without incommodating him. The King answered him, that they should alwaies be welcome; and that after he had dined, they might take their audience. But the Pensioner replied, that his Majesty being, without doubt,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55347:20"/>
weary with his journy, they would not trouble his repose that day, but would send to receive his orders the next. The King, who was weary indeed, expressed a willingness to dine in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, so that there staied no body by him, but M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Wimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, who was charged with the order of making his Majesty to be served at dinner, and in whatsoever it should please him to command. The Princess Royal, who had not slept the night before, was the first that withdrew; and obliged the others, by her example, to do the like. The Queen of Bohemia, and the Princess Dowager of Orange, followed her, and the King, who would lead them, and who took the Queen by the hand, had the goodness, after he had put her into the coach, to turn about to the end to help the Princess Dowager to go up. There staied with the King, at dinner, none but the two Dukes, his brothers, who dined with him. His Majesty before he sate at Table, would do M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Wimmenum the honour to make him to take his nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, to present it him; but that Gentleman, who knew how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself civilly, excused himself through modesty, and yeelded that advantage to him of his Officers, who used to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that function about the person of his Majesty. The toil of the journy, and little rest he had taken, the two former nights, made him desire to withdraw. And, indeed, they would have made the musketteers to forbear shooting, (who gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual volleys) if it had been possible to smother the universal joy, which the whole world would express on this occasion. To these volleys, answered those of a battery of eight and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty peeces of Canon, which were planted on the Viverberg, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced with another of five and twenty peeces of a greater stamp, which they were enforced to plant behind the Cloister Church of the Voorhout upon the rampart, in turning the mouth towards the field, for fear the noise of that thunder might shake the walls of the old Palace, and of all the adjoining buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
                  <p>The Estates General had ordained, the precedent day, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Heyde, <note place="margin">The Estates General go to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the King in a body.</note> their Agent, to go to Prince Maurice his House, and to know immediately after the King's arrival, at least as soon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55347:21"/>
as civility would permit him, when it would please his Majesty to receive the duty, which they had resolved to render him, in coming to do him reverence in a body; and his Majesty having granted it them, at four a clock in the afternoon, it was resolved that they should all meet, in the ordinary chamber of their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, half an hour after 3 a clock, to go from thence, in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to the house of Nassau, They met accordingly, at the hour appointed, to the number of five and twenty, <hi>viz.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> van Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburgh, Burgemaster of Leiden, and Deputy to the Estates General from the Province of Holland, who, at his turn, was President that week; the Baron of Gent, M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> van Bemmel, Braeckel, Balveren, Vande Steen, Ripperda of Buirse, the Count of Flodorff, Schimmelpennick, Vander Oyen, Huy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens, and Ommeren, Deputies from the Dutchy of Gelders; Meerman, of Horn, and the Pensionary Councellour from the Province of Holland; de Veth, Crommon, Vrybergen, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psins and Kien for Zealand; Renswoude and Amerongen, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties from the Province of Utrecht; Velsen, for the Province of Freesland; Ripperda of Hengelo for Overyssel; and Schu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenbourg and Isbrants for the town of Groning, and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent country; with which it makes also a Province. As soon as they were assembled, they went forth, two and two, in the same order as we have named them, going directly to the King's lodging, which is separated from the Palace but by a Ditch, whose two sides are joined by a stone bridge. That Palace is named the Court, or the Court of Holland, because it served sometime for dwelling to the Counts; as it comprehends now in its inclosure the apartments, where the Estates General as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble; the Councel of Estate of the United Provinces; the Estates of Holland; the Councel of Estate of the same Province; the Reckoning-chambers of the Generality, and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Holland: The two Courts of Justice, and the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments assigned for the lodging of the Princess Royal, and of the Prince of Orange. Before the Estates marched Prince William Frederick of Nassau, Governour and Lievtenant General of Freesland, of Groning, and of Overyssel; the Rhine Grave,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55347:21"/>
Commissary General of the Horse of the United Provinces, and Governour of Mastricht; Mons de Hauterive Chasteau neuf, Collonel of a Regiment of French Foot, in the service of the Estates, and Governour of Breda, and many other Collonels, Lievtenant Collonels, and other Officers, as well of Foot as of Horse, all bareheaded. At the entrance into the King's lodging, they were met with by the Lord Crafts, one of the four Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the bed-chamber, accompanied with a great number of gentlemen. The Marquess of Ormond, Lord Deputy of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and in this quality, the first and most considerable person of all England, after the Dukes, came to receive them at the stairs, and brought them into the King's chamber, All the high Officers that marched before, being entred, the Lords the Estates could scarce make way through the press, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary great there; but at last, being come to the King, the Baron of Gent, as chief Deputy from the Province of Gelders, which is the chief Province of the Union, because of its quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Dutchy, and as a person most fit for an action of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well because of his handsom presence, as of his natural eloquence, made the speech, and spake, word by word, in these terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>SIR, The Estates General of the United Provinces of the <note place="margin">The Speech of the Lord of Gent.</note> Low-countries, after having expressed to your Majesty, by the Deputies they sent unto you at Breda, how they participated in the happy successes, which follow your wise conduct, and the joy which they have to see you going to your Kingdom of England, to take there the Scepter of great Britain, come here now, in a body, to uphold the truth and sincerity thereof, by stronger, and more solemn declarations. It is the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, SIR, which had the honour to present it self to your Majesty, in this very place, in a sad and mournfull equipage; and which, with more grief in heart, then it could express by words, pronounced the lamentable accents of a most bitter sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which came then to strike the soul, not only of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, but also universally of all the Members of this Estate. From the same principle, which divided then their affliction,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55347:22"/>
SIR, proceeds now their rejoicement; to wit, from that of a most tender, and most respectfull affection for the sacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of your Majesty; and from a most submissive zeal for your service, and for the good of your affairs. The cause thereof is so just, and so touching, SIR, that we hope your Majesty will be easily perswaded of the truth of the protestations, which the Estates General, of this Republick, make thereof, here in your Royal presence. And we may boldly say, that their joy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth it self in its full extent, which is so much the more vast, as these admirable events arrive, in a time, when all human appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence seemed to remove them wholly. So must it be confessed, that they are the marvellous effects of divine providence, which hath made the hearts of the children to return to their father; that is to say, of the subjects to their lawfull King; and levelled the waies, by which your Majesty walks, at present, so pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably, and without effusion of bloud upon the magnifick, and superb steps of your glorious and triumphant throne.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Estates General of these United Provinces, wish, SIR, that these great and important prosperities, which surprise us no less them we have wished them, may be followed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant obedience of your people, with the respect of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and with the love of both; and that the Diadem, which the great God hath put upon the anointed and sacred head of your Majesty, being accompanied with all the favours of heaven, may stand there a long train of years, with a happy and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reign, for your sacred person, and remain perpetually in your Royal posterity, even to the end of the world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We will finish this discourse, SIR, by most humble thanks, which we render to your Majesty, in that it hath pleased you to chuse this country, rather then any other, to pass from thence into your Kingdom; for which the Estates General will alwaies esteem themselves honoured and obliged; with the regret not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, to see, that the reception which they cause to be made unto you, with so good a heart, is not accompanied with all the pomp and magnificence, that the Majestical splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of so great and potent a Monarch deserveth, who is so
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55347:22"/>
dear and precious to this Estate; and of whose gracious favour they shall indeavour to acquit themselves, by all the respects and services, which your Majesty may desire from your true friends, most faithfull allies, and most humble servants.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'T is observable in this visit, that the King made not so much as a shew to be willing to be covered; not that his design was to hinder the Estates General, who were there in a body, to be covered, since he did do that honour to their Deputies, when they did him reverence at Breda; and seeing that he did it since at home in their assembly; but without doubt, to the end to do something more for them, then he could do for an Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. Which appeared evidently in the visit he made, in person, to the Estates General, and to the Estates of Holland, when he took leave of them; of which, the sequel of this relation will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to speak hereafter, where he would fain be covered, to give them the liberty to be covered also; and to uncover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self afterward, when he began to speak, and to remain in this condition, whil'st he was in their assembly, as we shall say else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                  <p>The Lords the Estates were conducted, in departing from the audience, by the same Lords that received them; and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in the same order, to their ordinary Hall, they separated themselves.</p>
                  <p>The two other Soveraign colledges, composed of Deputies of all the Provinces, to wit, the Councel of Estate, and the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning-chamber, <note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and the Recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber have audience.</note> were at the audience after the Estates Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Prince William Frederick of Nassau, made the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Councel of Estate, as President; and M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Cauwer ven-Reigersberg, Deputy to the Reckoning-chamber of the United Provinces, from the Province of Zealand, (those who are here from Holland being excused) spake for the Chamber; the one, and t'other, with so much applause of those who were present there, and with as much satisfaction of the King's side, being returned to the assembly, they were thanked for it by their Colleagues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:55347:23"/>
Some doubted if the Embassadours, and Ministers of the <note place="margin">Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the audi ence of the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</note> Kings, Princes, and strange Estates, which were at the Hague, should be received to make their complements to the King without Letters of Credence; or if after it were acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that their character legitimated them for that, they might be covered; since that having no character towards this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, they could not be considered, but as particular persons to him. The difficulties which arose here, were taken away by the following considerations. They said, that Embassadours having a general Commission, and not being, as they said, <hi>missi ad hoc,</hi> they might, and ought to do that which their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters would do, if they were there present in person; and so being certain, that there is no Prince in Europe that would not do civility to the King of England, if he should meet him in his passage, their Ministers, who were in the place, could not fail therein also, without being wanting to civility, and to their duty. Notwithstanding, since his Majesty was not in his Kingdom, he might use them as he pleased; yet so, that although it was in his choice to admit the Embassadours, or not, he could not dispense himself of treating them, according to the dignity of their character, and of making them to be covered, after having admitted them, since they might, and were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make their character appear in all their publick actions, in an Estate where every one acknowledgeth them for Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Thou, Count of Meslay, Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour <note place="margin">Audience of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour of France.</note> to the most Christian King, and President in his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paris, ordinary Embassadour of France, having about three a clock, or a little after, obtained the first audience; as well for that having demanded it first, as for that there was no other Embassadour, at the Hage, that would come into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency with him, he was met in the Court by one of the chief Gentlemen of the Chamber; and on the top of the stairs, by the Captain of the Life-guards; which did, on this occasion, the functions of introductours. As soon as the Embassadour had made his reverences, and would begin to speak, the King

covered himself forthwith, and shewed thereby to the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour what he had to do. His complement was very well recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but his audience was short.</p>
                  <p>M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> Otte Krag, Lord of Welberg; Bayly of Nieburg, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour <note place="margin">Audience of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours of Denmark.</note> of the Crown of Denmark, and Godsche of Bugwaldt, Lord of Gieresbeeck, Prevost of the Covent of Uttersen, and Councellour of Estate to his Majesty, Extraordinary Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours from the King of Denmark, had their audience after the French Embassadour, and after they were received and treated in the same manner as the other was, the first, who is of a most illustrious birth in the Kingdom, as his Colleague is also in the Country of Holstein, and a personage of a full experience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himself to speak in these terms: <q>That since it had pleased the Almighty God to call again his Majesty into his Kingdoms, where his great merit should have established him long ago as well as the right of his birth, they would not fail to come to congratulate him, and to acquit themselves by this means of the duty which they have as well to the neer affinity which is between his Majesty, and the King their Master, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the streight alliance, which is, and hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies between the two Kingdoms of England and Denmark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That they had cause to rejoice for this happy change; not only because of the glory and felicity which redounded thence to his Majesty, but also because of the advantage which the King and Kingdom of Denmark, would draw from thence, which had not been afflicted and unjustly oppressed so long, if that of England had been in condition to hinder it. That the King their Master would not fail to witness himself, by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Embassage, the joy which he received from so surprising and so extraordinary a revolution, as soon as he was advertised thereof, and that they hoped in this happy conjuncture, that his Majesty would continue to live with the King their Master in the amity, alliance, and firm confidence, in which their Majesties have alwaies lived, and which for some years was not interrupted, but to their irrepairable prejudice of both one and t'other. And so that his Majesty would oppose himself gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55347:24"/>
to the violence which is done to their King, and succour him against the unjust invasion wherewith his Kingdom was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Besides that they thanked his Majesty for the honour he had done them to admit them into his Royal presence, and for the particular grace which they received from thence in their persons.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King thanked the Embassadours for the affection they had expressed to him, and said, that he knew very well, that not only from long antiquity, there was a most streight tie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kingdoms of England and Denmark; but also that the deceased King his Father, had such great obligations to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased King of Denmark, father of him that reigns now, his good Cosen, and to the present King himself, that one of the chief cares, whereunto he would apply himself, in entring into his Kingdom, should be to renue the ancient amity with him; to make known that the interests of the King of Denmark were as dear unto him as those of his own Estates: Of which he praied the Lords Embassadours to assure the King their Master; and that though he should not naturally have horrour for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and injustice, he could not but be touched with those which were done him, and could not deny them the proofs of affection which they demanded.</p>
                  <p>Don Estevan de Gamarra, Councellour to the Catholick King in his Councell of Estate, and War, General Field Martial of his Armies in the Low-countries, and his ordinary Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour with the Lords the Estates General of the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, saw also the King the same day, but it was without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding audience, and without ceremonies; his Majesty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given him to understand, that the affection which he had had for his interests, when he was at Bruxels, permitted him to see him every day, and at all hours. So covered he not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, because the open war which for some years was, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Spain and England, hindred him to make his character appear there; whereas the particular devotion, which this Lord hath alwaies had for the service of his Majesty, obliged him to be continually at the Court, and by his person.</p>

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:55347:24"/>
As on the contrary, Don Enriques de Souza de Tavares, <note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour of Portu gal cannot have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> Count of Miranda, Governour of the arms, of the Senate, of the town and castle of Porto, and extraordinary Embassadour from the King of Portugal to this Republick, could not obtain audience, what instance soever he made for it. But withall, to the end not to reject him altogether, the King, who is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the best, and civillest Prince of the world, sent unto him the next day Sir Edward Nicholas, Secretary of Estate, and of his commands, to tell him, that if the Lord Embassadour of Portugal had Letters of Credence for his Majesty, he would make no difficulty to give him audience; but being not in his Kingdom, nor in a place where he might treat of affairs of Estate, he praied his Excellence to consider, how unhandsom it would look, if in going out of the country under the obedience of the King of Spain, where he had received all kinds of civilities, he should give, without any necessity, audience to his declared Enemy. But that he might assure himself, that when he should be returned into his Kingdom, he should alwaies be ready to give audience to the Ministers of Portugal, which should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed to him with Letters of Credence.</p>
                  <p>After the publick audiences, the King received the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of many persons of quality, and at evening went to make a visit to the Queen of Bohemia, his Aunt, and next to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess Royal, his sister.</p>
                  <p>The Lords the Estates of Holland had a purpose to depute some of their body to accompany his Majesty at supper, but for as much as it was made known unto them, that the King would be very glad to sup in private, and to retire himself in good time, after the toil of the two former daies; and particularly after the visits, and complements, which he had been obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and wherewith he had been almost oppressed that day, they would not hinder him to take his repose; but resolved to reserve to themselves, that honour, for another time, when they might receive it without incommodating his Majesty,</p>
                  <p>We said before that the King had advertisement the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent day, that Admiral Montagu was arrived, with a part of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55347:25"/>
the Fleet in sight of Scheveling, which is but a village inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a hundred or six score families of fishermen, a good mile from the Hague, which was found true. For as soon as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the Fleet then at anckor in the Downs, which is a rode at the entrance of the channel that separates England from the main Land, what passed in Parliament, in behalf of the King; and the publick Declaration, which almost through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was made, it also declared for its lawful Prince, and set sail upon the first orders of the Parliament, with so favourable a wind, that it appeared on the coasts of Holland on Munday morning the 24 of May; and it had the same Admiral that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched an express to the King, to let him know that he was come there with a part of the Fleet to receive his Majesties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and to pass him into England. It was composed at first but of eighteen or nineteen vessels; but those that carried the Commissioners of the two Houses of Parliament, and of the City of London, having not yet joined with it, there arrived others every day and hour, so that before the King was in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to embark, there were reckoned eight and thirty great ships, the most part of them bearing fifty, sixty, and seventy peeces of brass Cannon. That of the Admiral, called yet the Naseby, carried fourscore, where of the fir strank was of eight and forty pound bore; the second, of two and thirty, and of four and twenty, and the third of twelve pount bullet, all of brass.</p>
                  <p>The Commissioners of the two Houses of Parliament, and of the City of London arrived the same day; but for as much as they were not of the King's train, and had no Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the Estate, it was resolved that they should not be treated, nor lodged by Harbengers. Notwithstanding, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration which was had for the quality of the Commissioners of the House of Lords, which were all followed with a great number of Gentlemen, and store of servants, clad in very fair and rich Liveries, as also for some of the Lower House, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their birth, or merit, it was found good to lodge them by billets. They went not a shore till the next day, and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55347:25"/>
Estate was carefull to cause coaches to be sent for them, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which brought them at the Hage in the evening; but they did not reverence to the King till Wednesday the 26. as we will say hereafter.</p>
                  <p>We have said also, that the Estates of Holland would not take their audience the day that the King arrived; to the end not to oppress him with complements, when he had need of rest; but they ordained M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Beaumont, their Secretary, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress himself to one of the Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber, and to pray him to know of his Majesty the hour of their audience, the next day; officiating, in the mean time, under hand by M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Beverweert, that it would please his Majesty to do them the favour to hear them in private, and to make all to depart the Chamber, when they entred there; except the Lords, that were necessary for the service of his person. Not that they had to entertain him with secret affairs in a publick audience, where they were but to felicitate his Majesty upon the present estate of his Kingdom; but because that being assembled in a very great number, and having to make their complement in a body, all the Deputies could not enter into the Hall, nor approach the King, if entrance should be allowed to all the world indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently. The reason which obliged them to give order to the Captain of the Regiment of the Guards, to forbid, that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, entrance into the House of Nassau, to all the inhabitants of the country, of what condition or quality soever they were. They caused a Guard also to be made, for them, of some Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, from the dore of their apartment, in the Palace, even to that of the Prince his house, and prevented by this means the confusion, which they would hardly have avoided without it. After then they had given these orders, and understood that the King expected them, at nine a clock, they came about that time to the place of their ordinary assembly, and went forth thence in the following order. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Starenberg, Collonel of the Regiment of their Guards marched first, and alone, bare-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: After him came the Estates of Holland in body, two and two, the Deputies of the Nobility, which are M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> of Wasse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naer,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55347:26"/>
of Beverweert, of Schagen, of Wimmenum, of Nort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wijck, of Somelsdijck, of Duyvenvoorde, vander Mylen: to wit, Scagen, Wimmenum and Merode, are politick; and as we say, of the robe, and the others have military charges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of their reception, and the other Deputies according to the rank which their towns hold in the assembly: with this difference, notwithstanding, that the Pensionary Councellour, who, although in the assembly he hath his place at the table of the Nobility, cannot, as Minister of the Estates, pretend rank but after all the other Deputies, when the Estates are together in a body; and yet takes place immediately after the Nobles; because that being to make the speech, he could not without disorder, make through the press, to approach the person of the King. Being thus arrived, a foot, at the gate of the King's lodging, they were received there in the same manner as the Estates General had been the day before.</p>
                  <p>The Pensionary Councellour made a very quaint discourse, which would give, without doubt, much ornament to our rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if that Minister would have communicated it; but it could not be obtained from his modesty, which is so much the more incommodious on this occasion; as it is wel known that all the productions of that accomplished wit have their perfection, and that this little treatise cannot have it without that. We must beleeve, notwithstanding, that he would not have rendred himself so difficult, if he would have considered, that it is not in his power to take away the knowledge thereof from posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who will find, one day, his Speech in the Registers, where the Estates would it should be inserted, in the same manner as he pronounced it. The subject was common to him with all those, that had spoken to the King 15 daies before. Therefore the answer of his Majesty, must also relate to that which he made to the oher complements. But that which was particular in this audience, was this, that his Majesty having given occasion to the Estates to enter into other matters, and the Pensionary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor, making use thereof, to speak of the Estate of the affairs of the North, the King declared himself so openly, and so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55347:26"/>
for the interests of the King of Denmark; that though the Lords the Estates should draw no other advantage from the generosity and vigour with which they carried their arms unto those quarters, then the sole approbation of this great Monarch, the glory which returns unto them from thence, would pay, in a manner, the great expence they were at there. It is not fit to speak here of the particularities of that discourse, no more then of those of the secret audiences, which the same Pensionary Councellour had after this general and publick one; but it shall suffice us to say, that the Estates of Holland remained very well satisfied with the civilities they had received in this, and with the declaration which his Majesty had made there. <note place="margin">The King giveth au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the town of Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Estates of Holland being retired, the Deputies of the town of Amsterdam, which made a part of them, gave order to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Groot, their Pensionary Councellour, to demand a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular audience for them, and to address himself for this purpose to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Oneal, one of the Grooms of the Bed-chamber, to know the hour, that it would please his Majesty to appoint them for that. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Oneal, who is of most illustrious birth in Ireland, and by the King's favour to be made a Count, after he had spoken to the King thereof, his Majesty said to him that he desired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to speak with M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Groot, who presently was brought into the chamber, where he found the King neer the chimny, a little distant from some English Lords, who were in affairs, with his Majesty. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Groot, being come to the King, said that the Burgemasters, and Magistrate of the town of Amsterdam, having understood, that this Majesty was come to this Province of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, had ordained their Deputies to go presently to the Hage, most humbly to beseech his Majesty to honour their town with his Royal presence, for so little time as the estate of his affairs should permit him to stay in the country; and that the Deputies had ordained him to know of his Majesty, when they might, without incommodating him, have the honour to do him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in private, and to make him the same request in person. The King answered, that he had a very strong affection for the town of Amsterdam, and that he was obliged thereunto by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55347:27"/>
considerations; so that he would be very glad to see once again that fair and great town, and to thank the Magistrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure, for the proofs of tenderness, which he had received thence; but that he believed he should not be able to obtain it from the impressement with which the Commissioners of Parliament, and City of London, spake of the necessity of his speedy return into England. Notwithstanding, that he would see the Commissioners after dinner, since they were already disimbarked, and if they gave him never so little time, he would imploy it in making a voiage to Amsterdam, and that in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim he would attend the Deputies, as soon as he had dined.</p>
                  <p>The Pensioner replied, that since his Majesty expressed an inclination to make a journy to Amsterdam, he besought him most humbly to defer the audience of the Deputies, untill that after the hearing of the Commissioners of Parliament, he could resolve himself upon the most humble supplication which the Deputies made him. Adding thereunto, that his Majesty might be fully perswaded, that there was no town, even in his own Kingdom, where he could meet with more tenderness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for his person, and more zeal for his interests, then in that of Amsterdam; and that the Burgmasters and Magistrate had no stronger ambition, then to be able to give him effectual and indubitable proofs thereof. That they had understood that his Majesty had some design to cause a Yacht to be made in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, on the model of that which had passed him from Breda into Holland; and likewise that he had the goodness not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise wholly the offer which M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Vlooswijck, one of their Burge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters, had made him of one, which is newly built at Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and which upon the advertisement given them thereof, they had caused to be bought of the Colledge of the Admiralty, to which it belonged; but they judged it not a present worthy of his Majesty, and that they should not without some confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion make him a present of this nature. Notwithstanding if his Majesty would be pleased to accept it, it would be necessary that he should send some one, at the place, to order the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and accommodations; as for their part they would
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55347:27"/>
indeavour to give it all the embellishmens which might render it pleasing to his Majesty. The King answered, that it was true; that the commodity which he had found in that kind of building, on diverse occasions; and especially in his last voiage, coming from Breda, had given him some thought to make one to serve his use on the Thames; but that his intention was not to oblige the Lords of Amsterdam to present him that which they had, though he would not refuse to receive again this mark of their affection, and to charge himself with a new obligation towards that fair and great town. That to this effect, he would send there the Captain of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Beverweerts Yacht, with order to cause that to be finished, which he received from their hands, in the best and most commodious manner that he should judge fit for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Moreover that he would give notice to the Deputies, of the hour he could appoint for their audience, after he had heard the Commissioners of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The Estates of Holland had understood, that the Courts <note place="margin">The Estates of Holland forbid the Courts of Iustice and the other Bodies to compleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the King.</note> of Justice, which they call the great Councel, and the Court of Holland, (where of the last is composed but of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altern Judges for the Province, and for that of Zealand, and the first serves for Parliament to the same Provinces, for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals which are brought there, from all the others Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice) had a purpose to demand audience of the King, and that after their example, divers other Colledges might demand it, as some of those, which make no body, took a priviledge to do it; before the King was arrived at the Hage, resolved that notice should be given to the two Courts of Justice, to the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning Chamber of the Province, to the Consistory of the place, to the University of Leiden, whose Rector was come to the Hage for that purpose, and to all the other bodies and Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that the Estate in making its complement, did it for all its subjects, and that it would not that the King should be troubled with other visits, after that which the Estates of Holland had made him in a body.</p>

to go to felicitate the Queen in her Palace, and the Dukes of York and Glocester, who were lodged at the House of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Embassadours, on the re-establishment of the King, and on the revolution of the affairs of England: and M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> of Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swoude of Utrecht, Ripperda of Hengelo of Overysel, and Isbrants of Groning were deputed to do the same office with the Princess Dowager, and with the Prince of Orange.</p>
                  <p>The same day, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Ripperda, of Buirse, having made report, in the same assembly, of what passed in the voiage he made, with some other Deputies, to the King at Breda, in order to their resolution of the 14. of this moneth, the Deputies were than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for it.</p>
                  <p>And for as much as the Estates General, (as it was agreed <note place="margin">The Estates General make a foundation of three hundred thousand gilders for the King's expence.</note> upon with the Estates of Holland) should be at all the expence that should be made for the King, during the residence which his Majesty should make in the Country, except that of his voiage, and that from the day that he arrived at the Hage, they laid down this day a foundation of three hundred thousand Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and they required the Lord Ripperda of Buirse, Gulde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wagen, Swanenburg, Stavenisse, Renswoude, Velsen, Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perda and Schulenbourg, to attend his Majesty at dinner.</p>
                  <p>The Table was doubly furnished, at the head of which, and in the mid'st sate the King, having on his left hand the Princess Royal, and on his right, the Queen of Bohemia, when she dined there. At the end of the Table, on the same side, were the Dukes of York and Glocester; and at the other end by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess Royal, was the Prince of Orange her Son. And this order was observed in all the repasts, only in the absence of the Prince of Orange, the two Princes, his Majesties brothers, separated and placed themselves at the two ends of the Table. By this means one could well serve all those that were there, because they were all at a certain distance, which permitted the Officers to do their functions: as also the Deputies of the Estates, left space enough between the King's Table and theirs, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of those which served the meat before the Royal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, putting themselves at the two ends of the skirt, before
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55347:28"/>
the King, who would not that the Deputies Table should be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his. Most commonly there was a Set of Violins; which divertised pleasantly the King, during the repast; and in the healths that were drunk, as the King never failed almost to drink the prosperity of this Estate, and very often of each Province in particular, the Cannon of the Viverberg thundred from every Battery.</p>
                  <p>As soon as they arose from dinner, the Commissioners of <note place="margin">Audience of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> the Parliament, and City of London, came to do reverence to his Majesty. The Higher House had nominated six, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord Aubery Veer, Earl of Oxford; the Lord Leonel Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Earl of Middelsex, Foulk, Grevil, Lord Brook; the Lord Charls Rich, Earl of Warwick, the Lord Leicester Devereux, Vicount of Herford, and the Lord John Barcley; but the Earl of Warwick, being sick of the gout, when the others embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, was constrained to stay at London. The Lower House deputed the Lord Eairfax, sometime General of the Parliaments Army, who on that consideration drew upon him the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and eys of every one, and who would see the King pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, to ask him pardon for the pass'd offence with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary submissions; The Lord Bruce, the Lord Falkland; the Lord Castleton; the Lord Herbert; the Lord Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devil, Sir Horatio Townsend, Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, Sir George Booth, he that levied an Army a year since for the calling of a Free-Parliament, in behalf of the King, Denzil Hollis, Esquire, Sir John Holland, and Sir Henry Cholmly. The Deputation of the City of London was much more numerous, as being composed of twenty persons, taken partly out of the Magistracy, and partly from amongst the principal inhabitants, and from the Militia of the City. The chief assembled in the House of the extraordinary Embassadours; and the others, in the house where the Citizens exercise to shoot at the mark, and learn to exercise arms. Both one and t'other went forth a foot, walking two and two, and having before them a very great number of young Gentlemen, that marched in the same order. Being brought into the King's chamber, they made a very low, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55347:29"/>
most submiss reverence. The Earl of Oxford spake for the Higher House: but those that were there at that action, agreed in opinion, that never person spake with more affection, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed himself in better terms, then M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Denzil Hollis, who was the Orator for the Deputies of the Lower House, to whom those of London were joined. He insisted chiefly upon the miseries under which that Kingdom had groned for so many years, and upon the government of Cromwel, who tyrannized the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish in their lives, in their goods, and in their consciences; whereas on the contrary, they could hope from the goodness of his Majesty, but repose, but sweetness, and a lawful liberty; beseeching him to return forthwith into his Kingdom, and to take again the Scepter of his Ancestours, without any condition: which redoubled the joy of this Court, though it were already assured thereof, by the mouth of Sir John Greenvil. The King received them with much goodness, as well as the protestations of obedience and fidelity, which they made him in the name of the Lords and Commons of England, and of the City of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in particular; and after the speech, they did all reverence to the King, in putting one knee to the ground, and in kissing his hand. After they came forth of the King's appartment, they went to the Dukes, to whom they also made complements from the Parliament, and City; they went there also a foot, and from thence, in the same order, to the Queen of Bohemia, and to the Princess Royal, where they acquitted themselves also of the duty which they had order, from the Parliament and City, to render unto them.</p>
                  <p>After the audiences of the Deputies, the King received many persons of quality, who in the impatience to see his Majesty had passed the sea voluntarily, without any particular commission, they all did him reverence, in the same manner the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners had done.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur Friquet, Councellour of Estate to the Emperour, and extraordinary Envoy from his Imperial Majesty to the Estates General, had also audience of the King; and made him his complement in the name of the Emperour, his Master, whose
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55347:29"/>
Predecessour had expressed a most particular affection for the King, even in the height of his persecutions.</p>
                  <p>In the number of those that came to render their duties to the King that day, was the Captain, or Master of the Ship, which received the King aboard on the coast of England, and passed him into France, when that Illustrious Maid, Mistris Lane, saved the fortune of the Kingdom, after the unfortunate battel of Worcester; at least if one may give that Epithete to an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which God hath so favourably blessed, and who hath so favourably disposed the affairs in the glorious return of the King, without any effusion of the blood of his subjects.</p>
                  <p>It is not our design to make here an unnecessary digression, in <note place="margin">Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the King's escape af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the battel of Worcester.</note> making a perfect narrative of all that passed in the miraculous escape of the King after the loss of the battel, nor in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the King, being separated from the Officers that were by his person after the defeat, was brought to the house of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, who changed cloaths with him, and shewed him a tree, where he passed the night. How afterward being come to the house of Mistris Lanes father, her brother received him, as servant, to wait on him in his chamber, and how in this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he rid a journy before that Gentlewoman. How he had a care of the horses in the journy, and what encounters he met there, because all these things are not of the subject of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and deserve well a particular one. But we think it not amiss to say; that the Lord Wilmot deceased Earl of Rochester, who had been extraordinary Embassadour at the Diet of Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon in the year 1653. and who was he, that gave orders for the King's passage, being come at the place where his Majesty was to embark, and seeing the Master of the ship to enter into the chamber, where they supped, to tell them that the tide would be good about midnight, and that they should do well to embark before night, praied him to sit at table, and to sup with them. But the Master had no sooner taken his place, and observed the features of the King's face, but he whispered M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Wilmot in the ear, saying, that he knew that illustrious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and that it was indubitably the King; the other denied
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55347:30"/>
it, and would have him to relinquish that thought; but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, though he made semblance to acquiess therein, during supper; said notwithstanding, in rising from the table, that whatsoever they would make him to beleev, he knew the King so well, that he could not be deceived; because that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been brought before him a few years since, when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, being with a Fleet in the Downs, where he caused some fishermen to be stopped, to whom he gave liberty, presently after he had caused them to be brought to his presence, and he with the rest, he had so well considered him, that since that time, he could not lose the Idea of him. But that they needed to fear nothing, that the person of the King should be alwaies sacred to him, and in safety in his hands. Wilmot persisted in his negative, caused the King to embark, and said no more to the Captain, untill that his Majesty being landed, on the coast of Normandy, he feared not to tell him, that it was indeed the King that he assisted to save, and that his Majesty would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his fidelity and affection, when there should be an occasion to acknowledge one another. And indeed, after the King had perfectly well received him at his closet dore, the Lord Craft, who had presented him to his Majesty, assured him that he might hope for any favours from him.</p>
                  <p>The English Officers that are in the service of the Lords the <note place="margin">Major Cromwell doth reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the King.</note> States, and were come to this town, did him reverence also, and among the rest M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Cromwel, Maior of a Regiment of foot of the same nation. He is Cosen German, but issued from an el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother of him, who is known to have sacrific'd the King his Soveraign to his irregular ambition, and detested that bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and horrible action; but seeing some apparent establishment in the fortune of the Protectour, he passed into England, where he rendered considerable services to those of the good party, and even gave himself the liberty, to remonstrate sometimes to his Cosen, what belonged to his duty: so that insteed of making his fortun there, he could draw from the Protectour for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and for his brother, who commands a Regiment of foot in the service of the Lords the Estates, but a gratification of two
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55347:30"/>
thousand pounds sterling, whereof they have received but the half; though the Major made an expence at London where with he shall be long time incommodated. The King, who know the intentions of this honest man, and permitted his brother to take the surname of Williams, instead of that which shall be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in execration to all Englishmen, and who had many good proofs of them, received him perfectly well.</p>
                  <p>This day came also to salute the King Sir William Davison a <note place="margin">As also Sir Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Davisson.</note> Scott by birth, but since some yeares established at Amsterdam. His Majesty had considered him, as a person most affectionate to his service, and was not deceived therein, because that those who know how he behaved himself, cannot doubt that he was most usefull, and that he acted if not directly for the re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the affairs of England; at least it cannot be denied, that he hath not been unprofitable therein. It was not long before, that the King had given him some proofs of his acknowledgement, in making him Knight Baronet; but this day he confirmed that quality to him, by letters pattents, in adding thereunto a pension without comparison more considerable then that title. The King gives it with very litle ceremony; in making the Novice kneel before him; he laies his sword on his shoulder, and sayth unto him, <hi>Rise Knight Baronet.</hi> Those that are invested with this quality, follow the Barons, and precede the ordinary Knights.</p>
                  <p>After this, the King went to visit the Queen of Bohemia, his Aunt, but it was without ceremony, as he used to do the whole time of his residence at the Hague, during which there passed not a day almost, that he saw her not. From thence he went to the House of the Princess Dowager of Orange, who received him on the stone stairs that go up into the Court. The King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented her presently his hand, and led her through that fair hall, and through the Guard Chamber, to that which they call the Chamber of presence, where the King treated her with much civility, refusing to sitt, till the Princess took her place at the same time. After a conversation of half an hour, the King took leave, and retired himself, but perciving in the fore-chamber that the Princess followed him, he turned about, and would hinder
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55347:31"/>
her to go further; untill that seeing, after a contestation very agreeable, and very obliging, that he could not overcom her, he took her again by the hand, and led her to the foot of the stairs, where he made her again some civility; but seeing her obstinate to render him her devoirs even in the Court, he yeelded at last, went up into his coach, and betook him to the Princess Royal, his Sister, where he met the Embassadour of France, who had the honour to discourse there with his Majesty a good while.</p>
                  <p>The King having spoken, in the evening, at supper, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Regiment of the Guards, which he had seen at his coming, and of which he had alwaies a Company in arms in the Court of his lodging, the Deputies of the Estates General, who were by his person at the hours of his repast, offered to shew it him the next day in battel, to the end his Majesty might judge as favourably of their skil, as he had judged of their shew: The King promised to be present, if his affairs permitted him to give himself that divertisement; but the two Princes expressed, that they should see that exercise with much satisfaction. And, indeed, the next day being the 27<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> the Regiment of the Guards, <note place="margin">The Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Guards exercise.</note> having been in the field, from the beginning of the morning, stood in battalia half the way to Scheveling, by the house, where M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Catz, sometime Pensionary Counsellour, and Keeper of the great Seal of Holland, made his retirement, after he had passed through the fairest imploiments, wherewith his country could have acknowledged his merit, in a very pleasant and fair plain; where the two Princes, the Duke of Brunswick-Lunenburg, the Prince of Orange, Prince William of Nassau, Governour of Freesland, the Rhine-Grave, and all persons of quality that were at the Hage, repaired about ten a clock in the morning; and after they had seen all that which skil could make a body perfectly exercised and disciplined to do, both in marching and fight, under good Officers, they made a course even upon the banks of the sea, from whence they considered the Fleet, and went from thence to dinner, the Dukes of York and of Glocester, with some Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Lords, to the Duke of Lunenburgs; and the rest to the Court. The Estates General deputed there to accompany the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55347:31"/>
King, that day M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> de Gent of Gelders, of Merode, and Navander of Holland, Lampsins of Zealand, Renswoud of Utrecht, Velsen of Freesland, Ripperda of Hengelo of Over-Ysel, and Isbrants of Groning.</p>
                  <p>The King was from the morning shut up with M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Hide, his Chancellour, who for being chief of his Councels, and his most confident Minister, was lodged in the same house; because that being incommodated with the gout, his Majesty would that he should be lodged in a place, where he might make use of his councels at all hours of the day. He was with him more then an hour and a half, sitting on his bed-side, and sometimes leaning upon the bed it self in a very secret conference.</p>
                  <p>After the King was gone out of the Chancellour's chamber, the extraordinary Embassadours of Denmark caused his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to be prayed, to appoint them an hour, for a particular au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which they obtained for the after-noon. They received, in this audience, new assurances of the good intentions of his Majesty, to the advantage of the King their Master, who would have profited notably thereby, if the treaty of peace with Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, had not been too much advanced, as, indeed, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a few daies after.</p>
                  <p>We said, that the precedent day, the King had promised the Pensioner of Amsterdam, that he would certifie the Duputies of the same town, when he could give them audience, to the subject of the request which they had to make unto him, touching the journy, wherein they indeavoured to engage him. And <note place="margin">Audiencé of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</note> indeed, the same evening, he sent them the Lord Wotton, second son to the Lady Stanhop, since Countess of Chesterfield, who was to advertise them, that they might see his Majesty, the next day, at nine a clock in the morning. This Deputation was composed of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Cornelius of Vlooswick, Lord of Vlooswick, Diemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brouck, and John de Huydecooper, Lord of Marseveen, Bourge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters in charge, Conrade Burg, sometime extraordinary Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour in Moscovia, Conrade of Beuningen, heretofore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Embassadour in Denmark, and in Swethen, and now named for the extraordinary Embassadour into France, Senatours,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55347:32"/>
and Peter de Groot, Pensionary of the same town. The last, after he had made a low reverence to his Majesty, spake in these terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>SIR, The Burgemasters and Magistrate of the town of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam, <note place="margin">Speech of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Groot.</note> who yeeld not in devotion and zeal for the glory and interests of your Majesty, to any person of the world, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that they have not satisfied, neither their duty, nor their affection, by the general testimony which they have rendred thereof, by the mouth of the Lords the Estates General, and likewise by that of the Estates of this Province, have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to beseech your Majesty, to grant them a particular au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, where they may give stronger proofs both of one and t'other. Your Majesty shall see them in the extream joy, which they have, for the glorious re-establishment of your Majesty upon the throne of your Ancestours, the circumstances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are so much the more considerable, as this miraculous revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is made without effusion of blood, and as your Majesty is obliged for it, but to the powerful hand of God only, who hath wrought therein by means altogether extraordinary. But you shall find the proofs thereof particularly, in the most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prayer which we have order to make you, to honour their town with your Royal presence, for the few daies the time will allow you to remain in this Province; to the end, that so many strangers, wherewith their town is inhabited, may be witnesses of the publick and real demonstrations which they intend to make, of the veneration which they have for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of your Majesty, and of the passion which they have for your service.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing can be added to the obliging words with which the King answered the complement of the Deputies of Amsterdam, in thanking them with much affection, for that of theirs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he said he had received most illustrious proofs, witnessing to be very sorry that he could not satisfie their request, seeing that he had no less inclination for that journy, then the Lords of Amsterdam could have passion to see him in their town; and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring them that he would eternally remember the amity they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55347:32"/>
had for him. The Deputies replied in the most submiss terms that respect could put into their mouths, and after they had prayed for the prosperity of his Majesty, and for the perpetual felicity of his reign, they retired.</p>
                  <p>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Coyet Knight, Extraordinary Envoy of the King of <note place="margin">Audience of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Envoy of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</note> Swethen, to the Estates General of the United Provinces, had demanded audience the day before; but those, which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty found himself obliged to give to the Estates of Holland, and next to the Commissioners of the Parliament and of the City of London, made him to refer it to this Thursday at eleven a clock in the morning. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Coyet being come into the fore - cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at the hour appointed, the King sent immediately unto him M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Wentworth, one of the four Gentlemen of the Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to entertain him, till affairs permitted his Majesty to come to speak with him, as he did presently after in the Presence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber. The Envoy made known to his Majesty, that he would speak Latine to him, and as he was very wel versed in that language, he had prepared a very elegant discourse for him: but for as much as his Majesty signified to him, that that tongue was not familiar enough to him to serve his turn to answer readily, he made him his complement in French, as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of all the other strange Princes did, extending himself on the present revolution of the affairs of England, on the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and great qualities of his Majesty, and of the amity which the Kings, and Crown of Swethen had from all time received from the Kings of Great Britain.</p>
                  <p>The King answered him, that the testimonies of affection which he rendred him, on this occasion, from the King of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, were very acceptable to him, and that he should find him alwaies disposed, not only to execute with sincerity the ancient treaties, which common interest hath caused to be made between England and Swethen, but also to confirm them by new, and streighter alliances. After this, his Majesty infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himself of the age of the King of Swethen, that reigns now, of the place where the Queen lives, and causeth the King her son to be brought up at present, and of many other
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55347:33"/>
things, which denoted the great goodness, with which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty would receive the Ministers of Princes, with whom his Predecessours had alwaies lived in good correspondence. After this familiar discourse, wherewith the Embassadour came of very well, he went to the Dukes of York, and of Glocester, and afterward saw also the Chancellour of England, to whom he spake of the present estate of the affairs of the North; and gave him to understand, that they were in terms of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, between the two Crowns of Denmark and of Swethen.</p>
                  <p>After this audience the King gave the rest of the day to the affairs of his Kingdom, being in continual conferences with the Commissioners of the Parliament, and of the City of London.</p>
                  <p>It shall not be from our purpose, to say here a word of the manner wherewith the King was served, at his ordinary repasts, <note place="margin">How the King was served.</note> and of the Estate of the expence which was made every day for his Majesty. We have spoken of his Table, and how the Royal persons that did eat there, were seated. They served up great Dishes in Oval form, at five courses, each containing five dishes and twelve trenchers, because they changed the dishes twice at every service, and every dish was so massive, that one shall not be troubled much to represent the expence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when he shall know that there was two dozen of Pheasants in one dish, and that all the other dishes were furnished accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. They served, besides that, five tables for the Lords, and one for the Ladies, as for the Marquess of Worcester, &amp;c. all at four courses, and almost as full, and furnished with the same meats, as those of the King's table, except one course, which was between the pottages and the rost. All the sweet meats, as well at the King's table, as at the Lords and Ladies, were pillaged at every meal, and exposed to the discretion of the people, who were ordinarily there at those hours by the King in crowds. And not only they served all sorts of delicious wines at the tables, but the sources steamed therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually day and night, and were never dry, as well for the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55347:33"/>
English of what condition soever they were, as for all those of the town that came to demand it. Every Table was of twelve coverings, and had its Steward, its four Butlers, as many assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in the buttery, and twelve men that serv'd up the meat and drink. But for the King's mouth, it was particular; there was a Clark of the Kitchin for the pottages, another for the courses, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the pastry, one more for the rost, and one for the meats between the courses, every Clark having four Cooks under him, for each service.</p>
                  <p>There hapned this day a thing, which for having made a <note place="margin">False ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a design upon the King's person.</note> great noise in the beginning, deserves well to be spoken of here, with circumstances which might make one beleeve the truth of what was spoken of then.</p>
                  <p>A man of a most mean condition, French by birth, being about 9 a clock in the evening, in a remote place towards the Rampart, presented himself at the dore of a Millars house wholly affrighted, and almost senseless, (as he appeared) out of breath, and said unto him, that having been enforced to draw off for some necessity of nature, he stooped down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that little rising, which serves for entrenchment to the Hage, and which we called Rampart; where being almost hidden, as well because that the place, where he put himself, was low, as because it was neer night, he presently saw three men to come, whereof two were cloathed in grey, and the third in black, who said one to another with displeasure, as he could judge thereof, in bad French, as he reported, that they failed twice, because of the great number of people that were about him, and serv'd him for guards; but they would so well take their advantage from the two sides of the Coach, that he should not escape them. That rising upon this, the others, wholly surprised to see a man in a place where they were come, because they thought to find no body there, said that they were discovered, and must dispatch him that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal them. That thereupon one of the three shot of a Pistol, whose bullet pierced his hat, which he shewed, wherewith he staggered; but that the other thinking the stroak was not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55347:34"/>
shot a second so neer, that he burned his hair: This had so astonished him, the he fell to the ground, where having lain a while, untill the three men were retired, he arose, and went streight to the house of that Millar. And indeed, he gave such an alarm, there, that the Millar went presently forth with him, and taking two of his neighbours with him, that armed themselves with stones, like him; they pursued those three men, but to no purpose, because they met them not; therefore they went to the place, where he said he saw them at first; and where they found, indeed, the cloak which he said fear had made him to quit. The affair was judged of such importance, that the Court of Justice was ordered, the next day, to make a most strict and most exact inquiry thereof. The Informer being questioned herein, by Commissioners, persisted in his first depositions, which were believed at first to be so much the more true; as the accuser, though incommodated enough in his domestick affairs, witnessed to be much uninterested, and demanded no recompence. Those, notwithstanding, that staied not much at fair apparences, and would that they should proceed to a more exact examination of an affair of this nature, spake of it, as of a deceit, which the laws should either justifie, or punish with the severest punishment. Howsoever it was, it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this effect, that the Estates judging that they could not bring too much care to the conservation of the precious pledge which they had with them, caused some troops of horse to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance with all speed, which were already commanded, and which, being arrived, kept guard with the standard on the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Palace, where the King was lodged, and of which there was alwaies a brigade, which followed the Coach where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever his Majesty went.</p>
                  <p>And for as much as it was known, that there was found in the Fleet a man bould enough to have resolved to put fire to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when the King should go to see the Vessel, where he served in quality of Marriner, which obliged Admiral Montague to seise himself on the key of the powder Magazine, and to ordain all the Captains of the other ships of the Fleet, to do the like aboard
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55347:34"/>
them, and to carry alwaies the key with them; the King was advised to chuse a guard of fourscore Gentlemen, under the charge of the Lord Gerard, Captain of his Life-guards, and one of the four Gentlemen of his Bed-chamber, which served by Brigades; so that there was alwaies twenty which marched on both sides the coach, having one hand on the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting staff of the boot, and holding a sword, drawn out of the belt, but in the scabberd, in the other. But as this posture was some what irregular, and offensive, in a country, where the person of his Majesty was no less dear then in his Kingdom; the King considering, that to hinder approach to his person, was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to secure it, would that they should wear their swords by their sides, and carry a cane in their hand, which assured their countenance, and made their quality and charge to be res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                  <p>The same day, the Estates of Holland gave Commission to M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> of Wimmenum, Deputy from the Nobility, to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Estate of Holland, Halling of Dort, Marseveen of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam, and Hoogland of Alcmaer, to go to felicitate the Queen of Bohemia, the Dukes of York and Glocester the Princess Royal, the Princess Dowager of Orange, and the Prince of Orange, upon the re-establishment of the King of Great Britain. They executed this commission immediately after dinner. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Wimmenum made the complement every where; and which was most admirable, never using twice the same cogitation, nor the same words in all his speeches.</p>
                  <p>The Estates of Holland gave charge also to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Wimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, to know of his Majesty, if it pleased him that they should make him a supper, where the Estates of Holland might have the honour to treat him in private; and if he desired that in this case the Estates should be there in a body, to render him the more honour, or if he would rather they should send there De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties. Whereupon his Majesty, having expressed an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of what they desired, and made known that by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a single person of each member, he should be as well satisfied as if the Estates were there in body, they fixed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55347:35"/>
on Sunday following for the day, being the 30 of the same moneth. They prayed M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Wimmenum to take upon him the whole ordering of the Feast, and to give necessary orders for it; and the Estates named Commissioners, which should be there from them, <hi>viz.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Wassenaer, Lieutenant Admiral of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Wimmenum for the Nobility: De Wit of Dort, Fabricius of Haerlem, Graswinckel of Delf, Buytevest of Leiden, Marseveen of Amsterdam, Cant of Tergow, Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Meyde of Rotterdam, Vander Colck of Gorcum, Vander Eyck of Schiedam, Vander Croest of Schoonhoven, Vander Berg of the Briel, Teylingen of Alckmaer, Jager of Horn, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Cant of Enchuysen, Houtuyn of Edam, Houting of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickendam, Stellingwerf of Medenblick, and Roothooft of Purmerent, to whom were added M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Wit, Pensionary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, and M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Beaumont, Secretary to the Estates of the same Province.</p>
                  <p>But to the end that nothing might be wanting to the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies <note place="margin">The Estates of Holland send vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and provisions to the fleet.</note> of affection which the Estates would render to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, those of Holland ordained, the same day, that all kinds of refreshments should be sent to the Admirals ship, to the Vice-Admirals, and to the Rear-Admirals, to be afterward distributed to the whole Fleet. They communicated hereupon with M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senaer, Lieutenant Admiral of Holland, and caused so much Wine, Victuals, Citrons, Oranges, and other provisions to be bought, that the Lord Montagu was constrained to confess, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw so much. Notwithstanding, they sent them not aboard before the King had fixed on the day of his embarkment, and the Deputy Councellours, who were to execute the orders of the Estates of Holland, gave the commission thereof to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Valquenbourg, of the Bosse, Captain in the Regiment of the Guards, who caused the provisions to be carried aboard the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, to whom it was judged fit they should leave the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, to cause them to be distributed to the other Ships according to his orders.</p>
                  <p>The Estates General of their side, writ to the Colledge of the <note place="margin">The Estates General furnish</note> Admiralty of Rotterdam, that they should provide, and furnish

such a number of Hoys, and other Vessels, as the Officers of <note place="margin">Uessels to transport the King's stable.</note> the King's stable, of the Duke of York, and of Glocester, should judge necessary for the transportation of the horses, and of a part of his Majesties baggage, and of their Royal Highnesses; and order was given that they should be kept and stabled in the town of Rotterdam, till they could be embarked, and that the ships should be provided of hay, of oats, and of straw, for the time that probably they might be upon the sea.</p>
                  <p>Friday the 28 of May, the Estates General, who knew they <note place="margin">And cause the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</note> should please the King, in doing civility to the Parliament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the Lords Ripperda of Buirse, of the Province of Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland, and Schulenbourg of Groning, to go with a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Commissioners of the two Houses of Parliament, and of the City of London, upon the present Estate of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of England.</p>
                  <p>The Lords Deputies of the Higher House, assembled in the <note place="margin">The Estates of Holland give char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon the Kings recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> House of the Earl of Oxford, who was lodged at M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Buisero's, Griffier or Secretary of the Councel to the Prince of Orange; and the Commissioners of the Lower House, at the Lord Fairfax's, who was lodged in the House of the Baron of Asperen, Deputy from the Province of Holland, to the Colledge of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Amsterdam, and received this civility with much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>The same day the Estates of Holland, having deliberated upon the recommendation which the King had made them, when they saluted his Majesty in a body, of some persons and English Officers, which are in the service of this Estate; whose affection, which they expressed to him in his affliction, as well for his interests, as for the person of the Princess Royal, his sister, ordained, that the three Regiments of Scots foot, which were reformed, and reduced to two, in the year 1655, should be brought again to their first estate, in behalf of Lieutenant Collonel Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson, and that the command of the third should be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, with the quality of Collonel. I say the quality, because that some years since, and in consideration of the peace, where the Major Officers are without function, the Colonels have
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55347:36"/>
but the title only, with the pay of the Major Estate of Lieutenant Colonel. They gave, on this very consideration, a troop of Horse to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Kerkhoven, son to the deceased Lord Heenvliet, in his life time, great Hunter, or as they say, Forrester of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, under the deceased Prince of Orange, and Intendant of the Princess Royal her house, who would acknowledge the services of the Father, and the affection of the Lady Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop, his Widow, whom the King made Countess of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterfield, in procuring him that charge through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the King, after having given him the conduct which his Father had of her affairs. The Estates of Holland gave also a company of Walloon Foot, with the hope of a troop of horse, to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Languerack, a Gentleman of the Country, of the House of Boetselaer, who till then had found great obstacles to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</p>
                  <p>They ordained also that M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> of Wimmenum, from the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Halling of the town of Dort, of Marseveen of Amsterdam, <note place="margin">They send to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and Hooglant of Alcmaer, should go to salute, from them, the Commissioners of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the City of London, and to endear upon the affection with which they procured the King's return, and on the zeal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they laboured to re-establish the affairs of the Kingdom, in the same estate they were under their last Monarchs, being then in the most flourishing estate of the world. They found the Commissioners assembled in the same places where the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Estates General had met them, <hi>viz.</hi> some at the Earl of Oxford's, and the others with the Lord Fairfax, and M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Wimmenum said unto them: <q>That the Lords the Estates of Holland, who had so much cause to rejoice for that great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophe, which they saw in England, could not be silent in that wonderfull conjuncture, and in that publick, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal joy; but found themselves obliged to express it, with them that contributed the most to it, and are the principal Authors thereof. That the Parliament of England had this advantage, to be as the foundation of the Estate, but that those which compose it now, had gained this glory to all posterity, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55347:36"/>
they had not only drawn the Kingdom from its greatest calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to carry it to the highest felicity; but also that they had been the first of the three Kingdoms to declare themselves for so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an enterprise. That the Lords the Estates, who in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with England, as they lived during the Anarchy, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, had manifested how dear the amity of the English was to them, participated therein as they ought; assured the Lords Commissioners of the perseverance of their affection, and praied God for the continuation of the prosperity of the affairs of the Kingdom, and of their persons in particular, with all the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency that could be expected from an allied Estate, and from persons perfectly affectionated to their good, and interests.</q> The Commissioners answered, by the mouth of the Lords whom we have named; and after they had thanked the Lords the Estates for the affection which they had for the King, and for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whereof they have every day such glittering proofs, they thanked the Deputies for the pains they would take in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to give them the greatest assurances thereof in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, offering to acknowledge both one and t'other, by their personal services, and by a perpetual and inviolable amity of their Estate with this Republick, and conducted the Deputies even to the coach.</p>
                  <p>Saturday the 29 of May, the Deputy Councellours, which make the Councel of Estate of Holland, considering the expence <note place="margin">Advise of the Coun cel of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of Holland for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> which the Province had made for the reception of the King, in his voiage from Breda, and that which they must make yet, as well for the Feast which they prepared against the next day, as for the presents which they purposed to offer to his Majesty, and to the Princes, his brothers; represented to the Estates of Holland, that it would be requisite to make forthwith a sum of six hundred thousand Gilders. The Estates consented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto immediately, and found it fit to furnish, for the King, the Bed, and the apprutenances, which the last deceased Prince of Orange, had caused to be made for the lying-in of the Princess Royal, and which she never used, because of the death of the Prince her husband, who deceased eight daies before the birth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55347:37"/>
of the Prince his son. This bed is, without doubt, the fairest and richest that ever was made at Paris; and besides the teaster, the seats, the skreens, the hangings and the other peeces ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to make a furniture compleat, the Estates would add thereunto a most perfect fair hanging of the richest tapistery, imbossed with gold and silver, (which they cause to be made of purpose) with a great number of excellent pictures, as well of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as of the countries ancient, and modern, and whatsoever can compose a chamber, worthy to lodge so great a Monarch in his greatest magnificence.</p>
                  <p>The same Councel of Estate ordained also, that all the fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barks of the Villages of Scheveling, and of Heyde, should be <note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state gives order for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkment of the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.</note> stayed for the service of the Estate; to the end, to serve the imbarkment of the Court and King's baggage, and that for the same purpose the Village of Catwick on the sea, should send the next Munday to Scheveling ten, and those of Nortwijck, Sant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voort, and Wijck upon the sea, each eight barks. They also gave order to Captain du Charoy to cause thirty open wagons to be in readiness, to bring a part of the baggage to Scheveling, Munday following; and a like number, with forty close wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, to conduct the train Tuesday, which was the day that the King had nominated for his departure, though it was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red since till Wednesday, the second of June, as we shall see hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The same day the Duke of York, brother to the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Duke of Brunswick Lunenburg, and with a great number of English and Dutch Lords and Gentlemen, went to Scheveling, to take the Marriners oath of fidelity, in quality of Admiral of England; but the wind being contrary, and the sea so moved, that the Lord Montagu, Vice-Admiral, thought it not fit to send boats from aboard him, to fetch his Royal Highness; and the fishermen of the Village, refusing to put him aboard, he was enforced to return to the Hage to dinner.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur Weiman, Councellour in the Councel of Estate <note place="margin">Audience of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg.</note> of the Elector of Brandenbourg, and his Chancellour in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55347:37"/>
Dutchy of Cleveland, had the opportunity to do reverence to the King at Breda, where he went about the affairs of the ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Prince of Orange, wherewith his Electoral Highness would charge himself in part. Therefore he would not press his audience, during the first daies after his arrival, when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was burthened with complements. But as soon as Prince Maurice of Nassau, who with the government of the town of Wesel, and charge of Lieutenant General of the Horse, in the service of the Estates General of the United Provinces, ceaseth not to be Governour of the Dutchy of Cleveland, and of the Provinces annexed to it, in the name of the Elector of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg, was arrived, they judged fit to make a solemn com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to his Majesty, in the name of his Electoral Highness. The Prince was there the same Saturday, accompanied with M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Weiman, who notwithstanding the imploiments which he hath elsewhere, forbears not to reside, some years, at the Hage about the affairs of the wardship of the Prince of Orange; and with M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Copes, ordinary Resident from the Elector, to the Lords the Estates. The discourse of the Prince was like a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeer; so that after the King had answered his complement, they spake of indifferent affairs, which have nothing of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with this relation.</p>
                  <p>The same day Monsieur Vicquefort, Knight, Resident with <note place="margin">Audience of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of Hessen.</note> the Lords the Estates, for the Land-Grave of Hessen, made his complement for the Prince his Master, which was so much the better received, as in his particular he had had an occasion to render most important services to his Majesty, as well as to the deceased King, his Father, of glorious memory. He had the honour to do reverence to his Majesty at Breda; when in the voiage, which he made there some daies before, with the Duke of Brunswick Lunenburg, the King expressed unto him, that he remembred the affection which he had for his service. He spake also for the Duke of Courland in such sort, that the King, who witnessed to be touched with the affliction of that Prince, protested that he would not fail to acknowledge the good offices, which that Prince rendred to the deceased
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55347:38"/>
King, and to his own person, during the disorders of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur Walter de Raet, Councellour in the Court of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Zealand, and West-Freesland, being gone to Bruxels, in <note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Raet is made Knight Barronet.</note> the beginning of the moneth of March, this present year, with M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Goes, his Colleague, by vertue of a Commission from the Court, to speak to the Princess Royal of the affairs of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of Orange, understood that there was notice given, that General Monck dissembled, in a manner, no more the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he had for the King's interests, and for the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the affairs of England, and from thence took the liberty to felicitate the King. His Majesty received him so well, as also the words which he said unto him, when being gone since about the same affairs at Breda, where his Majesty betook himself, he gave him to understand the occasion which hindred the Lords, the Estates, at present, to complement him on the estate of the affairs of the Kingdom of England; that he said unto him, that he should never see him but he would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the good will he expressed to him in this conjuncture. And, indeed this very day, the 29 of May, the King, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring those marks of affection, sent him his, in presenting him by M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Oudart, Councellour to the Princess Royal, and to the Prince of Orange, her son, with Letters Pattents under the great Seal of England, by which he gives to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Raet, and to his issue male, the quality and rank of Knight Barronet for ever. And for as much as those whom the King honours with this title, are obliged to maintain thirty foot souldiers for the service of Ireland; or to pay into the hands of the Treasurer the sum of a thousand fourscore and fifteen pounds, his Majesty caused the first Letters to be accompanied with a second, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing him of paying that sum, and acquitting him in general terms, and his posterity after him to perpetuity, of the said sum.</p>
                  <p>We have said elsewhere, that Don Stephen of Gamarra, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour of Spain entertaines the King.</note> Embassadour of Spain to the Lords the Estates, went to meet the King at Moordike, to express there, to his Majesty, the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55347:38"/>
joy that he had for his re-establishment. The residence which the King had made, for some years, at Bruxels, where Don Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen of Gamarra had the honour to lodge, some daies, in the house of the two Princes, the King's brothers, made him to be considered quite otherwise, then he could hope from his character, in a time, when there was open war between Spain and England, though against the intention of the two Kings. The caresses which the Princes made him on this occasion, and the extraordinary civilities which he had received from the King, proceeded from a particular affection, as well as the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness wherewith the same Dukes of York, and of Glocester prayed to dine with him, on thursday the 27 of this moneth. The Marquess of Ormond, and many other Lords had dined there, the day before, with the same familiarity wherewith the Lords German, Earl of St. Albans, and Craft went to dine with the Embassadour of France, the day the King arrived at the Hage; and upon the recital which these Lords had made to their Royal Highnesses of the great cheer the Embassadour of Spain had made them, they resolved to dine there the next day. But the King, who would dine that day in publick, with the Queen of Bohemia, the Princess Royal, the Prince of Orange, and the Deputies of the Estates General, having desired that the Princes, his brothers, might be of the company, the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, who had expected their Royal Highnesses, gave himself the liberty to complain to the King in raillery, for taking away his guests from him. His Majesty had the goodness to tell him, that he did it of purpose to hinder their dining with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would be also of the Party. And indeed, that very Saturday, the King after he had ridden to Scheveling, where he saw the Fleet, and at his return, visited the Queen of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, went in the evening to the house of the Spanish Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour, where were also the Queen of Bohemia, the Dukes of York and Glocester, the Princess Royal, the Prince of Orange, the Marquess of Ormond, the Lords Digby, Craft, and Taff, the Lady Stanhop, Widow to the Lord Heenvliet, to whom the King gave the title of Countess of Chesterfeild,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55347:39"/>
and Madam Howard her daughter-in-law, Lady of honour to the Princess Royal. The table was covered in the Hall, which is one of the fairest and greatest of the whole Hage; but it would be very difficult to make a pertinent discription of this feast, because that although they served up there but fish, and sallats, it was, without doubt, one of the most splendid and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ever was seen at a private house.</p>
                  <p>There was two great services of fish, or rather of Sea-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, besides the pottages, the courses, and the inter-meats; and there was served up so great a quantity of sweet meats, dry and liquid, that all the persons of quality, which were come, in great number, to see the order of that supper, returned thence all loaden. For the Master of the house had given order that they should have enough; and that the servants should present Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, Hypocras, and all sorts of delicious wines, to all those that should demand it, whil'st the Officers of his Majesty, and of their Royal Highnesses, were magnificently treated in the other apartments of the house. The King appeared there in the best humour that ever he was seen to be, and expressed so much content in this company, which was composed of none almost but of his family, and of persons whom he saw every day, that he staied there even until one a clock after midnight; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, without the least disorder, or confusion that might trouble their conversation and divertisement.</p>
                  <p>Every thing there was high and magnificent; but that which <note place="margin">Downing presents himself to the King.</note> was most remarkable, was this, that about midnight arrived there M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Downing, who did the affairs of England, to the Lords the Estates, in quality of Resident, under Oliver Cromwel, and afterward under the pretended Parliament, which having chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the form of the government, after having cast forth the last Protector, had continued him in his imploiment, under the quality of Extraordinary Envoy. He began to have respect for the King's person, when he knew that all England declared for a free Parliament, and departed from Holland, without order, as soon as he understood, that there was nothing that could lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger oppose, the re-establishment of Monarchal government,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55347:39"/>
with a design to crave Letters of recommendation to General Monk. This Lord considered him, as well because of the birth of his wife, which is illustrious, as because Downing had expressed some respect for him, in a time when that eminent person could not yet discover his intentions. He had his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when he arrived at midnight at the house of the Spanish Embassadour, as we have said. He presented them forthwith to the King, who arose from table a while after, read the Letters, receiv'd the submissions of Downing, and granted him the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and grace, which he asked for him, to whom he could deny nothing, Some daies after, the King Knighted him, and would it should be believed, that the strong aversions which this Minister of the Protector had made appear against him on all occasions, and with all sorts of persons indifferently, even a few daies before the publick and general declaration of all England, proceeded not from any evil intention; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a deep dissimulation, wherewith he was constrained to cover his true sentiments, for fear to prejudice the affairs of his Majesty.</p>
                  <p>Sunday the 30 of May, the King would in the morning hear a Sermon, and to that purpose it was ordained that M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Hardy, one of the Ministers which came from England, with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the City of London, should preach before the King in the Chappel of the Court, which serves for Church to the French that live at the Hage, at eleven a clock in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, as soon as the French had ended their ordinary devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And to the end, to prevent the disorder among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which were come there in crowds from the neighbour towns, the company which had the guard, was commanded to seise themselves of the avenues of the Chappel, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to possess the dore, which leads into a little Partition, where the Princes of Orange heretofore caused a bench to be made cloathed with black velvet, and covered with a canopy of the same stuff for themselves, and for persons of quality, that were ordinarily of their train, but they dreamed not to remedy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconvenience, which deceived all the other precautions
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55347:40"/>
that they used. For the French, instead of giving place to the English, and of using the civility which they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to have for strangers, would not go out of the Church; and even the persons of condition, which sate in the little partition, whereof we have spoken, and who were for the most part Dutch, refused to make place for the Lords, which were, in great number, about the King's person; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out considering that this very incivility hindred them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to satisfie the curiosity they had to see the King, and to be present at the English Liturgy. The Reader of the Church exhorted the people to withdraw; and likewise the Pastor, who made the Sermon, went up again into the Pulpit, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to them the wrong they did themselves, as well as their brethren of the same religion, and strangers, as they in this country, in obstinately staying thus in their seats, after having heard the word of God, in a place where they had been fed, and in failing of respect to the King, to whom that very Temple was given by their Superiours; and where the English were to hear it, after them, in their tongue. But these exhortations made no impression on spirits prepossessed, no more then the other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which he alledged; so that the King was enforced to do his devotions, in the place where her Royal Highness is accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have her preaching, particularly; since most important considerations hindred her to go to the English Church, where there entred as many as it could hold of the Lords of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Minister took his text in the 26 Chapter of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Isaiah, verse 19, which he applied to the present estate of the affairs of England, and made so learned and so pathetick a discourse, that there was not any one there, which was not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and edified therewith.</p>
                  <p>After the Liturgy and Sermon were ended, there presented themselves many persons sick of the Evil, which the King was <note place="margin">The King toucheth the sick.</note> to touch, after many others he had touched Friday and Saturday, the 28. and 29. of this moneth, in private. And for as much as this ceremony is done with circumstances very remarkable, and different from those which accompany it in France, when the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55347:40"/>
King there toucheth the sick; it shall not be from our purpose to speak here, of all the particulars thereof, since they make as well one of the essential parts of our relation, which is to omit nothing of what his Majesty did at the Hage. But before we engage us in this recital, it will be necessary to undeceive the spirit of those that believe, that that which the Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land do on this ocasion, is but a copy of that which is done in France, and that it is not but because of the pretension which they have to that Crown, and by vertue of the title which they take, and from the arms of France, wherewith they charge their Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuchion, that they attribute to themselves a grace which is given to the eldest Son of the Church. For it is most certain, that the King of Great Britain, hath this right and advantage, not as King of France, though he takes the quality thereof in his titles, but as King of England; and because the Kings, his Predecessours, have used it efficiaciously, since the reign of Edward, surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the Confessour; that is to say, since the beginning of the 11. age, and long before the Kings of England had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their pretensions, as they did, when Philip of Valois came to the Crown. Now this ceremony is performed, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as we shall at present relate.</p>
                  <p>Those that feel themselves afflicted with the disease, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Kings-evill, because the King cureth it, are obliged to address themselves to his Majesties chief Chyrurgion who visits them, and if he judgeth that it is the disease, which the King cureth, he appoints them a day and hour to be at the Chappel, where the King is to touch them. As in France, the ceremony of touching the sick is done in the morning, after the King hath communicated; so was it this day done in the Chappel of the Princess Royal, after the King had been at the sermon, and publick prayers. For the preaching being fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, they placed a great chair for the King, in a place some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what distant from the people. And as soon as the King was sate, one of the Clarks of the Closet stands at the right side of the chair, holding on his arm, or rather in his right hand, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gold Angels, every one tied to a ribband of white silk, as there
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55347:41"/>
were sick to be touched, which were then to the number of eight and forty. But for as much as the Angels, which is a kind of gold so named, because it hath the figure of an Angel upon it, are so rare, that they can scarce be gotten, especially in these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; the King useth ordinarily, as he did on this present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the ten shillings peeces, which are near of the same value. The Chaplain, that makes the sermon before the King, and who for this purpose takes ordinarily a text proper for the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, performs the office afterward, and stands on the left side of the chair, whilst the Chyrurgion takes place, with the sick, right over against the King, but at a certain distance: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, in the occasion whereof we speak now, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters text had nothing common with the ceremony, and it was not the Pastor who made the sermon, that assisted there; but Doctor Brown, Chaplain to the Princess Royal, who did all the functions thereof, representing the King's Chaplain, as he did on all the like occasions at Breda, whil'st his Majesty resided there.</p>
                  <p>After his Majesty had taken his place, having by his side the Secretary, or Clark of the Closet, and the Chyrurgion before him, the Chaplain, who held a New-Testament in his hand, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed there the text in the Gospel of Saint Mark the 16 Chapter from the 14 Verse, even to the end of the Chapter; and at the same time, the Chyrurgion, taking one of the diseased by the hand, after having both made three low reverences, came with him to put themselves on their knees before the King, close to the chair, and whil'st the Chaplain pronounced these words of the same Gospel, <hi>They shall lay their hands on the Sick, and they shall be healed;</hi> the King laied his hand on the two cheeks of the sick. This being done, he that was touched, retired himself, and they brought another to the King, who touched him in the same manner; the Chaplain repeating the same words, as many times, as there were sick for the King to touch, and as they brought them one after another at his Majesties feet. The Chyrurgion, who was alwaies on his knees, whil'st the King touched, arose not till the King had made an end of touching,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55347:41"/>
and then he made again three low reverences, and retired with the sick to the place where they were before, and stood there till the Chaplain had made an end of reading the rest of his text; which he continued not to read, till after the King had touched the last of the sick: This being done, the Chaplain began again another Gospel, taken out of the first Chapter of Saint John, from the first verse to the 15; and whil'st he read it, the Chyrurgion brought again the persons touched, to the King, in the same manner as he did before; and his Majesty taking from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the closet, whil'st the Chaplain pronounced these words of the Gospel, <hi>That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world</hi> one of these gold Angels hanging on a silk riband, and put it on the neck of one of the diseased which approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched one after another, in the same manner, as they did when the Chyrurgion brought them to be touched; the Chaplain repeating also those words, as many times as there were persons touched. After this, they all retired again to their first place, and then the Chaplain made an end of reading the Gospel, to the verse which we have denoted. He read after that, some other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the Holy Scripture and concluded the whole service with the Lord's Prayer, and a prayer which they make unto God, that it would please him to bless the ceremony, which the King had performed.</p>
                  <p>The Liturgy being finished, the Gentleman Usher (it was then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sands, who performed that function) brought a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, an ewer, and a towel, and being accompanied with two Lords, or Earls, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord Leonel Cranfield, Earl of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesex, and the Lord Henry German, to whom the King gave since the quality of Earl of Saint Albans; he presented the bason and ewer to the youngest of the two, who stood on the left hand of the Gentleman that carried the towel, taking the right hand of the elder of the two Lords. The last finding himself in the midst of them, they marched, in this order, towards the King; and after making three low reverences, they put themselves all three on their knees before his Majesty; and whil'st the Earl of Saint Albans poured forth the water on the King's hands, the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55347:42"/>
Earl of Middlesex took the towel from the Gentleman Usher, and presented it to his Majesty, who wiped his hands therewith. After this, the two Lords, and the Gentleman Usher, rose up, made again three great reverences to the King, and retired. And after that the King arose also, and went thence to the Princess Royal her chamber.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, that the King hath very often touched the sick, <note place="margin">The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish doubt not the effect of this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> as well at Breda, where he touched two hundred and sixty, from Saturday the 17. of April, to Sunday the 23. of May, as at Bruges and Bruxels, during the residence he made there; and the English assure, that not only it was not without suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, since it was the experience that drew thither every day, a great number of those diseased, even from the most remote Provinces of Germany; but also that there was no person hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so perfectly, who was not infected again with the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, if he were so unfortunate to lose, through negligence, or otherwise, the medal, which the King hangs on his neck, after he hath touched him; without any hope to be cured of it, if he be not touched again, and have another Angel about his neck. We have been loath to have touched on this particular, if many grave persons, whom one cannot suspect of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or deceit, spake not thereof, as of a most constant thing, and of which there is no doubt.</p>
                  <p>Coming from thence, the King and Princes, went to dine with the Princess Royal, where they passed a part of the day, to divert themselves in private. Towards the evening, he made a visit to the Queen of Bohemia; and at the beginning of the night, all the Royal Family were at Prince Maurice his house, where the Estates of Holland had prepared a most magnifick and stately feast for his Majesty.</p>
                  <p>There is more then one dore that gives entrance into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning chamber, which makes one of the fairest peeces of the <note place="margin">Feast of the Estates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> whole building; and in entring through the middle dore, which is over against the great stairs, one of the fairest and cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest of all Europe, because it is double, most large, and all built of a most rare Indian wood, one discovers it fully; so
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55347:42"/>
that wee see, at one and the same time, the cross barr'd win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows which front upon the Viver and Viverberg, the two chimnies of both sides, and in the mid'st above, an overture, which makes a roundel, fashioned like the foot of a lamp, shut with glass, and environed with a gallery, or with a ballister, which makes the tower of the lover, or open roof. From the center of this lover, descended low a Royal Crown, very gallantly made, in the midst of four lusters, or christal candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks; which with many other candlesticks, arms of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and a great number of torches, enlightned all corners much better, then the Sun could have done at midday. They gave, particularly, a marvellous lustre to the two bottoms of the chimny, which is on the left side; where two partitions of painted wood shut up as many cupboards of christal glasses, and a great store of vessels, and of silver plate, and vermilion gilt. The Hall was furnished with ordinary Tapistry, which is of crimson damask, and had no other adornments, but that here and there, there were some fair Pictures, and that the ends of the chimnies, and the void place above the cross bar windows, were adorned with garlands, wreaths and figures of trees, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with oranges, and mingled with all sorts of flowers, which formed not only a very regular compartment; but wonderfully refreshed also the chamber, and charmed no less the smel, by their perfume, then they pleased the sight through the diversity of their rich enamel.</p>
                  <p>The Table was made in double potence, and laied so, that that part, where the Royal family sate, was a thwart before the chimny of the right hand, thrusting from its middle a trunck, or skirt, which possessed more then two thirds of the length of the Hall; and it was shut up with a balustrade of three foot high, which reigned round about; yet so, that there was space enough, between the ballister, and seats of those which were of the feast, to hold the persons, designed for their service. This balustrade had divers wickets, whose entrance was recommended to the care of some Officers of the guards, which hindred strangers to present themselves there.</p>

The King took his place under a cloath of Estate of the same stuff, whereof the rest of the furniture was made, between the Queen of Bohemia, his Aunt, who was on his right hand, and the Princess Royal his sister, who was on his left. The King's two brothers, were at one of the two ends, on the Queen of Bohemias side, and the Prince of Orange at the other end, on the side of the Princess, his Mother. The King sate so, that from his place he saw easily all the Deputies of the Estates of Holland, who possessed that part of the Table, which came from the mid'st of the King's; and were seated according to the rank, which the Nobles and Towns hold in their Assemblies. They would fain that the Rhine-Grave, Commissary General of the Horse, and Governour of Mastricht, should have the honour to give the napkin to the King; but his Majesty would be served the whole meal by Officers of his own, as well as the other Royal persons by theirs. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> de Buat, Captain of the troop of light horsemen, which was formerly that of the Guard of the deceased Prince of Orange, and now of the Estates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Itersum, Lieutenant Collonel of a Regiment of foot, and Drossart of Rolduck, in the Country of <hi>Over-Meas,</hi> did the office of carvers; and served the meat before the King, and before all the Royal family; standing, for this purpose, in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty space, which the Estates of Holland had left between their places, and the table of his Majesty. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Boetzelaer, youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger son of the deceased Baron of Asperen, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Taillefer, el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest son of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Mauriack, Collonel of a Regiment of French foot, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Steeland, son to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Steeland, Lieutenant Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel to the foot Regiment of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Beverweert, and Drossart of Buren; and M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Desloges, son to the deceased Collonel of that name, did the same functions at the table of the Estates, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding between the ballister, and the table, and taking the dishes from the hands of the publick Messengers, whose custom is, to follow the Deputies of the towns to the Assemblies of the Estates, to serve up the meat to the Lords. The King's table was served with six great dishes, in oval form, and with two more laid a cross the other, all loaden like pyramides; and they changed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55347:43"/>
the services five times. There was on the Estates table eight and twenty great dishes, and many plate trenchers, but they changed them no more then four times; to the end, to make some difference between their table and his Majesties. In the ordinary daies they served but seven tables, with the King's, besides the servants; but this day there were sixteen, seven of which served as ordinarily, in the other apartments of the King's house, and the rest in the Castellany, which is as it were the Prison of the Castle, where they had given express order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and treat all the English which presented themselves. It is forbidden me to speak of the expence; but I think I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge here the person of the King, and affirm, that he said the next day, to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Wimmenum, that he never better sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, then the day he arrived at the Hage; and that in all the feasts which were made, as well in France as Spain, in Germany, and in the Low-countries, where he had met stately ones; and among others, that which the Arch-Duke Leopoldus made in the moneth of May, 1656, when he went out of the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to go into Germany, he saw nothing come neer that, wherewith the Estates of Holland had entertained him the day before. It was two daies since the Lords the Estates caused the Troops of Horse to come to the Hague, whereof we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken elsewhere; and this evening they caused a part of them to be lodged in little squadrons, upon the avenues of the King's house, and the rest to be put into battalia, in the Plain, which is a place by the house, worthy to be called, for the beauty of the buildings which environ it, the Royal Place of the Hague. The Regiment of the Guards had their Post, from one of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the house, to the Viverberg, and all a long that fair walk even to the other end towards the Place, behind the battery of the Cannon. As soon as they begun to drink the King's health, they gave the signal, with a torch, at one of the windows of the house, which looks upon the Viver, to make them fire the Cannon, to which answered the Musketeers of the Guards, and next, the Carbines of the Cavallery, and the artillery from the Rampart. Four times this musick served for intermedium
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55347:44"/>
to that, which passed in the Palace during supper: whil'st it lasted, there was made to come forth from a boat, which was in the mid'st of the Viver, or of that Pond, which washeth the foot of the wall of the King's house, as well as of the whole great Palace, an infinite number of squibs, and of other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial fire-works, which gave a most agreeable divertisement to the people, the whole night.</p>
                  <p>Munday, the last of May, the Lords the Estates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <note place="margin">Order of the Estates General, and those of Holla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the King in taking leave.</note> considering that the same reason, which had obliged them to honour the King's arrival, obliged them to do the like at his departure and embarkment; and thinking that the King would depart the next day, they resolved to dispose the Lords, the Estates General, to take their leave of his Majesty at his house, that day, or the day of his departure, as they should think fit; and to signifie to them, that the Estates of Holland could not suffer that any, but them, should accompany his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, either in body, or by Deputies, when he departed. The Estates General, who know that the place of their ordinary As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, is in the Soveraignity of the Province of Holland, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesced therein, without repugnance, and were ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire audience, to take leave of the King, that day, in body; when they understood that his Majesties voiage was deferred a day longer, and that he had signified to him of the Lords the Estates, who was President that week, that the next day he would make them a visit, in person, in the place of their Assembly. They would have been glad if they could have dispensed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of receiving so extraordinary an honour; but they chose rather, to leave themselves to be loaden with civility at home, then to commit an incivility, in opposing the will of the King. The Estates of Holland, to whom the King signified, by one of the Secretaries of his commands, that he would do them the same honour, received the advertisement thereof with the same respect; and both one and t'other, after they had agreed with the Ministers of the Court, how they intended to receive his Majesty, with all the submission they should be able to render to so good a Prince, and so great a Monarch, they both gave
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55347:44"/>
necessary orders, in their several assemblies, for this glorious and illustrious visit.</p>
                  <p>The Estates of the Province of Zealand, who were convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated extraordinarily, in the town of Middelborough, on the occasion of the King's voiage, had named also extraordinary Deputies, whom they ordained to complement the King upon his re-establishment in his Kingdoms, conjunctively with the ordinary Deputies, which are here from their Province in the Estates General. The Extraordinaries arrived at the Hage, Sunday the 30 of May, and the next day, in the morning, both one and t'other had audience of his Majesty, who caused them to be received and conducted in the same manner, and by the same persons he imploied at the reception of the Deputies of the other Estates, and the King made them the same civility. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Veth, Pensionary Councellour of Zealand, and one of the eloquentest men of his time, brother to him, who so long time, and with so much reputation, appeared to the Estates Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and who is there also, at present, for the interests of his Province, took on him the speech, and made a most excellent discourse, speaking in these terms.</p>
                  <p>SIR,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We are here from the Lords the Estates of Zealand, to do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to your Majesty, and to assure you of our most humble and most respectful services.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We represent us, SIR, and acknowledge, in the person and sight of your Majesty, the favours and assistances which our Province hath, from all time, received from the Kings of Great Britain, your most famous Predecessours; and so we cannot felicitate you, and express the joy which we have to see the grace which God would do unto your Majesty, in this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble revolution of affairs; wherewith your Majesty should be so much the more touched, as neither you, nor the rest of the world presumed so much as to hope it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If Great Britain hath made bon-fires at the birth of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, whatshould it do now in this marvellous conjuncture? where we see all the artifices and attempts of your enemies dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55347:45"/>
and overthrown; your Royal person miraculously re-establish'd in the Throne of your Ancestours, and Crown (to speak truth) sent from Heaven, rather then put upon the head of your Majesty, by the hand of man. So we need not doubt that God, who is the particular Protector of Kings; and who raises, at this time, your Majesty by waies so extraordinary, will not fail to uphold you by that powerfull hand, which laid it on your Royal head, and that whole Christendom derives not advantages from thence, which cannot be ordinary; since that God, by whom your Majesty reigns so visibly, will make it so, that you shall reign for him efficaciously, in rendring the good and repose of his Church, inseparable from the interests of your Estate.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And hence shall it be, SIR, that, as from an inexhaustible spring, upon the Councels and actions of your Majesty, shall flow all the blessings of heaven, which shall settle the repose of your Estate, and assure the Scepter in your hands, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of your people, for the protection of your Allies, for the terrour of your enemies, and for the establishment of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual peace in all Christendom; to the exaltation of the great name of God, and to the particular glory of your Majesty. Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially we hope that this favourable occasion, will serve to tie more strongly the knot of that Alliance, which, from all time, hath been so carefully maintained between Great Britain, and this Common-Wealth; particularly if her Highness, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess Royal, who is so notably interested in the good and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of both one, and t'other Estate, will labour herein, with the care which we promise us from her goodness.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Those are the most ardent prayers, SIR, which the Lords the Estates of Zealand, your very humble servants, make unto God, and which they hope will be heard in due time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Estates of the Province of Freesland, made the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in sending to salute the King, by Extraordinary Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <note place="margin">The Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Frees land send to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the King.</note> who had audience the same day, together with their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Deputies, which are in the Estates General, and were presented to his Majesty by Prince William Frederick of Nassau,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55347:45"/>
Governour and Lieutenant General of their Province. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinxma, Councellour in the Court of Justice of Leeuwaerden, addressed the speech, and made his complement in French, like others.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto there was no Minister sent, express, by any forraign <note place="margin">The Count of Olden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg is the first of the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which compleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the King.</note> Prince, or Lord, with Letters of Credence, to felicitate the King upon his re-establishment, and estate of his affairs: But this day there arrived at the Hage M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Cotteritz, Councellour in the Councel of Estate of the Count of Oldenbourg and Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menhorst, and his Drossart in the Bailywick or Jurisdiction of Farel, who had his audience after the Deputies of Freesland. This Lord, who despised the quality of Prince, which was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, to conserve that of most powerfull Count of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and who is no less considerable, through the prudence wherewith he governeth, then through the honour which he hath to be the of same house, with the King of Denmark, who shall be partly his heir, willing to give an extraordinary proof of the respect which he alwaies hath had for the Kings of Great Britain, who of their side have, from all time, much esteemed him, dispatched this Gentleman, as soon as he understood that the King was to depart from Breda, to come into Holland, not so much to acquit himself of that duty, by a simple complement, as to assure his Majesty, that the first day he would send to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his respect unto him in his Kingdom, by a person, who is very near unto him, whom he considereth, and loveth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly. The King, who is much more sensible of the good he receiveth, then of the injuries his enemies have done him, would make known by a most civil reception, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with much tenderness, and by a most obliging answer, which he made to the complement of that Gentleman; that if he could forget the ill usage he had received from some of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he was incapable to lose the remembrance of the obligation, which he had to the Count of Oldenbourg.</p>
                  <p>We have said before, that the Duke of York, as Admiral of <note place="margin">The Duke of York caused the Fleet to take an oath.</note> England, would go, Saturday last, to the Fleet, to take there the Oath of Fidelity of the Officers and Marriners; and that he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55347:46"/>
was hindred by the contrary wind and the tempest. But this day, the last of May, he embarked himself, and was aboard the Admiral. The Fleet declared it self for the King, when it was yet at anckor in the Downs, immediately after it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the intention of the Parliament, upon the Letter and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his Majesty, whereof we have spoken in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Relation; and it was not lately that the Lord Montague, who commands the Fleet now as Vice-Admiral, under the authority of the Duke of York, had made his good will so wel to appear, that not only the King could not doubt thereof, but also that he had given some suspition thereof to those of the contrary party. But it was necessary to disingage the Officers Souldiers, and Marriners of the Oath, which they had done to the last Parliament, and to be assured there of by a new Oath of Fidelity for the King, their Soveraign Lord. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duke being arrived at the Admiral's Ship, where he was received by the Lord Montague, with extraordinary honour and submissions; he caused the Captain of the other ships to come aboard there, and took their Oath, which the Captains caused to be administred since to the inferiour Officers, and to all the rest of the seamen in the other ships. The Lord Montague had caused the flag to be changed before he departed from the coast of England, and made the arms of the Common-wealth to be ra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed out, which appeared for some years on the castle of his proud poop; but he had reserved the honour for his Royal Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to change the name of the ship, which Cromwel caused to be called the Naesby, in memory of the great Battel, where the deceased King was defeated; and by which the Rebellion gained principally the strenght, which made it to subsist even to this last revolution. The Duke thinking that he could not give it a name which should be more pleasingly received, then <note place="margin">Changeth the name of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral ship.</note> that of the King, made it to be called <hi>The Charls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is certainly one of the handsomest frames that ever sailed <note place="margin">Descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral.</note> upon the sea. For although it be of the greatest size that hath been seen after that which they call in England, the Soveraign, and carries fourscore peeces of brass Cannon, amongst which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55347:46"/>
more then twenty are of 48 pound bullet; it is, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, one of the best sailers of the whole Ocean. She had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board her above six hundred men, as well Souldiers, as Sailors, and the Chambers and Galleries of the Castle, where the King was to lodge, and where the Lord Montague lodgeth ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, were all wanscotted, and gilded, and furnished with fair beds of the finest cloth of England, fringed with gold and silver, and with foot Turcky tapistry, for the Royal persons. But that which was most remarkable, was that in the Admirals Kitchin there were six Clarks, that laboured but for the mouth; and that his table was better served on the sea, then those of many Princes are in their Dominions. The plate, which was all of silver, was of so prodigious a greatness, that they were seen to be loaden with peeces of rost beef (whereof the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish have reason to make one of their delicates) which weighed neer a hundred pounds, and the other dishes of plate, which accompanied that, were without comparison, massier then the greatest washing basons that are ordinarily used, and so loaden with meat, that it seemed the whole Fleet was to be fed with the remains of that table, though they were intended but for the attendants of my Lord the Duke. He dined there, at the ordinary of the Vice-Admiral, which might pass for a great feast; and in going thence, he was saluted with the artillery of the whole Fleet, which did him the same honour, when he came aboard.</p>
                  <p>The same day the King received Letters from a certain kind of people, which are called in England Quakers; because that in the ordinary hours when they make their devotions, or prayers, there takes themselves, a certain trembling in all parts of the body, which they say to be a violent motion, caused by the spirit of God, wherewith they would make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe that they are possessed. It would be very hard to say, whether these people are fanatick, or hyponchondriack, that is, mad or melancholy; but it must needs be, that so great a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of spirit, as that which is observed in all their actions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from an ill disposition of the body. They have not only
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55347:47"/>
lost the respect they ow unto Princes and Magistrates; but they fail also in the duties which are inseparable from the civil life: And they are so far from humility, which is a vertue not known, but since the birth of Christianity, that hitherto there was never seen an animal so impudent, and so proud. The Letter was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and impertiment throughout; but particularly, in most places, it pronounced the threatnings of Gods judgment against the King, if he protected not that Sect, and entred not into those thoughts.</p>
                  <p>The King having made known, the day before, to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> the <note place="margin">The King renders a visit to the Estates General.</note> Veth, Deputy from the Province of Zealand, to the Estates General, and President that week for his Province, that his design was to render them a visit, the next morning, in their assembly, as we have said, it was resolved that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this honour, with all imaginable respect; and to that purpose would dispose of all things, in such manner, that his Majesty should carry away from his visit, the satisfaction which he might lawfully promise to himself from thence. And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Tuesday morning, the first day of June, the Lords the Estates General, being come to their chamber, about ten a clock in the forenoon, they named M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> of Gent, from the Province of Gelderland, of Merode and Guldewagen of Holland, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venisse of Zealand, Renswoude of Utrecht, Velsen of Frees<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ripperda of Hengelo of Over-Ysel, and Sculenbourg for Groning; who repaired to the King's Court, and told him, from the Estates, that they knew well, their duty obliged them to come to receive his Majesties orders at his house; but since it pleased him to do the Estates General the honour, to transport himself, in person, into their assembly; they should receive that grace in a most submissive manner; and that to this purpose, they were there, by the command of their Chiefs, to serve his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and to conduct him unto the Hall of the Councel. They prayed the Estates of Holland, to cause their Regiment to make a double guard, upon the avenues, from Prince Maurice his house, to the Palace; and Prince William Frederick of Nassau, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of Freesland, was required, from them, by M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55347:47"/>
and of Schulenbourg, Deputies of the two last Provinces of the Generality, to go to Prince Maurice his house, and to march before the King bare-headed, to conduct him, from his lodging, to the place where the Estates would receive him, in a body; and from thence, even to the seat which was prepared for him.</p>
                  <p>They caused a great train of coaches to come for the King's convenience; but his Majesty had no sooner answered the complement of the Deputies, but being upon the stone stairs of the Court, he caused the Lords of his train to advance, and expressed a willingness to walk a foot that little way, which is between Prince Maurice his house, and the Palace. Prince William of Nassau, put himself immediately before the King, who not disposed to cover himself on the way; the Deputies of the Estates that followed him, put themselves in the same condition; and in this order between two files of Souldiers, they arrived at the foot of the stairs of the great Hall, where the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states General came, in a body, to meet him, made him a low reverence, opened themselves to make him to pass in the mid'st of them, and followed him thus, two and two, a long the Hall, and then through the Gallery, where they sell Pictures; but whose shops were shut up, that day, and through the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing chamber, unto that of their ordinary assembly; his Majesty, and the Estates, being still uncovered.</p>
                  <p>This Hall is more long then large, and there is seen in the mid'st a Table, which reacheth even from one end to the other of the length of the Hall, capable to hold about thirty persons. The President of the Assembly, which changeth every week, according to the number and rank of the United Provinces, hath his place in the mid'st of the Table; but he quitted it then, to that which is over against, where the Embassadours and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of forraign Princes are seated, when publick audience is given them; and in the ordinary place of the President, they had made a foot-bank of seven or eight foot broad, covered with a foot cloth of Tapistry; which reached along the passage, even to the dore of the with-drawing chamber. On the foot-bank was placed a chair of green velvet; and over head, a cloath
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55347:48"/>
of Estate, or Canopy, of the same coloured velvet, which was hung between the Portraits of the four last Princes of Orange, of the house of Nassau; which were separated so, that those of the Princes, William and Maurice, were on the right side; and those of Frederick Henry, and of William the second, his son, on the left side of the Canopy.</p>
                  <p>The King being come to his place, which represented a kind of Throne, Prince William Frederick of Nassau, and some Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Lords put themselves behind the seat; and his Majesty, who stood, till all those which compose that illustrious Senate, which is called the Estates General, and whose number was very great, that day, because of the extraordinary Deputies, which were come upon this occasion, were entred, would not sit, nor be covered, till all the Deputies were disposed in their places; and then he sate and covered himself, but he remained not in that posture: for as soon as he saw all the seats full, and all the Deputies covered, he arose, and uncovering himself again, he thanked the Estates General, in very obliging terms, for all the civilities he had received from them, since he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the country; assured them of the constancy of his ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and affection, for the good of that Common-Wealth; and recommended unto them the persons, and interests of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess Royal, his Sister, and of the Prince of Orange, his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, in the manner as we shall have occasion to say here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Veth, who Presided then for the Province of Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as we have said, and was over against the King, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the name of the assembly, in terms, which made known the respect wherewith they resented the honour they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>This being done, his Majesty retired the same way, and in the same manner as he entred, Prince William marching in the head, and the Estates, who went two and two after him, conducting him, in body, even into the Court, to the foot of the stairs of the great Hall, where they had received him.</p>
                  <p>It was there that the Estates of Holland came to meet his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty <note place="margin">The King makes a visit to the Estates of Holland.</note> in body. They had before them Prince Maurice of Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55347:48"/>
Lieutenant General of the Horse, and Governour of We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, marching alone, and bare-headed; and performing, by them, the same function, which Prince William had done with the Estates General. The order which was given for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of the passage, was so well observed, that there was no encumbrance in the Court; so that the Lords of the King's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and the Gentlemen and Officers of the Country, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, at ease, between two files of Souldiers, drawn so into a guard. Those of the King's Court, and the Officers, went before the King's person, and the Estates of Holland followed him, going two and two: first the body of the Nobility, and next the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Towns, directly from the great stairs, to the dore of the Estates of Holland their apartment. In entring, they turned presently on the left hand, through a little Gallery, which leads into the chamber, where the Deputy Councellours assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which compose the Councel of Estate of Holland, the beauty of whose simetry, the King admired; considered par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in passing by the seat of those Lords, who in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Estates, are as Soveraigns in this part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which is called South-Holland, which is in a bar shut up with a long balustrade, and covered with a heaven, sustained by four columns, the ground all white, embellished with flowers and leaves of gold in embroidred work. Coming forth thence, they passed through the withdrawing chambers, whose plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is painted, but in another manner then the first; and which are also very richly hung with Arras. After that the King went up the great stairs to the Hall, where the Estates of Holland use to assemble, when they are convocated in body. It is a building made so few years since, that the proud work could not yet be finished, whose roof is seeled, nor the rich Tapistries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is to be furnished; but notwithstanding, it is very fair and most magnifick, as it is, being highly raised; its planched roof makes an arch, and the Hall opened with many great windows, which butt upon the Viver, between two fair chimnies. The place is so vast, that to the end, the voice of those that speak there, may not be lost in the air, they were constrained to make
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55347:49"/>
a kind of cutting off with great curtains, which reach from the roof to the floor; at the place, where a balustrade is to be made, which shall shut up that part of the Hall, to which one may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully give the name of Areopage, or rather of Sanctuary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it contains the seats of those who deliberate upon the most important affairs of the Province, and consequently, of all the Estate, whereof it makes one of the principal parts,</p>
                  <p>The seats are disposed so, that in entring one sees, from the dore, the back of a bench of three stories, made like a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel board with leaning pillows, which are revested with green cloath, as well as the seats. This bench is accompanied with two others, which are as two wings. That which is on the right hand, is composed of a low seat; and that on the left, is of two sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and these two benches are a little separate from the first, which, by this means, is in the mid'st, through a little intervale, which may serve for passage. The great bench is over against one of the two chimnies; before which, it forms it self, by that means, a great empty space, which is filled between the two wings with a long table, encompassed with back chairs, for the Deputies of the Nobility of the Province, (which are now but nine) and for the Pensionary Councellour, who, though Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Estate, ceaseth not to have place there; because, that having the charge to propose affairs to go to the suffrages, and to conclude, he can, from the place where he is, speak conveniently to all the Deputies of the Nobility, who deliver their opinion first, and are to be agreed among themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can form the voice only, which they have in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of the Province. The Deputies of Dort, of Haerlam, of Delf, and of Leyden, possess the bench on the right hand. The first story of the great bench, which is over against the chimny, is wholly for the Deputies of Amsterdam, which are in great number, because they will have them at all the extraordinary deputations, which are made for the affairs, whose discussion would consume too much time, if it were made in full assembly. The second story, is for the Deputies of Tergow and Rotterdam; and the third, for those of Gercum Schedam, Schoonhoven,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55347:49"/>
and the Bril; and the bench of the left wing is for the Deputies of the towns of North Holland, which are called in the publick acts, <hi>VVest-Freesland,</hi> and are Alcmaer, Horn, Enchuisen, Edam, Munickendam, Medemblick, and Purmerent.</p>
                  <p>It was necessary to make this little description of the Hall, to the end, to represent better all the circumstances of that remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable visit, in the subject whereof, I must say again, that they had taken away the ordinary table of the Nobility, instead of which they had placed that of the Deputy Councellours, which is not so long as the other; not just in the place of the first, but a cross before the chimny; which is at the end of the Hall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the chimny and table, was made a foot-bank raised with three steps, taking up the whole length of the table towards the chimny, from whence it was a reasonable distance of; and they had drawn the Secretaries table towards the windows; to the end, to free the passage. The foot-bank was covered with a fair Tapistry, and charged with a velvet chair under a cloth of Estate of the same stuff, which reached to the chimny.</p>
                  <p>In entring into the Hall, they conducted the King along the back of the bench on the right wing, to his place, where his Majesty stood, untill all the Deputies of the Nobility and Towns were placed in their ordinary seats. Prince William, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Freesland, held his left hand upon the back of the King's chair; and Prince Maurice, who joined himself to the Estates of Holland, after he had performed his functions with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states General, and put himself on the left hand of the King, had his right hand there, and between them and the chimny were four Lords of the King's attendance. As soon as the Deputies of the Nobility had taken theirs, at the two other ends of the table, and before; yet so, that forming a kind of half moon, which opened in the mid'st, they took not away the sight of the benches from the King, his Majesty who had stood still, and uncovered, sate down, and covered himself; but the King remained no longer so, then till the rest of the assembly were sate and covered; and then arising and uncovering himself, he spake, if not in the same terms, at least upon the same subject,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55347:50"/>
wherewith he had entertained the Estates General, in the visit he had made them. It was but an obliging acknowledgment of the civilities, which his Majesty said he had received from the Estates of Holland, but most sincere protestations of a perpetual and inviolable friendship with this Province, and recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the person and interests of the Princess Royal, and of the Prince of Orange her son.</p>
                  <p>The Pensionary Councellour, who was placed so, that he was almost over against the King, answered thereto in the name of the Estates of Holland, with his usual eloquence, in than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Majesty for the honour he did the assembly, and in witnessing unto him the acknowledgment which the Province should eternally have of the fair mark of his affection, and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al good will; which appeared so evidently in that illustrious, and splendid visit. He said, that the Lords the Estates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land considered, as an effect of his Majesties goodness, the satisfaction which he said to have from the little service which the time and estate of the country permitted them to do, for to express the universal joy, which his Majesty might observe in the countenances of all the inhabitants, rather then in the reception, or entertainment which the Estate had made him. That they received, with respect, the assurances which his Majesty gave them of his amity, and that he might fully assure himself, that his sole consideration would oblige them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace fervently the interests of the Princess Royal, and of the Prince of Orange her son, though they should not be obliged thereunto by other reasons, as they are to aknowledge the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and inclination which her Royal Highness hath alwaies had for the good of the Estate, and for that of the Province of Holland in particular. And as for the Prince of Orange, that the merit of his Ancestours, was still so present to their memory, that there was no doubt, but the desires of his Majesty should be fulfilled of that side.</p>
                  <p>After that, the King retired, in the same manner and order, as he came, the Estates of Holland following him in body with design to conduct him even to his house. But the King being
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55347:50"/>
descended into the Court, by the same way he went, took that towards the Princess Royal her apartment, which is in the same Palace; and the Estates, having conducted him even to the first story, took leave of him, and returned through the gallery, to the Hall of their Assembly.</p>
                  <p>Every one was extreamly surprised with so obliging, and so gallant a manner of proceeding; but this joy was in some kind moderated, because the place being so vast, that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the cutting off, the most part of the Deputies lost either the sense, or words of the King's discourse. The Pensionary Councellour, who answered thereto, said unto those that ask'd it him in writing; that he had perfectly well comprehended the intention of the King; but that he would not undertake to relate, word by word, what his Majesty said concerning the Princess Royal, and the Prince of Orange, which was that they most desired to know. The King being advertised of the displeasure of the Estates of Holland, had the goodness to call for pen, ink, and paper, in the Princess Royal her Chamber, and to send to the Pensionary Councellour this following note, written and signed with his hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sirs, whereas I leave here in your hands, the Princess, my Sister, and the Prince of Orange, my Nephew, two persons which are extreamly dear unto me, I pray you, Sirs, to take their intersts to heart, and to make them to resent the effects of your favour, in the occasions which the Princess, my Sister, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest you, either for her self, or for the Prince, her son; assuring you that all the effect of your good will towards them, shall be acknowledged of me, as if I had received them in my own person; and was signed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>CHARLS R.</p>
                  <p>The Pensionary Councellour answered thereunto, by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal discourse, and most elegant, the substance whereof we shall only declare, and so it imported no other thing, but that this note, whereof a copy was sent to the Estates General, was inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Registers of the resolutions of the Generality, and of the Province of Holland.</p>
                  <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> de Thou, Count of Meslay, Embassadour of France, took this day his audience of leave, with the same ceremonies
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55347:51"/>
he took the first. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Otte Krag, and M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Gotsche of Bugwald Extraordinary Embassadours from the King of Denmark took theirs also, and added to the complement they made his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, upon his happy voiage, a most humble prayer, that being upon his return into England, it would please him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his good Cosen and Ally, the King of Denmark, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and the estate of his affairs; as the King their Master, of his side, would acknowledge, as lnog as he lived, the good Offices which his Majesty should render him on so pressing an occasion. The King, after he had thanked the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours for their complement, upon the subject of his voiage, said, that he could not be ignorant that it was partly for his sake, that the King of Denmark suffered, and that he should be no sooner returned into his Kingdom, then he would imploy all possible means to declare the part he took in the interests of that Prince, his neer Cosen; chiefly in a cause, the justness whereof was so evident, and wherein he was interested in his particular. And that he hoped, that the peace not being so far advanced, as they were made to believe, he should have leisure to give him proofs of his good will. After that, the Embassadours retired, to go visit the Earl of Oxford, chief of the Deputies of the Higher House of Parliament. The Embassadours had caused the King to be sounded, if he were pleased that they should see the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the two Houses; whereas his Majesty expressed to them, that they should do him a pleasure therein, they had often caused audience to be asked both of one, and t'other; but their continual imploiments upon the King's person, joined to the difficulty that was to assemble persons that diverted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a place, where occasions were not wanting to them, and in a time when all the world rejoiced, opposed alwaies their satisfaction; untill that the Earl of Oxford, who indeavoured what he could to make the Commissioners of the Higher House to assemble, but to no purpose. They prayed at last, the 31 day of May, audience of the Lower House, with the Lord Fairfax, who had assembled some of them in the house of the Baron of Asperen, where he was lodged, and the next day, which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55347:51"/>
was Tuesday, the Earl of Oxford did as much, in receiving them at home with him, in the house of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Buysero, Griffeer, or Secretary of the Councel of the Prince of Orange. Coming from the audience of the King, both one and t'other treated the Embassadours with much honour and respect; but they talked of the affairs of the North, as of a thing, whereof the King should have, for the future, the disposition, since that in entring into the Kingdom, he should have solely the whole conduct of the affairs of the Estate.</p>
                  <p>We have said elsewhere, that the Embassadour of Spain saw not the King, but as his particular servant; and that he of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, saw him not when his Majesty arrived: Hence was it that there were no other forraign Ministers, that would trouble him with their complements upon his voiage, after having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiated with him upon his coming to the Crown. There was but Prince Maurice of Nassau, who having had the honour to lodge the King in his house, which is, without doubt, the only one in the Hage, capable to receive so great a Monarch, as well because of its seat, being scituated in the fairest place of the Town, and chief avenue of the Palace, to which the Viver serves for Mote; as because of the decoration of its apartments; in one of which, he caused to be represented the Princes of his House, one of the most ancient and most illustrious of all Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, which would chuse there an Emperour, in a time, when there was none to be found in the other families; There was but that Prince, Isay, who willing to acknowledge the honour he had received at home; and, at the same time, to officiate with his Majesty for his Electoral Highness of Brandenburg, made him also a complement upon his voiage. His Majesty received him perfectly well, did him civility in his particular, speaking very advantagiously of the merit of his person, and thanking him for the affection which he would express unto him: but it was with an extraordinary resentment, that the King spake of that which the Duke of Brandenbourg had had for the estate of his affairs, when all the world believed them desperate; and said, that he would conserve eternally the remembrance of the good
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55347:52"/>
Officers which his splendid Highness had rendred him in the Empire, and of the great obligations which he would gain upon him in a time, when there was no Prince, almost, that dared to declare for his interests.</p>
                  <p>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Coyet, who had saluted their Royall Hignesses some daies before, and had had a particular conference with the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, contented himself to signifie to his Majesty, by Sir Edward Nicholas, that he would not trouble him, among so many other complements, which he should have to receive, because the King, his Master, would not fail to send an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Embassadour to felicitate his Majesty, solemnly, in his Kingdom, as soon as the distance of the places would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the advertisement of his re-establishment to be carried into Sweden.</p>
                  <p>But the Estates General, who had received an honour, whose memory shall be eternally pretious to posterity, thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <note place="margin">The Estates General take leave of the King in a body.</note> bound to acknowledge it, in going, in body, to thank his Majesty for the grace he had done them: and to complement him upon his voiage. They were there, as we now say, in body, and in the same order as at their first audience; and the Baron of Gent, who uttered the speech eight daies before, was the Orator also this time, and spake thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>SIR,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Estates General of the United Provinces, having been <note place="margin">The Speech of Mr. of Gent.</note> advertised from your Majesty, that you purpose to embark to morrow, to compleat your voiage for England, return here again, to receive the honour of your commands on the point of your departure. If your Majesty finds not on their faces the same cheerfulness, which you might observe there, when they had the honour to come to salute you at your arrival, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the sorrow they have to see themselves ready to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the splendour of so fair a light, which your Majesty hath made to shine in their Estate, during the little time you would remain there. That which comforts them, SIR, in some kind, is, that they know, that the interests of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty press your departure; and the good of the affairs of your
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55347:52"/>
Crown, permits you not to defer it longer. Notwithstanding, the little residence which it hath pleased your Majesty to make amongst us; and the goodness, wherewith you would receive the indeavours we have made to be able to please you, leaves there such signal, strong and indubitable marks of your good will towards us, that we shall bless, eternally, for it the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to which we ow those incomparable advantages. The presence of your Majesties sacred person, in their assembly, SIR, and the obliging expressions, which your royal mouth would make in their Senate, are such evident testimonies of the disposition which you have to honour this Estate with your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al good will, that they deserve that all posterity should find them written in Letters of Gold, in their registers, as we have deeply graven them in our hearts. If the entertainment which hath been made to your Majesty; and which it hath pleased you to accept in so ingaging a manner, hath no proportion with the greatness of so potent a Monarch, we beseech you most humbly, to believe, that this defect proceedeth rather from the indigence of our country, then from the will of the inhabitants; in whose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations and joy, we are perswaded that your Majesty may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve visibly the zealous devotions, and ardent prayers, they put forth unto Heaven for the prosperity of your affairs, and for the glory of your Majesties person. And since the Estates Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral are, through an indispensable necessity, to be deprived of the precious presence of your Majesty, they will accompany, at least, your person with their prayers, which they will make inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly, that the sea and winds may favour your passage, and make you happily to arrive at the haven of your Kingdom, that calm and quietness may be open unto you, after that storm and tempest, had so miserably held it shut to you so many years. As soon as the Estates General shall have understood, that your Majesty is landed, they will not fail to send to you their Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Embassadours, as well to finish, with you, in your Kingdom, the offices which they have begun here, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and make more particular overtures in the important sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of an alliance, whereof it had pleased your Majesty to touch
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55347:53"/>
here something in general; being ready to answer, of their side, the good and sincere intentions, whereof you had the goodness to give such great assurances; because that with the affection which we have for the good of your affairs, we have also a most deep respect for the sacred character of your unction, and for the inestimable merit of your Royal person.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King did but confirm, by his answer, the assurances he had already given of the amity he had promised to conserve for this Common-wealth; and the unparallel'd advantages which the Estate should find in the alliance which they may renue with England; thanking them also for all the civilities they had done him, since the time he entred into the country.</p>
                  <p>The Estates General being retired, the King imploied the rest of the day in visits of taking leave: The first he made, was to the Queen of Bohemia, his Aunt, where he staied not long. Coming forth thence, he went to the house of the Princess Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager of Orange; where he found also the Princess of Nassau, and the Young Lady of Orange, her daughters. The conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he had with her Highness, was more then a good halfhour, which was imploied, not only in civilities ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily practised among persons of that condition; but also, (as the wit of this Princess is capable of the greatest affairs) in a very serious discourse on the present Estate of Europe, and on the most important interests of its Princes, whereof she hath a most perfect knowledge. She had received the King on the stone stairs of the Court, and intended to wait on him even to his Coach; the King opposed it, and protested, that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive that honour from a Princess, whom he esteemed no less for her merit, then for her birth, and quality; but the Princess insisted therein so strongly, that it was impossible, for the King, to overcome her civility, though at every step, and at every apartment, he indeavoured to hinder her. But, indeed, she reconducted him, with the Princesses her daughters, to the same place where she received him; and retired not, till she saw the coach go away, as she did at the first visit. After this the King went to see the Princess Royal, who presented him
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55347:53"/>
many persons of condition, either to recommend them, or to take leave. He staied there untill supper time, whil'st the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, which the Estates had hired had brought the baggage to Scheveling, where they embarked it, as soon as it came.</p>
                  <p>At evening, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> of Wimmenum laying hold of the occasion which the King gave him, in speaking of the testimonies of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which the Estates of Holland had rendred him, said to his Majesty, that the intention of the Lords the Estates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was to do something more, if there were any rarities in their Estate that might be presented to so great a Prince. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, <note place="margin">Presents of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of Holland to the Dukes of York and of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</note> that they would give themselves the liberty to cause him to be accommodated, and to send him, on the first occasion, some Presents, which they would beseech his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to consider, as proofs of their good will, rather then as effects of their power. The King would put if off, in saying, that he needed no other assurances of the affection of the Lords the Estates of Holland, then those they had given him on this present occasion; that he was satisfied therewith, and thanked them, not only for the effects pass'd; but also for the good will they expressed unto him for the future. Those Presents which they had designed for him, were not yet ready, as wel because the stately bed of the Princess Royal, which was to make a part of them, was not yet perfected; as because they knew not yet what his Majesty would like most: Therefore was it that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menum would insist no more therein; but went from thence to the House of the Duke of York, to whom he said, that the Lords the Estates of Holland, willing to give some mark of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Royal Highness, had sought every where for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might be worthy of him, and that having found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing because of the small residence which his Majesty, and the Princes his brothers, had made in the country, and yet not able to resolve themselves to let his Royal Highness depart, without giving him a testimony of their respect and good will, they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to accept a bill of Exchequer of seventy five thousand Gilders, which make seven thousand pounds, which he might cause his Treasurer to receive, either at present in this Town, of M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Berckel, Receiver General of the Province, or at London, or
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55347:54"/>
elsewhere, for no body will refuse to give it immediately. The Duke received the bill with many testimonies of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and signified that it was without repugnance that he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself with this obligation towards the Lords the Estates. The Duke of Glocester, to whom M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Wimmenum presented also a bill of a like sum, received it also very kindly, and thanked the Lords in most obliging terms. The Lords the Estates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had also designed a Present, to the value of four thousand Gilders, for my Lord Craft, one of the four Gentlemen of the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, that brought them into the audience of the King; but they deferred to give it him, for the same reason, that made them defer the King's, because a chain of gold of that price could not be made in so few daies.</p>
                  <p>At this time the daies were at their full length, and yet it may <note place="margin">The King departs from the Hague.</note> be said, that not only the Hague saw Wednesday, the 2 of June, some thing more early then the Sun; but also, that there was, in a manner, no night between Tuesday and Wednesday; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for those, who finding no hole to put their heads, because the houses not being able to lodge the crowd of people, which ran there from all the neighbour Towns, the most part were constrained to walk the streets. There was no night for more then fifty thousand persons, who from the precedent evening were gone to take up place on the Downs, or sand-hils, which border on the sea along the coast of Holland, from whence they might discover the Fleet, and from whence they intended to see the King to embark. The Boute-selle awaked the Cavalle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before day; and at two a clock in the morning, instead of the Moon, Drum did beat the assemble, as well for the Citizens as for the souldiers. In the King's house it self, every one was imploied, the whole night, in causing the rest of the baggage to be loaden, and sent away; and there was seen nothing but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and Coaches full of English, who went to embark them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before the barks appointed for his Majesties service, were possessed by his domestick people and servants, who were to attend upon his person. The Citizens came together at their ordinary rendezvous of the Viverberg, and the Regiment of the Guards in the outer-Court, commonly called <hi>Buitenhof;</hi> and both
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55347:54"/>
one and t'other marched from thence to Scheveling, where they stood in Batalia, on the sea shore, from both sides of the Battery of the Cannon, which was brought there from the Hague.</p>
                  <p>The King was soon ready, and received the submissions and complements of many particular persons, that would do him reverence, in expecting the Estates of Holland, who had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed audience to be asked, to take leave in body. They came about eight a clock in the morning to the Hall, where they had received the King's visit, the day before; and went from thence to Prince Maurice his house, in the same manner and order, as they observed, when they made him their first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement. All the persons of quality that were about his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, came to meet them, and conducted them to the chamber where the King had given the most part of his publick audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Pensionary Councellour, who his the organ, by which this great body useth to express it self, and who had place, because of that, immediately after the Nobles, and before the Deputies of the towns, spake neer in these terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If one may judge of the displeasure which we have to see <note place="margin">The Speech of Mr. de Wit.</note> your Majesty depart from our Province, by the satisfaction we have had to possess you, we shall have no great trouble to make it known unto you. Your Majesty might have observed, in the countenance of all our people, the joy they had in their hearts to see amongst them a Prince cherished of God, a Prince wholly miraculous, and a Prince that probably is to make a part of their quietness and felicity. Your Majesty shall see present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the streets filled, all the waies covered, and all the hils loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with people, which will follow you even to the place of your embarkment; and would not leave you, if they had wherewith to pass them into your Kingdom. Our joy is common unto us with that of our Subjects; but as we know, better then they, the inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable value of the treasure which we possess, so are we more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of this sad separation. It would be insupportable to us, SIR, if we re-entred not into our selves, and considered not, that it is the thing of the world we most desired, and the greatest advantage also that we could wish to your Majesty. We acquiess therein, because we know that this removal is no less necessary for us, then glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55347:55"/>
to your Majesty, and that it is in your Kingdom that we must find the accomplishment of the prayers we have made, and make still for you and us. So we shall not fail to profit thence, as well as from the assurances which it hath pleased you to give us, of an immutable affection for the good of this Republick. We render most humble thanks unto your Majesty for them, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for the illustrious proof, which it pleased you to give us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by the glorious visit, wherewith you honoured our assembly. We shall conserve the memory of it most dearly, and make the marks of that goodness to pass to our last posterity; to the end, you acknowledge it with the same respect, with which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it. The constitution wherein we see your Majesty, ready to take horse for the continuation of your voiage, forbids us to enlarge our selves upon a subject which would never weary us, if we had words conformable to our respectful sentiments. But we have no mind to increase the just impatience which your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty should have to see your self returned into your Kingdom. We pray God, SIR, that it be quick, and happy, and that, as he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the hearts and affections of your subjects to acknowledge their lawfull and soveraign Prince, it will please him also to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the sea and winds to favour your voiage; to the end, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have received on your own coast the same prayer which we shall reiterate, you may enjoy in your royal person, and in your posterity forever, all the felicity and prosperity, which your most humble servants wish unto your Majesty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King thanked the Lords the Estates of Holland for the civilities they had done him, during the residence he had made in their Province, as also for the affection they had expressed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by the prayers they made for the success of his voiage, and prosperity of his reign. He promised them also, that he would not only continue to live with that Republick, in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect good correspondence; but would also take a great pleasure to make a good and most streight alliance with it.</p>
                  <p>After this, the King, who staied but till this complement was ended, went forth of his chamber; at the same time the Estates of Holland retired. He took his way to the Princess Royal her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom he would visit at home, before he took horse; and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55347:55"/>
seeing that the Lords the Estates conducted him, he would not be covered from his house to the chamber of the Princess Royal, where being come, the Estates retired, to take coach, when they saw the King to go a horse back. The conversation which his Majesty had with the Princess, was but a moment; for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, he went thence, and came down into the Court of the <note place="margin">The King goes out of the Hage.</note> Palace, where he mounted a horse back, with the Princes, his brothers, and took his way for Scheveling with the report of the great artillery, which thundred from the Rampire, marching in the mid'st of those two Princes, and having before him the Prince of Orange, accompanied with Prince William of Nassau, Governour of Freesland, with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Wassenaer, Lieutenant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of the Province, and with many other persons of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Queen of Bohemia, the Princess Royal, the Princess Dowager, and the Princesses, her daughters, took coach, as well as the Estates of Holland, who would accompany him, in body, even to the place of his embarkment. The Embassadours, and other Ministers of forraign Princes, who sent not there their coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for the same reason that had dispensed them thereof at the entrance, and almost all persons of condition, took the avantguard, and disposed themselves along the coast, where the Citizens, the Horse, and the Regiment of the Guards, stood in Battalia. A great part of the inhabitants, of the neighbour Towns, were there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and those that came not forth of the Hage, early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the nightbefore, followed the Royal Persons, in so great a multitude, that that place, which is very populous, and could not lodge the people that were come there from all places of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, was abandoned, and converted into a desart, in very few hours. As soon as they saw the King to appear on the hill, which covereth the village of Scheveling, on the sea side, the Cannon, which was transported, two daies before, from the Viverberg, upon the strand, saluted him with its whole battry, which ceased not to shoot continually, untill being drawn off from those coasts, could see no longer the honour they indeavoured to render him. The Citizens and the Guards answered thereunto with their vollies of Musket shot, and the Cavallery with their Carbines, and invited thereby the Fleet to make all their artillery to thunder, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55347:56"/>
lightened the air, filled it with so thick a smoak, that those great floating Castles, disappeared in a moment to the eys of those that were on the land.</p>
                  <p>The King being alighted, received the last complement of the Lords the Estates of Holland, (who had conducted him, in body, to the very brink of the sea, and left him Deputies to conduct him to his ship) by the mouth of the Pensionary Councellour. His Majesty next took leave of the Duke of Brunswick-Lunenbourg, of the Princess Dowager of Orange, of the Princess of Nassau, and of the young Lady of Orange, her daughter; and of all the other persons of quality, which could not follow him, or might trouble him in waiting on him to the Fleet: There were none but his nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest relations, the Queen of Bohemia, the Princess Royal, and the Prince of Orange, that conducted him aboard the Admiral ship, which was to pass him into England. The Estates of Holland had <note place="margin">He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barks.</note> caused one of the greatest barks of the place to be fitted for the Royal persons. The body of the vessel was garnished with Tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, its Mast carried the Royal Flag, and its yards were loaden with garlands, and crowns of verdure and flowers, amongst which there was one fastned, accompanied with a streamer, which carried for Devise, <hi>Quo fas &amp; fata,</hi> to denote, that the King, in embarking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, went to the place where the justice of his cause, and the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God called him, and to allude to the ordinary Motto of the Kings of England, <hi>Dieu &amp; mon droict.</hi> The King entred there with all the Royal Family; but seeing a shallop to approach cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, glased and tapistred which the Admiral Montague had sent from aboard him, as soon as he saw the King to appear on the Strand, he entred into her, and the Queen of Bohemia followed him. This Shallop was accompanied with many others, and was rowed with oars, by the sea men, who seeing themselves in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of their Soveraign Prince, made the whole neigbour shore to resound with their shouts; and expressed their joy by all the marks that could be required from persons of that quality: some in casting their caps up into the air, and others, in casting them into the sea, to which some likewise abandoned their doublets and wastcoasts. The Lord Montague, who had changed the Flag of the pretended Republick, before he departed from the coast
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55347:56"/>
of England, and born that of the three Kingdoms, whil'st he was in the rode; seeing the King to approach, caused the Royal Flag to be put to the main mast, and to the Castle of the poop, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Majesty, with the greatest submission, that could be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to a Prince, at the top of the ladder, by which one goes up unto the ship. The King rendred him all the testimonies of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and affection, which he could expect from a Soveraign, who acknowledged perfectly the important services he had done him, as having been one of the most powerful instruments of his re-establishment, whereof he had given him assurances long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and a most certain proof, when he departed from the Sound, upon the King's orders, to favour the design of Sir George Booth, who had taken arms for the service of his Majesty, under pretence of demanding the convocation of a free Parliament.</p>
                  <p>It was past eleven a clock when the King arrived at the Fleet, so that as soon as his Majesty was never so little disinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of a part of those that would follow him to the ship, he put himself at table in the gallery of the poop, with the other Royal Persons, and caused some persons of condition, and the most confident of his Majesty, to be entertained in the other apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the Lord Montague making as fair an expence at this repast, and at all the others following, as at this passage of the King, which was but of two daies, he imploied more then two thousand Jacobusses, though the Lords the Estates had provided his ship, and the rest of the Fleet, with all kinds of provisions, and refreshments necessary, beyond what needed for so little a passage. After dinner, the King received again the last complements of some particular persons, express'd great civility to the Deputies of the Estates of Holland, (for whom M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Wassenaer, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Admiral of the Province, uttered the speech) and sent them away with new protestations of affection and amity. The Sea was calm, and the Heaven so cleer, that the King had a desire to discover once again a Country, where he had received so many testimonies of respect and love: to this purpose he went up on the top of the poop, and seeing that the people, with which he had left the Downs covered, remained there still, he could not chuse but say, that he must confess, it was impossible that his own
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55347:57"/>
subjects could have more tenderness for him, then those people, on whose affections he saw that he reigned no less, then he was going to reign on the wils of the English.</p>
                  <p>After this, he embraced the Prince of Orange, with the same tenderness, as he could have had for his own Son, and gave him his blessing; and took leave of the Queen of Bohemia. But when he was to depart from the Princess Royal, his Sister, that Princess, who had with so much courage, and without grief almost, look'd all pass'd misfortunes in the face, and who had vertue enough, to fortifie that of her brothers, had need of all his constancy, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve her self, to suffer this separation, which she had wished with so much impatience, and whose consequences were to be so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious both to one and t'other. The King himself, who had had resolution enough, to witness no weakness in his greatest misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, cannot resist the tears of a Sister, whom many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, as strong as those of birth render extreamly dear unto him. She would have been inconsolable, but for the hope she had to see again shortly the King, her brother, in his Kingdom; and they would have been troubled to disingage her from the arms of his Majesty, if Admiral Montague had not caused the ankors to be weighed, and given signal to the other ships to set sail. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral ship was already under sail for England, when the Queen of Bohemia, the Princess Royal, and the Prince of Orange, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into the Bark, which was to bring them back again to the land. All the artillery of the Fleet, saluted those Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and the Battry of the Downs answered it, with the small shot of the Citizens and Guards. It was about four a clock in the after-noon, that the Fleet did set sail, and about six a clock, it was gotten so far of, that the people, which stir'd not from the Downs, having lost sight of it, retired themselves, whil'st the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his way towards his Kingdoms, with the same prosperity, which was seen lately to accompany all his affairs.</p>
