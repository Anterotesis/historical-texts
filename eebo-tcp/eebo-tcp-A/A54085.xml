         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>GEorge Keith</hi> having of late appeared Clamarous againſt us, both in Print, and in a Meeting (of his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing) at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> to which our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent was neither ſought nor made neceſſary, as well as that we had many other juſt Ex<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108138:3"/>
Had <hi>G. K.</hi> (as our Books, wherein our Friends and Principles have been publickly defended from his falſe Gloſſes lie upon him unanſwered to this day, though he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us ground to expect an Anſwer from him to two of them) deſiſted from further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on us, and not even of late continued to Charge ſome of us, <hi>As holding moſt Erroneous and Hurtful Principles, contrary to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrines</hi> of the Chriſtian <hi>Faith,</hi> and others, as <hi>Approvers</hi> and <hi>Countenancers</hi> thereof, (ſee his <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> p. 2.) We mought have reſted ſatisfied in what we have already offered. But he perſiſting to Accuſe, and yet waving to concern himſelf with our Defences, I have choſen in theſe to bring <hi>G.

K.</hi> and ſhew how himſelf hath Advocated for our Faith, even in thoſe particulars he hath of late rendered us Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in. A Work I made ſome <hi>Eſſay</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in my late Sheets (Stiled, <hi>An Apoſtate Expoſed)</hi> but then confined my ſelf to that particular Controverſy depending, in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his, called, <hi>Groſs Error,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>To begin then with his Anſwer to <hi>Robert G<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urdon,</hi> in a Book called, <hi>The Light of Truth Triumphing,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1670. he thus ſaith,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108138:3"/>
to his <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> p. 5. <q>The ſecond Snare thou mentioneſt, is, that ſome on the other hand, pretend ſo much Zeal for this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, Chriſt within, the Operations and Actings of the Spirit of God in themſelves, that they deny the Myſtery of God in the Fleſh of Chriſt, as a Matter of any neceſſity to them, as to Redemption, Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Charge thou plainly directs againſt us, called in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, <hi>Quakers—</hi>I ſay, it is a falſe Charge, nor are we guilty of it, as alſo thou falſly alledgeſt, that we reckon to accompliſh this in our own Bodies, each for himſelf, through Obedience to the Law or Light in his Conſcience, which Light they call Chriſt, Redeemer and only Saviour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to the true Chriſt, and our only Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> I ſay this is <hi>Falſe,</hi> for though we ſay Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Juſtification and Redemption is wrought in us by Chriſt, yet not without reſpect to Chriſt, even as outwardly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, Born and Crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath a true, and real, and certain reſpect to Chriſt, both as inwardly manifeſted in us, and alſo as manifeſted in that Body of Fleſh which was Crucified in <hi>Judea,</hi> &amp;c. for we do believe that he took upon him the form of a Servant, even in the outward, and died even in the outward, and offered up even his very Fleſh, through the Eternal Spirit, in the outward as a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108138:4"/>
Sacrifice of a ſweet Smell and Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto God, in order to our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reconciliation with God, ſo as thereby he prepared or made ready the way, for our Juſtification, though our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not ſimply and abſolutely thereby wrought, as if no more were to be done by him and his Spirit in us, or as if his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Body, Fleſh, Blood and Life were the ONLY Sacrifice, and Propitiation, excluding the inward.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hear him yet again, p. 12. <q>But that both here and oft elſewhere thou inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, as if we had no reſpect to his [Chriſt's] outward Coming and Sufferings in order to Juſtification, is a falſe and diſingenuous alledgance of thine; we dearly own and and reſpect him in both the ways of his Coming, and do not ſet the one in oppoſition to the other, nor divide them, for they are in Unity and work together (according to the Eternal Purpoſe of God) for the full and perfect Deliverance and Salvation of Man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, p. 13. <q>We believe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, who was manifeſt in that Body of Fleſh, to be the true and only Chriſt and Saviour, and yet we believe him alſo to be the only true Chriſt and Saviour, as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in us, for he is not two Chriſts but one—we believe that his Outward Coming was not a bare and naked Example, but hath a real Influence and Service in its place, in and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108138:4"/>
upon all who are ſaved, tho' all have not that expreſs knowledge thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And p. 17. <q>Though we Preach him as the Light that enlightens every Man, and cry up the Light within, yet we cry not down the Blood without; nor in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as an Example, do we deny the Atonement, theſe are but thy falſe and groundleſs inſinuations.</q> And in the next page he Expoſtulates with his Adverſary, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>Did thou ever read or hear fromany of us, as if we <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> G. K's <hi>Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,</hi> True Copy, p. 23.</note> counted the Blood of Chriſt, even in the Outward, as the Blood of any ordinary Man or Beaſt? Or thinkeſt thou to infer ſuch a Concluſion from our Principle, as becauſe we ſay Chriſt the Light within us, is precious and ſaving, that therefore we account his Blood as the Blood of any ordinary Man or Beaſt, but I muſt tell thee, thy Inference is bad and deceitful, and doth no wiſe follow from our Principle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What thinkeſt thou, Reader, of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus?</hi> Would <hi>R. Gourdon</hi> (his old <hi>Antagoniſt)</hi> know him now, if he ſhould meet him? Would he take him to be the ſame <hi>G. Keith?</hi> Who from the very ſame Hypotheſes he here oppugns, draws the ſelf-ſame inferences which he tells his <hi>Adverſary,</hi> are <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?</hi> But Truth is the ſame, God is the ſame, his People the ſame, their Principles the ſame, although <hi>G. K.</hi> is not the ſame. And now
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108138:5"/>
let me follow him to the Year 1677. and hear what he ſaith of the <hi>Quakers</hi> then.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Both Chriſt and the Apoſtles (ſays he in his Book called, <hi>Way Caſt up,</hi> p. 72.) Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God and Chriſt in Men, as well as Chriſt his coming in the Fleſh, or God made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in Fleſh, in that prepared Body which was Crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and afterwards raiſed up again and Glorified. And this ſame Doctrine the <hi>Quakers</hi> Preach,</q> 
               <hi>ſaith he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We acknowledge no other Chriſt, but the one only and true Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of <hi>David,</hi> our only Saviour—We do moſt faithfully believe and acknowledge Jeſus Chriſt to be true and perfect God, and true and perfect Man, and that the Nature and Subſtance of his God-head is not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Subſtance of his Manhood: His Manhood is not his God-head, nor is his God-head his Manhood, yet that Man Chriſt is God, by reaſon of the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Union betwixt the two Natures, p. 82.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <q>We hold forth no other Chriſt Jeſus, but the ſame that all the Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in, and was of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh, and before them, and the Father and Lord of them according to the Spirit, who is the Saints hiding place in all Ages, as it is written, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 2.</q> 
               <hi>And the Man</hi> (to wit, the Man Chriſt) <hi>ſhall be as an hiding place,</hi> p. 152.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And thus I have gone through the Eight particular Charges (ſaith <hi>G. K.)</hi> wherewith
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108138:5"/>
he hath ſo falſly Charged us, and in plainneſs and ſimplicity of Heart, declared OUR Belief concerning them; and how that we own the true Chriſt, as true and perfect God, and as true and perfect Man, who, as concerning the Fleſh, was the Son of <hi>David</hi> and of <hi>Mary,</hi> but yet was before <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and all Men, who is the Son of God, bleſſed for evermore, p. 167, 168.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe I might add Quotations out of two Books more, the one written by himſelf and ſome of <hi>Rhode Iſland,</hi> called, <hi>The Chriſtian Faith of the People called Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1692. which was ſince he began to be litigious, the other by himſelf ſingly, the ſame Year 1692. in anſwer to <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>A Serious Appeal,</hi> wherein the <hi>Quakers</hi> are cleared as Orthodox in their Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Conception, Birth, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Aſcenſion, Interceſſion, and coming again to Judgment,</hi> even in thoſe very things he would now render us Heterodox in.

               </q> Now doth not this manifeſt great hardneſs, that a Man, who had ſo large, ſo long, ſo near and intimate Converſe (both <hi>Private</hi> and <hi>Publick)</hi> with the moſt Noted and Eſteemed among Friends, for ſo many years, and had ſo lately defended them and their <hi>Chriſtian Teſtimony,</hi> ſhould now all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den give the lye to all this, and which is more, deduce ſome of his pretended Probations, out of thoſe very Books, which, among others, he had ſo newly commended and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

This he Objects againſt Friends, <hi>Nameleſs Bull,</hi> p. 11. and ſaith, <q>Seeing this true Faith is wrought in God's ordinary way by Preaching, therefore the true Faith of Chriſt's Death and Sufferings ought to be one of the <hi>Firſt</hi> and chiefeſt things, that every true Miniſter ought to Preach, and build up his Hearers in, in order to bring them to Communion with God and Chriſt in Spirit, and that they may Witneſs God and Chriſt to dwell in them, and rule in them.</q> One great Quarrel he had againſt Friends in <hi>America,</hi> was about the ſufficiency of the Light, he having ſaid, <hi>That the Light is not ſufficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe.</hi> And he urges in his <hi>Plea,</hi> p. 23. <q>That if the Man Chriſt Jeſus be our real Saviour, and that his <hi>Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion</hi> and <hi>Mediation</hi> for us, without us, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, hath any part in our Salvation, then the Light doth not ſave us without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe.</q> Other Inſtances of the like kind may be ſeen, p. 12. and 17. of his <hi>Seaſonable Information.</hi> Now although we do not in the leaſt undervalue what our Lord did and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that prepared Body, but acknowledge (as <hi>G.

the Caſe,</hi> p. 11.) was their debate there, but <hi>G. K.</hi> denies it, however it is ours here. And in order thereto I am now examining what <hi>G.

K.</hi> that the <hi>true Faith of Chriſts Death and Sufferings ought to be one of the firſt and chiefeſt things that every true Miniſter ought to preach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with his <hi>Way to the City of God,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1678. There he ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 3. <q>The Knowledge of his [Chriſts] inward Coming, is that which is the more needful, and in the FIRST PLACE, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, by which the true and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe of his outward Coming, is ALONE ſufficiently underſtood.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And p. 125. <q>Through the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt thus in the inward, even before he was outwardly Come, or manifeſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were SAVED, and attained unto PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FECT Peace and Reconciliation with God in their Souls.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again, in p. 152, 153, 154, 155. <q>Though expreſs Knowledge of his [Chriſts] outward Coming, Sufferings and Death is very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beget Faith and Love in Men towards God, as aforeſaid, and ought to be HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY VALUED IN ITS PLACE, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this expreſs Knowledge is not of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity unto Faith and Love, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the outward Coming, Sufferings
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108138:7"/>
and Death of Chriſt may have, and hath a true and real Influence upon them who know it not expreſly. For ſeeing he hath taſted Death for every Man, and given his Life a Ranſom for all, it cannot be but that it ſhould have an influence upon all. As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity ſuffer diſadvantage by his Diſobedience, who never knew it expreſly, ſo why may not many receive an Advantage by Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, even in the outward, who never knew it expreſly? Yea certainly they have, for how many THOUSANDS have been ſaved before Chriſts coming in the outward, who knew it not expreſly? And many, who knew ſomething of it, it was but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Darkly,</hi> and under <hi>Vales</hi> and Figures. Yea the very Diſciples did not for a good Time know of his Death—and yet they had both Faith and Love in ſome meaſure. Seeing then that ſome had Faith and Love ☞ to God, and WERE SAVED, without the expreſs Knowledge thereof, before he came outwardly, why not alſo after his Coming, where his Coming outwardly hath not been <hi>Preached</hi> nor <hi>Revealed?</hi> Yea, hath not God a way of ſaying Infants, and the Dumb and Deaf, who have not that expreſs Knowledge? For now Chriſt is inwardly come in a Seed of Life and Light in all, which is the Word of Reconciliation, by which Men may be reconciled with God—And indeed we find that this is ONLY the true and effectual way of knowing the Uſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108138:8"/>
and Work of his Coming, and Sufferings and Death in the outward, by turning and having our Minds turned inwards unto himſelf, near and in our Hearts, in the Holy Seed, to know, by an inward Feeling and good Experience, his Doings and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in us, by being made conformable thereunto.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He hath no way to come off here, but by playing upon the Word <hi>Expreſs,</hi> and ſo he doth in his Anſwer to <hi>Samuel Jennings (Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſcovery,</hi> p. 16.) where he ſaith, <q>As concerning the indiſpenſible Neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt, as he dyed for us and roſe again, as univerſally neceſſary to Salvation, how and in what Senſe I have affirmed, I have fully explained in divers of my late Printed Books, relating to our late Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, where I have diſtinguiſhed betwixt the <hi>Expreſs,</hi> or explicite Knowledge and Faith of Chriſts Death, in order to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, and the implicite Knowledge and Faith of it, aſſerting this <hi>laſt,</hi> but not the <hi>firſt,</hi> as univerſally and indiſpenſibly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is truly ſaid by him, that the Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt Explicite and Implicite is a <hi>late</hi> Diſtinction (and indeed to ſerve a turn) for in his former Books I find it not, though the Word <hi>Expreſs</hi> be uſed, as where he ſaid even now, that <hi>many of</hi> Adams <hi>Poſterity ſuffer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage by his Diſobedience, who never knew it expreſly,</hi> where it is a Word of Courſe, and of no Force, ſeeing even of them that knew it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108138:8"/>
not at all, neither implicitely nor expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely, there have periſhed. But he hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his own Diſtinction, and blockt up his own way in acknowledging <hi>many of them, who knew ſomething of it, that it was very Darkly, and under Vales and Figures,</hi> while others, who are excepted from them, the <hi>many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>were ſaved before Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the outward,</hi> cannot be truly ſaid to know it, either explicitely or implicitely, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no <hi>Medium</hi> between knowing very Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in Vales and Figures <hi>(implicitely,</hi> in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſcure Degree) and not knowing at all. Yet even theſe as well as thoſe were ſaved, and he purſues the inſtance to Infants, Deaf and Dumb, as well as to the D<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Again, what means his ſaying, that the <hi>expreſs Knowledge of Chriſts outward Coming ought to be highly valued in its place,</hi> if he did not allot an <hi>higher place</hi> to the Knowledge of the Inward? and that he doth ſo, is further manifeſt from the Conceſſion he makes, that Men have been ſaved without the expreſs Knowledge of the one, but not of the other, for he avers it to be <hi>only the true and effectual way of knowing the Uſe and Work of his Coming in the outward.</hi> But not to dwell here, I ſhall now cite him out of his, called, <hi>Light of Truth Triumphing,</hi> p. 6. in theſe Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:108138:9"/>
                  <q>May not the Benefit of Chriſts taking on him the Form of a Man redound unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who do not expreſly know it, (they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a true Light within them) even as a diſeaſed Perſon may receive Benefit of a Cure applied to him, though he hath not an expreſs Knowledge of all the Names and Ways, how from firſt to laſt it hath been prepared; and even as many have ſuffered hurt, through the Diſobedience of the firſt Man, to wit, <hi>Adam,</hi> who have not known expreſly that ever ſuch a Man was, or the manner of his Diſobedience. So why may not even many receive Benefit, through the Obedience of Chriſt, in the outward, who have not known expreſly his outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Sufferings? Otherwiſe <hi>Adams</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience were more Effectual for Mans Deſtruction, than the Obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were for his Salvation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>One Inſtance more I ſhall bring out of this Book, and then betake my ſelf to another. It is p. 17. where he ſaith, <q>Though Prophets and Apoſtles preached him as in the Form of a Man, yet they preached him alſo, and that MORE GENERALLY, as a Light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yea and to <hi>Jews</hi> alſo.</q> If this be true, and <hi>G. K.</hi> believe it, his Cavil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, <hi>nameleſs Bull,</hi> p. 10, 11, for not ſo frequently Preaching Chriſt without as Chriſt within, is quite out of Doors: For if they, who lived before and in the age in which it was accompliſht, and where that belief was oppoſed, yet <hi>more generally</hi> preached him, as
<pb facs="tcp:108138:9"/>
a Light, why is he ſo offended with us, for doing ſo, where the outward is ſo univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received and believed, except that he liſts to be Contentions? Now let us hear what he once termed the <hi>neceſſary Parts of Religion,</hi> what not, and ſee if he knows how to agree with himſelf there. It is in his <hi>Appendix</hi> to <hi>Immediate Revolation,</hi> p. 229, 230.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Theſe Parts neceſſary to the being of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are thoſe, without which, Religion cannot ſubſiſt, they belonging to the very Being and Life of it: The other Parts are thoſe which belong unto the Intireneſs or Fulneſs of it, yet ſo as true Religion may be without the expreſs Knowledge and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of them. And according to this, I ſay, The Knowledge and Belief of the Hiſtory of Chriſt his outward <hi>Coming, Birth, Life, Death, Burial, Reſurrection,</hi> &amp;c.—Are ſuch Parts of our Religion and Faith, as ſerves to make up the Intiredneſs or Fulneſs of it.—That the hiſtorical Knowledge and Faith is not an eſſential part of true Religion is manifeſt, becauſe as ſome not having true Religion, may have the hiſtorical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Faith; ſo ſome who were truly Religious, did want it, as is clear in the Caſe of that Devout and Religious Man, <hi>Cornelius,</hi> whoſe Prayers God heard, and yet he knew not the Hiſtory of Chriſt, nor of his Death and Sufferings, till it was Preached unto him by <hi>Peter.</hi> And the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſciples themſelves, while they follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt outwardly, knew not that he was
<pb facs="tcp:108138:10"/>
to die for ſome time, and yet in that time of their Ignorance of this weighty Matter, were truly Religious.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is a hard Matter for this Man to ſay any thing, but he muſt interfere; his former and later <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ritings looks askew upon one another, as if they did not belong to the ſame Author. He finds fault, in his <hi>Cauſeleſs Grounds,</hi> p. 1. with ſome for altering the Titles of his Books, and giving new ones, particularly to one, this new Title, <hi>The Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> or <hi>George Keith</hi>'s <hi>Eyes opened:</hi> 
                  <q>As if the Name <hi>Chriſtian Quaker</hi> were peculiar to me (ſaith he)—Or as if I had been formerly blind till of late Days [and then tells us] "What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath delivered in any of his late Printed Books, touching either the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead, or <hi>any other</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtian Doctrine, hath been his Faith ever ſince he came among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> viz. upwards of thirty Years paſt.</q> He is like to be tried before we part. But this I here obſerve, that in the above recited <hi>Appendix, Cornelius</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a <hi>Devout</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> Man, one whoſe <hi>Prayers</hi> God <hi>heard:</hi> Yet in <hi>Truth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,</hi> p. 45. (a Book Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1694.) he will not allow him, or the <hi>faithful Heathen, who had no Knowledge nor Faith of Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and raiſed again, to be true</hi> Chriſtians <hi>at all.</hi> Nay p. 70. he reckons it among the <hi>dangerous and hurtful Errors</hi> to aſſert, that <hi>Men may have that Holy Ghoſt, that was given to Believers in Chriſt Crucified,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Without all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108138:10"/>
Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt Crucified.</hi> For he adds, <q>It is not ſaid, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> had the Holy Ghoſt in his <hi>Gentile</hi> State, although he had a great Meaſure of <hi>Gentile Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </q> Now I would fain know of him, Whether any <hi>Prayer</hi> is heard by God, but what is put by his <hi>Spirit?</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was of another Mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 26. And I doubt not but <hi>G. K.</hi> hath been ſo once. Himſelf tells us, p. 46. <q>Some have aſſerted, that <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gentile Philoſophers,</hi> who had ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Uprightneſs, and were in ſome Meaſure faithful to what was inwardly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto them, were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyr,</hi> and ſome other Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have aſſerted.</q> [This he ſaith, <hi>he will not poſitively contradict,</hi> but adds] <q>If they were real <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and were worthy of that honourable Name, they had ſome Faith and Knowledge of Chriſt the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and Saviour of the World, as he was to come in the Fleſh.</q> But I ask, waving the Definition of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> wherein their <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> exceeds his, Whether a Man in his pure <hi>Gentile</hi> State, devoid of the Holy Ghoſt, hath the <hi>neceſſary Parts</hi> of Religion, hath that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which <hi>Religion cannot ſubſiſt,</hi> as to the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of it, (the Terms of his Poſition above) and if ſo, it will neceſſarily follow, that the Holy Ghoſt only makes up the <hi>Entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of it, but is not <hi>Eſſential</hi> to the Being and Life of it, which is an <hi>hurtful Error</hi> indeed: If not, <hi>Cornelius,</hi> by having
<pb facs="tcp:108138:11"/>
thoſe <hi>Parts neceſſary</hi> to the Being of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had the Gift of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and out of this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> let him Extricate himſelf, if he can. In the mean time, I go on to the next Citation, out of the ſame <hi>Appendix,</hi> p. 232.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In them who have not the Scriptures, the Spirit and Light of Chriſt ſufficiently teacheth them the Parts of Religion, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary without the Scripture, (to which Parts the Hiſtory of the Scripture doth not belong, as is ſaid) and they who do faithfully improve the Knowledge of thoſe neceſſary Parts, although they want the Hiſtory, it <hi>ſufficeth</hi> unto them for <hi>Salvation.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence I Query, Whether the Spirit and Light of Chriſt being the Teacher, ſuch may be ſaid to be <hi>without the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> And whether any thing leſs then the Holy Ghoſt (in ſome Degree) <hi>ſufficeth</hi> to <hi>Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is another Blunder of his yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, <q>I do moſt willingly grant (ſaith he p. 242.) that the Preaching of Chriſt without us, in his Birth, Life, Suffering, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a very conſiderable part of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, yea more than the skin is a part of the Body of the Man, yet it is but an <hi>integral</hi> Part, ſuch as the Hands and Feet of a Man, without which a Man may ſubſiſt, but not as an entire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Man, and ſo may true Religion and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſubſiſt without the Hiſtory
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108138:11"/>
of Chriſt in the Letter, to wit, in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Life of Chriſt in the Spirit; and yet even here, where the <hi>Hiſtory is wanting,</hi> the Myſtery or <hi>inſide</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is not without its skin, or outſide, namely, an outward Confeſſion unto God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Waving the unaptneſs of the Simile, for no Man can ſubſiſt without his Skin, without Hands or Feet he may; I obſerve he here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of a <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> without the Hiſtory of Chriſt in the Letter; What becomes then of his late Poſition, <hi>That if they were real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they had ſome Faith and Knowledge of Chriſt the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>as he was to come?</hi> He that pretends, that upwards of thirty Years he hath been the ſame Man, may caſt an Eye back upon what he hath ſaid, <hi>Reaſons and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> p. 31. <hi>viz. That Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, as he came without us in the Fleſh, and died for our Sins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is neceſſary to make a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> The ſame he tells <hi>T. E. Seaſonable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> p. 29. and aſſigns it as the <hi>chief point of Doctrine, wherein the Controverſie lay between them of the other ſide and him.</hi> Is this Man fit to engage in Controverſie with others, that knows not his own Mind? But this is not all, it ſeems where the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> is wanting, the Myſtery may not, nay it is not without its <hi>outſide,</hi> if there be an <hi>outward</hi> Confeſſion to <hi>God,</hi> though there be never a Word of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Death, Sufferings,</hi> &amp;c. Yet once again let me Query, Whether, where the <hi>Myſtery</hi> is known, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> be received or not?</p>

                  <q>This is the true Method and Order (ſaith <hi>G. K. Way to the City of God,</hi> p. 156, 157.) which the Lord hath taught us to hold forth unto People, whereby they attain unto Holineſs,—and come to know the great End and Uſe of his [Chriſts] outward Coming, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>firſt Place</hi> to point and turn their Minds unto the Light of Jeſus Chriſt, who hath enlightned them and every one, and hath ſown a Seed of his Light, Life, and Spirit in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, unto which Seed they ſhould give the moſt inward of their Hearts—whence then in due time ſuch a meaſure of Light and Life ariſeth therein, as gives them both truly to know Chriſt, and to follow him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In his Book of <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1671. he ſaith, <q>This is the true and <hi>Only</hi> Method which ſhould be uſed by Preachers, for the bringing People into the Faith and Acknowledgment of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion: <hi>Firſt</hi> to enform them of this Univerſal Principle, what it is, and turn
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108138:13"/>
them towards it—and ſo as <hi>Wiſe Builders,</hi> to lay this true Foundation in its <hi>proper</hi> Place—And this will naturally bring People to own the Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and things therein declared, to own <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets,—to own Chriſt in the Fleſh, his Miraculous Birth, his Doctrine, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, together with the wonderful End and Deſign of God therein, to own the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles—and finally to own the ſame, as it is now again reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this day after the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> p. 92.

               <p>Now hear what is not good Method and Order. <q>But to come (ſaith he, p. 93.) to the Nations, that have not, nor do own the Scriptures, and but few of the things therein declared, and preſs them to believe the Scriptures, and own them as the Words and Oracles of God in the firſt Place, without firſt directing them to the great Word and Oracle of God in their own Hearts—is moſt contrary unto the true Method and Order of the Goſpel, and againſt all true Method and Order held in the Knowledge of things natural, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways proceeds from the more known to the leſs—And to ſpeak the Truth, hence it is, even for want of this true Order in Preaching of the Goſpel, that Men have had ſo little ſucceſs hitherto,</q> (Compare this with <hi>Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Bull,</hi> p. 10, 11. forequoted.)</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>There was ſuch a Principle in them, [the Gentiles] whereby they did the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law; Therefore it was a Principle of the very <hi>ſaving</hi> Light and Life of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is that <hi>Divine Nature</hi> mentioned, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</q> Thus far p. 28. Now let him tell me, whence this <hi>Divine Nature</hi> was influenced, if not from the <hi>Divine</hi> Spirit or <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which lately he would not allow to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> but only a great meaſure of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Sincerity and Righteouſneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he goes on, p. 29. thus, <q>Theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did the things contained in the Law, ſo that they were excuſed, yea and juſtified, and did receive the reward of <hi>Glory,</hi> Honour and Peace in ſo doing. In divers of theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>the Seed was raiſed,</hi>
                  </q> [that's beyond
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108138:14"/>

                  </q>

               <p>But it ſeems ſome were ready to <hi>Argue</hi> then, as he hath done ſince, <hi>that there can be no juſtification without Faith in Chriſt, but theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had not Faith in Chriſt, therefore,</hi> &amp;c. to which he <hi>anſwers</hi> by <hi>denying the ſecond Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 
                  <q>For if they did cleave unto, (ſaid he <hi>then)</hi> and Believe in the Light, they Believed in Chriſt, for he is the Light, nor is the <hi>outward name</hi> that which ſaveth, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Nature, Virtue and Power, ſignified thereby, which was made manifeſt in them, and thus is Chriſt even that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were not ſo caſt off, but that as to what was the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> thing, to wit, the word of Faith, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did ſhare with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that whoever among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did Believe and Call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Name of the Lord, were <hi>ſaved</hi> no leſs than the <hi>Jews,</hi> p. 34.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This was the priviledge of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> no leſs than of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to have this word ſo near unto them, as to be in the Mouth and in the Heart.</q> That theſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who did call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ☞ the Name of the Lord, and <hi>were ſaved,</hi> 
                  <q>were not under any outward Adminiſtration of the Goſpel, is moſt evident from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection framed by the Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108138:15"/>
his anſwer thereunto, p. 35.</q> (Compare with <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> p. 70. cited above.)</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The hearing that Faith comes by, (he tells us, p. 36.) is the hearing by the word, even that Word that was in their Mouth and Heart. And a little lower, as a Comment upon thoſe Words, <hi>They have not all obeyed,</hi> he bids us mark, the Apoſtle doth not ſay, <hi>They have not all obeyed the law of Nature, or the Light of Nature,</hi> but they have not all Obeyed the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſo that the <hi>very Goſpel</hi> (adds he) hath been Preached unto <hi>all,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhould never have been charged with not having Obeyed it.</q> But I put him to prove, that the Hiſtory of Chriſt his Conception, Birth, Crucifixion, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Aſcenſion, hath ever been Preached to <hi>all,</hi> either <hi>Explicitely</hi> or <hi>Implicitely,</hi> ſeeing he ſaith, the very Goſpel hath been: And Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That whether, where the very Goſpel hath been received, or that which he here calls the very Goſpel, the Holy Ghoſt hath not been given.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not ſo caſt off of God, but that they had the ſame Mercy, as had the <hi>Jews,</hi> in relation unto the <hi>Chief</hi> and <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> thing—They [the Scriptures] point unto ſome Manifeſtation of him, in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in all Ages, ſufficient unto Salvation, p 56.</q>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108138:15"/>
might enjoy him, which doth again infer, that there was ſuch a Manifeſtation of the Son let forth unto them, which was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent into Salvation, elſe, How could they be required to Kiſs him, if he were not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and made manifeſt unto them?

               <p>
                  <q>Chriſt in Scripture is called the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, which was in ſome meaſure made known, or manifeſt in them, though not as to the OUTWARD NAME, yet the Power, Light and Life, p. 58.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>What, though they knew not the <hi>outward Name,</hi> if they knew the Nature, the Spirit, the Life which ſlays Sin and cures the Soul?

And in his <hi>Further Diſcovery,</hi> p. 10. he calls a Friend, <hi>Bold Ignorant Soul,</hi> for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That the Blood which cleanſeth from all Sin <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:108138:16"/>
                  <q>That the knowledge of him [Chriſt] at in the outward, is of neceſſity unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we grant not, ſave ONLY where it is Revealed, and there it is very uſeful and comfortable, p. 117.</q> (Compare with the Quotation out of <hi>Further Diſcovery,</hi> page 16. above.)</p>
               <p>From our common Adverſaries allowing that Children may be ſaved, <hi>G. K.</hi> infers, <q>Why may not alſo ſome Men (who are as it were but Children and Infants, even Babes in Chriſt, as to Spiritual Knowledge) he ſaved without that clear, diſtinct Knowledge of his outward coming, being born of his Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 117.</q> This he ſpeaks of the Gentiles, as will be obvious to any that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Book, for it immediately follows the Quotation above. That which I obſerve is this, That here he allows them to be <hi>Babes in Chriſt, Born of the Spirit;</hi> but in his <hi>Truth Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,</hi> p. 70. <hi>Cornelius</hi> is denied to have <hi>had the Holy Ghoſt in his Gentile State.</hi> Are Babes in Chriſt, who are Born of the Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit? Or is not their Food <hi>Spiritual,</hi> to wit, the <hi>ſincere Milk</hi> of the <hi>Word?</hi> But this Man muſt be made manifeſt: To that end, hear him again.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He [Chriſt] left not the other Nations deſtitute of the MAIN and PRINCIPAL thing, even the manifeſtation of the Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would have given them the Knowledge of God, and of all his Laws and Statutes NEEDFULL to be known by them, had they improved the ſame aright—
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108138:16"/>
And ſeeing it hath been ſo in times paſt, why may it not be ſo now, p. 120.</q> (Let <hi>G. K.</hi> anſwer his own Queſtion, if he can.)</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Though the outward Teachings, which proceed from the Light, are truly profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet are they not of ſuch abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as if God and Chriſt could not be known, where the outward occaſions of hearing are wanting, p. 121.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>G. Keith,</hi> one while aſſerting, that Faith in Chriſt, as he Died, Roſe again, Aſcended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is indiſpenſably neceſſary to all; another while, that Men have been ſaved without it, (which upon what hath been premiſed, I leave with the Reader, whether it hath not been ſufficiently proved upon him) puts me in mind of an <hi>Obſervation</hi> a Friend made, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That he knew not what could palliate it, but the ſtrange Notion of the <hi>Revolution</hi> of <hi>Humane Souls,</hi> which makes it more than probable, that they ſhall have opportunity, one time or other, before the end of the world of <hi>Hearing</hi> this <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> Preached, and may receive it, though now they Die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. But this point (adds he) muſt be <hi>tenderly</hi> touched now, becauſe few are ripe for it; yet how far he <hi>(G. K.)</hi> hath counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced it, is known to many.</q> See <hi>State of the Caſe,</hi> p. 12. Yet I remember alſo, how <hi>ſtoutly G. K.</hi> confuted him, by telling him he was <hi>extreamly Ignorant, had neither the true Faith, nor a true Notion of the ſufficiency of the Light within,</hi> (Further Diſcovery, p. 16.) I ſhall therefore, to avoid his attacking me in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108138:17"/>
like manner, barely give an inſtance or two out of his Book, called <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> and leave it to the Reader to judge.</p>
               <p>His Anſwer to an Objection, That <hi>Adam Died not that day he Sinned, but lived many years after,</hi> he divides into three Heads. His laſt is this, <q>As it is obſerved by ſome, (ſaith he) neither <hi>Adam</hi> nor any of his poſterity living a <hi>compleat thouſand</hi> years, which in Scripture ſignifies ſometimes a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. it may be ſaid, he lived not a whole day, p. 23.</q> Now that this is a Principle of the <hi>Revolutioniſts</hi> is plain to all that know their Principles; and that it is his, is alſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in that he gives it as one of the anſwers to the Objection. What? Can he hold to nothing? But be ſelf-inconſiſtent in every thing?</p>
               <p>Again, p. 42. he ſaith, <q>Who are under the Law, and obey it, according to what their Ability doth reach, they are held there as in a <hi>Cuſtody,</hi> or <hi>place of Safety,</hi> as the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Refuge,</hi> in the time of the Law,</q> till the Faith come to be Revealed. This word [till the Faith come to be Revealed] is a plain indication of his Notion, though he <hi>dare not deſend it;</hi> for they dying in this City of Refuge, when ſhould the Faith be Revealed to them, except in ſome other Revolution?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Some had a meaſure of Sincerity and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, under the Law or Legal Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had not the Faith and Knowledge of Chriſts Death and Reſurrection, and all ſuch were
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108138:17"/>
in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Safety</hi> for that <hi>preſent time,</hi> ſo that had they died in that State, they could not have periſhed, even as the Manſlayer was ſafe in the City of Refuge, p. 43.</q> This is again a Token that he leans to the <hi>Revolutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> whoſe this is, not to the Scriptures, that ſay, <hi>In the place where the tree falleth, there it ſhall be, Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 3.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We do believe, (ſaith he, p. 23.)

               <p>Again p. 54. <q>Is not Chriſts Body a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body, which he hath now in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens?

               <head>Fifthly, <hi>Concerning Water-Baptiſm and the Supper.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>It is ſo hard for <hi>G. K.</hi> to be conſiſtent with himſelf in any thing, that even here he falters. That the Non-obſerving of the <hi>outward</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and Supper, hath been one <hi>Characteriſtick</hi> of our Profeſſion, wherein others have differed from us, they muſt be very little Converſant with us, who do not know. That he once concurred with us, in our Teſtimony relating thereto, is what will appear anon: At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſhall ſhew, how I find him now: For he would now perſuade us, he hath been very eaſie in the point all along. <q>It is known by my former Printed Books, (ſaith he in his <hi>Further Diſcovery,</hi> p. 30.) I have been moderate in my judgment concerning both <hi>Water Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> in the outward uſe of Bread and Wine, chiefly blaming the great formality in Mens pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing theſe things, and reſting in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward practiſe of them, but not univerſally judging or concluding, that God neither did, nor would move any by his Spirit, to practiſe them ſince the Apoſtles days, but rather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it might be poſſible, that ſome were or might be moved.</q> Thus far <hi>G. K.</hi> And in his <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> p. 173. he makes <hi>ſome Poſitions and Queries,</hi> concerning <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>outward Supper,</hi> 
                  <q>tending (as he ſaith) to Love, Peace and Unity among all the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Profeſſors of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108138:19"/>
hold the Head, and build on the true Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and yet differ in ſome leſſer matters.</q> Which whoever pleaſes to beſtow the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, will ſee, whoſe Communion he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to inſinuate himſelf into next, <hi>as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Head, and only differing in ſome leſſer matters,</hi> at the ſame time when no <hi>Epithets</hi> are <hi>black</hi> enough upon his <hi>quondam</hi> Friends, whom he ſometimes boaſts he hath been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 30 years amongſt. For my part I grudge them not ſuch a <hi>Proſelyte,</hi> nor do I think they will be fond of him; but what is before me, is to give the Reader a taſte, that here, as well as in the Inſtances above, the Man is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and fluctuating.</p>
               <p>In p. 183. of <hi>Truth Advanced</hi> qu. 5. he thus interrogates, <q>Whether it may not be ſaid, there is <hi>One</hi> Baptiſm, as that there is one Land called <hi>America;</hi> though the Map or Figure of it is alſo called <hi>America,</hi> even as there is but one <hi>Spiritual Baptiſm</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt, though the <hi>Outward Baptiſm</hi> with Water, is alſo called <hi>Baptiſm?</hi>
                  </q> To this he ſhall make anſwer, out of his Book ſtiled, <hi>Help in the time of need</hi> (Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1665.) p. 65. <q>Though the Scripture declare of this Word, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> yet they are not that Word, more than a Map or Deſcription of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> is <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> or the Image of <hi>Caeſar</hi> is <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or Bread and Wine is the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</q> Here this <hi>Rabbi,</hi> who once boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (in his <hi>Serious Appeal,</hi> p. 29.) <hi>that he hath the Gifts both of ſound Knowledge and Expreſſion,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108138:19"/>
with manifold other Mercies beſtowed on him,</hi> hath foiled himſelf ſorely: This is too conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous not to be ſeen, Darkneſs and Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as reconcileable as theſe two contrary Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. In the one the Map of <hi>America</hi> may paſs for <hi>America,</hi> to uſher in Water-Baptiſm; in the other the Map of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>London</hi> muſt not for <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> in calling the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Word. And why I pray? But that it ſerved his purpoſe in the one caſe, not ſo in the other? This ſhews what Men preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>ſound Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Expreſſion</hi> are; when in Enmity againſt Truth and the ſincere Profeſſors thereof.</p>
               <p>Again in p. 184. of <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> he Queries, <hi>Qu.</hi> 7. <q>Whether being Baptized into the Name of the Lord Jeſus doth always ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie being Baptized into the Power &amp; with the Holy Ghoſt? And Qu. 8. Whether could any Men Baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, or give the Holy Ghoſt, but only the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus?</q> This muſt be deſigned with reſpect to that Command, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>(Go teach all Nations, Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c.) or elſe it were wholly incoherent here. Therefore his Senſe of that Text formerly, I ſhall now confront him with.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We have good ground to believe (ſaith he in <hi>Truths Defence,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1682.) that [by <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 19, 20.] the Spiritual [Baptiſm] only is meant, becauſe it is the Spiritual Baptiſm only, which is called the Baptiſm of Chriſt in Scripture, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly diſtinguiſhed from the Baptiſm of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108138:20"/>
                     <hi>John</hi> with Water, and certainly the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which Chriſt Commanded, was his own Baptiſm, p. 133.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again <q>Whereas he alledgeth, we argue that Water Baptiſm is not meant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. becauſe not expreſt, I ſay, that Baptiſm with Water is not expreſt, nor by any true and juſt conſequence is proved to be meant, p. 134, 135.</q> And in p. 124, (as well as in p. 23. of his <hi>Plain Short Catechiſm,</hi> Printed in <hi>Penſilvania, Anno</hi> 1690.) he hath theſe words, <q>We ſay the Baptiſm of Chriſt is <hi>not</hi> with Water, but with the Holy Ghoſt.</q> Thus much on this Subject: Now to the Supper.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Rector Corrected,</hi> p. 60. he writes thus, <q>It [the Sacramental Eating, ſo called] dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not from the common and ordinary eating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only as to certain Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which do not tye us, nor indeed did tye them, after the Subſtance it ſelf came more clearly to be revealed, which was the Spiritual Coming of Chriſt into their Hearts.</q> 
                  <hi>(Qu.</hi> Could Men be <hi>moved</hi> to it, as was inſtanced out of the <hi>Further Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> p. 30. even now, and no <hi>tye</hi> upon them therein?)</p>
               <p>And in p. 64. <q>If any did not ſee unto the end of it, we are to wait upon them and help them, but not to <hi>Go Back</hi> again unto the Shadow, from the Subſtance—Theſe things being once <hi>buried,</hi> (adds he) are not to be raiſed up again, as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaid of old, touching the Legal Rites and Shadows.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:108138:20"/>
Is this being <hi>moderate in his Judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, chiefly blaming the great formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> &amp;c. to tell People, we are to <hi>help them</hi> forward, <hi>but not go back unto the Shadow,</hi> and to rank them among the <hi>legal Rites and Shadows, and things buried, not to be raiſed up again.</hi> Surely the moſt <hi>poſitive,</hi> could not have given a more <hi>deciſive</hi> Judgment againſt them. But he hath more.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We cannot call it the Lord's Supper (ſaith he) becauſe it is not any Command of the Lord to practiſe it, after or beyond his Spiritual Coming—We dare not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Traditions of Men, as Divine Commandments, p. 65.</q> Is this to moderate again, to <hi>deny</hi> it to be the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and call it the <hi>Traditions of Men, which he dares not obſerve?</hi> Or dares he upon ſecond thoughts, <hi>allow</hi> Men, under the Goſpel, <hi>may be moved to obſerve the Traditions of Men? Paul</hi> was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, when he forbad to <hi>Touch, Taſte</hi> or <hi>Handle</hi> them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 21. But the caſe is altered with <hi>G. K.</hi> he muſt be a <hi>Sect-Maſter</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: That he cannot be among the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and other Profeſſions will not receive him, except he recede from our Principles, touching thoſe two great Ordinances, as they are eſteemed; ſo that he had need be compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent with them, though in contradiction to what he hath formerly aſſerted, that after all his Rovings he may fix ſomewhere, if any will ſo far ſuffer themſelves to be deceived or impoſed upon, as to believe he can be <hi>true</hi> to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108138:21"/>
them, who hath been ſo <hi>falſe</hi> to us, after thirty years Converſe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Truths Defence,</hi> p. 9. <q>We Challenge him (ſaith <hi>G. K.)</hi> to inſtance any one Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinance or Appointment of God, that is truly ſo, which we are againſt: For it is but only <hi>Humane Inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Aboliſhed Shadows,</hi> ſet up as Divine Ordinances, that we oppoſe.</q> And would he now have us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to thoſe Humane Inſtitutions, to thoſe aboliſhed Shadows, which he hath declared to be ſuch? Is this to go forward, or backward?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That time, when Chriſt Suffered, was the the Evening, or laſt part of the Covenant Diſpenſation, wherein he gave them a Sign or Figure, ſuitable to that preſent Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and was not to continue as a binding thing, after the Goſpel-Day or Diſpenſation ſhould clearly break up, p. 139. What Chriſt did at that time, and bid his Diſciples do until he came, is no Goſpel Ordinance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was done in the Night or Evening, of the Old Covenant Diſpenſation, and conſequently was to come to an end with it, although for the weakneſs of ſome, it was continued for a time, until the darkneſs of the legal Diſpenſation ſhould clearly vaniſh, p. 140. That Commemoration of his Death, until he ſhould come, did not oblige them longer, than until that his Coming—We ſay, it is his Spiritual Coming in his Saints, p. 142.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There's an end of it then, if <hi>G. K.</hi> dare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>G. K.</hi> yet the Reader will find <hi>G. K.</hi> of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108138:21"/>
another mind anon, for in his 9th <hi>Poſition</hi> of his Book called, <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> p. 174. wherein he treats concerning <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> for the ſake of ſuch as he (in the <hi>Title Page</hi> thereof) ſays, <hi>held the Head,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet differ in ſome leſſer matters,</hi> he thus hath it, <q>Such Signs and Figures, as do not ſignifie Chriſt to come in the Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but are Memorials and Significations, that he hath already come—May be and are of ſervice to be continued in the Church.</q> And that Water-Baptiſm, as Adminiſtred to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt Jeſus, which he terms <hi>that other Baptiſm, was a Badge of their Chriſtian Faith and Profeſſion,</hi> he tells us before, in his 6th Poſition. This ſhews the Man knows not how to agree with himſelf.</p>
               <p>But he goes on in <hi>Truths Defence,</hi> p. 144, 145. where purſuing his Argument about the taking of Bread and Wine, he ſaith, <q>We cannot find it to be any Goſpel Precept, and therefore we cannot acknowledge it to be neceſſary or profitable to the weakeſt.</q> If neither neceſſary nor profitable to the weakeſt, to whom are they, or what have we to do with them, ſay I? And <q>if they be Shadows, they are no part of the Goſpel Diſpenſation, according to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine,</q> ſaith <hi>G. K.</hi> p 146. and yet even now, as <hi>Memorials</hi> and <hi>Significations</hi> that Chriſt hath already come, they were <hi>of ſervice</hi> to be <hi>continued in the Church.</hi> Reconcile this who can, for it is paſt my skill.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>MAny more Inſtances might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <hi>G. K.</hi> his Contradictions and Inconſiſtencies, but I love not to clog my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who could have been content to have been more brief, than I am. Yet if any will take the pains to trace him, they will find that in the Doctrine of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi> he is the ſame uncertain Man, as in thoſe I have handled, if they read from page 9. to 15. of <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> and compare it with his Book of <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> from page 73. to 79. and from page 105. to the end. Alſo what he ſays of the <hi>Church her coming out of the Wilderneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Glory of this Diſpenſation</hi> (Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1665. in a Book called, <hi>Help in time of need,</hi> from page 55. to the end, which was written (I queſtion not) in a brighter time, than of late he hath known) hath no Analogy or Proportion with what he ſaith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Subject, in his <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> p. 133. to 163. as may be ſeen by comparing them together.</p>
               <p>What remains, is to touch on a few Paſſages of his Book Stiled, <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> not thoſe many ſly falſe and proofleſs Inſinuations, hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly couched as with a ſide-winded blow at us, which he ſeems willing ſhould affect us, yet would guard ſo, that if they fall ſhort and cannot his us, he may come off, and ſay he did not charge upon us, wherewith his Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds; but an Abſurdity or two, whereby
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108138:22"/>
the Mans Spirit may be ſavoured, and the loſs he is come to, by <hi>leaning</hi> to his <hi>own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> may be obvious.</p>
               <p>In p. 16. He oppoſeth as an <hi>Error,</hi> that the <hi>Garden of Paradice, was ſome part of this viſible Earth.</hi> And whereas our Tranſlation hath it, <hi>That God put Man into the Garden to dreſs it, and to keep it,</hi> he finds fault with the word [Dreſs] ſaying p. 18. <hi>That it anſwereth not to the Hebrew, which ſignifieth, to work in it, for it cannot be well underſtood,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that it needed dreſſing after the manner of our common Gardens.</hi> And his Reaſon is, <hi>Man's Food, both for his Soul and Body, was to have been Paradiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:</hi> but the Probation of both is to ſeek. To this I ſhall only object, What <hi>Work</hi> hath a man to do in a Garden, if not to <hi>dreſs</hi> it, and if the Garden had been no part of this viſible Earth, what work had there been to do there? Surely if this viſible Earth were made for Man, he was not always to live in another Region above.</p>
               <p>So p. 21. He tells us, <q>Though God made Man of the Duſt of the Ground, yet that Duſt was not common Duſt, but much more pure and refined, than that of which the Bodies of Men ſince the Fall were made of.</q> This ſhews he loves to be a <hi>Dictator,</hi> and thinks well of his own Notions, but proof he gives none, knowing it is eaſier to aſſert than prove: nor when he ſaith, p. 26. <hi>That the Beaſts of the Field are the Fallen Angels,</hi> have we any more than his ſay ſo for it, which conſidering how often he hath ſaid and unſaid, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108138:23"/>
above, will not go a great way, with ſuch as well know him.</p>
               <p>He alſo accounts it as an <hi>Error</hi> to aſſert, <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>were naked before the Fall,</hi> ſaying, <hi>it is no where ſo affirmed in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and makes nakedneſs the Fruit of <q>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were not aſhamed of their Nakedneſs, doth not (adds he) imply their <hi>Innocency,</hi> but rather their <hi>Impudency,</hi> and too great boldneſs that they had after the Fall, <hi>See</hi> p. 24. 25.</q> To this I ſay the Scripture give us an account of their eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the forbidden Fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. and in the next Verſe of an effect thereof thus, <hi>And the Eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they ſewed Fig leaves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made themſelves Aprons,</hi> v. 7. What ſign or token of <hi>Impudence</hi> is it in People, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cover their Nakedneſs? But here was the difference between their two States; before their Fall they were Innocent, <hi>They were both naked, and were not aſhamed,</hi> chap. 2. 25. after the Fall, <hi>they knew that they were naked, and ſewed Fig leaves,</hi> &amp;c. chap. 3. 7. <hi>and hid themſelves,</hi> v. 8. whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed both <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He goes on and Expounds <hi>their hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves among the Trees of the Garden, to be in a Tree of the Garden:</hi> and that <hi>one Tree may be well underſtood to be the Divine Mercy or Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> ſaith he, p. 25. But how got they thither, ſay I? The <hi>Divine Mercy is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and if they were got there, methinks <hi>when they heard the Voice of the Lord God walking in the Garden,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:108138:23"/>
they ſhould not have been <hi>afraid,</hi> for they were already ſafe. But his whimſical Notions <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o interfere, as doth their <hi>Author.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as to their Clothing, he tells you what that was, if ye can believe him, <q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, ſaith he, p. 27. the Man and his Wife by Sin, had contracted a two-fold Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, one of the Soul, the other of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or one inward, the other outward, he provided a Clothing to both, Clothing them inwardly with the Righteouſneſs of the Lamb; and Clothing them outwardly with the Skin and Fleſh of this Frail, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and Corruptible Body.</q> 
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Did he Cloth them with the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and yet at the ſame time debar them <hi>acceſs</hi> to the <hi>Tree of Life.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 21. 22. What ſtrange Doctrine is this? I thought, whoever were Clothed with the Lamb's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had right to the Tree of Life. This is Doctrinally unſound, the other Monſtrous, that we ſhould have a Body a top of a Body, and Clothes over them. But it ſeems the firſt Body had no <hi>Skin,</hi> for Skin he gives as the additional Clothing: Query, Whether it had <hi>Belly, Guts</hi> and <hi>Draught,</hi> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Reſurrection Bodies to have, p. 111. or whether it had need, if its Food was to be Paradiſical.</p>
               <p>In p. 28. He is for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mending (or marring) our Tranſlation again. The word <hi>Rib</hi> he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>Side.</hi>

                  </gap> them that think it was after the Fall: <q>From all which they conclude, ſaith he, that the Woman being ſeparated from the Man was a conſequent of the Fall, and that therefore it was not good that Man ſhould be alone, <hi>to wit,</hi> that his Wife ſhould remain barren in him; for the effect of their Fall was ſuch, that they could not multiply their Species in one Body, as they mought have done, if the Fall had not been. And ſo as to that manner of propagating their Species or Kind, they became unfit &amp; unfruitful, which is by way of Allegory expreſt by ſome My ſtick Writers, that their Backs were joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and their Faces averted, <hi>i. e.</hi> turned the one from the other; but when they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, their Faces were ſet one to the other according to the words in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18.</q> 
                  <hi>I will make him an help, as before him,</hi> i. e. Face to Face, ſo the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſee p. 28. 29.

Now although he ſeems averſe to anſwer us in Print, where he hath abuſed us, alledging <hi>want of time and ability of outward Eſtate,</hi> yet inaſmuch as he is ſtill as induſtrious, to make us a deriſion to Fools, if he can, or to ſtir up the Populace againſt us, ſurely it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming us, to wipe off his <hi>Obloquy</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,</hi> and declare what the Man himſelf thought, when he was more himſelf, and leſs agitated with Paſſion and Prejudice. This is the ſcope, this the aim of my preſent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, not in ill will or vindictiveneſs to the Man, but in defence of Truth and the Friends thereof, which he hath calumniated.</p>

            <head>A POSTCRIPT, BY G. W.</head>
            <p n="1">1. HAD we firſt Condemned <hi>George Keith</hi> in Print, as <hi>Guilty of groſs Errour, Hypocriſie, Unbelief,</hi> and afterward in Print Challenged and Summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to a publick Tryal before us, at a Meeting appointed in our own time and place, without his Privity or Concurrence, as he has done by ſome of us, he and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108138:25"/>
others more indifferent, (who better know common Law and Juſtice than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) might have juſtly reflected upon us, as very Arbitrary and Unjuſt Judges, to be thus prepoſterous and extra-judicial in firſt Condemning, and then Summoning Men to Tryal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Had we for ſome weeks aforehand raked in <hi>George Keith</hi>'s Books to pick out Matters againſt him, and only given him a General Charge of <hi>moſt Erroneous and hurtful Principles,</hi> (or of his ſelf Contradictions or Calumnies againſt us) <hi>contrary to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legion,</hi> and then in Print, Advertiſement and Summons to a publick Trial, (i. e. <hi>to hear himſelf Charged and Proved Guilty)</hi> without ſo much as affording him any Copy of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of his Indictment or Charge before Trial, or of the Books and Pages referred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to therein, (for a due preparation to anſwer) as he has done againſt us, I am perſwaded he would not be ſo ſerved or ſurprized, but might have juſtly deemed this procedure ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unfair, <hi>precipitant,</hi> and unjuſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All which undue, Arbitrary, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudicial Proceedings, and new Court of Judicature, as erected by <hi>George Keith,</hi> I with the reſt of my Friends and Brethren concerned, both as <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> have refuſed and rejected, and do proteſt againſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108138:26"/>
the ſame, as unwarrantable both in the ſight of God and juſt Men: As <hi>Chriſtians</hi> we are not to be ſubject to <hi>George Keiths,</hi> Summons without God's Call, nor allowed to gratifie his Ambitious, Contentious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or ſuch as cauſe Diviſions or Offences, <hi>&amp;c. As Men,</hi> we are obliged to have reſpect to the Civil Government and Peace, and not to Countenance or Abet Strife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in any Publick Meeting, tending to Diviſions and Confuſions, contrary to the Intent of the Law it ſelf, which is Enacted, <hi>For the Eaſe and Liberty of Diſſenting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Subjects in the exerciſe of Religion and Religious Worſhip,</hi> in order <hi>to unite them in Intereſt and Affection,</hi> (as the Words and Reaſon of the Statute are) for which end, only Meetings and Meeting Houſes are tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, and entred on Record, and not for Stages of Contention.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The firſt point in Difference between <hi>George Keith</hi> and my ſelf, that I remember, and which I was really diſſatisfied with, was, his Notion of <hi>Twelve Revolutions</hi> (or Tranſmigrations) <hi>of Humane Soulr, (whether of all or ſome of them) paſſing out of one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into another to have Twelve Intervals of Life, to accompliſh one thouſand years on Earth;</hi> Arguing from theſe Scriptures <hi>John</hi> 11. 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. and ſome others, if I miſtake not; if he ſays I do, let him give us a plain State of his own Notion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108138:26"/>
herein, which as I underſtood him, was according to ſome paſſages in the Book of Two Hundred Queries, concerning that Opinion <hi>of the Revolution of humane Souls.</hi> For which Notion, I am ſure he argued in a Book of his in Manuſcript, which he ſhewed me before he went over into <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and then would have had it Printed, but I then (in diſlike to it, and love to him) diſſwaded him from Printing it, yet he told me ſince his return, he had brought it over with him, but I ſuppoſe is afraid to Print it with his Name to it; how he has covertly Writ and Diſcourſed in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Notion of the Revolutions, or varied about it, he (and ſome others) knows.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I am not conſcious to my ſelf of Errour, either in <hi>Reference to the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Chriſt's Satisfaction (or Sacrifice) or his viſible coming again in his Glorified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> (without us) <hi>to raiſe the Dead at the great day of Judgment,</hi> or of having <hi>denied</hi> the ſame, as he has in that and other things unjuſtly accuſed and aſperſed me in two of his late Pamphlets; The one ſtyled, <hi>A True Copy,</hi> p. 31. and the other, <hi>Groſs Errour,</hi> p. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. I ſay, I am not conſcious of denying Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again without us, in his Spiritual Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By my Queſtioning ſome Anabaptiſts (as <hi>William Burnet</hi> and <hi>John

And to prove me Guilty of <hi>Unbelief,</hi> becauſe I ſaid, <hi>We do not Read of a Third coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh, yet to be expected;</hi> Hereupon ſeems his moſt colourable Charge againſt me, but I think it no more proves me <hi>an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer</hi> in this point than himſelf; for our not Reading of a third coming of Chriſt <hi>in the Fleſh,</hi> only Queſtions ſuch a manner of his Coming, and proves not me Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Unbelief</hi> of his Coming in a more excellent manner, <hi>viz. in great Glory in hir Spiritual Glorious Body;</hi> For <hi>George Keith</hi> has confeſſed the Body of Chriſt <hi>to be wonderfully charged as to the mode and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its being, it being no more a Body of Fleſh, Blood, and Bones, but a pure Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real or Heavenly Body, like unto which the Bodies of the Saints are to be at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> (Way caſt up, page 131.) <hi>and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued altogether with Heavenly Qualities; The Husk or Dreſſy part not the true Body,</hi> &amp;c. as more fully in his Book, ſtiled, <hi>Groſs Error,</hi> p. 9, 13. Now if Chriſt's Glorious Body <hi>be no more a Body of Fleſh, Blood

and Bones,</hi> (as <hi>George Keith</hi> ſaith) How ſhould his Coming a third time in the Fleſh, or in a Body <hi>of Fleſh and Blood,</hi> &amp;c. be expected again, to be ſeen by the World with their Carnal Eyes, or Eyes of Fleſh.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>George Keith</hi>'s formerly Writing and Arguing againſt the continuance of <hi>Water-Baptiſm, Altogether denying it to be commanded to the Apoſtles by Chriſt,</hi> Matt. 28. and being <hi>but a Shadow buried with other Shadows, not to be raiſed up again,</hi> in a Book Intituled, <hi>Quakeriſm Confirmed,</hi> Printed 1676. <hi>Sec.</hi> 6. And his lately Writing and Arguing for the continuance of <hi>Water-Baptiſm, as a badge of Believers Chriſtian Faith and Profeſſion, and of Service to be continued in the Church by true Chriſtians under the Goſpel,</hi> in his Book, Intituled, <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> Printed 1694. p. 173, 174, 175, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such his Wavering, Variation, Uncertainty, and Inconſiſtency, together with his great Envy in repreach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in his Printed Books, contrary to his own former Teſtimonies in Print, ſhews he is now <hi>no Quaker,</hi> nor Friend (but Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary) to the People called <hi>Quakers.</hi> Both <hi>John Whitehead, William Penn,</hi> my ſelf, and divers other Friends, have patiently ſuffered under <hi>G. K.</hi>'s Abuſe, and Miſrepreſentations in Print for ſometime, I having writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, to clear my Conſcience in great plainneſs, for which I ſuppoſe he Envies me the more, I have hitherto forborn (and do
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108138:28"/>
yet forbear) to publiſh an Anſwer to detect him. He being fallen into other Hands to deal with him, and Load him with his own Fruitleſs Work, (for I find it no great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to Anſwer him) And I believe that they (i. e. <hi>T. Ellwood,</hi> and <hi>J. Penigton)</hi> have Conſcientiouſly Oppoſed and Obviated his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious Attempts even about divers of thoſe points Charged by him againſt us. We now wait to ſee where he will Center, after all his Hovering, Waverings, Turnings, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to Gratifie our Adverſaries.</p>
