            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>A Modern Wit, (so swift his Notions ran)</l>
               <l>Describ'd the Patron first, then nam'd the Man,</l>
               <l>Whose wide spread Character high rais'd in Fame,</l>
               <l>Did the great <hi>Dorset</hi> to the World proclaim.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:58805:3"/>Here I, my Lord, might diff'rent Tracks pursue,</l>
               <l>And praise as great a <hi>Dorset</hi>—but by naming you.</l>
               <l>Let others—for poor Gain the first resign,</l>
               <l>And seek new Patrons, you alone are mine.</l>
               <l>My Muse feels native Pride, and flatters none,</l>
               <l>But once enjoying you, she's yours alone.</l>
               <l>Yours—for 'tis you, my Lord, she dares to boast,</l>
               <l>The most a Courtier, yet above it most.</l>
               <l>Thus, well distinguish'd from the rest of Men,</l>
               <l>You slight the Feather, but command the Pen,</l>
               <l>With this my willing Temper does comply;</l>
               <l>Wholly my Patron, you, as much your Poet, I.</l>
               <l>Strait would my <hi>Genius</hi> flag, nor could I raise</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:58805:3"/>To Undesert a Pile of sordid Praise.</l>
               <l>I cannot bend too low my suppliant Mould,</l>
               <l>Nor flatter Fortune's Sons for servile Gold:</l>
               <l>Unaw'd, my Muse, to seek your Favour flies,</l>
               <l>Resolv'd to perish, or resolv'd to rise.</l>
               <l>Blest is her Choice, grown conscious now of You,</l>
               <l>At once our <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Mecaenas</hi> too.</l>
               <l>'Tis here, her firm Allegiance she assures,</l>
               <l>No proud Superiour your Desert endures,</l>
               <l>The Field of Wit, as well as War is yours.</l>
               <l>Whilst you protect me, who shall dare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy!</l>
               <l>Not the <hi>Palladium</hi> better guarded <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I fear no Force illnatur'd Criticks raise,</l>
               <l>I have their Envy, and despise their Praise,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:58805:4"/>What here I offer, you alone can claim,</l>
               <l>An Angel couch'd in <hi>Florimena's</hi> Name,</l>
               <l>And sure 'tis yours, to guard your Lady's Fame.</l>
               <l>To you alone her Character is due,</l>
               <l>As she alive belong'd alone to you.</l>
               <l>But no one Sphere has <hi>Phoebus</hi> Rays confin'd;</l>
               <l>Her radiant Lustre shone on all Mankind.</l>

               <l>She was what Woman could be— she was yours.</l>
               <l>This, to end all Debates, of force may serve,</l>
               <l>Who could charm CUTTS, indeed must all deserve.</l>
               <l>She must be more—tho' to a wonder fair;</l>
               <l>Possest of double Pow'rs, who conquers there.</l>
               <l>Forgive, my Lord, the transports of my Mind,</l>
               <l>This you would pardon, could you search be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</l>
               <l>

               <l>All I can keep, I do; but that ran ore,</l>

               <l>You and your Merits dash the Poet's Hand,</l>
               <l>You slight our Praise, yet those our Praise command.</l>

               <l>My humble Genius no great State assumes,</l>
               <l>Nor sends to tell she will, before she comes.</l>
               <l>My Visit now your Presence dares demand,</l>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IAm now I suppose, Gentlemen, (Criticks I mean) about to write a Letter to you; but I presume you expect no loving Billet at my hands: for I must own I have no very tender Passion for you, neither do I design to court you; and if I ever humble my self before ye with the least show of Adoration, it must be thro' meer Fear, as <hi>Indians</hi> (damning themselves through dread of being damn'd) pay a blind Worship to the Devil. I must confess I have yet had no very particular Reason for attacking you; I wage War against you only as the common Enemy; who, like
<pb facs="tcp:58805:6"/>
the noted Pyrats, make prize of all you meet. But mine I conceive you thought so small a Sail, as was not worth a Chace. Thence 'tis my Quarrel with you rises, for the Muses are, like <hi>Russian</hi> Wives, never well satisfied, till beaten; and a Poet takes a Blow from a Critick for as great a Favour as he would from a Mistress. He must be indeed of very little Force whom you would not endeavour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm; and to take no notice of a young Lady, (who with a charming Assurance, sets up for a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) is an Affront sufficient. Wit is like Courage, and all young Poets, like young Souldiers, catch at first occasions to make it known they have it; should no Provocations be of force to make the one draw his Pen, or the other his Sword, they must be indeed too cool to feel the Fire of Fancy or of Valour. For my part I think 'tis fittest for me to oppose you now, while the Body of my Forces is yet intire, for I shall be able to make but small Resistance, when you have strain'd, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously disjointed the tender Limbs of my Muse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rack of Criticism; and tho there may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be no Action for a while, 'tis (as our late good Friends the <hi>French</hi> have sometimes prov'd) no small Advantage, first to take the Field, and
<pb facs="tcp:58805:6"/>
with an early Fury open the Campaign. On this Consideration I thought it best to draw a Circle round me, ere the Spirit was rais'd. and indeed this course seems strictly necessary here; for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Critick is a Devil which all the Charms of Verse want power to lay. 'Tis now my business to observe where I lie most open to you in this last Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I may the better parry your Thrusts, and stand upon my guard as much as possible.</p>
            <p>As to my former Poem call'd <hi>The Triumphs of Peace,</hi> I know nothing that has offer'd which requires my Defence, and I think it has been so little read, that its own bound Cover has been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Safeguard, and the Poet as well as the Poem triumphs only perhaps by being unassaulted. I have heard indeed that some have said they kuew not what to make of it, and I confess I am apt to believe them; but I can no more make them Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, than they can make me a Writer. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self, and with reason enough, that Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tate,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> were pleas'd to like it, but above all, that it was honour'd with the signal Approbation of its Patron, whom (and I have convincing Reasons to fix me in the opinion) I believe not at all inferiour in Wit to
<pb facs="tcp:58805:7"/>
either of the Former, nor to the Latter in Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As to the present Poem, if his Lordship shall please to accept and patronize that too, I shall here likewise have my Ends accomplish'd; for 'tis design'd intire his Lordship's, as was the late bright Subject, who has giv'n the sad Occasion. But if it miss the wish'd Success, there are but six Days lost, for I can produce unquestion'd Witness, that within the Limits of that time I wrote it, nor did I sit up labouriously at it, like those who made the Mourning for her Ladyship's Relations, tho I must own 'twas finished without any great Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, which gives me some Hopes that it máy all be of a piece. I must take leave to say too, (so large a Field such copious Merits gave me) that it flow'd from me easie, free, and unconstrain'd, as from her Ladyship's Acquaintance did their Tears. Thence 'tis that the mourning Muse grown fond of her own Melody, has sung so long an Ode. However, long as it is, Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> belov'd for his Candour, as much as for his Wit admir'd, was pleas'd not only to approve, but greatly to commend it, in having read it thrice. The Stile is Pindarical, or at least, that which is vulgarly call'd so; 'tis of the same Libertine sort,

tho' not such, as Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> was so successful in; but indeed it deserves not to be thought even an Imitation of <hi>Pindar;</hi> for in all his Odes there was a constant Measure certainly observ'd; and tho' the Number of every Verse was not answer'd by the immediately succeeding Line, yet infallibly 'twas answer'd with an harmonious Disposition in some other in the Stanza, it was the artful Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that his Genius kept, which made him appear so much at liberty, and his Muse, tho' fetter'd, with such Grace danc'd to the Musick of her own Chains, she seem'd to have her freedom. Thus, soaring so irregularly high, on that account in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I may be said to have out flown even <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar.</hi> 'Tis no easie Task for the Muse constantly to beat her aiery Wings in Fancy's middle Region, and yet to seem to the Beholders still to rise: Her Flight is to be perform'd like that of <hi>Daedalus,</hi> she's to be born up but by a constant Motion, and not only to shun the Ocean, the Abyss of Thought, but even the Heats of a too scorching Sun; tho' <hi>Phoebus</hi> is the God inspires her: But mine, yet artless, and making but her second Iourney thro' the Air, like <hi>Icarus,</hi> perhaps might miss her way; her Wings, like his, being only wax'd. Unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:58805:8"/>
as she is, she flyes undaunted; for she esteems it better to have dar'd to rise, than not at all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it. She chose therefore that Style, whose rapid Current might bear her up the best; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this mournful Theam (in my opinion) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd such Numbers most, Numbers resembling the late bright Subject which has caus'd them, where awful Lustre shone at once, and tender Beauty warm'd. Pastoral may seem to some to have been most proper here, that is indeed the common Mode of writing, and had the Subject here been common, I should have chosen it too; but 'tis a Path so worn already, that no Genius, less than that of the admirable Author of <hi>Pastora,</hi> can, without servilely following others Tracks, with any pleasure tread; and if he deviates from it, he may err; besides Pastoral only begs our Pity, but Pindarick forces. I shall now offer only this in respect of the present and the former Poem. To abuse the Poet, doubtless you may be apt to reflect upon his Muses; now I confess in both, I have been very familiar with them, nor quitted them till the very end; should I go about to excuse my self, I could urge that Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> says: calling frequently on the Aid of the Muses,
<pb facs="tcp:58805:8"/>
is a Liberty Pindarick can hardly live without; but if you are angry that I have made use of all of them at once, I'll only answer, 'Tis better to have them all, than (like you, when you pretend to write) to have none. When the Muses Statues were to be made, they were at first design'd but Three, but the Artist making Nine, (intending that the three most beautiful should be chosen,) found all too charming for any one to be deny'd, and sure the Muses should themselves be favour'd rather than their Statues: But this, Gentlemen, I suppose won't take with you, who, I dare be bold to promise, will never raise a Statue to a Muse.</p>

            <head>THE MUSE To the PATRON.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>Tempora mutantur, &amp; nos mutamur in illis. — Haec olim meminisse juvabit.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <lg>
               <l>BEhold, my Son, these mourning Robes I use,</l>
               <l>To shew my Grief for your departed Mufe.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:58805:46"/>To Shades, ah! Too, too melancholy gone,</l>
               <l>Your Muse, your Mistress, and your Wife in one.</l>
               <l>I, who have long been woo'd, and won by you,</l>
               <l>Sue in my turn, —then hear me while I sue.</l>
               <l>The Soul should seldom with its Wants comply,</l>
               <l>Who faintly asks, but teaches to deny.</l>
               <l>Still should Wit's Cause be pleaded by the fair,</l>
               <l>The rising Poet is the Muses care.</l>
               <l>'Tis you, whose Bays with branching Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels grow,</l>
               <l>My best-lov'd Son, the Muse addresses now.</l>
               <l>Beneath their shade, as a secure retreat,</l>
               <l>Afford my new-born Child an humble Seat,</l>
               <l>Fenc'd from the rude Insults of an impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Fate.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58805:46"/>A Poet's Name he to your Fame does owe,</l>
               <l>Yet now he sues to be no longer so.</l>
               <l>Or first, or last, all do my Charms despise,</l>
               <l>I make them witty oft, but seldom wise.</l>
               <l>'Tis true, in Numbers still he feels Delight,</l>
               <l>He has a Genius: Born, and loves to write.</l>
               <l>But he repines, that Custom ill has made</l>
               <l>A lib'ral Art a mercenary Trade.</l>
               <l>None, but <hi>immortal Dryden,</hi> nobly vain,</l>
               <l>Great in his fancy'd Empire of Disdain,</l>
               <l>Felt Rage enough, and Courage only to sustain.</l>
               <l>But here this tend'rer Off-spring faintly sings,</l>
               <l>With infant Voice, and flys with feebler Wings.</l>
               <l>Approaching Storms he dreads, nor can he bear</l>
               <l>The furious Blasts of a malignant Air.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:58805:47"/>The Poet's Title he would now disown,</l>
               <l>Or rather boast it but for you alone.</l>
               <l>By you, and only you, (my Heir) 'twas given,</l>
               <l>That Mankind knows me to be sprung from Heaven.</l>
               <l>You, whose sublimest Genius reach'd the height,</l>
               <l>Whence first I flew, and track'd my sacred flight.</l>
               <l>Wisely to you does my new Off spring sue,</l>
               <l>Of all Mankind, he would serve chiefly you.</l>
               <l>If Verse has Charms, 'tis now they must prevail,</l>
               <l>Too well he knows all lost, if here he fail.</l>
               <l>You 'tis he claims, nor shall he poorly strive</l>
               <l>For any other Patron—CUTTS alive.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:58805:47"/>But hold,—I find I must not dare to raise,</l>
               <l>Nor clap my joyful Wings to spread your Praise.</l>
               <l>The bashful Poet does my Suppliant stand,</l>
               <l>And gently checks me with his trembling Hand.</l>
               <l>So pure his Flames.—And they who love the best,</l>
               <l>Know what they feel can never be exprest.</l>
               <l>Warm are his Thoughts, as warm his new Desires,</l>
               <l>Yet bear no vain, or vast, ambitious Fires.</l>
               <l>To you, his gen'rous Patron, lost, he flies,</l>
               <l>On you builds humble Hopes, on you relies.</l>
               <l>Nor rose his Wishes, since they first began,</l>
               <l>Above the Poet, or beneath the Man.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:58805:48"/>He courts no transient Present from your Hands,</l>
               <l>'Tis here his nobler Expectation stands.</l>
               <l>He would your Favours from your Choice derive,</l>
               <l>Pleas'd, he receives what you are pleas'd to give.</l>
               <l>But if your gen'rous Temper doubts to choose,</l>
               <l>The Poet's Mind lyes open to the Muse.</l>
               <l>Most fond he courts what you can best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow,</l>
               <l>For most he serves himself, in serving you,</l>
               <l>Not that his Merits any Claim can boast,</l>
               <l>But Favours nere in grateful Souls are lost.</l>
               <l>All have their prosp'rous Hours, he courts the Time;</l>
               <l>Want of Success is ever charg'd a Crime;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:58805:48"/>To make it certain who the Charm can raise!</l>
               <l>He asks of Heaven, and when it grants, gives Praise.</l>
               <l>Let not the happy view his Wreck with Scorn,</l>
               <l>He was, like them, to flowing Plenty born.</l>
               <l>His Scene of Life seem'd all serene as theirs,</l>
               <l>With blooming Fortunes in his blooming Years.</l>
               <l>Then flourishing Ioys did on his Senses fall;</l>
               <l>But—when War's Thunder broke, it blasted all.</l>
               <l>On you, my Son, he owns his Hope must stand,</l>
               <l>Nor would be rais'd by any vulgar Hand.</l>
               <l>Tho' I, the Muse, thro' wilful Tracks have hurl'd,</l>
               <l>And snatch'd him hence to my aërial World,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:58805:49"/>Like the fam'd Eagle, prosp'rous may I prove,</l>
               <l>Who bore up pale the trembling Youth above,</l>
               <l>And fixt his happy Seat, plac'd in the Courts of <hi>Iove.</hi>
               </l>
