         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65029:2"/>AS there ought to be nothing dearer to any man than his own Soul, nor any thing more heeded by him on this ſide the Grave, than its eternal Salvation; ſo I bleſs my GOD that he hath for ſeveral Years touched my Heart with a ſence of this, as well as the Sins of my Life; which put me upon frequent and diligent Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Articles of the Chriſtian Religion, wherewith I was ſeaſoned from my Youth, according to the Doctrine and Communion of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> The more I looked into the Doctrines of Tranſubſtantiation, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Invocation of Saints, Indulgences, and Worſhipping of Images, the more Scruples aroſe in my Mind, and the rather, becauſe I could find no ſolid Foundation for them in the SCRIPTURE, (which I thought could beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me what I ought to Believe for my Salvation, tho' thoſe of my Sort in that Communion are not allowed the uſe of them) nor yet in the Three CREEDS, in which I found all allowed the Doctrines of Salvation to be ſumm'd up. I took ſeveral opportunities to diſcourſe of theſe Points, as well with thoſe of the Clergy of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as with others whom I thought know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Principles of that Church, ſincerely deſiring to learn the Truth, for the eternal Welfare of my Soul: But I found their Defences of thoſe Doctrines Unſatisfactory, and my own Scruples againſt them to gather ſtrength up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. I then applied myſelf privately to diſcourſe them with ſome of the Clergy, and others, of the Communion of the PROTESTANT CHURCH, and to look into ſome Books of thoſe Writers; and thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came confirmed in my Diſ-believe of thoſe Doctrines. Theſe and ſuch-like Thoughts, and Communications, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in me a ſence of Duty, that I ought to joyn myſelf with the CHURCH of CHRIST, holding only the true ancient Catholick Faith; which I am convinced the

CHURCH of GOD, whereof <hi>Your Lordſhip</hi> is one of the Spiritual Guides, does. But then the Cenſures and Inconveniencies, as to Worldly Reſpects, I ſaw I ſhould expoſe myſelf unto, retarded me. And when I diſcourſed at any time any ſuch the leaſt Inclinations, I met with the Tears and Entreaties of many of my Relations to ſtop me, and the Flouts and Menaces of others to deter me. But I bleſs GOD, who has at length born me above all thoſe Diſcouragements, and made my Salvation the love of Truth, as it is in JESUS and the inward Peace of my CONSCIENCE (convinced of my Errours and my Sins) dearer to me than all Secular Reſpects.</p>
