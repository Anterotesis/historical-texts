         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Volume of the <hi>Lives</hi> of Ten Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Ministers of Jesus Christ, and
of some other Christians. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of my former Labours in
this kinde, hath encouraged me to
make some further progress herein.
We see how diligent the <hi>Papists</hi> have been to write and
publish the <hi>Lives</hi> of their <hi>Rome-canonized</hi> Saints,
though most of them were but <hi>Ignes fatui</hi> that led men
into Boggs of Errour, or <hi>blinde leaders of the blinde,</hi>
as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were in our Saviours time, till <hi>both
fell into the ditch:</hi> How much more diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
should we be, to perpetuate the Memories of those
who were fixed Stars, not in the <hi>Antichristian,</hi> but in
the true Church of Christ: And truly, if any Church
in the Christian world, since the Reformation, much
more (through Gods great mercy) hath the Church
of <hi>England</hi> abounded with such: And now what
doth the Lord require of us, but that <hi>we should be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of those,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 12.</note> 
               <hi>who through faith and patience
inherit the Promises.</hi> Good examples are for imitation,
bad for evitation. Good examples put a kinde of life
<pb facs="tcp:62956:3"/>
into men: Even tired Jades seeing other Horses to
gallop, will easily be put into a gallop also; and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
shews, that its a good means for our quickning,
duely to observe the examples of such as have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in godlinesse, according to that of the Apostle,
Phil. 3. 17. <hi>Mark them which walk so as you have us
for an example.</hi> Its the Spirits end in guiding some
men in the right way, and that eminently, that by their
walking therein, they might excite others to follow them:
And its also a special end of Regestring the Histories of
the Saints departed,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> 
               <hi>For whatsoever was written
aforetime, was written for our learning;</hi> and this is
the best learning which we can reap from such Records,
to imitate their Excellencies, and (if it be possible) to
outstrip them therein. God in his wisdome hath not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestred
them, that they should be known onely as matter of
Story for our delight, but for our direction and imitation;
and to shew that the things which he requires of us are
possible, seeing they have been done by others before us;
as also to shew the way and means more plainly how to
do them, and to declare how gratefull and acceptable
they are when done. For the Scriptures are not penned
altogether in a commanding stile, but have sweet allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Examples mingled with the Precepts. There are
four wayes (saith an eminent Divine) of teaching,<note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Sibb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
               </note> Rule,
Reason, Similitudes, and Examples: The two former
enjoyn, but work not upon the affections; and as for
Smilitudes, they are for illustration, onely Examples
conform us in a sweet alluring manner; and that we may
receive good from good Examples, these Rules are to be
observed:</p>
            <p>1. We must eye and pry into them, which is the very
<pb facs="tcp:62956:3"/>
end why God hath left us a continuall succession of good
Examples.</p>
            <p>2. We must eye them, not to observe their weaknesses,
to discover their shame, for this is a poysonous disposition;
neither may we observe them thereby to take liberty to the
flesh, from what is amiss in them; but we must eye them, as
we look into Glasses, to dress, and adorn our selves thereby.</p>
            <p>3. We must eye them for imitation: We must look
upon the best, and the best in the best. We must not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
our selves with those who are inferiour to us in
Gifts and Graces: For he that thinks himself good by
comparison is not good at all.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 1.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Brethren,
be ye followers of me, even as I am of Christ:</hi> He
propounded to himself, the most excellent pattern of all,
even of Christ himself, and he blamed the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
because they <hi>measured themselves by themselves,</hi>
2 Cor. 10. 12.</p>
            <p>4. We must labour for soft and sanctified hearts; for
a stony heart will receive no impression.</p>
            <p>5. We must look to every one that hath any good thing
worthy imitation: For in every Christian there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
imitable; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> longed to see the
<hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>he might be comforted by their faith,</hi>
Rom. 1. 12.</p>
            <p>6. Lastly, In things concerning which there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rule to direct us, we ought to imitate the Examples
of the most holy and sober Christians, as in the fashion of
our apparrel, the length of our hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as good examples are very profitable, so there is
much danger in those that are evil, which by reason of the
corruption of our natures, are great incentives, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
to sin. <hi>Nemo errat uni sibi, sed dementiam
<pb facs="tcp:62956:4"/>
spargit in proximos, accipitque invicem,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca.</hi>
No man erres to himself also, but disperseth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
his folly to his Neighbours alone, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
receiveth the like from them. And as evil
Examples are hurtfull in all, so they are most pernicious in
superiours: For seldome do these tall Cedars fall, but they
beat down all the low shrubs about them. Thus Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
by their evil example corrupt their subjects, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
their children, Masters their servants, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Princes their people, seeing all the Country, either for
fear or flattery, is apt to conform to their Examples. <hi>Ea
conditio est Principis, ut quicquid faciat, praecipere
videatur,</hi> saith <hi>Quintilian.</hi> Princes actions stand for
precepts, and their examples have the power of a Law to
draw their subjects to imitation. As the <hi>Heliotrope</hi>
moves after the Sun, so do subjects follow the manners of
their Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur Orbis.
Alexander</hi> the Great used to carry his head on the one
side, whereupon his Nobles and Courtiers in imitation of
him did the like. The common people (saith one) are like
a flock of Cranes, as the first flyes all the rest follow after;
or as a Beast, where all the body follows the Head. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
sins do much hurt, as by imputation—<hi>Delirant
Reges,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.</note> 
               <hi>plectuntur Achivi,</hi> so by imitation; For man is
an Apish creature, apter to be led by his eyes, than by his
ears. <hi>Magis intuentur quid fecerit</hi> Jupiter, <hi>quam quid
docuit</hi> Plato, satth St. <hi>Augustine.</hi> Height of place ever
addes two wings to sin, Example and Scandal, whereby
it soars higher, and flyes much farther. Oh therefore how
cautious should Rulers be lest they be <hi>partakers of other
mens sins,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 22. They have enough of their own
<pb facs="tcp:62956:4"/>
to answer for. <hi>Potentes potentèr torquebuntur.</hi> Let
them take heed lest the <hi>iniquity of their heels</hi> (of those
that follow them at heels) <hi>doth compass them about,</hi>
Psal. 49. 5.</p>
            <p>And as the evil examples of Great ones are very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious,
so are their good examples very profitable: Such
as were the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> such were the subjects; like
Prince, and <hi>like Priest, like people.</hi> Before <hi>Vespati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
time the <hi>Romans</hi> were grown to great excess, and
profuseness in their apparrel, houshold stuffe, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
having by their Conquest of the <hi>East,</hi> learned the
<hi>Eastern</hi> vices; and though many good Laws were made
against it, yet could they not be restrained: But so soon
as he came to the Empire, being a sober, moderate, and
temperate Prince himself, all that former vanity grew
out of fashion.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant how some of late have endeavoured
to bespatter, and to bring an <hi>Odium</hi> upon the Names of
some of our former Worthies (whose Lives I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
published) as though they were <hi>Fanaticks, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi>
(because they would not have their children
baptized by <hi>Popish</hi> Priests) enemies to the State, Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
&amp;c. But the memory of them shall be blessed, when
the names of these their traducers shall not. This is no new
thing: Indeed its an old trick of the Devil and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
to belye Gods Children, and to represent them
in the ugliest hue they can devise, thereby to make them
the more odious:<note place="margin">Jaer. 20. 10.</note> Thus <hi>Doeg</hi> dealt by <hi>David:</hi> The

                     </note> He was admitted into <hi>Clare-Hall,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62956:9"/>
was Pupil to Dr. <hi>Bing,</hi> a famous <hi>Civilian,</hi> and Master
of that House.</p>
                  <p>Presently after his first admission into that House,<note place="margin">His Proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> he
was taken notice of as one of singular Learning, and
ripeness for his years. Amongst the rest that were of
his year he had a <hi>Theam</hi> given him to make upon
this Subject, <hi>Frugalitas virtutum maxima:</hi> and when
the young Students brought in their Theams, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer
took, and read them, and when he came to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
Theam he stood,<note place="margin">His Industry.</note> and paused awhile, and at last,
said before them all: Here is the best Theam that ever
I read; and gave him some money for his encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and highly commended his Industry; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
after cast a favourable eye upon him, and sought
opportunities to do him good.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> had taken his degrees of <hi>Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note>
and Mr. of <hi>Arts,</hi> his Tutor, Dr. <hi>Bing</hi> (out of
his singular love to him for his Piety and Learning)
gave him a Chamber in his own Lodgings, where he
continued a year, or two, which conduced much to the
compleating of him for the work of the Ministry; and
all the while that he continued a gremial in the lap, and
bosom of his Mother, the University, he held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Meetings with divers of his famous Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries,
and that every week, as with Dr. <hi>Chaderton,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> (afterwards Bishop of <hi>Ely)</hi> Mr. <hi>Culver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Kewstubs,</hi> and divers others, whom God
raised up and fitted to send forth into his Harvest, to
gather his Corn, then ripe for the Sickle, into his
Barn.<note place="margin">Note.</note> At their meetings they had constant Exercises;
first, They began with prayer, &amp; then applied themselvs
to the Study of the Scriptures; one was for the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62956:9"/>
Languages,</hi> anothers task was for the <hi>Grammatical</hi>
Interpretation; anothers for the <hi>Logical Analysis;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for the true sense, and meaning of the Text; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gathered the Doctrines, and thus they carried on
their several imployments, till at last they went out,
like <hi>Apollos,</hi> eloquent men, and mighty in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
and the Lord was with them; so that they
brought in a very great Harvest into Gods Barn.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> would not run before he was sent,<note place="margin">His Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
though he was so excellently qualified for the work;
he durst not venter upon the exercise of the holy work
of the Ministry, till he had, not only an inward, but
an outward call also, <hi>viz.</hi> an assignation, approbation,
and solemn admission by the laying on of the hands of
the <hi>Presbyterie.</hi> When he was ordained, the Bishop
(who in those days was <hi>primus Presbyter,</hi> or <hi>Praeses)</hi>
seeking to oppose him, asked him this Question, Have
you read the Bible through? <hi>Yes</hi> (said he) <hi>I have read
the Old Testament twice through in the</hi> Hebrew, <hi>and the
New Testament often through in the</hi> Greek; <hi>and if you
please to examine me in any particular place, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to give you an account of it.</hi> Nay (said the
Bishop) if it be so, I shall need to say no more to you;
only some words of Commendation and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he gave him, and so with other assistants, he Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained

                     <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1583. the Vicaridge of <hi>Bramford</hi> in
<hi>Suffolk,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He fixes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Bramford.</hi>
                     </note> near <hi>Ipswich,</hi> fell void, and Mr. <hi>Rose</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
beforementioned, procured the Presentation
thereof for Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> of the Dean and Chapter of
<hi>Canterburie,</hi> in whose Gift it was. The Salary at first
was only twenty Marks <hi>per annum,</hi> but afterwards
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62956:10"/>
the Church raised it to twenty pound <hi>per annum,</hi> and
that was the most that ever he had there, yet he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of it, and being setled in it, he set himself to do
the work of Christ faithfully with all his might, <hi>as a
workman that needed not to be ashamed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every Lords day he preached twice very powerfully,<note place="margin">His great pains.</note>
and Chatechised the younger sort. He also preached a
Lecture every <hi>Thursday,</hi> to which multitudes from
<hi>Ipswich,</hi> and other adjacent places, did resort: And
God gave such success to his Ministry,<note place="margin">His Successe.</note> that by his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
many sons and daughters were from time to time
begotten unto God. Many precious Christians that
remain unto this day, acknowledge that their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was by Mr. <hi>Carters</hi> Ministry.</p>
                  <p>Before his Sermons he made but a short Prayer,<note place="margin">His Prayers.</note> and
that always in the same words: After Sermon he used
to be large, and full, and expressed himself with great
variety of phrases, and with much fervency, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
he concluded with the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was very diligent in visiting the sick,<note place="margin">Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Charity.</note> especially
the poorer sort; and he never went to the house of any
poor creature, but he left a Purse-Alms, as well as a
Spiritual-Alms of good, and heavenly advice, and
prayer. No poor body ever came to his door that
went away empty; his wife also looking to that as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
as himself.</p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Saturday</hi> throughout the whole year he gave
the Milk of his Cows to the poor of the Town; and
indeed he gave more to the Poor every year, then the
Revenue of his slender Vicaridge came to in the whole:
yet God so blessed him, that whilst he was in <hi>Bramford,</hi>
he quickly paid Mr. <hi>Rose</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> all the money
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62956:10"/>
that he had disbursed toward his Education in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>university;
and before he left <hi>Bramford</hi> he purchased
about twenty pound <hi>per annum;</hi> Gods blessing only
makes rich.</p>
                  <p>He had but two sons,<note place="margin">His children.</note> and he brought them both up
in Learning, and maintained them in the University in
good fashion.</p>
                  <p>He was sound,<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> and orthodox in his judgement: An
able, and resolute Champion against all manner of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
and <hi>Arminianism;</hi> as also against <hi>Anabaptism,</hi> and
<hi>Brownism,</hi> which did then begin to peep up, and infest
the Church, to tear and rent the seamless coat of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>He was always a <hi>Non-conformist,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</note> one of the good
old <hi>Puritans</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> He never swallowed any of
the <hi>Prelatical</hi> Ceremonies against his Conscience: So
that he was often troubled by the Bishops, but God
raised him up friends that always brought him off, and
maintained his Liberty. He was prudent, and of a
peaceable spirit, and never censured any that could, and
did conform, if he judged them consciencious, and saw
any thing of God in them.</p>
                  <p>At his first coming to <hi>Bramford,</hi> he saw of the travel
of his soul. He had a plentifull harvest, many souls
being daily added to the Church, by his powerfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
and holy life. But after he had abode many
years amongst them, the people began to be glutted
with heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> and loathed it, so that there
grew a great decay in their first love: and about the
year 1615. or something before,<note place="margin">His enemies.</note> there arose up a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of malignant spirits, who were haters of a
plain, powerfull, and searching Ministry, and of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62956:11"/>
life and power of Godliness: These were the Gentry,
and chief of the Parish. These rose up against Mr.
<hi>Carter,</hi> pressed him to Conformity, complained of
him to the Bishop, and threatned that they would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bring him to conformity or eject him.</p>
                  <p>At this very juncture of time,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> through Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Providence, the Rectory of little <hi>Belsted</hi> fell to
be void. A very small Village, some three miles from
<hi>Ipswich,</hi> and a solitary place; the means indeed was
better then <hi>Bramford,</hi> yet short of a competency, and
of the deserts of so eminent a Pillar in the Church of
<hi>Christ:</hi> it being but about fifty pound, and at the most
not worth above sixty pound <hi>per annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Patron (Mr. <hi>Bloss)</hi> became a Suitor to Master
<hi>Carter</hi> to accept of it, which he refused again, and
again, being resolved rather to endure persecution at
<hi>Bramford,</hi> to grapple with all difficulties, and to die
there, rather then to remove. But Gods providence
over-ruled him. At <hi>Bramford</hi> he saw that he must be
outed, and Mr. <hi>Bloss</hi> would take no denial: yea, and
he found favour in the eyes of the Bishop; so that he
was instituted without subscription, or submitting to
the Ceremonies: and then at last, God (as it were) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him by the hand, and pulling him whether he
would or no, he removed from <hi>Bramford,</hi> after he had
done faithfull Service in the work of the Ministery for
about thirty four years in that place,<note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Belsted.</hi>
                     </note> and was setled at
<hi>Belsted</hi> Parsonage, where be continued eighteen years
before God caused him to rest from his Labors; and
in all that time he discharged his holy Function just as
he had done in <hi>Bramford</hi> in his younger years; though
his Congregation here was but small: yet it pleased
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62956:11"/>
God that many Fish came within the compass of his
Net from <hi>Ipswich,</hi> and other neighbouring Towns,
where they were destitute of faithfull Shepherds, so
that his later Crop in Gods Harvest-field, was very
considerable.</p>
                  <p>Little <hi>Belsted</hi> was a <hi>Tusculanum</hi> to him, where in
his old age he had much secret,<note place="margin">His Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God.</note> and sweet communion
with God in the house, and, as an <hi>Isaac,</hi> with him in
the Fields, which was a beginning of that glorious
Communion which he now enjoyes with God
in the <hi>mountains of Spices.</hi> He <hi>being dead, yet speaks;</hi>
and his <hi>works praise him in the Gates.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His works.</note> For from the
Press we have his Learned, and pithy Commentary on
the <hi>Sermon of Christ in the Mount:</hi> and two short, but
substantial, solid, and profitable <hi>Catechisms:</hi> one, <hi>Milk
for children:</hi> the other, <hi>Winter evenings Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His pains in the study of the <hi>Revelations</hi> were
indefatigable. He wrote much in a little room; but
these Labours of his yet never saw the light. Many
Ministers that privately did converse with him, lighted
their candles at his.</p>
                  <p>For his carriage and deportment in his Family,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>His</hi> Family Duties.</note> it
was sober, grave, and very Religious. He there offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up the Morning and Evening Sacrifice of Prayer,
and praise continually: so that his House was a little
Church. Thrice a day he had the Scriptures read, and
after that the <hi>Psalm,</hi> or Chapter were ended, he used
to ask all his children and servants what they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
and whatsoever Sentences they rehearsed, he
would speak something out of them that might tend
to their edification. For his own, and his Wives ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62956:12"/>
it was very plain, and homely, of the old Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">His humility.</note>
yet very cleanly and decent; insomuch, that all
that came to his house would say, they had seen <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
and <hi>Eve,</hi> or some of the <hi>old Patriarchs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all his house also, there was nothing but honest
plainess. He was such an one as <hi>Jacob,</hi> a plain, sincere,
I had almost said a perfect man; I am sure a true <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaneel,
in whom was no guile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He never used any Plate in his House, but Vessels
of Wood and Earth; Pewter and Brass were the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Mettals for his Utensils. All the time of his house-keeping
he used constantly at his Table a little wooden
Salt, which with age was grown to be of a duskish
black, which was much taken notice of by all
Comers.</p>
                  <p>He never made Feasts,<note place="margin">His hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> yet always had wholsom,
full, and liberal Diet in his house, and all fared alike:
He, and his wife did never think that his children, and
servants, and poor folk did eat enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The righteous man</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) is mercifull to
his Beast:</hi> So he was carefull even for the bruit Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that they should be fed to the full. All his cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
were like to the first <hi>Kine</hi> that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> saw feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Meddow, they were fat-fleshed, and well
favoured; insomuch, as some godly people used to
say merrily: If they would be a Cow, or a Horse,
or a Hog, or a Dog, they would choose Mr. <hi>Carter</hi>
for their Master.</p>
                  <p>He had a sharp wit,<note place="margin">His conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and was sweet, milde, affable,
and pleasant in his conversation; yet were there not
any of his most facetious passages, that did not savour
of holiness. His communication and discourse was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62956:12"/>
always heavenly,<note place="margin">His secret Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> and his eyes were frequently lifted
up towards heaven: He did not eat, or drink without
praising God with his mouth, and eyes. His whole
<hi>Conversation was in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides his Family Duties, and Prayers, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
constantly in his Closet at his first going to his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and before he came forth to Dinner and Supper.
He prayed very loud,<note place="margin">His Prayers</note> and mostly very long: for the
extension of his voice he had a double reason; one
that by his earnest speech he might quicken, and raise
up his own heart, and devotion: the other, that he
might give a good example for secret prayer to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and servants; and he never closed any Prayer,
without adding the <hi>Lords Prayer;</hi> and his ground for
that practise was this; He judged his own best Prayers
imperfect, and that of Christ most perfect, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of all our necessities.</p>
                  <p>That you may be the better satisfied concerning
his sense, and judgement in this matter, take this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
out of his Printed Commentary upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 9.
Where after he hath set forth the excellency, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Christs Prayer, he addeth, <q>Christ now
directs us to the right performance of the Duty of
Prayer.<note place="margin">Of the Lords Prayer.</note> 
                        <hi>After this manner pray ye:</hi> Or as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Luke</hi>
sets it down, <hi>When you pray, say.</hi> Not binding us
strictly to use these words always, and none other,
but to use the matter, manner, and like affections: But
as for them who cannot so well enlarge their suits in
other words, or for those also who can, and do it,
and yet remain still unsatisfied, as not having done
it sufficiently (and who can do it sufficiently?)
the Lord Christ hath left this most excellent help to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62956:13"/>
use the very words of this Divine Prayer, as the
most worthy servants of God have ever used to do:
And learn we here by the way, that an absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
lyeth upon us (which ought to be our greatest
glory and comfort) to pray in these words, or in this
manner. For it is the undispensable Commandment
of our Lord Christ: <hi>After this manner pray.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had a special dexterity in comforting afflicted
Consciences;<note place="margin">His skil in comforting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note> resolving doubts, and answering que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions;
when some came to him (not long before he
changed this earthly for an heavenly Mansion) and
told him of the rigour of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> how it grew
higher every day, how they persecuted conscientious
Ministers, and Christians: Of their Innovations, and
of the Book for Liberty of Sports on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> days,
tending to the fearfull profanation thereof: He used
these expressions: <hi>I have had a longing desire to see, or
hear of the fall of Antichrist: But I check my self, I
shall go to Heaven, and there news of it will come thick,
thick, thick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When others came to him, and pressed him with
importunity to tell them his Judgement concerning the
future state of the Church, saying to him, that he had
travelled much in the study of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and
they were perswaded that God had revealed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then ordinary to him. What do you think
(said they) shall we have <hi>Popery</hi> once again, or no?
He answered, <hi>You shall not need to fear fire, and fagot
any more: but such dreadfull divisions will be amongst
God people and Professors,</hi>

                     <hi>as will equalize the greatest

                  </p>
                  <p>A man meeting him near his house, called to him,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62956:13"/>
saying, Oh Mr. <hi>Carter!</hi> What shall I do? My wife is
entring into her Travel, and I think she will die with
very fear: Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> answered, <hi>Make haste, run to
your wife, and tell her that I am going to my Closet as
fast as I can to pray for her; therefore bid her not faint,
but to be of good courage and comfort.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Prayers successfull.</note> The man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
ran to his wife, and told her what had passed
between Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> and him. Presently her fears va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
God gave her strength, and she was delivered
immediately, and safely: and strait after, her Husband
went to Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> (even before he came out of
his Closet) and told him what God had done for
him.</p>
                  <p>Another time, a poor man met him by the way,
and cryed to him piteously, saying, Mr. <hi>Carter!</hi> What
shall become of me? I work hard, and fare hard, and
yet I cannot thrive, I continue bare, and know not
how in the world to live.<note place="margin">His gracious speeches.</note> He answered him: <hi>Yet still
you want one thing, and I will tell you what you shall
do, Work hard, and fare hard, and pray hard, and I
will warrant you shall thrive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There dwelled in that Parish a Tanner, that was a
very godly man, and one that had much familiar soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
with Mr. <hi>Carter.</hi> This man as he was very busie
in Tawing of a Hide with all his might, not so much
as turning his head aside any way: Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> coming
by accidentally, came softly behinde him, and merrily
gave him a little clap on the back: the man started, and
looking behinde him suddenly, blushed, and said, Sir,
I am ashamed that you should find me thus: To whom
Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> replied, <hi>Let Christ when he comes finde me
so doing:</hi> What (said the man) doing thus? <hi>Yes</hi> (said
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62956:14"/>
Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> to him) <hi>faithfully performing the Duties of
my Calling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being at Dinner at <hi>Ipswich</hi> at one of the Magistrates
Houses; divers other Ministers being at the Table
also: One amongst the rest (who was old enough, and
had learned enough to have taught him more humility)
was very full of talk, bragged much of his parts,
and skill, &amp;c. and made a Challenge, saying, Here
are many Learned men, if any of you will propound
any question in <hi>Divinity,</hi> or <hi>Philosophy,</hi> I will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with him, resolve his doubt, and satisfie him ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
All at the Table (except himself) were silent
for a while: then said Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> (when he saw that
none else would speak) to him, calling him by his name:
<hi>I will go no further then my Treacher to puzzle you:
Here is a</hi> Sole:<note place="margin">His acuteness.</note> 
                     <hi>Now tell me the reason why this Fish that
hath lived always in the salt water, should come out
fresh?</hi> To this, this forward Gentleman could say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and so was laughed at, and shamed out of
his vanity.</p>
                  <p>At another time a certain man came to him, and
made his moan, saying, I have lost the greatest friend
that I had in the world: I had (in a manner) all my
livelyhood from him: To whom Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<hi>When the Fountain is dryed up in one place, God
will open it in another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To one of his Sons he said,</hi> Son <hi>John,</hi> God hath
always brought water for me out of the hard stinty rock.
Those covetous hard hearted men, who have been ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to my person and Ministery, have many times come
in, and given me countenance and maintenance.</p>
                  <p>His eldest son, whom he had bred up to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62956:14"/>
and who proved a blessed Instrument in the
Church of Christ, being dead, Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> took care
of his eldest son, sent him to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him towards the Stable, took his last leave of
him, in these words in <hi>Latine, Cave, mi fili, fastum,
ignaviam, Antichristum,</hi> My son, beware of Pride,
Sloth, and Antichrist.</p>
                  <p>His usual saying was, <hi>a Traveller must have a Swines
belly, an Asses back, and a Marchants purse:</hi> Meaning
that he must be content with any fare, bear all injuries,
and provide for vast expences. We are Pilgrims and
Travellers here, and we must prepare for wants, wrongs,
and spoiling of our goods.</p>
                  <p>It might well be said of him, <hi>Semper erat ubi non erat:</hi>
His heart was where his head was, and now his soul is,
to wit, <hi>in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His whole life was nothing else but a Communion
day. Old <hi>Jacob</hi> seemed to live in him: and sure the
Spirit of God breathed as much in him,<note place="margin">His fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> in his words,
and writings (holiness dropped from his Pen in every
ordinary Letter that he wrote) in his actions, and <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies,</hi>
as in any mans in these latter times. He was
always instilling precious precepts, exhortations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
or consolations into those with whom he
had occasion to converse.</p>
                  <p>A godly woman told his Son, that she had been ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to a Religious Gentleman, to whose house Mr.
<hi>Carter</hi> did often resort, and that she was <hi>won</hi> to Christ
at first, by hearing the Heavenly speeches, and sweet
principles that dropped from him as she was warming
his Bed, and as she waited upon him in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62956:15"/>
He was always most just,<note place="margin">His Justice.</note> and exact in his dealings.
He put a Clause in his <hi>Will,</hi> for the faithfull, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
payment of his Debts: yet when his Son <hi>John,</hi>
and his daughter <hi>Eunice,</hi> whom he made his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
enquired what his Debts were, he could finde
nothing that he owed, except to the Smith for shooing
of an Horse or two.</p>
                  <p>His Son, when he came to look over his Library,
found two or three Books (not one of them worth a
Groat) upon which he had written, <hi>This Book was
borrowed of such an one: Let it be restored: or if the
owner cannot be found, allow something to the poor for
it, and that liberally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once, being in a journey many miles from home,
in changing a piece of Gold at a Shop, he took an half
Crown piece instead of a shilling, neither he nor the
Shop-keeper knowing it: but as soon as he came home,
he found the mistake; whereupon he could not rest
satisfied, but the next day took a long journey back
again on purpose to that Town, to carry back the half
Crown again.</p>
                  <p>He was of a sweet, mild, and gentle nature, and of
a gracious spirit. A loving, and faithfull Husband to
his wife, and a tender, and indulgent Father to his
children; and if he failed in any thing, it was in his
carriage to his Servants; for truly he carried not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to them as a Master to his servants, but as a familiar
friend to his friends. He would make them to sit down
with him at his Table, and would drink to them at
his meals.</p>
                  <p>He, and his Wife were married together almost
threescore years, and in all that time there was never
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62956:15"/>
heard any distastefull word to pass betwixt them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed could it be otherwise: For he lived, and
walked with her <hi>as a man of knowledge:</hi> he was to her
a Prudent, Faithfull, and tender guide; and she was
humble, and meek, reverenced, and highly esteemed
him. Every word he spake was an Oracle to her, and
her will ever closed with his Judgement.</p>
                  <p>He lived to the age of fourscore:<note place="margin">His Age.</note> When his youngest
son <hi>John</hi> was born, who was the youngest of nine, he
called him the Son of his Age, and yet he lived to see
him fourty years old before he died himself, being
fourty years old when he was born.</p>
                  <p>He was much,<note place="margin">His Fastings.</note> and frequent in secret Fastings, and
when he kept such a day, he told none of his house of
it, save his wife only, and she would not eat any thing
that day on which he fasted, but oft-times she was with
him in his retiring chamber to joyn with him in prayer;
yet could it not be concealed from the rest of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
because at night he supped not, but only had a
Toste, and a draught of ordinary Beer to sustain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Days he never had any Roste meat
at Dinner, because he would have none thereby kept
from the Publick Ordinances; the Pot was hung on
with a piece of Beef, and a pudding in it, and that
was their constant Lords Days Dinner, for well-nigh
sixty years together.</p>
                  <p>His Church at <hi>Belsted</hi> stood in a very solitary place,<note place="margin">His retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>
whereof he always kept a key, and would often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
thither all alone. A Gentleman once espying
him as he went towards the Church on a private day,
hid himself, till Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> was past, and gone into the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62956:16"/>
Church, and then he came close up to the Church
wall, desiring to peep in at some window to see what
he did, and to listen if he said any thing; and this
Gentleman afterwards told his Son <hi>John,</hi> that he first
prayed, then read a Chapter, and after that prayed
largely, and very heavenly, as if he had been in his
Family, or in the publick Congregation.</p>
                  <p>He vigorously held on the constant course of his
Ministry to the last.<note place="margin">His vigour.</note> It may be said of him, as of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb</hi>
and <hi>Joshua;</hi> he was as sit for service in Gods Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest-field
at fourscore, as he was at fourty.</p>
                  <p>Indeed some abatement of bodily strength there
was, as old Age did steal upon him. After his after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
Sermon on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> days he would be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
faint, and commonly when he came home he
would call for some comfortable draught, and when
he had lifted up his eyes to heaven, and taken it, he
would say to them about him, <hi>These are crutches to
shore up a ruinous house:</hi> but in his Intellectuals, and
spiritual strength there was no decay.</p>
                  <p>Old Mr. <hi>Benton</hi> of <hi>Wramplingham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> a
holy man of God, being upon occasion in <hi>Suffolk</hi> in
those parts, could not but give a visit to his old friend,
Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> of <hi>Belsted;</hi> and being with him, he heard
him discourse with such holy gravity, and a mixture of
all kinde of Learning, sollidity, and wit, that he stood
amazed at it, and said, Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> I see you are like
unto the Palm and Cedar Tree, you bring forth more
fruit in your Age. <hi>I thank you</hi> (said Mr. <hi>Carter) you
tell me what I should be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the time of his departure was at hand:<note place="margin">His sickness.</note>
Some fortnight, or three weeks before his Translation,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62956:16"/>
there appeared some decays in his body, and memory,
which now began to fail him. He would sometimes
(but rarely) call to go to Sea, and to his better Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
Yet he sate up from morning till night, and
commonly walked up and down the room, and never
failed to perform Prayer, and other Family exercises,
so that none could discern any considerable defect
either in his spiritual, or natural strength: Only in this,
that when he had done, he would presently call to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
again; and say to his daughter <hi>Eunice,</hi> who was
now the stay of his house, and the staff of his old age
(God having taken away his dear wife about two years
before) <hi>Daughter, shall we not go to prayer?</hi> and when
she answered him, Sir you have been at Prayer alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and you are weary, he would reply, <hi>I fear we
have not done what we should do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was one of his constant and ordinary Petitions
in every Prayer, that God would vouchsafe him a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,
and easie passage out of this life, and the Lord
did most graciously answer him therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> the 21. <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1634. being the
day before the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in the evening he called very
earnestly for Paper, Ink, and two Pens: <hi>For</hi> (saith he)
<hi>by Gods grace tomorrow I will preach twice:</hi> But (God
knows) he was not in a fit condition for study; yet
with that resolution he went to Bed, and God gave
him some rest that night. In the morning upon the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> day he did rise from his Bed, as he used to do,
and came out of his Bed-chamber into the Hall, and
after Prayer, he called for his ordinary breakfast,
which he used before he went to Church (for still he
held his resolution for Preaching) which was an Egg;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62956:17"/>
he took it into his hand, but alas! it would not down:
whereupon he said to his daughter.</p>
                  <p>Eunice, <hi>I am not able to go to Church, yet I pray
thee, lead me to my Bed, I will lie down a little and rest
me.</hi> So he rose up out of his chair, and walked up and
down, she supporting him, and when he came to the
Parlour door, before he put his foot over the threshold:
<hi>Oh</hi> Eunice! saith he, <hi>What shall I do?</hi> Put your trust
(saith she) in that God of whom you have had so
much experience, who never yet did leave you, nor
forsake you. <hi>Yea</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Lord be thanked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So he gathered up his strength, went to the Bed-side,
sat down upon it, and immediatly composed
himself to lie down.<note place="margin">His Death.</note> He lifted up one of his Legs
upon the Bed without any great difficulty, laid down
his Body, and rested his Head upon the Pillow. His
Daughter still stood by, expecting when she should
lift his other leg upon the Bed, thinking that he had
been faln asleep: and she was not mistaken, for so
he was. It proved his last sleep, and before she could
discern any change in him, his soul had taken its flight
into heaven, even into the Arms, and embraces of his
Blessed Saviour, whom he had faithfully served all his
life long; being about fourscore years old.</p>
                  <p>He intended a <hi>Sabbaths</hi> labour for Christ, and Christ
gave him rest from his labour, even the rest of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Sabbath.</hi> When his daughter began to speak to him,
and to lift him, she found that his breath was departed,
yet was there not any change in his countenance at all:
his eyes and his mouth continuing in the same posture
they used to be in his sweetest sleeps.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord gave unto his faithfull Servant the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62956:17"/>
desire of his soul, and a return of his Prayers, such
an easie passage, as that his death could not be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from a sweet natural sleep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not many days before his death he called his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and said to her,</hi> Daughter, Remember my love to
my Son <hi>John:</hi> I shall see him no more in this life: and
remember me to the rest of my children, and Family, and
deliver this message to them all from me: Stand fast in
the faith, and love one another. <hi>This was the last mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
that ever he sent to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ended his life with a <hi>Doxology,</hi> breathing out
his last, with these words, <hi>The Lord be thanked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he had thus yielded up his Spirit into the
hands of his heavenly Father, his daughter <hi>Eunice</hi>
dispatched away a Messenger to his Son <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich:</hi>
for so had her Father given order before he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that his body should not be put into a <hi>Cofsin</hi> till
his Son <hi>John</hi> came: and God carried him through the
journey in hard weather, so that through Gods good
providence, he arrived at <hi>Belsted</hi> early on the <hi>Tuesday,</hi>
and going into the house of mourning, he found the
Body of his deceased Father still lying upon the bed:
they uncovered his face, and sweetly he lay, and with
a smiling countenance, and no difference appearing to
the eye between his countenance alive and dead, only
that he was wont to rejoyce, and to bless his Son at
their meeting, and now he was silent. His son fell
upon his face and kissed him, and lift up his voice and
wept, and so took his last leave of him till they should
meet in a better world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> the 4th. in the afternoon,<note place="margin">His Funeral.</note> 
                     <hi>Anno Christi,
1634.</hi> was he Interred, at which time there was a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62956:18"/>
great confluence people from all the parts thereabout,
Ministers, and others, all taking up the words of <hi>Joash</hi>
King of <hi>Israel: Oh my Father! my Father! the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
of</hi> Israel, <hi>and the Horsemen thereof!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Good Mr. <hi>Samuel Ward,</hi> that famous Divine, and
the glory of <hi>Ipswich,</hi> came to the Funeral, brought
with him a mourning Gown, and offered very respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to have preached his Funeral Sermon, now that
such a Congregation was gathered together, and upon
such an occasion.</p>
                  <p>But his Son, and daughter durst not give way unto
it: for so their Father had often charged them in his
life time, and that upon his blessing, that there should
be no Sermon at his burial: <hi>For</hi> (said he) <hi>it may give
occasion to speak some good of me that I deserve not,
and so false things may be uttered in the Pulpit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> rested satisfied with this, and accordingly
did forbear: But the next <hi>Friday</hi> at <hi>Ipswich,</hi> he turned
his whole Lecture into a Funeral Sermon for Mr. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
in which he honoured him, and lamented the
Churches loss, to the great satisfaction of the whole
Auditory. <hi>Gloria fugentes sequitur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Glory is like your shadow! follow it, and it will
flie away from you; but she from it, and it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
you.</p>
                  <p>And so it proved with Mr. <hi>Carter:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Humility.</note> He was most eminent
for Humility: Humble he was in his habit, and humble
in all his deportment: For though his Gifts called him
before great men, yet his most ordinary converse was
with those of an inferiour rank; in whom he saw most
of the power of godliness. So that he might truly
say, with <hi>David, Psal. 119. 63. I am a companion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62956:18"/>
of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy
precepts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He wrote very much; but he left nothing behinde
him save what is Printed,<note place="margin">His Works.</note> and his Exposition upon the
<hi>Revelations;</hi> and a Petition to King <hi>James</hi> for the
taking away of burdensom Ceremonies out of the
Church. Nothing else but a few broken Papers, which
he regarded not. Probably he burnt the rest, when he
saw his appointed time draw neer, meerly out of a low
opinion of himself, and his own gifts.</p>
                  <p>He avoided all things that might tend to outward
Pomp, and ostentation: He would have no Funeral
Sermon: He left order in his <hi>Will</hi> not to be buried
in the Church, but in the Church-yard; where he, and
his wife, that glorious pair, he interred together without
so much, or rather so little as a poor Grave-stone over
them.</p>
                  <p>He had learned of Christ to be meek and lowly in
heart: He was humble in his Life, and humble in his
Death, and now the Lord hath highly exalted him.</p>
                  <p>He kept a constant <hi>Diary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Diary.</note> or day book, in which
every day he set down Gods extraordinary dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
his own actions, and whatsoever memorable
things he heard, or read that day.</p>
                  <p>He cast up his Accounts with God every day:
and his sins were blotted out before he came to his last
reckoning; his day of refreshing came, and he rests
from his labours</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>It may be truly said of him, and his faithful Yoke-fellow,
as it is written of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, they
were both righteous before God, walking in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
and Ordinances of the Lord blameless;</hi> and
truly the world will, and can testifie, that neither of
them did ever do that thing that was evil, or unjust, or
scandalous, or uncomely, even their enemies themselvs
being Judges, they were as to men, without blemish:
their life was a sweet savour, and they went out of this
life as a fragrant persume.</p>
                  <p>This Life was drawn up by Mr. <hi>John Carter, Junior,</hi>
now also with the Lord, one who degenerated not from
the steps of his Learned, and holy Father, and by him
was sent to me some years since, together with this
ensuing Epistle: which I have the rather inserted, to
provoke, and stir up others, who can in this way, revive
the memories of the Dead Saints, to do it, which will
be a more lasting Monument to them, and far more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial,

                        <p>Now, good Sir, let me be bold to give a short account
of my self. Some few days since <hi>I</hi> went about to make a
new <hi>Diary</hi> for my self, <hi>I</hi> was desirous in the first place,
to set down some passages of my Father, for mine own
satisfaction, and use. <hi>I</hi> began so, and before <hi>I</hi> was aware,
it amounted to so much, as I thought better that that should
be published, than nothing at all: and at last my Spirit
grew restless: I could not satisfie my self, till I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
it into some order, and made it publick. And now,
Sir, here it is; I present it to your judicious view; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it in good part from a meer stranger.</p>
                        <p>My humble request to you, Worthy Sir, is this, that,
though I slipped the last opportunity, yet if you shall set
forth any more Lives; or if you shall have a new Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of any of the former, that you would extract so much
of my precious Fathers Life, as you shall judge fit, and
place it where you please in your <hi>Ecclesiastical History.</hi>
Your Monuments will be lasting in after Ages, when my
poor Pamphlet will be worn out with time. Pardon my
boldness: The Lord lengthen out your days, for the good
of his Church, and the honour of his Saints.</p>

                  <p>From his very youth he was highly esteemed in that

more expedite, and exquisite for any worthy, and

his <hi>Aeneids: Juvenals</hi> first <hi>Satyre,</hi> and most of the
memorable speeches both in <hi>Virgil,</hi> and other Poets;
All which were clear demonstrations of his ingenious
capacity, and ingenuous sufficiency.</p>
                  <p>And, to shew that his heart; even in his youth was
drawn Heaven-ward (from whence his wit was sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied)
he translated divers of <hi>Davids Psalms,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
several Sacred <hi>Hymnes</hi> of his own: Some of
which he sung with tears of joy, and desire in his last
sickness, having a sweet voice, and good skill in <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his younger years also, he was a constant, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
hearer, and great admirer of that man of God,
Mr. <hi>William Perkins,</hi> and a Reverend Observer of all
the most eminent men of that Time, who were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in their Generation, carefully, and safely laying
up in the faithfull Treasury of his Memory what he
heard from them; which was an evident presage of his
future abilities, and that he was likely to become a
skilfull <hi>Master Builder</hi> in the House of God, and an
excellent Instrument of winning many souls unto
Christ.</p>

He was acute in the <hi>Greek,</hi>

<hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongues, which he sparingly made
use of, only upon necessary occasions, not for osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
to amuse such hearers as seem to be most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with what they least understand; but for the more
full, and clear opening of the Text, and giving the

whose full sense, and native Elegancies (proper
to every Language) cannot always be expressed to the

                  <p>He very well understood, and spake the <hi>Italian,
French,</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongues, and had read very many
grave, and witty Authors in each of them, whereof,
by the excellency of his wit,<note place="margin">What use he made of them.</note> he made admirable use

                  <p>While he was yet a Fellow in <hi>Emanuel</hi> College,
in a due compliance with the pious Statutes of that
House,<note place="margin">His Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> he entred into the Office of the Ministry, <hi>Sept.</hi>
the 24th <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1601, which he took not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him as a shelter to save a Fellowship, but to gain
souls unto God: For which purpose he immediatly
betook himself to that Evangelicall work of Preaching,
for the most part at a place called <hi>Coxton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His preaching.</note> not far from
<hi>Cambridg,</hi> and in some other places thereabouts;
where (besides the prosecution of his other studies,
and performance of sundry exercises in the College)
he had preached twenty eight Sermons within the

those times, when the Fellows of Houses were rather
hinderers than furtherers of so good a work, if under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken

                  <p>Having thus traced his wayes, and procedure in the

For in <hi>September Anno Christi</hi> 1602, he was by

or insinuating friends) fairly, and freely called to
the Pastorall charg of a great Flock at <hi>Wrington,</hi> a

Knight S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Arthur Capel</hi> of <hi>Little Hadam</hi> in <hi>Hertford

                  <p>There did he (in obedience to his Call) forthwith
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62956:23"/>
settle himself, and immediatly he set upon the work
for which he was sent,<note place="margin">His Industry and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <hi>viz.</hi> to instruct, and turn unto
righteousness that great people, who had never before
enjoyed the blessing of a Preaching Minister, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
amongst them (which therefore required the
greater skill, and industry of the spirituall Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to manure, and manage, such an incultured plot)
so that he was to them (if not to the whole Country
adjacent) the first that by preaching the Gospell,
brought Religion into credit, and discovered to them
the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> which before was to most of
them a <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> as an unknown land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
left them much richer both in spirituals, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals
than he found them. Insomuch that, he might
at length, in a proportion, say of that place as <hi>Augustus,</hi>
the Emperour, did of <hi>Rome, Lateritiam reperi, marmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ream
reliqui:</hi> I found it built of bricks, but I left it
built of marble.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Crook</hi> having thus pitched,<note place="margin">His Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and fixed his Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
staff, as he never sought higher, or other earthly
preferments (though his capacity, and credit was well
known to be such as made him capable of, and opened
a ready way for it) so he never accepted of any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or accessions of maintenance, or honour, though
they were Honourably profered by such Persons as
were able to have advanced him.</p>
                  <p>As for the course of his Ministry, and deportment:
his progress was answerable to his beginings: yea, his
works were most,<note place="margin">His holy life.</note> and best at the last: For as he
Preached, so he practised: his whole life being but
one continued Commentary upon his Doctrine, and
an exemplary Sermon consisting of living words, or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62956:23"/>
of words translated into works, as will further appear
in its due place.</p>
                  <p>Few men ever came into a place with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
expectation,<note place="margin">His esteem</note> which yet he not only satisfied, but
exceeded it. Few men could draw after them those
affections, and admiration which he did; which also
were so far from cooling, and diminishing, as that they
encreased, and that deservedly, to his last, rather than
decreased amongst all that had learned Christ in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and truth.</p>
                  <p>And as for those few silly seduced ones, who were
carried away towards his latter end, with a spirit of
giddiness, through the secret, and subtile insinuations,
and whisperings of false Teachers, in corners (who
with as much ignorance as confidence delude the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by <hi>great swelling words of vanity,</hi> and uncouth phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
abhorrent from Christian Religion, sobriety, and
truth, and which wise men lament, while fools, who
are ignorant of the depths, and methods of Satan, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud,
and admire) endeavoured in their virtigenous
fits, to eclipse his credit, and splendour: yet his pious,
and affectionate Essayes to reclaim them with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of meekness, as also his fervent Prayers, and yearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bowels for their reducing, turned all their revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to his greater lustre, and glory, amongst all such
as were able to discern of things that differ, and willing
to approve the things that are excellent.</p>
                  <p>Not long after Mr. <hi>Crook</hi>'s first setling in this his
Pastorall charge,<note place="margin">His Marriage.</note> he happily married a Wife of his
own Tribe, and after his own heart, who was the eldest
daughter of that Reverend Mr. <hi>Walsh,</hi> an holy, and

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> and abundant charity. She was a very
prudent, and gratious woman, a most loyall, loving,
and tender wife, zealous and active for his encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
credit, and comfort in all things, especially in his
Ministry; to which she constantly bore such hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and reverence, as did much quicken, and enlarge
him in the work of the Lord. She was also continually
studious, and carefull to free, and ease him of all emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
occasions, avocations, and businesses of ordinary
concernment, that so he might with the more freedom
follow (what his soul most delighted in) his diviner
imployments, and enjoy himself, and friends in his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
relaxations. In a word, her behaviour was such
<hi>as becometh holiness, a teacher of good things to the
younger women,</hi> and in her Family a worthy pattern,
and a great promoter of godliness in all that conversed
with her, and to her Husband a meet help indeed, and
so she continued all the dayes of their conjugall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Children he left none, besides those spiritually
begotten unto Christ by his labours in the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>His great delight,<note place="margin">His great pains.</note> and indefatigable pains in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so many years so frequently, was almost beyond
all example: for he constantly preached (if in health)
thrice a week, besides his extraordinary labours on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
emergent occasions which he cheerfully embraced,
as rejoycing in all opportunities of doing good, and that
abroad as well as at home.</p>
                  <p>In all his Sermons (which were many thousands)
his expressions were choice,<note place="margin">His manner of preaching.</note> grave, solid, weighty, savou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and seasonable: His applications home, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
strongly enforced, and set on from Divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62956:24"/>
by a sweet, and moving elocution, a masculine
eloquence, fervent zeal, and strength of love to the
souls of the hearers.</p>
                  <p>He knew very well how to set forth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
abstruse points plainly, and how to manage <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
plain truths elegantly; <hi>not in the words of mans wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but which the Holy Ghost teacheth:</hi> Alwayes
speaking in Christ, <hi>as of God in the sight of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was not like one that makes a Feast once a
moneth, or once a quarter, letting his Family beg or
starve in the intervals; Nor like such as visit the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
twice every Sabbath day, yet bring no new matter
with them scarce once a moneth; but still are setting
on the same dishes with a little new garnish, even unto
nauseousness: But our Mr. <hi>Crook,</hi> as he layed in richly,
so he layed out liberally, and prudently, like a ready
<hi>Scribe instructed to the Kingdom of God;</hi> or a good
Housholder, <hi>who brings forth of his treasury, things both
new, and old.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And albeit he could by his quick invention, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Judgment, and faithfull memory (things rarely
meeting in the same man) dexterously dispatch that
with little labour which costs other men much pains;
yet he seriously professed with rejoycing, that he never
durst serve God with that which cost him nothing:
well knowing that industry adds weight, and respect
both to the matter, and speaker, whereby his words
became <hi>as goods, and nails fastened by that great Master
of the Assemblies, which are given from one Shepherd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Motto was,<note place="margin">His Motto.</note> 
                     <hi>Impendam, &amp; expendar:</hi> I will
spend, and be spent, which he cheerfully verified. For
he counted not his life dear in comparison of preaching
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62956:25"/>
the Gospell, and of <hi>finishing his course with joy,</hi> and the
Ministry he had received from the Lord Jesus, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the Gospell of the Grace of God. When he was
told by his Physician (who was very carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his life) that he might live longer if he would
preach seldomer: <hi>Alas!</hi> (said he) <hi>If I may not labour I
cannot live: what good will life doe me, if I be hindred
from the end of living?</hi>
                     <q>Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causam?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When through age,<note place="margin">His Industry.</note> and weakness he was disenabled
from travelling abroad any more to perfume other
Congregations with the sweet odours of his pretious
ointment: and when by reason of his years, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
he might very well (as an <hi>emeritus miles)</hi>
have sued out (even in the Court of Heaven it self)
a Writ of ease, and have passed the rest of his dayes
in rejoycing over his Triumphs, and Trophies: yet
would he never give over studying, and Preaching, till
all strength of Body gave him over. Yea he often
preached, even when his legs almost refused to carry
him any more to Church, and that with much spirit,
and unexpected vivacity, even as a mighty man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed
with the Wine of Gods Spirit. And being
(some years before his departure) sensible of the
daily approaches of Death (which he long expected)
to his exhausted, and decayed body, almost ready to be
deserted of its Divine Soul; he did severall times
preach his own Funerall Sermon (as supposing he
should never preach more) and that not without

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62956:25"/>
he invited (as his constant manner was) such Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and Friends as came to hear his Lecture, to his
Table; he would force himself to sit with them (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
for the most part he was forced to be silent, by
reason of the expence of his spirits) and much rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that he had once more imployed his Masters Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,

was all his delight.</hi>
                  </p>

but a voice,</hi> as being troubled at the decayes of nature
growing upon him more, and more, whereby his feeble
body was disenabled from serving his still active soul,

Cells affect to be most fraught; Like those,

                  <p>He was a wise Master builder,<note place="margin">His prudence in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</note> who intending to
raise a strong, and beautifull Fabrick, laid a solid Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
able, and sufficient to bear, and strengthen all
his superstructures. He therefore began his Ministry
with a pervous, and perspicuous handling of such
Texts as might discover to his People, the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
sufficiency, purity, and energy of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
the ten Commandements, Articles of the Faith,
the Lords Prayer, the Doctrine of the Sacraments,
God in Trinity, his Decrees, Creation, Providence, of
Sin, Christ, the New Covenant, the Fall of Man, the
Mediator, the Gospell, Faith, Vocation, Regeneration,
Justification, Adoption, Sanctification, Glorification;
the Church, the last Judgment, the Christian Warfare,
and such like: All which in process of time, he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and applied, sometimes more largely, sometimes
more briefly; but alwayes profitably, and sweetly, <hi>as
a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, but rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the word of truth</hi> in a practicall way.</p>
                  <p>Out of all which in his more mature,<note place="margin">His Catechism</note> and riper
years, greatest strength of parts, and depth of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he (after many serious reviews) compiled that
excellently compacted <hi>Systeme</hi> of Divinity in a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheticall
way, which he deservedly intituled, <hi>The Guid
to true Blessedness.</hi> And out of it he again extracted
that lesser Catechisme which he often used, with very
profitable, and delightfull explanations, both in his
Congregation, and Family. A most profitable, course of
teaching, and learning the true knowledg of Christ.</p>

                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62956:26"/>
He went also through many intire Scriptures (which
doth greatly try, and improve a Divine) and the more
obscure any place was, the greater was his diligence,
with happy success to bring light unto it. Difficulties
which are Lions in the way of the sluggard, proved but
spurs to his Industry.</p>
                  <p>He went over many of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> as the 1<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>,

his own unworthiness in the sight of God, how much
soever he was cried up, and esteemed by men. No ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of naturall abilities, no eminency of spirituall
endowments, no acceptation of his labours ever puffed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62956:27"/>
him up; but that he still walked in all lowliness and
humility towards all men, even in his greatest exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the hearts of men.</p>
                  <p>Much might be said of his long continued course of
Catechising, (that most profitable, and speedy way of
implanting knowledg) by which he set up so great, and
cleer a light in his Congregation, as will not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the wisdom, and excellency of the workman, and
guid their feet in the wayes of truth, and holiness who
have been enlightned thereby: but much facilitate the

by all that heard him in publick, or private, and that
ever knew what a Prayer of Faith, elevated to the
highest pitch by the Holy Ghost, meaneth, whether
they ever found any to excell him, or many to come
near him. O! those penitent, unbowelling confessions,
earnest deprecations, petitions, panting-longings, and
sighings after God, and his Grace; those mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
Arguments whereby he set all home, feeling
Thanksgivings, and divine raptures carrying up his
soul to Heaven in the sacred flames of his own Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
sweetly perfumed with the Incense of him
who presenteth all the Prayers of his Saints on the
Altar of Grace.</p>
                  <p>He first brought conceived Prayer into use in those
parts, wherein he was so happy, so free from imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
expressions, and unnecessary repetitions, so rich
in piercing supplications, patheticall thanksgivings, and
gracious wrestlings with the Almighty; yea, so
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62956:27"/>
dexterous to apply himself to prefer all suits, and to
fit every occasion (like an exquisite Archer, able to
shoot to an hairs breadth,) and so prompt, and full in
expressing the very hearts of those that indeed joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him, in whatsoever they desired for themselves
or others, as if, by a kind of transmigration, their
souls had passed into his, and spake the very bottom
of their hearts by his Tongue, which their own could
not utter.</p>
                  <p>And this was such an opening, and warming of his
hearers hearts before his Sermons, and such a sweet
closing up of all after his Preaching, as added much to
the power, and profit of all his labours, and was to him
a transcendent advantage in his whole Ministry. And
truly his example took so well with all the godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
that heard him, that they accounted it their
great happiness, and honour to follow, and imitate him
(with whom yet very few could keep pace) in that
most important part of a Ministers work, and office,
whereby they might be the more able to pour out their
souls, and the souls of their people into the bosom of
the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>In the Orb of his publick Ministry,<note place="margin">

in mercy to many, set it on going again, and cast him
that interrupted it out of his place, while this painfull,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62956:28"/>
and faithfull labourer went on with his work.</p>
                  <p>So much for his publick Ministry: come we now
to his private carriage.</p>
                  <p>His whole Life was exemplary.<note place="margin">His holy life.</note> Take him as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
raised by his Ministeriall function to the height
of a Beacon upon an hill, and so his light was great,
and his smell very fragrant. He not only kept himself
pure and <hi>unspotted of the world,</hi> but his light so shined,
that both good men glorified God by <hi>seeing his good
works,</hi> and wicked, and foolish men had their mouthes
stopped <hi>by his good conversation in Christ,</hi> and were
even enforced to give in testimony to it, maugre their
malice against his holiness, and worth.</p>
                  <p>In his Family,<note place="margin">His Family carriage.</note> towards the Wife of his bosom, he
walked as <hi>a man of knowledg,</hi> wisdom, and great ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deness
of love: Towards the rest of his houshold, as
<hi>David</hi> professed he would do in the 101 <hi>Psalm,</hi> and as
a Bishop of <hi>Pauls</hi> description, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Titus</hi> 1.
Yea towards all, as a worthy pattern of love, zeal, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
meekness, temperance, patience, gravity, and of
every good work.</p>
                  <p>What his constancy,<note place="margin">His studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and diligence was in his
studie, the fruits of the great, and long travell of his
mind, his Works (which praise him in all the gates of
<hi>Sion)</hi> do speak to all the world, beyond that can here
be spoken of him. For when all is said that can be
spoken of him, so much cannot be said as his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
speaks.</p>
                  <p>In his more vacant hours he was far from being
idle,<note place="margin">His usefulness to others.</note> or unprofitable. Such as had the happiness (which
was never denied to any that desired it) to partake of
his private discourses, never returned empty from his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62956:28"/>
full magazine, if they brought but vessels capable of
the overflowings of his rich mind, and heart. Very
many excellent Lights in the Church have lighted
their Torches at his Coelestial fire. Many young Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
have been marvellously improved by his prudent,
and pious directions, and encouragements in their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which now are become excellent instruments
in the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>If after his preaching he found no mention made of
his Sermon, by which he might collect, that probably
some benefit had been reaped by it, he would be much
dejected, as if the fault had been in his preaching (even
then when he seemed to excell himself,) rather than in
his hearers; and used to say, that <hi>if he had preached
better, they would have profited more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any Christians came to him for resolution in cases
of Conscience,<note place="margin">His skill to comfort others</note> or for counsell in straits, or for comfort
in spirituall desertions, or for healing of a wounded
spirit; as God had given him an excellent spirit of
discerning to judg of their condition, and of the most
seasonable applicatives; and an exquisite dexterity to
speak <hi>a word in season to the weary,</hi> and fainting soul;
so he was never shie, coy, or difficult to be spoken with,
nor lofty, or supercilious to any to whom he gave ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
but shewed forth all tenderness, pity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to them: he heard them fully, and patiently
and wisely administred to their severall distresses, and'
ever sent them away (as its said that <hi>Titus Vespasianus</hi>
did his suitors) not only not grieved, but very well
satisfied, and abundantly comforted.</p>
                  <p>He was very bountifull to his kindred that needed
it,<note place="margin">His Charity.</note> and then most when their necessities swelled highest.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62956:29"/>
He was very charitable, and open handed to the poor
members of Jesus Christ: And albeit his charity shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
most to those of his own flock, yet was it not shut
up from strangers, but he was very liberall to them
also as he found occasion. Yea, when he went abroad
to bestow the Gospell freely upon other Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
adjacent, such poor as he found to be hearers
(unless they were known to him to take up hearing
as a cloke to cover their idleness, and neglect of their
callings) never went home empty handed, but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
warmed, and cheered them with his bounty, as
well as instructed them with his Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>How much he was given to Hospitality,<note place="margin">His hospitality</note> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Ministers, Neighbours, Strangers, and the Poor,
must needs give in such an ample testimony as will
hardly be credited by such as knew him not, and are
strangers to a bountifull heart. He spared from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to administer unto others; minding more the woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of many to receive benefit by his Ministry (some
of whom might perhaps at first follow him for the
loaves) than to lay up largely for such as he should
leave behind him: and choosing rather to be at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
charg to encourage men by his bounty) than to
suffer them to be unprovided for, when they came to
partake of his Ministry.</p>
                  <p>When he conversed with Ministers,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> his Humility
usually put him into the place of a learner: but in
learning he taught, and by teaching he learned more.
He was so good, and skilfull a <hi>Chymick,</hi> that he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
parted with such company, till he had gotten
something by them: yet were they sure to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
gainers, and he alwayes accounted it the best bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
when others were gainers by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:62956:29"/>
His constant, and continuall preaching, seldom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him the much desired opportunity of hearing
others: but when he could enjoy that benefit, he gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
laid hold of it: and then would this painfull Bee
gather Hony from every Flower, making a good use of
the meanest gifts, and improving his own rich Talent
by dipping it into theirs. Nor was he ever heard to
slight or disparage the labours of any the least of his
Brethrn, that sincerely endeavoured to bring in souls
unto Christ: but alwayes he encouraged them, and as
he found cause, informed, and directed them, and that
in a prudent, and taking way, to their great advantage.</p>
                  <p>In his mirth (to which he sometimes unbended
himself to recreate his overwearied mind,<note place="margin">His mirth.</note> that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
strength he might return to his more serious,
and severer studies) he strictly observed the bounds
of honesty, civility, modesty, and the gravity of his
place; well considering, that the least dead fly in the
Apothecaries choisest Oyntment, causeth it to send
forth an unpleasing savour.</p>
                  <p>The Table was usually the place of his greatest li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in this kind,<note place="margin">His Table-Talk.</note> yet even there he would still interlace
mirth with some sprinklings of a more serious wit,
which might instruct as well as exhilerate, and make
cheerful; and contained all within the limits of sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without biting sarcasmes, or unbeseeming scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
And usually he closed all with reading some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scripture, and giving some short, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
instructions thereupon, which might administer
Grace to the hearers, and leave a sweet savour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
upon their spirits, and whole converse.</p>
                  <p>To give you a true,<note place="margin">His Character</note> and full Character of his whole
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62956:30"/>
deportment in few words. He was a good, and a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Steward in his Masters house, <hi>alwayes abounding
in the work of the Lord,</hi> a Pillar in the house of his
God, never weary of his Lords work, but best pleased
when he had done most service. His conversation
was immaculate, and unblameable: His behaviour uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and universally pious. He was grave without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
pleasant without levity: Courteous without
dissembling: Free in discourse where he might profit,
yet reserved where he saw cause: He was seldom the
first speaker although he was best able to speak. He
loved usefull discourse, but abhorred froth, and
babling. He was witty without vanity, facetious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
girding, or grieving of others. He knew his place,
yet was not insolent: Resolute he was, but not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
He maintained his authority, but was not haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
A great Master he was of his own Passions, and
Affections, and thereby abundantly furnished with
the more abilities, and embellishments that most at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and maintain the dearest love, the deepest reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and highest respect. He was a great admirer of
Learning, and Piety in others, though they were far
below himself in both: His affections were above,
though he were below: He conversed more with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
than with earth while he remained on it, and is
now <hi>a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord, and
a Royall Diadem in the hand of his God,</hi> as being an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
unto Heaven it self.</p>
                  <p>He lived in the world seventy five years (within one
moneth,)<note place="margin">His long life.</note> in which long race he saw many sad changes,
and sore storms beating hard upon the Church, tossed
with tempests, and not yet at Anchor. But never was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62956:30"/>
                     <hi>David</hi> more distressed for his dearest <hi>Jonathan,</hi> than
this man of Bowels was for the calamities of the dear
Spouse of Christ.<note place="margin">His sympathy.</note> He was most incessantly inquisitive
after the Churches estate in all Countries; A sad la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter
of all her afflictions; A daily Orator, and
mighty Advocate for her at the Throne of Grace, and
never enjoyed himself, but when he descried her under
sail towards some Creek, or Haven, wherein she might
find comfort, and rest: being much in Prayer and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
for her full reformation, and perfect deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Some good hopes whereof he conceived in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
atchievements of the Great <hi>Gustavus Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
late King of <hi>Sweden (semper Augustus:)</hi> But when
he by the sad, and unsearchable providence of the only
wise God, suddenly, and untimely fell, in the full carier
of his victories, and of the Churches hopes, and that
the Christian world was by his fall, hurled from the
height of so great expectation, he continually mourned
over the unhappy setting of that glorious <hi>Northern</hi>
Starre, as a sad presage of all the inundations of miseries
since befallen, and that still are rising higher, and higher
upon the Church of Christ, the quick, and deep sence
whereof lay close upon his heart to his dying day.</p>
                  <p>Neither was he without his sufferings,<note place="margin">His afflictions.</note> and dangers
in our uncivil Civil Wars. He was affronted by rude
Ruffians, and bloody minded Souldiers, who tyranized
over him in his own house; not permitting him quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to enjoy himself, and his God in his private study,
to which he often retired, not only from their insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
but from their Blasphemies: Even thither would
they pursue him with drawn swords, vowing his instant
Death for not complying with them in their bloody
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62956:31"/>
engagements. Yet it pleased that gracious God whom
he had so faithfully served,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> to preserve him for further
service, and to make that an hiding place for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
which they intended for his slaughter house,
and after all, to bring him to his end in peace.</p>
                  <p>When he had faithfully served his Generation,<note place="margin">His death.</note> by
the will of God, in the Gospel of his Son for above
forty seven years, he was gathered to his Fathers in
a good old Age, full of Days, and Honour, by a
blessed, and happy Death (the certain result of an
holy life) <hi>Decemb. 25. Anno Christi</hi> 1649. the day
formerly used for celebrating the Nativity of his great
Lord and Master, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>The last Testimony of the Peoples great love to him
must not be forgotten by any that desire to preserve
his precious memory in their hearts with honour.<note place="margin">His Funeral.</note> This
amply appeared by their great lamentation, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him in his sickness, and at his Death, and sad
Exequies. His Funeral was extraordinarily celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
not only by the voluntary confluence of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
number of people that ever crouded into the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Fabrick of that Church; and by many hundreds
more there assembled about the door, which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to get in: But by multitudes of Gentlemen, and
Ministers, all striving to out-mourn each other, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about his Hearse with tears, recounting his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Labors, his fruitfull Life, their great profiting by
him (as sometimes the widows about <hi>Peter,</hi> weeping,
and shewing the coats, and garments which <hi>Dorcas</hi> made
while she was with them) every one aggravating their
griefs, and losses in his gain, and striving who should
honour him most in bearing his Body to the bed
of Rest.</p>

The Testimony given him at his Interment by him
who performed that last office of love with many tears,<note place="margin">The Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note>
and which he knowingly spake from his long, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
acquaintance, and conversing with him almost
forty years together, take with you for a close in that
Ministers own words out of the Pulpit.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Although (said he) Funeral Orations are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
either the vain flourishes of mercinary tongues, or
the weak supports of an emendicated fame; and since
good mens works shall praise them in the gates, it is
but to light a candle to the Sun: and since bad mens
works cannot be covered with so thin a daub; It is but
to paint arotten Post. Yet some Testimony is due
to such as having obtained a more eminent place in
Christs mystical Body, the Church, have also been
instruments of more than ordinary good to his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
<hi>Samuel</hi> died a Judge, a Prophet; a Great
man, a Good man in <hi>Israel,</hi> and all the <hi>Israelites</hi>
were gathered together (to honour his Obsequies)
and lamented him, and buried him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 1.</p>
                     <p>To say nothing then of so rich a Cargazoon, so
full a Magazine, so rare a subject of all commendable
qualities, and admirable endowments, were a frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of your eager expectations.</p>
                     <p>To say little, were a wrong to him that deserved so
much; to say much, were both a derogation from his
merits, that may challenge, and an imputation upon
your Judgements and affections that will acknowledg
more due, than I can now deliver. Nevertheless,
since the memorial of the Just is a sweet perfume,
give me leave to strew a few of his own flowers upon
his Herse, and I will discharge your Patience.</p>

His holy Life, and consciencious courses, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Labors thrice a week in the Ministery of the
Gospel (unless in times of sickness, or necessitated
restraint) for the space of forty seven years (wherein
he could give an account of above seven thousand
elaborate Sermons preached by him) are so well
known, not only in this, or the neighbour Parishes,
but through the whole County, and the Country
round about, that I need not mention them.</p>
                     <p>Few men ever ran so long a Race without cessation,
or cespitation, so constantly, so unweariedly, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamably.</p>
                     <p>All which time he was <hi>a burning, and a shining light,</hi>
joyfully spending, and being spent for the good of
Gods people. Many, many of whom he hath guided
to Heaven before him, who received the beginnings
of spiritual life from his Ministry; and many more
shall walk in that light after him.</p>
                     <p>And from his splendent Lamp, divers faithfull
Ministers (some Triumphant before him, some Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
after him) have lighted their Candles: His <hi>Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
Lecture</hi> being more profitable to teach usefull
Divinity than an <hi>Academy,</hi> whereby he did not only,
<hi>Dolare lapides, sed artifices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two things (rarely met in one man) were both
eminent in him: A quick invention, and a sound
judgement, and these accompanied with a clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and a gracefull elocution. To which Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Humility being joyned, made him a transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Minister, and a compleat Christian.</p>
                     <p>In his sickness (full of biting pains, which he bore
with great Patience) it was his greatest grief that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62956:32"/>
God had taken him off from his labour, which was
his life and joy. His heavenly mind (like the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bodies) counted his work no weariness. If he were
weary in work, he was yet never weary of work.
His spirit was still willing when the flesh was weak:
And he often used to say in his health, <hi>Si per hanc
viam mors, sum immortalis:</hi> and in his weakness, <hi>Odi
artus, fragilemque hunc corporis usum desertorem
animi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And when he saw no more ability for labors, he
accounted it superfluous to live; and chearfully, not
only yielded, but patiently desired to die, in a satiety,
and fulness of life; not as meat loathed (as many
times natural men do) but as a dish, though well liked,
that he had fed his full of.</p>
                     <p>He had his intellectuals strong in a weak body;
witness his last Swan-like song in this place, the sweet
Doctrine of our Adoption in Jesus Christ, on <hi>Rom.
8.</hi> 16. (so far he had gone in that Chapter) most
clearly, and acuratly delivered, and aptly distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Justification, and sanctification: yet that day,
<hi>October</hi> 16. going to Church, and sensible of his
own weakness, he said to a dear Friend (who told him
that he came to see, and hear him) perhaps it may be
my last; as to all our loss, it was indeed.</p>
                     <p>And as if his motion in Gods work, had been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
he was more quick, more vigorous toward his
Center, and, like the Sun, shewed his greatest light,
when he was nearest his setting.</p>
                     <p>His last Ministerial duty privately done in great
weakness of Body (unable to go to the Church) was
the Baptizing of two children, wherein he stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62956:33"/>
such beames of Divinity; sounded such
bowels of Humanity, shewed such sweetness of
affection to his charge, that I seriously wished his
whole Congregation had heard him, in this departing
farewell. And being told how well it was approved,
he replyed with tears, in great humility, <hi>Lord, what
am I? What am I?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To diverse of his loving Neighbours, visiting him,
he often protested, that Doctrine that he had taught
them, was the truth of God, as he should answer at
the Tribunal of Christ, whereunto he was hasting,
exhorting them to stand fast therein, as he most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately
prayed for them, professing of them
with joy, <hi>I have kind friends, kind neighbours, Lord
reward them all, and grant they may find mercy with
him in that day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His desire was to give to his Neighbours (if enough
could have been had his Printed Catechism, which
(to my knowledge) hath had the approbation, and
commendation of the profoundest, and accutest
Judgements in both Universities; and well it might,
being a compleat Body of Orthodox Divinity, and
to have this assertion of the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it,—<hi>Exhorting, and testifying that this is the true
Grace of God wherein ye stand</hi>—and to subscribe his
name to it.</p>
                     <p>After he had in himself received the sentence of
death approaching (which he chearfully did, when he
saw no more likelihood of Labour) he desired his
Friends not to pray for his life; but <hi>pray God</hi> (said he)
<hi>for Faith, for Patience, for Repentance, for joy in the
Holy Ghost;</hi> and the Lord heard him in that he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62956:33"/>
for he was a rare pattern in all these, as (amongst
many others) these gracious words of his may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Lord</hi> (said he) <hi>cast me down as low as Hell in
Repentance, and lift me up by faith to the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
in confidence of thy salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I wish our proud, presumptuous, impenitentiaries
had heard him crying for Repentance, and seen him
weeping for Grace. It might, perhaps, have melted
their stony hearts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As he was full of days, so was he full of grace, full
of peace, full of assurance: The</hi> Tuesday <hi>before he
departed,</hi> This day seven night <hi>(said he)</hi> is the day on
which we have used to remember Christs Nativity, and
on which day I have preached Christ, I shall scarce
live to see it; but, For me was that Child born, unto
me was that Son given, who is, Wonderfull, Councellor,
the Mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of
peace.</p>
                     <p>And no less full was he of true Honour for his
worth, and work sake in the hearts of all that feared
God; his memory shall be blessed, and his name a
sweet perfume to posterity, when the names of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
scorners (the last brood of <hi>Beelzebub)</hi> shall
rot, and stink, and be an abhorring to all slesh.</p>
                     <p>He is now come to the end of his labour, and the
beginning of his rest. His work was with his God, and
his reward shall be from his God: Now he sees the
blessed, and blessing face of God, which is the glory
of all sights, and the sight of all glory.</p>
                     <p>Thus set this bright <hi>Occidental Star:</hi> A Star of the
first Magnitude. One of the first, and I dare say (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
envy of any, that knew him, and that knows
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62956:34"/>
himself) one of the most glorious Lights that ever
shone in this Orb, or ever is like to arise in this <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</hi>
O! how is such a publick loss to be lamented!
Of such a Champion of Christ! Such an <hi>Atlas</hi> of
the Truth! that set his shoulders to support the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
pillars thereof in these days of abounding, and
abetted errours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Well may this Parish mourn, well may this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
well may his Friends, his Family: well may we
of the Ministry bewail it, saying,</hi> O my Father, my
Father, the Chariots of Israel, and the Horsemen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of!
Ah my Brother, my Brother! I am distressed for
thee, very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Lovely and

was to lay open, not those more apparent,

vertues of evil men, and the real Graces of the
truly Godly: as likewise between the raigning sins
of Hypocrites, and the daily infirmities of the
Saints, which many times, even by quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62956:35"/>
Spectators, are both mistaken.</p>
                  <p>In prosecution whereof, he first brings forth
the Hypocrite in his best dress, and attire, and
then sets by him a Regenerate man living up to
his Rule: adding the differences between them,
thereby to unmask the Hypocrite, and to detect
his Incroachments upon the name, and priviledges
of the Saints. Secondly, he sets out a true
Childe of God, labouring under infirmities, and
an Hypocrite under the power of sin (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist with saving Grace) notwithstanding all
his flourishes, that so he may clearly distinguish a
Christian in black, from a Counterfeit in white,
and between the bewailed weaknesses of the Saints,
and the wilfull wandrings of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>A work no less needfull to all, than gratefull to

and hindering such discoveries, and by all means
discouraging those that would make them (together

                     <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1584.
His Parents were persons of considerable quality,
and of good reputation. Their condition, as to the
things of this life, competent: neither unable to defray
the expences of his education in good literature, nor
so abounding, as to be a temptation on the other hand
unto the neglect thereof: and God, who had then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined
this then tender plant, to be a Tree of Life,
for the feeding of many thousands, and to be a chosen
Vessel to bear his Name before the Nations, in way
thereunto, he inspired his Parents with an effectuall
sollicitude concerning the ordering of this their Son in
his minority.</p>
                  <p>This care in his Parents was quickly above expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

who more, and more encreased great hopes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him throughout the whole time of his minority,
wherein he was trained up in the <hi>Grammar</hi> School of
<hi>Derby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was about the age of thirteen,<note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                     </note> he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into <hi>Trinity</hi> College in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> where his
industry was great, and his profiting in the Arts, and
Languages above his equals, so far commended him
to the Master, and Fellows, as that he had undoubtedly
been chosen Fellow of that College, had not their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
expence about building of their great Hall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62956:36"/>
at that time put it by, or at least, deferred their election,
untill some longer time.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Trinity</hi> he was removed to <hi>Emanuel,</hi> that
happy Seminary both of Piety,<note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Emanuel.</hi>
                     </note> and Learning: and in
that Society the Lord gave him favour, so that in due
time he was honoured with a Fellowship amongst
them; when he was elected to it, after a diligent, and
strict examination according to the Statutes of the
College; wherein this is not unworthy the taking
notice of; that when the Poser came to examine him
in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, the place that he made triall of
him by, was that portion of Scripture, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>,
wherein the Prophet declaims against the pride, and
haughtiness of the <hi>Daughters of Sion;</hi> which Text
hath more hard words in it, than any other place of the
Bible, within so short a compass: and therefore, though
a present construction, and resolution thereof, might
have put a good <hi>Hebrician</hi> to a stand, yet such was his
ability, and dexterity, as made those hard words facil,
and easie,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and rendred him a prompt respondent. And
this providence is further remarkable about him, That
whereas his Father (whose calling was towards the
Law) was but obscure, and had not many Clients that
made use of his advice in Law-matters before; it
pleased God after his Sons going to <hi>Cambridg,</hi> to bless
him with great practice, so that he was very able to
keep him there, and to allow him full, and liberall
maintenance; Insomuch as this blessed man hath been
oft heard to say, <hi>God kept me in the University.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being thus advanced,<note place="margin">His Industry.</note> he was in the place of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
beset with Examples as so many objects of
better emulation. If he slacken his pace, his compeers
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62956:36"/>
will leave him behinde: and though he quicken it, there
are still those that are before him: But he was, not
only a lover of Labour, but Communicative of his
Learning, and therefore he proved a diligent Tutor,
and had many young Students committed to his care.
He was a <hi>Didactical</hi>-man, both able, and apt to teach:
and truly ability to instruct youth argues a Wise man:
and to be willing to teach, argues a good man: For
goodness is communicative: And such was his <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi>
dexterity,<note place="margin">His prudence.</note> that he could impart (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> speaks)
the felicities of wit to his hearers, so accomodating
and insinuating the matter in hand, as that his Pupils
might both perceive their profiting, and taste the
sweetness of that wherein they profited. Thus by
his School-stratagems he won the hearts of his Pupils
both to himself, and to a desire of Learning: they
were each to other as the Prophets, and the sons of
the Prophets: his Pupils were honourers, and lovers
of him: and he was a Tutor, a Friend, and a Father
unto them.</p>

own relation was thus. During his residence in the
University, God began to work upon him by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of Mr. <hi>William Perkins</hi> of blessed memory:
But the motions, and stirrings of his heart which then
were, he suppressed, thinking that if he should trouble
himself with matters of Religion, according to the
light he had then received, it would be an hinderance
to him in his Studies, which then he had much addicte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
himself unto. Therefore he was willing to silence
those suggestions, and inward Callings which he had
from Gods Spirit, and did wittingly defer the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62956:37"/>
of that work until afterwards. At length, as he
was walking in the fields, he heard the Bell tolling for
Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> who lay a dying, whereupon he was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
glad in his heart, that he should now be rid of
him, who had (as he said) laid siege to, and beleagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his heart. This became matter of much affliction
to him afterwards, God keeping it upon his Spirit,
with the aggravation of it, and making it an effectual
means of convincing, and humbling him in the sight,
and sense of the natural enmity that is in mans nature
against God. Afterward hearing Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> (then
Mr.<hi>Sibs</hi>) preaching a Sermon about Regeneration,
wherein he shewed, First, what Regeneration was
not, and so opening the state of a meer Civil man,
Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> saw his own condition fully discovered,
which (through Gods mercy) did drive him to a stand,
as plainly seeing himself, destitute of true Grace, all
his false hopes, and grounds now failing him: and so
he lay for a long time, in an uncomfortable despairing
way: and of all other things this was his heaviest bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
that he had wittingly withstood the means, and
offers of Grace and mercy which he found had been
tendered to him; thus he continued till it pleased God
to let in a word of Faith into his heart, and to cause
him to look unto Christ for his healing, which word
also was dispensed unto him by the same Doctor <hi>Sibs,</hi>
which begat in him a singular, and constant love to the
said Doctor, of whom he was also answerably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
                  <p>That which frist made him famous in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
was his Funeral Oration for Doctor <hi>Some,</hi>

of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> Elocution, and Oratorious
beauty of the whole, as that he was thenceforth look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at as another <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or <hi>Musa Attica,</hi> throughout
the University.</p>
                  <p>Some space of time intervening, he was called to
preach at St. <hi>Maries,</hi> where he preached a University
Sermon, with high Applause from the <hi>Academical</hi>
Wits, insomuch as the fame of his Learning grew
greater, and greater. And afterwards being again
called to preach in the same place (as one Oration of
<hi>Pericles</hi> left his hearers with an Appetite after another)
so the memory of his former accurate Exercises, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Colleges, especially the young Students,
with a fresh expectation of such Elegancies of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as made them flock to the Sermon with an <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Itch after some new thing, as to the ornaments of
<hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and abstruser notions of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> But
his spirit now savouring of the Cross of Christ more
than of humane Literature, and being taught of God
to distinguish between the <hi>Word of Wisdom,</hi> and the
Wisdom of Words, <hi>his speech, and preaching was
not now with the enticing words of mans wisdom, but in
the demonstration of the Spirit, and of power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The disappointed expectation of the Auditory soon
appeared in their countenances, and the discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their non-acceptance returned him unto his
Chamber, not without some sad thoughts of heart:
Where yet he had not been long, but lo, Dr. <hi>Preston</hi>
(then Mr. <hi>Preston)</hi> knocks at his Chamber door,<note place="margin">He converted Dr. <hi>Preston.</hi>
                     </note> and
coming in, acquainted him with his spiritual condition,
and tells him how it had pleased God to work effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62956:38"/>
upon his heart by that Sermon: After which Dr.
<hi>Preston</hi> ever highly prized him, and both fully, and
strongly closed with him: which real Seal of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Ministery much comforted his soul, far above
what the present less acceptance of the Auditory had
dejected him, or their former acceptance had encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
him.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Concio ad Clerum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His great Learning.</note> or <hi>Latine</hi> Sermon, which
he preached when he proceeded Bachelor of Divinity
(which was after he had been at <hi>Boston</hi> about half a
year) was very much admired, and commended. His
Text was, <hi>Mat. 5. 13. Vos estis sal terrae: quod si sal
infatuatus fuerit, quo salietur?</hi> Ye are the salt of the
earth; but if the salt hath lost its savour, wherewith
shall it be salted? In handling of which Text, both the
weight of the matter, the elegancy of Phrase, <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi>
strains, grave, sweet, and spiritual pronunciation,
rendred him yet more famous. The like did his answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Divinity Act in the Schools, having a very
acute Opponent [Mr. <hi>William Chappel]</hi> to dispute
with him. So that in <hi>Cambridge</hi> the name of Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
was much set by.</p>
                  <p>Unto this earthen vessel,<note place="margin">His call to <hi>Boston.</hi>
                     </note> thus filled with Heavenly
Treasure, the Inhabitants of <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi>
made their address, saying, <hi>Come and help us.</hi> And in
that Candlestick the Father of Lights placed this
burning, and shining Light: To whom he removed
from <hi>Cambridge</hi> about the twenty eight year of his
Age. At his first coming, he met with some obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
from the <hi>Diocesan,</hi> then Bishop <hi>Barlo,</hi> who told
him that he was a young man, and therefore unfit to
be set over such a divided people: Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> being
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62956:38"/>
ingenious, and undervaluing himself, thought so too,
and purposed to return to the College again: But
some of his <hi>Boston</hi> Friends, understanding that one
<hi>Simon Biby</hi> was to be spoken with, who was neer to
the Bishop, they presently charmed him, and so the
business proceeded without any further trouble, and
Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> was admitted into the place after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in those days.</p>
                  <p>Two things are here not unworthy our observation,<note place="margin">His Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>
which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> would sometimes speak of to his
Friends: First, That in the beginning of his Ministery
he was exercised with some inward troubles which
much dejected him. And indeed, good spirits are
much bettered by their conflicts with the worst of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
Spiritual Preachers are often trained up in the
School of temptation. So true is that <hi>Theological
maxime,</hi> Meditation, Prayer, and Temptation make
a Divine. This Dispensation of the All-wise God,
he afterwards found, not only to be beneficiall unto
him, in preparing his heart for his work: but also
that it became an effectual means of his more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and comfortable settlement in that place, where
the people were divided amongst themselves, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a potent man in the Town, who adhered to
another <hi>Cambridge</hi> man whom he would faign have
brought in. But when he saw Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with his own exercises of spirit, he was free
from all suspition of his being Pragmatical, or addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to siding with this or that party; and so both he and
his party began to close more fully with him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas there was an <hi>Arminian</hi> party in
that Town, some of whom were witty, and troubled
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62956:39"/>
others with Disputes about those points; by Gods
blessing upon his Labours in holding forth positively
such truths, as undermined the foundations of <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism,</hi>
those Disputes ceased, and the Tenets of
<hi>Arminianism</hi> were no more pleaded for. Thus God
disposeth of the hearts of hearers, as that generally
they are all open and loving to their Preachers at their
first entrance.</p>
                  <p>For three or four years he lived,<note place="margin">His troubles.</note> and preached
amongst them without opposition. They accounted
themselves happy (as well they might) in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him; both the Town and Country there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
being much bettered, and reformed by his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
But after he was not able to bear the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
imposed, his <hi>Non-Conformity</hi> occasioned his
trouble in the Bishops Court at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> from whence
he was advised to appeal to an higher Court: and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
Mr. <hi>Leveret</hi> (who afterwards was one of the
<hi>Ruling Elders</hi> of the Church of <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi>
to deal in that business, and he (like <hi>Jacob)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a plain man, yet piously subtile to get such a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
blessing, so far insinuated himself into one of
the Proctors of that high-Court, that Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> was
treated by them, as if he were a Conformable man,
and so was restored unto <hi>Boston.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this time he was blessed with a successfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
unto the end of twenty years. In which space
he on the Lords Dayes in the afternoons, went over
the whole Body of Divinity in a <hi>Catechistical</hi> way
thrice,<note place="margin">His Labours.</note> and gave the heads of his Discourse to those
that were yong Scholars, &amp; others in the Town, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
his questions in publick in that great congregation:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62956:39"/>
and after their Answers, he opened those heads of
Divinity; and finally applied all to the edification of
his people, and of such strangers as came to hear him.
In the morning of the Lords Dayes he preached over
the first six Chapters of the Gospel of St. <hi>John:</hi> the
whole Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes;</hi> the Prophesie of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi>
and many other Scriptures; and when the Lords
Supper was administred (which was usual every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

he preached upon, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. &amp; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.
the whole Chapter, besides some other Scriptures
concerning that subject. On his Lecture days, he
preached through the whole first, and second Epistles
of <hi>John,</hi> the whole Book of <hi>Solomons Song;</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables
of our Saviour set forth in <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel to
the end of Chapter the 16th. comparing them
with <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke:</hi> He took much pains in private,
and read to sundry young Scholars that were in his
House,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is Industry.</note> and to some that came out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and
had his house full of Auditors: Afterwards, seeing
some inconvenience in the Peoples flocking to his
House, besides his ordinary Lecture on the <hi>Thursdays,</hi>
he preached thrice more in publick on the week days:
<hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>Wednesdays,</hi> and <hi>Thursdays,</hi> early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and on <hi>Saturdays</hi> at three a clock in the afternoon.
Only these three last Lectures were performed by him
but some few years before he had another famous Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league.</p>
                  <p>He was frequent in Duties of Humiliation,<note place="margin">His holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> and
Thanksgiving: Sometimes he continued five or six
hours in Prayer, and opening the Word: So indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable
was he in the Lords Work: so willing to spend,
and be spent therein. Besides, he answered many Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62956:40"/>
that were sent him far and near, wherein were
handled many difficult Cases of Conscience, and many
doubts cleared to great satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>He was a man exceedingly beloved,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and admired
of the best, and reverenced of the worst of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
He was in great favour with Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> the
then Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who much esteemed him for
his Learning, and when he was <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> of the
Great Seal, he went to King <hi>James,</hi> and speaking of
Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> great Learning and worth; the King was
willing, notwithstanding his <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> to give
way that he should have his <hi>Liberty</hi> in his Ministry
without interruption: which was the more remarkable
considering how that Kings Spirit was carried out
against such wayes. Also, the Earl of <hi>Dorchester,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Old Boston,</hi> and hearing Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> preaching
about Civil Government, he was so affected with the
wisdom of his words, and spirit, that he did ever after
highly account of him, and put himself forth what he
could in the time of Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> troubles to deliver
him out of them, that so his <hi>Boston</hi> might still enjoy
him as formerly; but his desires were too strongly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be accomplished.</p>
                  <p>About this time he married his second Wife, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss
<hi>Sarah Story,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Marriage.</note> then a Widow. He was blessed
above many in his Marriages, both his Wives being
pious Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ons, grave, sober, and faithfull. By the
first he had no children: the last, God made a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Vine unto him: His first-born was brought forth
far off upon the Sea, in his passage to <hi>New England:</hi>
So that he being childless when he left <hi>Europe,</hi> arrived
a joyfull Father in <hi>America:</hi> In memorial whereof he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62956:40"/>
called his name <hi>Sea-born, to keep alive</hi> (said he) <hi>in me,
and to teach my Son, if he live, a remembrance of Sea-mercies,
from the hand of a gracious God:</hi> He is yet
living, and entred into the Work of the Ministry. A
Son of many Prayers, and of great expectation.</p>
                  <p>The corruption of the times being now such,<note place="margin">His troubles.</note> that
he could not continue in the exercise of his Ministery
without sin; and the envy of his maligners having
now procured <hi>Letters Missive</hi> to convent him before
the <hi>High Commission Court,</hi> which Letters a debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Inhabitant of that Town undertook to serve upon
him (who shortly after died of the Plague.)<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor.</note> Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
having intelligence thereof, and well-knowing
that nothing but scorns, and imprisonment were to
be expected from them, according to the advice of
many able heads, and upright hearts (amongst whom
that holy man of God, Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> of blessed memory,
had a singular influence) he kept himself close for a
time, in, and about <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> sometime did at
<hi>Wittenberg;</hi> and <hi>Paraeus</hi> since at <hi>Anvilla:</hi> Yet was
not that season of his recess unprofitable:<note place="margin">He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> For addresses
during that time were made unto him privately by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
persons of worth, and piety, who received satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
from him in their Cases of Conscience of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
concernment. And when he went into <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
it was not a flight from duty, but from evident
danger, and unto duty: Not from the profession of
the truth, but unto a more opportune place for the
profession of it.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> arrived at <hi>New England,</hi> his
manner of entrance unto them was with much bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.<note place="margin">His arrivall in <hi>New Engl.</hi>
                     </note>
For at his first coming he found them not free
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62956:41"/>
from troubles about setling the matters both of Church
and Commonwealth. At which time, being requested,
he preached before the general Court: His Text was,
<hi>Haggai 2. 4. Yet now be strong, O</hi> Zerubbabel, <hi>saith
the Lord, Be strong, O</hi> Joshua <hi>the son of</hi> Josedek, <hi>the
High Priest, and be strong all ye people of the Land,
saith the Lord, and work: For I am with you, saith the
Lord of Hosts:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> And the Lord working mightily by
this Sermon, all obstructions were presently removed,
and the spirits of all sorts, as one man, were excited
unanimously, and vigorously in the work of the Lord
from that very day.</p>
                  <p>In order whereunto, the Court considering, that
all the Members of that <hi>Republick,</hi> were also Church
Members, and therefore to be governed according to
the Law of God, they desired Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> to draw
an abstract of the <hi>Judicial Laws</hi> delivered from God
to <hi>Moses,</hi> so far forth as they were of Moral, <hi>i. e.</hi> of
perpetual, and universal equity; which accordingly
he did, advising them to persist in their purpose of esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
a <hi>Theocraty, i. e.</hi> Gods Government, over
Gods people.<note place="margin">Magistrates and Ministers united.</note> From this time it was a usual thing
for the Magistrates to consult with the Ministers in
hard and difficult cases, especially about matters of
Religion: yet so, as notwithstanding occasional con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
Religious care was had of avoiding confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Councils. After which time how usefull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Cotton</hi> was to <hi>Old England,</hi> to <hi>New England,</hi> to
Magistrates, to Ministers, to People, in Publick, in
Private, by Preaching, by Counsel, and resolving dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
questions, all know that knew him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
saw the Grace of God so evidently manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in him.</p>

                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:62956:41"/>
In the course of his Ministry in <hi>New Boston,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Labours.</note> by way
of Exposition he went over the Old Testament to
<hi>Isaiah</hi> the 30. The whole New Testament once
through, and the second time to the middle of <hi>Hebrews</hi>
the 7th. Upon the Lords Days, and Lecture Days,
he preached through the <hi>Acts of the Apostles:</hi> the
Prophesies of <hi>Haggai, Zechariah, Ezra,</hi> the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Ecclesiastes, Canticles:</hi> the second, and third
Epistles of <hi>John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The success of the Ministry.</note> the Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> both the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
to <hi>Timothy;</hi> the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> with
other Scriptures. The presence of the Lord being
with him, and Crowning his Labours with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of many Souls, and the edification of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands.
Besides these aforementioned Labors, he hath
many pieces in Print, which being well known, need
not be here enumerated.</p>
                  <p>His youth was unstained, whence he was so much
the more capable of being an excellent Instrument in
the Church in his elder days. He that will do good
in the Church, <hi>must have a good report of them which
are without, lest he fall into the reproach, and snare of
the Devil, 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 7. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> tels us, that <hi>A
good life is requisite in respect of our selves, but a good
name is requisite in respect of others.</hi> We may be
good men if we have a good Conscience, but we are
not like to do much good, if we have not a good
name.</p>
                  <p>He was a general Scholar,<note place="margin">His learning and studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> studious to know all
things, the want whereof might in one of his Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
be denomitated ignorance, and piously ignorant of
those things, the nescience whereof made him more
Learned. Deservedly therefore is his praise great in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62956:42"/>
all the Churches, that he not only gave himself to the
acquiring of Learning, but exceeded many that had
done vertuously therein. He excelled in the greater
part of the <hi>Encuclopaidia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those which best knew his goings out,<note place="margin">His piety.</note> and his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in, cannot but give a large testimony to his Piety.
He was a Saint (above many of the Saints) manifestly
declared in the Consciences of the Godly amongst
whom he walked, to be <hi>the Epistle of Christ, known,
and read of all men.</hi> In his house he <hi>walked with a
perfect heart.</hi> He was an example to the Flock;
clothed with love, and humility amongst his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
One of a thousand in respect of his worth:
But (as it is reported of Dr. <hi>Whitaker)</hi> as one of
the multitude in respect of his facile, and companion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
behaviour.<note place="margin">His Humility.</note> Both ability, and modesty in such a
degree, are not ordinarily to be found in the same
man. Others with much affection beheld the beauty
of his face, whilest himself was as one who knew not
that his face shined. He was a Father, Friend, and
Brother to his fellow-Elders, and a shining Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all men.</p>
                  <p>He well knew that a Bishop ought not to be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in the well government of his Family:<note place="margin">His Family carriage.</note> He must
be <hi>one that rules well his own house:</hi> In conscience
whereof, he himself rising betimes in the morning,
as soon as he was ready, he called his Family together
(which was also his practice in the evening) to the
solemn worship of God, reading, and expounding,
and occasionally also applying the Scriptures unto
them, alwayes beginning, and ending with Prayer.
In case of sin committed by child or servant, he would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62956:42"/>
call them aside privately (the matter so requiring)
laying the Scriptures before them, and causing them
to read that part which bore witness against such an
offence: Seldome or never correcting in anger, that
the dispensation of godly Discipline might not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pured,
or become less effectuall, through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing
of humane passion.</p>
                  <p>He began the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Sabbath imployment.</note> on the <hi>Saturday</hi> evening:
and therefore then performed Family duties after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
being larger then ordinary in Exposition, after
which he Catechized his children, and Servants, and
then returned into his Study. The morning follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Family worship being ended, he retired into his
Study untill the Bell called him away. Upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the Congregation, he returned again into
his Study (the place of his Labour, and Prayer) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his private devotion; where (having a small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past
carried him up for his dinner) he continued till the
toling of the Bell. The publick service being ended,
he withdrew for a space into his aforementioned Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
for his sacred addresses unto God, as in the
forenoon: Then came down, repeated the Sermon in
his Family, prayed, and after Supper sang a <hi>Psalm,</hi>
and, towards bed time, betaking himself again to his
Study, he closed the day with Prayer. Thus he
spent the <hi>Sabbath</hi> continually.</p>
                  <p>In his Study,<note place="margin">His depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God.</note> he neither sate down unto, nor arose
from his Meditations without Prayer: Whilest his
eyes were upon his Book, his expectation was from
God. He had learned to Study, because he had
learned to Pray. An able Student is a Gospel Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
because unable to Study without Jesus Christ.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62956:43"/>
The barrenness of his Meditation at some times, yea
though his endeavour was most intense upon a good
matter, convinced him whence it was, that his heart
musing upon the same Subject at another time, his
tongue became as the Pen of a ready writer. As he
was not (comparatively) wanting in parts, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Industry; so was he most carefull not to trust
in them, but to fix his dependance wholly upon God.
Herein he was not unlike to blessed <hi>Bradford</hi> who stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
kneeling. Another <hi>Synesius,</hi> who was wont to
divide his life between Prayer, and his Book. Like
unto <hi>Paul, Not sufficient of himself to think any thing
as of himself,</hi> and professing all his <hi>sufficiency to be of
God. But we will give our selves</hi> (say the Apostles)
<hi>continually unto Prayer, and to the Ministry of the Word.</hi>
Men of labour, they were, and men of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>As any weighty cause presented it self either in the
Church,<note place="margin">His Fastings.</note> Commonwealth, or his Family, he used to
set dayes apart to seek the face of God in secret: Such
were the bowels of this spirituall Father, <hi>the Horsmen,
and Chariots of this Israel.</hi> He might say with <hi>Paul,
He was in fastings often.</hi> His conversation upon
earth was a trading in Heaven. A demonstration of
the praises of him who hath called him. A tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that holiness, sweetness, and love, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
gained upon the hearts of many spectators.
The habituall gracious scope of his heart in his whole
Ministry, is not illegible in that usuall subscription of
his at the end of all his Sermons, <hi>Tibi Domine.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy honour, O Lord. A tast of the divine <hi>Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies</hi>
between God and his soul, you may please to
take notice of from these two transcribed Poems

left behind him in his Study, written with his own
hand.</p>

                  <p>A Disputation is well called the Sieve of truth:<note place="margin">His Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> So
in his Polemical labors he was a seeker thereof in love:
His scope was, the Glory of God, Unity of the Church,
and the edification of men, not the ostentation of wit. It
was his holy ambition, not to seem to be learned, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to be bettered. A sincere seeker of <hi>light,</hi> not of
victory. Witness his Brotherly acceptance of Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi>
his Examination of Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> Treatise <hi>of Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
from whom he acknowledged that he received
light thereby, and was ready to attest the great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Doctor, that Star (if any in this age) of the
first magnitude. It is true, Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> mind was
then exercised about the point of Reprobation.
Touching the point of Election, it is sufficiently
known that he was not only Orthodox, but also cleer.
As there were of old that pretended the <hi>Predestinarian
Heresie</hi> to have had it's rise from St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and
<hi>Grevinchovius</hi> of late blushed not to say of famous Dr.
<hi>Ames,</hi> who was, <hi>Arminianorum malleus, Amesius
Pelagianizat.</hi> Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> playes the <hi>Pelagian:</hi> So,
the wonder is less, if this sound, and judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
hath not escaped the imputation of <hi>Arminianism</hi>
from some, notwithstanding the redundant Testimony
of his Doctrine, and generally of all that knew him, to
the contrary; yea, that occasionally he hath been heard
to say, by Testimony yet alive, and above exception,
that he looked at <hi>Arminianism</hi> as <hi>another Gospel,</hi> and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62956:45"/>
directly contrary to the Covenant of Grace. What
<hi>Melancthon</hi> sometimes said to <hi>Eccius,</hi> may be here
truly applied to him: Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in his Disputations
sought not his own Glory, but Gods Truth So able
an Opponent was rare, so candid an Opponent was
more rare. He that fell into his hands, was likely to
fall soft enough ordinarily (except through his own
default) not likely to lose any thing save his
error.</p>
                  <p>A mans wisdom makes his face to shine:<note place="margin">His Wisdome.</note> He had
an happy, a quick comprehensive, and benign under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
as having received the manifestation of the
Spirit, for the service and profit of others. To disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the mind of God, and therewith the sentence of
Judgment, in matters too hard for inferiour Judges,
was no small part, both of the worth, and usefulness of
him that was to minister before the Lord. So it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
good to the Father of Lights to make this happy
Instrument, not only to excel his Brethren, but in
many respects, upon this account to excel himself:
A Grace so far acknowledged in him, as that all sorts,
both the Magistrates, and private Persons, whether
learned, or unlearned, exercised with their respective
Cases of conscience, waited under God, in a special
manner upon his lips for knowledge, <hi>and sought the
Law at his mouth.</hi> So equal a contention between
learning and meekness, is seldom visible in any one
person. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>meekest on Earth</hi> in his dayes.</p>

mention thereof. It is true, he had an advantage
above many in his natural constitution, and it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
from his education, heightened intellectuals,
and moralities, was not inconsiderable; but that
which gave the being of meekness, which sanctified,
and perfected all, was the Grace of Christ. He was
of an accute apprehension, and therefore sensible of,
but yet so little in his own sight, that he was not easily
provoked by an injury. Sensibleness of dishonor
done to God by sin, or of what the offender had done
unto himself by sinning, left such impressions upon him,
as that his taking notice of any injury done unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
was not usually taken notice of. He had well
learned that lesson of <hi>Gregory: It is better many times
to fly from an injury by silence, than to overcome it by
replying.</hi> It was <hi>Grynaeus</hi> his manner, to revenge
wrongs by Christian taciturnity. If inferiors expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulated
unnecessarily with him, he would patiently
hear them, and give them a brotherly account, paci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fying
their minds with a gentle, grave, and respectiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

answer. Take one instance in this kind instead of
many; unto one of his hearers, then sick of singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and therefore the less able to bear sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
following him home after his publick labours in
the Congregation, and instead of better incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
telling him that his Ministry was become either
dark, or flat: He gently answered? Both, Brother,
without further opening his mouth in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
choosing rather to own the imputation, than
to expostulate with the Imputer.</p>
                  <p>Disputations are great trials of the spirits of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
men.<note place="margin">His Modest</note> 
                     <hi>Hooper</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> were patient Martyrs,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62956:46"/>
but somewhat impatient Disputers. The <hi>Synod</hi> held
at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> as matters were then
circumstanced; was unto this good man an hour of
temptation, above what had ordinarily befaln him in
his Pilgrimage: yet such was his eminent behaviour
throughout, as argued in the consciences of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
singular patience, and left him a Mirrour for the
temperament, mildness, and government of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Pious meekness fits for Church Society. Yet
though he was so gentle, meek, and flexible, that men
might perswade him above what could be expected
usually from a man of his worth, in the things of God
he was steadfast, and unmovable. The Sanctuary
cannot want the fire that is from Heaven, neither
may it be touched with the fire that is from Hell.
Gentleness of disposition, when actuated by Christ,
makes us so much the more acceptable, and profitable
unto man: But if the Spirit withdraweth his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
we fall short of reaching Gods ends, and the
seasonable suppressing of exorbitancies. If this good
man had alwayes had that voice sounding in his heart,
which one wished that mild <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen</hi> might

might, by Gods blessing, have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                  <p>But ordinarily, and in matters of greatest weight
the Lord was with him. Though his forbearance was
both observable, and very imitable in things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
himself; yet he could not forbear them whom
he knew to be evil. An experience whereof he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62956:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some Heterodox spirits, by their specious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
about <hi>Free-Grace</hi> and subtle concealings of
their Principles, so far deceived him into a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of them than there was cause, as that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they fathered their Errors upon him in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and abused his Doctrine to the countenancing of
their denial of Inherent Grace in particular, yet was
he slow to beleeve these things of them, and slower
to bear witness against them. But so soon as the truth
herein appeared to him, hear his own words taken out
of his Letter to Mr. <hi>Davenport; The truth is</hi> (saith he)
<hi>the body of the Island is bent to backslding into Errour,
and Delusions: the Lord pitty, and pardon them, and me
also, who have been so slow to see their windings and
subtil contrivances, and insinuations in all their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,
whilst they propagated their opinions under my

was his ingenuity and piety as that his soul was not
satisfied without often breaking forth into affectionate
bewailing of his infirmity herein in the publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
sometimes in his Prayer, sometimes in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and that with tears.</p>
                  <p>He was a man of an ingenuous and pious candour,<note place="margin">His Candor.</note>
rejoycing (as opportunity was offered) to take notice
of, and to bear witness to the gifts of God in his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
thereby drawing the hearts of them to him, and
of others to them, and that to the encouragement of
them, and the edification of many. He did not think
himself a loser by putting honour upon his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourers,
but was willing that they should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with him in the love and esteem of the
people. He was not only a son of Peace, enjoying

continually the feast of a good conscience,<note place="margin">His Peace-making</note> with sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and tranquillity of affections at home, but also a
peace-maker, quallified by the graces aforementioned
to be a choice Instrument in the hand of the Prince of
Peace amongst the Churches, where if any difference
arose, Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> was ready (being called thereunto)
to afford his help for the composin; of them; and had
a singular faculty and ability therein, by reason of
that excellent wisdome, and moderation of spirit which
God in Christ had given him, whose blessing also
did ordinarily crown his endeavours with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
                  <p>He was one, the reality of whose profession gave

of this life, exempted him from being an object of
envy in that behalf; yet behold, <hi>Quantum ex quantillo,</hi>
so much communicated out of so little; we may not
here be altogether silent concerning the Grace of
God bestowed upon him, whereby according to his
power, yea above his power, he was benificent unto
others, but especially to those of the Houshold of
Faith. The Gospel opened his heart, his lips, and the
doors of his house. He well remembred that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,

there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to poverty.</hi> As also, <hi>The liberal soul shall be made

Ministry were entertained with peculiar contentment.
By one instance see his spirit in the rest, A certain
Minister who had gotten into the fellowship of that
eminent man Mr. <hi>Arthur Hildersham,</hi> and many other
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62956:47"/>

a little Church whereof the Reverend Mr. <hi>White</hi> was

the will of his Adversaries, who gave him not over till
they had bereaved him of much of his livelihood, his
liberty, Country, and therewithall of the sweet so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of lovers, friends, and many wayes endeared
acquaintance, more precious to him than life it self.</p>
                  <p>Yet the measure of the afflictions of Christ, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be suffered by him, was not so fulfilled; but
lo, in the time of his exile, some Brethren, provoked by
the censure of Authority, though justly, &amp; not without
tears inflicted upon them, singled out Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> as
the object of their displeasure, who (though above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men) declining irregular and unnecessary inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resting
himself in the actions of the Magistrate, and
(while opportunity lasted) endeavouring their healing,
yet they requited him evil for good, and they (at least
some of them) who were formerly companions with
him in the tribulations of that <hi>Patmos,</hi> yea respecters of
him, had <hi>taken sweet counsel together, and they had walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the house of God</hi> as friends. Hence was he with
Tongue and pen blasphemed by them, for whom he
formerly intreated, and for whom, he both then, and
afterwards wept, and put on sackcloth.</p>
                  <p>As touching any Tenet wherein he may seem singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
remember that he was a man, and therefore to be
heard and read with judgement, and happily sometimes
with favour. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> makes a difference between
reading the writings of the Apostles, and other men.

                     <hi>They</hi> (saith he) <hi>alwayes speak the truth, these as men
sometimes erre.</hi> But no man did more placidly bear a
Dissentient than he. It contributes much towards the
fuller discovery of truth, when men of larger capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
and greater industry than others may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to communicate their Notions; onely they
should use this liberty by way of disquisition, not of
Position, rather as searchers after Scripture-light, than
as <hi>Dictators</hi> of private opinions.</p>
                  <p>But now this <hi>Western</hi> Sun hastens to his setting: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called to preach at a neighbour Church, he took
wet in his passage over the Ferry, and, not many hours
after, he felt the effect of it, being seized upon with an
extream ilness in his Sermon time. This sad provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
when others bewailed, he comforted himself in
that he was found so doing. <hi>Decet Imperatorem stantem
mori.</hi> It is the honour of a Commander to dye stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
St. <hi>Austins</hi> usual with was, that when Christ
came, he might finde him, <hi>Aut praecantem, aut praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantem;</hi>
either praying, or preaching. <hi>Calvin</hi> would
not that when the Lord came, he should finde him
idle. After a short time he complained of the infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of his lungs,<note place="margin">His Sickness.</note> and thereupon found himself
<hi>Asthmatical,</hi> and afterward <hi>Scorbutical</hi> (which both
meeting in a complicated disease, put an end to his
dayes) insomuch that he was forced to give over
those comforting drinks which his stomack could not
want. If he still used them, the inflamation grew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable,
and threatned a more sharp, and speedy
death. If he left them, his stomack forthwith ceased
to perform its office, leaving him without hope of
life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:62956:49"/>
By these Messengers he received the sentence of
death, yet in the use of means he attended the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of him in whose hands our times are; his labours
continued whilst his strength failed: <hi>November</hi> the
18. he took in course for his Text the four last verses
of the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy, Salute Prisca and
Aquila, &amp;c.</hi> Giving the reason why he spake of so
many verses together, because otherwise he said, he
should not live to make an end of that Epistle. He
chiefly insisted upon those words, <hi>Grace be with you all;</hi>
so ending that Epistle, and his Lectures together. For
upon the Lords day following he preached his last
Sermon upon <hi>Joh. 1. 14. And the Word was made
Flesh, and dwelt among us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (and we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the onely begotten Son of the Father) full of Grace
and Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now he gave himself wholly to prepare for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
making his Will, and setting his house in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
When he could no more be seen abroad, all sorts,
Magistrates, Ministers, Neighbours, and Friends afar
off, and those near at hand, especially his own people
resorted to him daily, as to a publick Father. When
the neighbour Ministers visited him (in which duty
they were frequent) he thanked them affectionately
for their love, exhorting them also as an <hi>Elder, and a
witness of the sufferings of Christ, to feed the Flock,</hi>
encouraging them, that when the <hi>chief Shepherd shall
appear, they should receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth
not away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finding himself to grow weak, according to that of
<hi>James,</hi> he sent for the Elders of the Church of <hi>Boston</hi>
to pray over him, which last solemn duty being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62956:49"/>
not without much affection, and many tears:
Then (as <hi>Polycarp</hi> a little before his death said, <hi>That he
had served Christ fourscore and six years, neither had he
ever offended him in any thing)</hi> so he told them (through
Grace, he had now served God forty years, it being
so long since his conversion) throughout which time
he had ever found him faithful to him; and thereupon
he took occasion to exhort them to the like effect,
that <hi>Paul</hi> sometime did the Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> a little
before they were to see his face no more, <hi>Take heed
therefore to your selves, and to all the Flock over w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Lord hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of
God which he hath purchased with his own blood.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
he lamented that the love of many, yea, and
some of their own Congregation was grown cold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the publick Ordinances, calling upon them so
much the more for their watchfulness in that respect;
which done, he thanked them for their loving and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
assistance to him in their holy fellowship, and
commended them to the blessing of God.</p>
                  <p>His pious Consort, and those Olive Plants that
sate lately about his Table, now gathered together
about the Bed of a dying Husband, and departing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This was his last solemn transaction with man
in this world: Silver and Gold (though he wanted not)
he had not much to give them, but the blessing of a

faithful Pastor of that Church, taking his last leave of
him, and most ardently praying unto God that he
would lift up the light of his countenance upon him,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62956:50"/>
and shed his love into his soul, he presently answered,
<hi>He hath done it already, Brother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His work now finished with all men, perceiving his
departure to be at hand, and having nothing else to
do, but onely that great work of dying in the Lord,
he wholly composed, and set himself for his dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
desiring that he might be permitted to improve
that little remnant of his life without impediment to
his private Devotions, and divine <hi>Soliloquies</hi> between
God and his soul; and for that end he caused the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to be drawn, and a Gentleman, and Brother of
that Congregation that was much with him, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
to him in his sickness, he caused to promise
him that the Chamber should be kept private. But a
while after, hearing the whispering of some brethren
in the Room, he called to that Gentleman, saying, <hi>Why
do you break your word with me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after (being mindful no doubt of that
great helpfulness which he received from that afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned<note place="margin">His Death.</note>
Brother throughout his visitation) he left
him with this farewel, <hi>The God that made you, and
bought you with a great price, redeem your body and soul
unto himself.</hi> These words were his last words, after
which he was not heard to speak, but lying some hours
speechless, he quietly breathed out his spirit into the
hands of him that gave it, <hi>December 23. Anno Christi,
1652.</hi> being entred into the Sixty eighth year of his

it his great honour and blessing to be the
<hi>Son of Gods Handmaid,</hi> Psal. 86. 16.</p>
                  <p>His Parents dedicated him unto God from his
Child-hood,<note place="margin">His Education</note> designing him to the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
and in order thereunto they trained him up
in School-learning in the Country; and being there
well fitted, they sent him to <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge in
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> where the Rose was not cankered in the
bud, his youth not corrupted, nor debauched, as too
many are: But this morning (like that 2 <hi>Sam. 23. 4.)</hi>
was without clouds, not sullied with any noted mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage;
but on the contrary, as it is said of <hi>Sampson</hi>
when young, that the <hi>Spirit of the Lord began then to
move him,</hi> Judg. 13. 25. So in his then sober, and
studious behaviour, the Sun looked out betimes in
that Summer morning, and through Gods Grace (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than it oft falls out in nature) he gave pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
hopes of an after clearer day.</p>
                  <p>This being taken notice of by the Governours of
the Colledge,<note place="margin">His Proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> they thereupon, after examination had,
chose him Scholar of the House, he (as his Saviour)
still <hi>growing in wisdome and stature, and in favour with

in his private studies in the Colledge, for his further
perfecting, and the more happy seasoning of his spirit,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62956:51"/>
he went and sojourned with that man of God (now
also with the Lord) Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> at <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
where, by Gods rich blessing upon his most god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
directions, and example, and the society he had
with him, and other eminent Christians in that place,
he was much improved and furthered, as otherwise, so
especially in Heavens-way, which happily went along
with him to his journies end.</p>

                  <p>Nor was he an Hireling to flye when the Wolf

                  <p>This Alabaster Box of precious oyntment thus
powred out, filled the whole house with its odour, and
the sweet fragrancy of it did spread abroad, so that now
he came to be more taken notice of by many both
great, and good men, and so by some of eminent

how zealous to advance Piety and Learning; and for

                  <p>As a Minister of the Gospel:<note place="margin">His painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nistry.</note> In his preaching he
was plain, powerful, spiritual, frequent, and laborious:
For besides what in that kinde he did, as to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
in St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and in the Colledge Chappel,
which was very happy in his often pains there; In the
Town he set up one Lecture every Sabbath morning
in the Parish Church of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> performed only
by himself, and cheerfully frequented by a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
both of Schollars and Townsmen; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Church of <hi>All-Hallows</hi> every Lords day in
the afternoon, in which he did bear at least the fourth
part of the burden, and both of them <hi>Gratis,</hi> as there
were many more such Lectures there performed, much
about the same rate, weekly by other pious learned
men, and more indeed than are in any Town or City,
upon those tearms in all <hi>England,</hi> or are like to be
there again; which is mentioned that God may have
the glory in the first place, and then for the honour of
that Reformation, which so many do traduce, and spit
at; as also of those more noble spirited Preachers, who
so freely offered unto God that which did cost them
so much, for which of men they received nothing.</p>
                  <p>But that place of <hi>Cambridge</hi> did not bound the
course of this our laborious Preachers Ministry, but
(as it is said of our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 9. 35.) That he went
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62956:54"/>
about all Cities, and Villages teaching and preaching;</hi>
and of St. <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 15. 17. <hi>That from Jerusalem,
and round about, and that to Illyricum</hi> (which was in
right line three hundred and thirty <hi>German</hi> miles, as
<hi>Pareus</hi> upon the place computes it) <hi>he did fully preach
the Gospel;</hi> imitating herein, as <hi>Jerom</hi> observes, his
Lord and Master, that Sun of Righteousness, <hi>whose
going forth is from the ends of the Heaven, and his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit
unto the ends of it,</hi> Psa. 19. 6. In these their blessed
steps our Brother trod, and followed them in his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Ministry, diligently preaching when he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be abroad in remoter parts; but especially in
many Towns and Villages nearer hand, round about
the University, being a means to set up Lectures in
many of them, and very often assisting in them; and as
our Savior is observed by some Divines to have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more frequently the nearer he was to his departure;
so this his faithful servant, as it were presaging that his
day would be but short, towards his evening he made
the more haste and speed in his journy towards his end,
and yet more <hi>abounded in this work of the Lord,</hi> and

                  <p>And lastly,<note place="margin">His activity for God.</note> as he was a Christian, he was active for
God, as his Saviour, <hi>Act. 10. 38. Going up and down,
and doing good;</hi> and though otherwise modest, yet
when the case required it, bold in a good cause. He
was spiritual in communion, and a quickner of those
with whom he conversed. Fruitful in discourse, by
which the frame of his spirit might easily be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Frequent in asking questions, which was both his
humility, and Christian good husbandry, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62956:54"/>
to improve himselfe, his time and company.</p>
                  <p>Affable he was to others,<note place="margin">His Character</note> of much humility, and
low thoughts of himself, and of great integrity and
singleness of heart towards God, his Truth, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
wayes, and servants; of a very publick spirit,
and much affected with the various conditions of the
State, but especially of the Church and people of
God.</p>
                  <p>He was a most loving Husband to his wife, and a
dutiful son to his Parents, and in his life time very
helpful to his other Relations.<note place="margin">His Charity.</note> Many poor, both of
the University and Town do now feel the want of his
bounty which they tasted of in his life time; and both
they, and others had done more at his death (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by his intentions of it in the draught of his

it.</p>
                  <p>In a long continued Quartan,<note place="margin">His last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> God had knocked at

him to get all within ready against the coming of
his Lord, which, though to his friends was unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet found not him unprepared. In his short sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he expressed to an intimate Friend his great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and joy in Gods discriminating electing-love; and
to a Reverend Doctor, about half an hour before his
departure, who enquired of him about the setling of
his outward estate, and inward peace, he readily, and
without the least hesitancy, answered, that thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who dyed Anno Christi, 1653.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>WIlliam Gouge</hi> was born in <hi>Stratford-Bow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Birth and Parentage.</note> in
the County of <hi>Middlesex, Novem. 1. Anno
1575.</hi> His Father Mr. <hi>Thomas Gouge</hi> was a godly
Gentleman. His Mother was the vertuous and pious
Daughter of Mr. <hi>Nicholas Culverel,</hi> a Merchant in
<hi>London,</hi> and she was sister to those two famous
Preachers, Mr. <hi>Samuel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ezekiel Culverel;</hi>
she had also two sisters who were married to those
two famous and learned Divines, Dr. <hi>Chaderton,</hi> the
Master of <hi>Emanuel</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Whitaker</hi> the <hi>Regius Professor</hi> of Divinity in the same
University; so that by the Mothers side he came of a
stock of eminent Preachers.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>William Gouge</hi> in his younger years was first
trained up in <hi>Pauls</hi> School <hi>London,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Education</note> and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
sent to a Free-school at <hi>Felsted</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> where
he was trained up three years under the publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of his Uncle Mr. <hi>Ezekiel Culverel,</hi> by whose
labours he was much wrought upon, and if not first
begotten, yet much built up in his holy Faith, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
often expressed. From thence he was sent to <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
where he was educated other six years, during
all which time he was more than ordinarily studious
and industrious; for when other boyes upon play-dayes
took liverty for their sports and pastimes, he
would be at his book, wherein he took more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
than others could finde in their Recreations,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62956:57"/>
whereby he profited beyond many his equals.</p>
                  <p>At this time whilst he was a Schollar at <hi>Eaton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His early Piety</note> he
was possessed with an holy fear of God, was consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
in secret prayer, and in sanctifying the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi>
and was much grieved at the ordinary prophanation
thereof by sports and pastimes which were then, and
there too much allowed, as he did oft-times in his life,
with much thankfulness unto God express.</p>
                  <p>From the School at <hi>Eaton</hi> he was chosen to Kings
College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His remove to Cambridge.</note> whither he went <hi>Anno Christi
1595.</hi> and at the first entrance of his studies he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
himself to <hi>P. Ramus</hi> his <hi>Logick,</hi> and grew so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
therein, that in the publick Schools he maintained
and defended him, insomuch as when on a time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Sophisters</hi> set themselves to vilifie <hi>Ramus,</hi> for
which end the Respondent had given this question,
<hi>Nunquam erit magnus, cui Ramus est magnus,</hi> which
some of the Sophisters hearing, and knowing the said
<hi>William Gouge</hi> to be an accute disputant, and a stiff
defender of <hi>Ramus,</hi> they went to the <hi>Divinity</hi> Schools,
where he was then hearing an <hi>Act,</hi> and told him how
in the other Schools they were abusing <hi>Ramus,</hi> he
thereupon went into the <hi>Sophisters</hi> Schooles,<note place="margin">He defended <hi>Ramus.</hi>
                     </note> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Moderators calling for another Opponent, he
stepped up, and brought such an argument as stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Respondent, whereupon the Moderator took
upon him to answer it, but could not satisfie the
doubt: This occasioned a <hi>Sophister</hi> that stood by to
say with a loud voice, <hi>Do you come to vilifie</hi> Ramus,
<hi>and cannot answer the Argument of a</hi> Ramist? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Moderator rose up, and gave him a box on
the ear, then the School was all on an uproar; but
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62956:57"/>
the said <hi>William Gouge</hi> was safely conveyed out from
amongst them.</p>
                  <p>When he was <hi>Senior Sophister,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> he was chosen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
of the <hi>Sophisters</hi> Acts in the publick Schools,
which was a place of great credit, and he began every
Act with a solemn speech in <hi>Latine</hi> which was not
usual in those dayes, and it added much grace to the
Act.</p>
                  <p>The said <hi>William Gouge</hi> took his degrees in order,
performing for every one of them, all those Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
in the publick Schools, which by the Statutes of
the University were required. And during his first
three years, he kept the Colledge so close, that he lay
not one night out of the walls thereof; and at the three
years end he was admitted Fellow,<note place="margin">He is Fellow.</note> and then went to
visit his Friends.</p>
                  <p>He was a very hard Student;<note place="margin">His studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s.</note> for as he was a
lover of Learning, so was he very laborious in his
studies, sitting up late at night, and rising early in the
morning.</p>
                  <p>He continued in the Colledge for the space of nine
years, and in all that time (except he went forth a
Town to his friends) he was never absent from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prayers in the Chappel, which used to be about
half an hour after five a clock in the morning; yea,
he used to rise so long before he went to the Chappel,
as that he gained time for his secret devotions, and for
reading his morning task of the Scriptures: For he
tyed himself to read every day fifteen Chapters in
<hi>English</hi> out of the Bible,<note place="margin">He read 15 Chapters every day.</note> five in the morning, five
after dinner before he fell upon his other studies, and
five before he went to bed; he hath been often heard
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62956:58"/>
to say, that when he could not sleep in the night time
he used in his thoughts to run through divers Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Scripture in order, as if he had heard them
read to him; and by this means he deceived the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of his waking, and deprived himself also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of the sweetness of his sleeping hours, though
by that, which administred to him better rest, and
greater sweetness; for he preferred the meditation
upon the word before his necessary food with <hi>Job,</hi>
and before sleep with <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like practice he used in the day time when he
was alone,<note place="margin">His meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word.</note> whether within doors, or abroad; for which
ed, as an help, he wrote in a little book which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
carried about him, the distinct heads of every
particular passage in every Chapter of the Bible, that
so, when in any place he meditated on the word of
God, and was at a loss, he presently found help by
that little book. By this means he made himself so
expert in the Text, that if he heard any phrase of
Scripture, he could presently tell where it was to be
found.</p>
                  <p>Besides, he had his set times of study for the more
difficult places of Scripture, that he might finde out
the true meaning of them, by which he attained to a
great measure of exactness in the understanding of the
Scripture.</p>
                  <p>During his abode in the University he did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ply his own studies,<note place="margin">He instructed others.</note> but used also to send for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whom he observed to be ingenuous and willing,
and instructed them in the Arts, whereby he was a
great help to many, and brought them also to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:62956:58"/>
While he was a Scholler in Kings College,<note place="margin">He learned Hebrew.</note> there
came a <hi>Jew</hi> to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who was entertained in
sundry Colleges to teach them the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue,
and amongst the rest, in Kings Colledge, and Mr.
<hi>Gouge</hi> took the opportunity of learning of him, as
many other of the Students also did; but most of
them grew soon weary, and left him, onely the said
Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> kept close to him so long as he tarried. But
when he was gone, those which before had lost their
opportunity, now seeing their own folly, they came
to Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> and entreated him to instruct them in
the grounds of the said Language, which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
did, and thereby himself became an excellent
<hi>Hebrician.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as he was expert in the learned Languages,<note place="margin">A general Schollar.</note> so
was he likewise in the Arts, and all other necessary
Literature, that he might have nothing of these
to learn when he should come to make use of
them.</p>
                  <p>Being chosen a Lecturer both of <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
in the College,<note place="margin">His Diligence</note> he made conscience of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all the times appointed by the Statute for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and never omitted any of them, and his readings
were so exactly composed, that thereby he profited
his Auditors exceedingly, and procured much credit,
and applause from them; but withall, some envy from
his successors, who by his example were now provoked
to a more painful, &amp; frequent reading of their Lectures
which in former times were performed seldomer, and
in a more perfunctory manner. He was so cautious,
and strict in the whole course of his life, that thereby he
got the name of an <hi>Arch-Puritan,</hi> which was the terme
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62956:59"/>
then given in scorn to those who were conscientious in
their wayes.</p>
                  <p>In the first year of his Fellowship he began his
<hi>Common-place</hi> book for <hi>Divinity,</hi> in which he made
references of all which he read. He had also white
paper bound betwixt every leaf of his Bible, wherein
he wrote such short and pithy interpretations, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
on the Text as could not well be referred
to any head in his Common-place book.</p>
                  <p>He took such pleasure in, and was so addicted to a
University life, that he was resolved to have spent
many more years than he did, if not his whole life
therein.</p>
                  <p>But his Father, after he had been two or three years
Master of Arts, much against his minde, took him
from the University upon the occasion of a marriage
which he prepared for him; and God by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
turned this to the great good of his Church:
For by this means, though it were somewhat late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he entred upon the Ministry, yet it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that he entred upon, and exercised that sacred
calling much sooner than he would have done, if he
had been left to his own choice.</p>
                  <p>His wife was the daughter of Mr. <hi>Henry Caulton</hi> a
Citizen,<note place="margin">His Marriage.</note> and Mercer of <hi>London,</hi> but an Orphan when
he married her.</p>
                  <p>Having thus changed his condition, and entred
into a married estate, that he might not be distracted,
nor impeded in his studies by worldly business, he
committed the whole care of his Family affairs to the
management of his wife, and still applied himself wholly
to his studies, and to the weighty businesses of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:62956:59"/>
He lived with this his wife for the space of two and
twenty years in much love,<note place="margin">His Children.</note> and peace, and had by
her thirteen children, seven sons, and six daughters,
whereof eight lived to mens, and womens estate, and
were all of them carefully educated, and sufficiently
provided for.</p>
                  <p>It was his earnest desire,<note place="margin">His esteem of the Ministry.</note> and daily prayer to God
for his sons that they might all be preachers of the
Gospel, so highly did he prize the function, that is so
vilified and contemned by too many others, for he
himself found such comfort, and content in that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that he thought no greater could be found in any
other; and he often professed for his own part, that the
greatest pleasure he took in the world was in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
about the work of the Ministry, insomuch
as he was wont to say to divers Honourable persons
of his acquaintance, and particularly to the Lord <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,</hi>
Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>he
envied not his great place, and imployment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the order and government of his Family,<note place="margin">His Family government.</note> he
was very exemplary. His house was another <hi>Bethel,</hi>
for he did not onely constantly upon conscientious
principles use morning and evening Prayer and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sacred Scriptures in his Family; but also he
catechized his children, and servants, wherein God
gave him a singular gift for their edification; for in
teaching them he used not any set form, but so, as
that he brought them whom he instructed, to express
the principles taught them in their own words; so
that his children (as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> saith of his
Father) found him as well a spiritual as a natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Yea never any servant came to his house, but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62956:60"/>
gained a great deal of knowledge therein: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
did diverse others, who at the request of their
Parents were instructed by him.</p>
                  <p>He was in a special manner a strict and conscionable
sanctifier of the Lords day,<note place="margin">His sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath.</note> and that not onely in the
exercise of publick duties incumbent upon his Office,
but also in the private sanctification of it in the duties
of piety in, and with his Family, and secret in his Closet;
and for this end, as he did forbear providing of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
the Eve before the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that servants might
not be occasioned thereby to sit up late; so neither
would he suffer any servant to stay at home for dressing
any meat upon the Lords day for the entertainment of
friends, whether they were great or mean, few or many.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> after his publick labours were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
divers Neighbours (wanting helps in their own
Families) came to his house, where he repeated his
Sermons after so familiar a manner, that many have
professed that they were much more benefited by
them in that his repetition, than they were in the first
hearing of them; for he did not use word by word to
read out of Notes what he had preached, but would
by Questions and Answers draw from those of his own
houshold such points as were delivered; and this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
being ended, his constant course was to visit
such of his Parish as were sick,<note place="margin">His visiting the sick.</note> or by pain and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
were dis-inabled to go to the publick Ordinances,
with each of whom, he would discourse of some spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and heavenly subject suitable to their condition,
and after that, he prayed with them, wherein he had a
more than ordinary gift, being able in apt words and
expressions to commend their several cases unto God,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62956:60"/>
and to put up Petitions suitable to their several needs.</p>
                  <p>His usual course was to pray eight times in the
publick Congregation on the Lords dayes;<note place="margin">His frequent Prayers</note> for as he
prayed before, and after each Sermon; so also before,
and after his reading and expounding the Scriptures,
which he performed both in the forenoon and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.
And in his Family his constant course was to
pray thrice every Lords day, and that in a solemn
manner, <hi>viz.</hi> in the morning, and evening, and after
his repetition of the Sermons.</p>
                  <p>He was ordained Minister in the two and thirtieth
year of his age,<note place="margin">His Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and about a year after, which was in
<hi>June</hi> 1608. he was called to the exercise of his Ministry
in the Parish of <hi>Black-Friars London,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to his dying day, which was about five and
forty years, and six months, never accepting of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ministerial imployment, though he had the
proffers of many great places: His manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Black-Friars,</hi> was thus,</p>
                  <p>That Parish being destitute of a preaching Minister,<note place="margin">His choice to Black-Friars.</note>
Mr. <hi>Hildersam,</hi> a famous, pious &amp; powerful Preacher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in company with some of the better sort of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Black-Friars,</hi> who complained of their want,
he told them that there was one living in <hi>Stratford-Bow,</hi>
who was out of imployment, whom he judged
very fit for them. Hereupon divers of them went
thither on the Lords day, where he frequently preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>gratis,</hi> to help the Minister that then was there,
and upon hearing of him they liked him so well, that
making report thereof to their neighbours, he was
by an un animous consent <hi>(nemine contradicente)</hi> chosen
to be their Minister, which election being made known
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62956:61"/>
to him, he accepted of it, and ever after shewed a great
respect to the Inhabitants of that place.</p>
                  <p>Before Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> came to them, they had not so
much as a Church of their own to meet and hear the
word of God in, nor any place wherein to bury their
dead, but by such means as he used, the Church and
Church-porch, together with the Ministers house,
and Church-yard (all which they enjoyed before but
upon curtesie) were bought in; so as now, they all, as
their proper Inheritance, do belong to the Parish of
<hi>Black-Friars.</hi> And five years after his coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the old Church being found too little to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
those multitudes that flocked thither from all
parts of the City, to hear him, he was an instrument
of purchasing in certain rooms adjoyning, whereby
the Church was enlarged almost as big again as it was
before. The sum of purchasing, new building, and
beautifying of which Church amounted to above one
thousand five hundred pounds, all which was procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
partly by Collections at his Lectures, and partly by
the volunta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y contributions of his Parishoners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any publick Collections in other places.</p>
                  <p>After this, there being divers rooms under the said
Church belonging to several Land-lords, he used such
means as to purchase them also for the benefit of the
Parish, which he did the rather to prevent all dangers
that by wicked minded persons might have befaln
Gods people in that Church, by any contrivance in
the rooms under the same.</p>
                  <p>Thus they who had nothing of their own at his first
coming, have now, through his procurement, the
whole Church, the Church-porch, a Church-yard, a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62956:61"/>
Vault to bury their dead in, a very fair Vestry with
other adjacent rooms, besides the house wherein he
himself dwelt so long as he lived; all which they hold
as a perpetual Inheritance.</p>
                  <p>They have also a Lease of certain Tenements of a
considerable value for three hundred years; all which
were procured by his Prudence, Interest, and Industry.</p>
                  <p>Such was his love, and respect to this Parish, as
though he was oft proffered places of far greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,<note place="margin">His self-denial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note>
yet he refused them all, oft saying, That the
height of his ambition was to go from <hi>Black-Friers</hi>
to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>At his first coming to <hi>Black-Friers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Industry.</note> being in the
thirty third year of his age, he preached constantly,
besides twice every Lords day, a weekly Lecture,
<hi>viz.</hi> on the <hi>Wednesdayes</hi> in the forenoon, which for
the space of about thirty five years was very much
frequented, and that not only by his Parishioners, but
by divers City Ministers, and by sundry pious and
judicious Gentlemen of the <hi>Innes of Court,</hi> besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other well-disposed Citizens, who in multitudes
flocked to hear his heavenly Doctrine; yea such was the
fame of Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> his Ministry, that when any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Ministers, and godly Christians came to <hi>London</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their affairs, they thought not their business fully
ended, unless they had been at <hi>Black-Friers</hi> Lecture.</p>
                  <p>And it pleased God to give such a blessing to his
Ministry,<note place="margin">His success in the Ministry.</note> that many of his Auditors, though living
in other Parishes, upon Trial before sundry Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
have confessed, that the first seeds of Grace
sown in their hearts, were by the blessing upon Dr.
<hi>Gouges</hi> Ministry: And indeed herein God wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62956:62"/>
honoured his labours, by making him an aged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Christ to beget many Sons and Daughters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and to nourish up others in the wayes of
righteousnesse, thousands having been converted,
and built up by his Ministry.</p>
                  <p>He used also every month to preach a preparation
Sermon before the Communion, on the Eve before
each monthly Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>He was eminently laborious and faithful in the
work of his Ministry even to his dying day,<note place="margin">His painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so long as he was able to creep up into the Pulpit,
<hi>As a tree planted in the House of the Lord, he was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
even in his old age,</hi> Psal. 92. 13, 14. He often used
to say in his latter dayes, that he could preach with
more ease than he could get up into the Pulpit, the
reason whereof doubtlesse was this, because as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of his <hi>Asthma</hi> dis-inabled him to go, so the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of his Intellectuals enabled him to preach with
more ease than in his younger dayes.</p>
                  <p>His preacing was alwaes very distinct:<note place="margin">His manner of Preaching.</note> First, he
opened his Text, giving the true and proper sense of
it, then gave he the <hi>Logical Analysis</hi> of it, and then
gathered such proper observations as naturally flowed
from it, and properly and pertinently improved, and
applied the same; by which method his Ministry proved
very profitable to his hearers. Many have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that in regard of the <hi>Logical</hi> resolution of his
Text he went beyond all that ever they heard, as also
in clearing difficult, and doubtful places of Scripture as
they came in his way. And as his method was clear, so
were his expressions plain, alwayes delivering the solid
points of Divinity in a familiar stile to the capacity of
the meanest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:62956:62"/>
As for his life and conversation,<note place="margin">His holy life.</note> it was holy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary,
himself practising what he preached unto
others, and living over his own Sermons; his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and his practice concurred, and went hand in
hand together.</p>
                  <p>Before these times of Examination of persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their admission to the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper, he used to go to the houses of the better sort
in his Parish, where he appointed a time for them, and
their whole Families to meet together, that he might
examine how fit they were to be admitted to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance:
yea he appointed sundry small Families to
meet together on a certain day, that he might make
trial of their fitness also; and then his manner was, not
to admit any of the younger sort to the Sacrament,
till in his judgement he found them fitted for it.</p>
                  <p>Though he addicted himself much to his studies,<note place="margin">He is envied.</note>
and carried himself peaceably, yet wanted he not
those that did envy, and malign him, and that took all
occasions to do him what mischief they could: As in
the case of Serjeant <hi>Finch</hi> his book about the <hi>Calling
of the Jews,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> only published, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
himself owned it, yet for his publication of it he
was committed to prison, and kept there for the space
of nine weeks together.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>James</hi> being informed that the Serjeant had in
that Book declared, and endeavoured to prove that the
<hi>Jews</hi> should have a visible Kingdome which should be
above all other Kingdoms, which Doctrin he abhorred,
he thereupon grew extream impatient: Bishop <hi>Neal</hi>
also with others, provoked him against the publisher of
the Book, which so incensed him, that he would admit
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62956:63"/>
of no Apology. Yet after a while, Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> was moved
distinctly to declare his judgement, and opinion about
that point <hi>of the calling, and conversion of the Jews,</hi>
which he did in these ensuing Propositions.</p>
                  <p>All that I can gather out of the holy Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this point is,<note place="margin">His judgement about the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Jews.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That the Calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> importeth more than
a spiritual Calling to beleeve in Jesus Christ, and to
imbrace the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>2. This their spiritual Calling may be called an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
glorious Calling, in regard of the visibility and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallity
of it; to put a difference betwixt the promised
Calling of the Nation, and the continual Calling of some
few persons. For in all ages since the rejection of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> some few, here and there have been called. Thus
the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the Apostles time, when
Christians had no pompous Civil Government, was an
outward glorious Calling, by reason of the visible famous
Church which they had.</p>
                  <p>3. It is probable that at, or after their Calling, they
shall not be scattered as now they are, but shall be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together into Churches, and be freed from the bondage
and slavery wherein they have been many years together.</p>
                  <p>4. To give them a Soveraignty over all the whole
Church seemeth to me to be derogatory to that absolute
Sovereignty which Christ the head of his Church hath, in
whom the promises of the perpetuity of <hi>Davids</hi> Scepter,
of the extent of his Dominion, of the subjection of all
Nations are accomplished.</p>
                  <p>5. To set down the distinct time, place, and other like
circumstances of their Calling, needeth more than an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
spirit, and implies too much curiosity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62956:63"/>
6. The point of the Calling of the <hi>Jews</hi> being no
fundamental point of Christian Religion, to be over stiff
in holding one thing or other therein, to the disturbance
of the peace of the Church, comes near to Schisme.</p>
                  <p>Upon which being examined by Archbishop <hi>Abbot,</hi>
and his answer approved, he was released from his
imprisonment.</p>
                  <p>Ordinarily in the Summer Vacation he was with his
Family in the Country;<note place="margin">His Labours.</note> but not so much for his own
ease, as for the further service of Gods Church: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his preaching every Lords day in the place where
he resided, he improved his time for the publication
of those his Treatises which are now in Print, <hi>viz.
The whole Armour of God, Domestical duties,</hi> An <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
of the Lords Prayer, Gods three Arrows, of the
Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then raging. The <hi>Saints Sacrifice of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi>
upon his recovery from a dangerous sickness.
To which is now added his Commentary upon the
whole Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which was the subject
of his <hi>Wednesdayes</hi> Lectures for many years.</p>
                  <p>While he was setled at <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
Batchelour of Divinity <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1611.
which was the eighth year after he had taken the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Master of Arts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1628,<note place="margin">He commenced Doctor.</note> he proceeded Dr. of <hi>Divinity,</hi>
at which time eight <hi>London</hi> Ministers proceeded Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
upon which occasion, Dr. <hi>Collins,</hi> the then <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius
Professor,</hi> put up Mr. <hi>Gouges</hi> Degree, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
it to pass in the Regent-house before he had any
notice thereof, and without his consent, whereby he
did in a manner force him to take his Degree; yet so
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62956:64"/>
as when he heard what was done, he readily went to
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> and performed all his Acts, according to
the Statutes of the University, as he had done at the
taking of all his former Degrees.</p>
                  <p>Such respect was generally shewed to him,<note place="margin">His publick imployments.</note> as that
in sundry publick Imployments he was chosen a
<hi>Trustee</hi> or <hi>Feoffee.</hi> As in the year 1626, he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
one of the <hi>Trustees</hi> for Mr. <hi>Whetenhalls</hi> three
Lectures.</p>
                  <p>Also in the year 1616. he was chosen one of the
<hi>Trustees</hi> for buying in of Impropriations, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other pious, and charitable uses wherein indeed he
alwayes approved himself a carefull, and faithfull
<hi>Trustee,</hi> and in some cases, by his great pains and cost,
he procured to be setled for ever such pious Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as would otherwise have been wrested away, and
alienated from their intended use.</p>
                  <p>The business about the buying in of Impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
was this:</p>
                  <p>There was a select society of thirteen persons joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves together as <hi>Trustees,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Buying in of Impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> to stir up, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
such as were piously affected to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the buying in of Impropriations, and giving
them freely towards the maintenance of godly and
able Ministers. And these were so faithful to their
trust, as albeit they met very frequently, and spent
much time, and pains in consultation about that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yet did they never spend one penny out of the
publick stock, for the refreshing of themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea
though they had sundry Agents, and Messengers
whom they imployed about that business, and that
both far and near, yet did they never diminish that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62956:64"/>
stock wherewithall they were intrusted to the value
of a penny; but themselves, at least most of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
out of their own purses for the discharge of
all by-expences. And when they had the opportunity
of buying in any great Impropriation, and wanted
money in stock to go through with it, they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves give, or lend so much as might
effect it; and amongst others, our Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> at one
time lent 300 l. <hi>gratis</hi> for that use, besides the
monthly contribution which he gave. By this means,
in a few years space, thirteen Impropriations were
bought in, which cost betwixt five and six thousand
pounds, into which their care was to put godly, able,
and orthodox Ministers; and their design was to plant
a learned and powerful Ministry, especally in Cities,
and Market Towns in several parts of the Kingdome
where there was the greatest need, for the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of the Gospel in those parts.</p>
                  <p>Indeed this was it that raised up so much envy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and made Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> the then Bishop of
<hi>London</hi> to consult with Mr. <hi>Noy,</hi> the Kings Atturney
General about dissolving this Society, and hereupon
Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> brought them all into the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi>
picking this quarrel against them, for that they had
made themselves a body Incorporate, without any
Grant from the King. When the Case had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
by Learned Councel on both sides, the result
was, that the Court adjudged their proceedings to be
illegal, that their Trust should be taken from them,
and that what Impropriations they had thus purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
should be made over to the King, and that the
King should appoint such as he thought meet, to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62956:65"/>
dispose of those Impropriations which they had
bought in.</p>
                  <p>The aforesaid Atturney that strictly examined all
their Receipts, and Disbursments, found that they had
laid out of their own money, at the time when
they were questioned, a thousand pounds more than
they had received, and thereupon obtained an Order of
the Court, that those debts should be first discharged
out of the Revenues of the Impropriations, before
they should be disposed to particular uses. Thus was
their Trust quite wrested out of their hands, and that
excellent work fell to the ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1653, Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> was by the Authority
of Parliament called to be a member of the <hi>Assembly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He is chosen to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note>
                     <hi>of Divines,</hi> wherein his attendance was assiduous, not
being observed during the whole time of that Session
to be one day absent, unless it were in case of more
than ordinary weakness, ever preferring that publick
imployment before any private business whatsoever,
and therein he was not one to make up the number
onely, but a chief and useful member.</p>
                  <p>For he was chosen, and sate as one of the Assessors
and very often filled the Chair in the Moderators,
absence, and such was his constant care, and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness
in the expence of time, and improving it to
the best advantage, that in case of intermission in
the Assembly affairs, he used to apply himself to his
private studies: For which end it was his constant
practice to carry his Bible, and some other Books
in his pocket, which upon every advantage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
drew forth, and read in them, as was observed by
many.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:62956:65"/>
Episcopacy also being voted down by both Houses
of Parliament,<note place="margin">To the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> and so no ordinary way being left for
the Ordination of Ministers, the Parliament thought
fit to set up an extraordinary way by Three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Ministers, who for the space of a year were to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
such as tendred themselves according to the
Rules prescribed by them, with the humble advice of
the Assembly, of which number Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> was one,
and acted with his Brethen therein; at which time I
observed his strictness in keeping of Fasts: For on an
Ordination day, which was alwayes accompanied
with Fasting and Prayer; in the afternoon one proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him a peece of a candied Orange Pill, which (though
he was then very ancient) he refused to accept of till
the work of the day was finished.</p>
                  <p>He was likewise chosen by a Committee of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,<note place="margin">To write An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations on the Bible.</note>
amongst others, to write large <hi>Annotations</hi>
upon the Bible, being well known to be a judicious
Interpreter of Scripture, and how well he performed
that Task, is, and may be evident to all that read his
part, which was from the beginning of the first Book
of the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>Job.</hi> In which the Intelligent Reader
may observe such skill in the Original, such acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the sacred Story, such judgement in giving
the genuine sence of the Text, and such accuteness in
raising pertinent Observations, that without the help
of any other Commentators, a man may accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
himself with the sense, Doctrines, and uses of
most of those Scriptures that came under his hand, in
those brief <hi>Annotations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before this,<note place="margin">He refused to read the Book for Sports.</note> when the Book allowing Sports and
Recreations on the Lords Dayes was by publick
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62956:66"/>
Authority injoyned to be read in all Churches
throughout the Kingdome, he, as sundry others, godly
and faithful Ministers refused to read the same, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rather to suffer the uttermost, than to manifest
the least approbation of so wicked, and licentious a
practice, it being so contrary to the express letter of
the Scripture.<note place="margin">His skill in Cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>By reason of his ability and dexterity in resolving
Cases of Conscience, he was much sought unto for
his judgement in doubtful cases, and scruples of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and that not only by ordinary Christians, but
by divers Ministers also both in the City and Country,
sometimes by word of mouth, and other sometimes
by writing: And indeed he was accounted the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the <hi>London Divines,</hi> and the Oracle of his
time.</p>
                  <p>He was likewise a sweet comforter of troubled
Consciences, wherein he was exceeding skilful, and
dextrous, as many hundreds in the City have found
from time to time, being sought unto far and near by
such as groaned under afflictions and tentations, many
of whom, through Gods blessing upon his labours, were
restored to joy and comforts out of unspeakable terrors
and torments of Conscience.</p>
                  <p>He was of a most sweet,<note place="margin">His Meekness.</note> and meek disposition; yea
such was his meekness of spirit, that it seemeth not to
be paralleld. For though he lived with his wife above
twenty years, yet neither childe, nor servant, could
ever say that they saw so much as an angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
or heard so much as an angry word proceed
from him towards her all her life long.</p>
                  <p>Some have observed, that towards his latter end in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62956:66"/>
his visage he did much resemble the Picture that is
usually made for <hi>Moses.</hi> Certainly he was the exact
<hi>Effiges</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> his spirit, and in this resembled him
to the life, that he was one of the meekest men that
this Generation hath known.</p>
                  <p>He was,<note place="margin">A Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</note> as a great peace-keeper, so a great peace-maker,
having an excellent dexterity in composing
of differences, he was far from doing wrong to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and as far from revenging wrong done to him
by others.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding which, he suffered much, both by
the speeches, and also by the actions of evil, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
persons; yet his manner was, rather to pray for
them, than in any harsh manner to retaliate like for
like. He alwayes judged that revilers, and injurious
persons wronged themselves more than him.</p>
                  <p>Sundry scandalous and false aspersions were cast
upon him,<note place="margin">He is slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> yea by such persons as were guilty of those
very crimes which they laid to his charge. For
some who lived by the unwarrantable trade of Usury,
to justifie their own unlawful practices, have not stuck
to charge the same upon him, though he was alwayes

by himself, or any other for him, neither directly,
nor indirectly, as he hath been often heard to affirm,
both in his life time, and not long before his
death.</p>
                  <p>Being chosen President of <hi>Sion</hi> College,<note place="margin">His good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custome, when he left his Office, he
preached a learned and polite <hi>Latine</hi> Sermon <hi>ad cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
which he delivered by the strength of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
without the help of his notes, which shewed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62956:67"/>
that though his body was decrepit, and feeble, yet
his intellectuals were vivid, quick and vigorous.</p>
                  <p>He was very charitable,<note place="margin">His Charity.</note> especially to the godly
poor, according to that direction of the Apostle,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. where he exhorts us <hi>to do good to all, but
especially to the houshold of Faith.</hi> He maintained some
poor Schollars in the University wholly at his own
charge, and contributed liberally towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of others. Indeed he set apart a <hi>Sacrea stock</hi>
as he called it, a portion for the poor, proportionable
to his receits, which he faithfully distributed.</p>
                  <p>Yea he was of such a charitable, and bountiful a
disposition, that though his Father left him a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
estate, yet such were his annual disbursements
for his kindred, and others that stood in need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that from the time of his Fathers death till his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
came to be of years, and so to call for their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he laid up nothing of all his comings in; whereby
it may appear, that they, who out of envy cry up his
estate to be greater than it was, do consequently cry
up his bounty and charity: For that whatsoever his
estate was, it was wholly laid out for the relief of such
as stood in need (necessary expences for his Family
only excepted) which as it doth appear by his Papers so
in his life time he professed it to some of his Children;
and truly as in other things he excelled many others, so
in this he excelled himself.</p>
                  <p>He was very conscientious in the expence of his
time from his youth to the very time of his death.<note place="margin">His studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> His
custome was to rise very early both in the Winter and
Summer. In the Winter time he constantly rose so
long before day, as that he alwaies performed all the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62956:67"/>
exercises of his private devotions before day-light:
And in the Summer time he rose about four a clock
in the morning; by which means he had done half his
work before others began their studies. If he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to hear any at their work before he began his
studies, he would say (as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> spake concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Smith) that he was much troubled that any
should be at the works of their Calling, before he
was at his.</p>
                  <p>He was a man of much temperance and sobriety,<note place="margin">His Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note>
both in his eating, drinking, and apparrel: And for
Recreations, howsoever many pious persons do spend
time therein, and that lawfully in warrantable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
yet he spent none of his so, whence it was
that he was never expert in any kinde of sports: He
hath been often heard to say, that he never took any
journey meerly of pleasure in all his life-time. Study,
and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ins were alwayes, both in youth and age his
chefest pleasure and delight; yea it <hi>was his meat and
drink to be doing the will of his heavenly Father,</hi>
wherein he took as much pleasure and delight, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
men do in their eating and drinking, or in their
disports and pastimes.</p>
                  <p>Such was his deportment in his conversation,<note place="margin">His Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that
there was scarce a Lord, or Lady, or Citizen of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in, or about the City that were piously affected,
but they sought his acquaintance, and were ambitious
to enjoy his company, wherein they took much
content, and found much benefit to their souls
thereby.</p>
                  <p>And whereas many persons of quality out of their
great respect to him, came to visit him, he would so
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62956:68"/>
endeavour to order their conference as might tend
most to their edification; and if their visits were meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complemental, he soon grew weary, and accounted
it a burden to him.</p>
                  <p>He was alwayes of a very friendly,<note place="margin">His Affabi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

disposition, in so much as the meanest, not only of his
own Parish, but of the City, found easie access to
him, and he was as easie to be intreated, yea ready to
do what good he could to all.</p>
                  <p>And amongst other Graces his humility was very
eminent,<note place="margin">His Humility</note> and exemplary: Though others knew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
when his face did not shine, yet he knew not when it
did. He that readily could observe the least glimpses
or appearances of any worth in others, would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
them in himself: He was (as it was said of
<hi>Nazianzen)</hi> high in imployments, and abilities, but low
in his disposition, and resentment of his own worth.
He was not observed to be puffed up either with the
multitudes that flocked unto his Ministry (which were
many and great) nor with any applauses of men; but
would still say, <hi>That he knew more by himself to abase
him, than any could know to extol him;</hi> yea so eminent
was his Humility, that he charged his Executor, to
whom he committed the care of his Funeral, that
there should no <hi>Green-staffe</hi> be laid upon his Herse,
though this usual respect is given to those who in their
life-time were Governours of the Hospital of <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
one of which number this worthy Doctor was,
yea and a Benefactor too to that House: As also that
he should not affixe any <hi>Escocheons</hi> to his Herse,
though he was a Gentleman of an ancient Descent, as
if he had thought that the poverty of Christ was his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62956:68"/>
Patrimony, and Coat of Arms, and his interest in him,
his greatest, and best atchievement; or as if both living
and dead he would be (as the Apostle speaks) <hi>cloathed
with Humility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was much in Communion with God,<note place="margin">His Fastings.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
not himself only with his constant, daily, and
ordinary holy duties, but was also frequent in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
exercises. In the Bishops times, when it was not
permitted to keep Fasts in the publick Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he was one of those Ministers who frequently holp
private Christians in their more retired Humiliations.
In times of fears and dangers, he with divers others,
had sometimes monthly, yea sometimes weekly Fasts,
whereof many were kept in his own house, and others
of them in his Vestry; which he was observed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
with extraordinary reverence &amp; awfulness of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
His Confessions were accompanied with much sense
of, and sorrow for sin, brokenness of heart, self-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency,
judging of the creature, and justifying of
God: His petitions were pertinent, judicious, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
seasonable, accompanied with faith and fervency;
like a true son of <hi>Jacob,</hi> he wrestled with supplications,
and tears, as resolving not to depart out of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
without a blessing.</p>
                  <p>But there was none like him in Thanksgiving,<note place="margin">His Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings.</note> when
a man would have thought that he had spent the last
drop of his spirits and strength in Confession and
Prayer; O! how would he recollect is spirits when he
came to the work of Thanksgiving, wherein he
would be so large, particular, warm, and vigorous,
that in the end of the day when mens affections
grew flat, he would so revive and quicken them, as if
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62956:69"/>
the work had been then but newly begun, and as if
that had been the onely work of the day; and herein
indeed he may be a pattern to all his surviving Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in the Ministry.</p>
                  <p>He was very inquisitive after the state, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church of Christ, both at home, and
abroad, that he might accordingly order his prayers in
their behalf, of whom he was never unmindful in his
addresses unto God. And when he heard that it went
ill with the Church of God in any place, like another
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Sympathy</note> 
                     <hi>he sate him down, and wept, and mourned,
and fasted, and prayed unto the God of Heaven</hi> in their
behalf.</p>
                  <p>His study was as great to advance Christ,<note place="margin">His Faith.</note> as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base
himself. He used frequently to say, <hi>When I look
upon my self, I see nothing but emptiness, and weakness;
but when I look upon Christ, I see nothing but fulness
and sufficiency.</hi> When the hand of his body was weak
and shaking, that of his soul, his faith was strong and
steddy. When he could not hold the Cup at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
nor scarce carry it to his own mouth by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his Palsie hand, yet then with a firme an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fixed
affiance did he lay hold upon Christ, and with a strong
and eager appetite applied his blood to his soul, and his
manner was sweetly to breathe forth joyful Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings
for his refreshment by the blood of Christ,
when he was returned to his house after the Lords
Supper; yea when he could hardly creep with his body
to the place where it was celebrated, and was forced
many times to make use of the help of others to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
him in his passage thither, even then did his faith
run swiftly, and was upon the wing to carry him to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62956:69"/>
Christ. When worldly suports failed him, when
health, and strength forsook him, he made Jesus
Christ the staff of his old age, often professing, as his
great misery and impotency without him, so his holy
and humble recumbency upon him.</p>
                  <p>Great was his patience under the visiting hand of
God,<note place="margin">His Patience.</note> especially in his old age, when God exercised
him with painful maladies. Though by reason of the
sharpness, and bitterness of his pains occasioned by
the stone, and acuteness of his urine, and that <hi>Lethalis
arundo</hi> (as he oft called it) that deadly arrow in his
side, which he knew could never be plucked out but
by death, I mean his <hi>Asthma,</hi> which he got by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
cold in attending upon publick imployments:
Notwithstanding (I say) by reason of these he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
heard to groan, yet never did he once grumble
against the dispensations of God. Never did he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of God for his sufferings, though oft of himself
for sinning: He never cryed out <hi>A great sufferer,</hi> but
oft, <hi>A great sinner!</hi> and yet he would overtake that
expression again, with the discoursing of, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
himself in <hi>A great Saviour,</hi> and in the depth of
his torments he would say, <hi>Well, yet in all these there
is nothing of Hell, or of Gods wrath.</hi> His sufferings
were never so deep, but he could see the bottome of
them, and would say, <hi>Soul be silent, soul be patient; It is
thy God, and Father that thus ordereth thy estate; Thou
art his clay, he may tread and trample on thee, as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
him: Thou hast deserved much more: It is
enough that thou art kept out of Hell: Though thy
pain be grievous, yet it is tollerable: Thy God affords
some intermissions, he will turn it to thy good, and at
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62956:70"/>
length put an end to all; none of these can be expected
in Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He used often to make mention of the extent of
obedience,<note place="margin">His excellent Speeches.</note> which he said, was not onely to endeavour
to do what God requireth, but also patiently to bear
what Gods will is to lay upon his creature, as Christ
himself, <hi>though he were the Son, yet learned he obedience
by the things which he suffered.</hi> In his greatest pangs, he
oft used this speech of holy <hi>Job, Shall we receive good
from the hands of God, and not evil?</hi> He often commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his soul unto Christ, and used to say, <hi>I am perswaded
that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him
against that day.</hi> When any of his Friends went about
to comfort him in those gifts which God had bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him, and works which he had wrought by him,
he would answer, <hi>I dare not think of any such thing for
comfort; Jesus Christ, and what he hath done, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
is the only ground of my sure comfort.</hi> Many
that came to visit him in his weakness, professed that
they went away better than they came, by reason of
those savoury and gracious speeches, and expressions
that proceeded from him.</p>
                  <p>Though, towards his latter end, his fits of the stone
were frequent and sharp, having sometimes four or
five of them in an hour, yet such was his desire to
finish that his so much desired Commentary upon the
Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that so soon as the bitter pain
of his fit was over, he still returned to his work, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
some further progress therein. And thus he
continued labouring in that imployment through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pains till <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 6. of <hi>December,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Sickness.</note> 
                     <hi>Anno Christi,
1653.</hi> About which time, as his natural strength was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62956:70"/>
exceedingly decayed, so now also his Intellectuals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fail, and for the following three dayes, a drousi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
seized upon him, insomuch that he could not hold
up his head to look into a Book, but slumbered away
his time in a Chair; and upon <hi>Friday</hi> being the third day
after he had given over his studies, enquiring what
day it was, he cried out, <hi>Alas! I have lost three dayes.</hi>
The day following being <hi>Saturday</hi> he had no desire to
arise out of his bed, neither indeed could he, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his weakness, which was such, and he was so
sensible of it, that he said, <hi>Now I have not long to live
in this world, the time of my departure is at hand, I am
going to my desired Haven;</hi> the apprehension whereof
was no little joy unto him, for he had often said to such
of his friends as came to visit him in his sickness, <hi>I am
willing to dye, having, I bless God, nothing to do but to
dye.</hi> Indeed sometimes he seemed to be in the same
strait with St. <hi>Paul</hi> between Life and Death, <hi>having a
desire to depart that he might be with Christ, which was
best of all:</hi> but yet very desirous he was to finish his
Commentary upon the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which
he knew would be very useful to the Church of God,
and in that respect he was willing to live; and God so
far answered his desire in that particular, that he lived
to finish it within half a Chapter. But when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that his time in this world could not be long,
O! how sweet, and joyful was the apprehension of
Death unto him, which he often termed, <hi>his best friend
next to Jesus Christ.</hi> So that he came willingly; he
was not plucked and dragged to Death: Death was
his familiar acquaintance; it was his priviledge as
well as his task. When his good sister said to him in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62956:71"/>
his sickness, Brother, I am afraid to leave you alone;
<hi>Why Sister</hi> (said he) <hi>I shall I am sure, be with Iesus
Christ when I dye.</hi> The meditation of Death was not
more frequent than sweet unto him. His soul was
upon the wing, and was bent Heaven-ward, even
whilst it was in the cage of his decrepit body.</p>
                  <p>Upon <hi>Saturday,</hi> though he kept his bed through
weakness, yet was he more wakeful, and his spirit
more lively, and cheerful, than for several dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which questionless was from his joyful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of his approaching departure.</p>
                  <p>His speeches that day were more than ordinary
Heavenly: He spake much in the admiration of
Gods Free grace, and riches of his Mercy in Jesus
Christ.</p>
                  <p>As while he lived he led a heavenly life, so about
the time of his death, by those comforts, and joyes
that he found in his soul, he seemed to be in Heaven,
even while he was upon the earth; and so he continued
full of sweet, and divine comfort, and heavenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
to the last of his understanding and speech,
which continued to <hi>Munday</hi> morning, when both of
them failed him; from which time he lay breathing,
yet shorter, and shorter till eight of the clock at night,
about which time, in the presence of all his Children,
and divers of his Friends, he quietly slept in the
Lord,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> making an happy change from earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which was <hi>Decem. 12. Anno Christi</hi> 1653, being
79 years old, after he had served God faithfully and
painfully in his Generation.</p>

occasioned frequently by the view of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
he changed it into <hi>Gataker)</hi> was a branch of a
very ancient Family, so firmly by Gods Providence
planted in <hi>Shropshire,</hi> that the Stock hath continued in
the same House, carrying the Name of its owner, and
known by the Title of <hi>Gatacre-Hall;</hi> by an un-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
succession from the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
<hi>Confessor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Father, Mr. <hi>Thomas Gatacre</hi> (being a younger
Son of <hi>William Gatacre)</hi> was designed by his Parents
to the study of the <hi>Law,</hi> in order whereunto he was
admitted a Student in the Temple: And during his
abode there, he, occasionally went to visit some of his
Kindred, who were then high in place, and power,
whereby he was often present at the examination of
some Christian <hi>Confessors</hi> of the Gospel, in those
bloody times wherein Satan armed all his Forces to
suppress that dawning light which threatned ruine to
his Kingdome of darkness.</p>
                  <p>The harshness and cruelty of those proceedings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the constancy of those weak, yet sincere
Christians, who with evidence of truth, and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of minde maintained faith and a good conscience,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62956:72"/>
were very prevalent with him to facilitate his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of that purer Doctrine of the Gospel which
began to shine into his soul.</p>
                  <p>This being apprehended by his Parents, fearing his
change in Religion, they sent him over to <hi>Lovaine</hi> in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and to win him to a compliance with them
in Religion, they setled upon him an estate in a Lease
of an hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> in old Rents; but
like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. <hi>He counted all outward advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
as nothing in comparison of the knowledge of
Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Father therefore perceiving how fixt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
he was in his choice of Religion, in which yet

when, not onely the clouds of ignorance and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition

means which his Parents applied him unto,<note place="margin">His Education</note> for the
implanting in him the seeds of good Literature, that
he rather needed a bridle, than a spur: For his love of
learning (equal to that admirable capacity, wherewith
the Father of Lights had furnished him) was so active
in the acquiring of it, that his Father was fain often
gently to chide him from his book. Neither were his
nimble wit, sharp judgement, and vast memory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to be the instruments of that debauchery
wherewith the corruption of our Nature doth too
often stain and desloure our first dayes: For he had a
lovely gravity in his young coversation; so that

                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after his settlement there, his Father
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62956:73"/>
(being called by God to receive the reward of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours)
left him, not wholly destitute, and yet not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

and means for him, who was by an hidden counsel
then designed to be an instrument of doing much
service to the Church of Christ. Thus the fruit was
not nipped in a promising bud, by the Frost of
want.</p>
                  <p>Now not from meer favour,<note place="margin">His industry and preferment</note> but from merit (upon

of that worthy Society, wherein he continued his
studies with unwearied diligence, and happy success,
till he, with abilities answerable to his Degree, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
Master of Arts. For an instance of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
take this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was a constant Auditor
of that eminent Light of Learning, Mr. <hi>John Boys,</hi>
who read a <hi>Greek</hi> Lecture in his bed to certain young
Students that preferred their nightly studies before
their rest and ease. The notes of those Lectures he
kept as a treasure, and being visited by Mr. <hi>Boys</hi> many
years after, he brought them forth to him, to the
no small joy of the good old man, who professed
that he was made some years younger by that grateful
entertainment.</p>
                  <p>About this time was contracted that streight friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
betwixt our Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> and that faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of Jesus Christ. Mr. <hi>Richard Stock,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

to the death of this Reverend Minister, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> testimony given unto him at his
Funeral.</p>
                  <p>An evidence of that good esteem which Mr. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi>
had now acquired for his Learning and Piety
was this,<note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Sidney</hi> College.</note> That a College being then to be erected by
the Munificence of the Countess of <hi>Sussex,</hi> the
Trustees of that Foundress (being persons eminent
for Prudence and Zeal) did choose him for one of that
Society, and they transplanted him into that new
Nursery of Arts and Religion, being confident that
he would (as indeed he did by Christs assistance) prove
very fruitful both for the ornament and benefit of that
Seminary.</p>
                  <p>Indeed they laid hold of him before the house was
fit for Inhabitants, fearing lest so fair and promising a
Flower should be taken up by some other hand. But
while the College was in building. (that he might not
lose any opportunity of doing good) he retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the house of Mr. <hi>William Aylofes</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His abode in <hi>Essex.</hi>
                     </note> who
had prevailed with him to instruct both himself in the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, and his eldest Son in that Literature
which was proper to his age.</p>
                  <p>In this Family,<note place="margin">His imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there.</note> partly by his own inclination, and

to them a portion of Scripture every morning,
that the Sun of Righteousness might as constantly
arise in their hearts, as the day brake in upon them.
In this Exercise, whereby he laboured to profit both
himself and others, he went over the Epistles of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62956:74"/>
Apostles, the Prophesie of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and a good part of
the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> rendring the Text out of the
Original Languages, and then delivering cleer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
and also deducing usefull Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Stern,</hi> the <hi>Suffragan</hi> of <hi>Colchester,</hi> on a time
visiting the Mistress of the Family (to whom he was
nearly related) happened to be present at one of these
Exercises, at which time Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> explicated the
first Chapter of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
which is known to be most pregnant of Divine My
steries: But this portion of holy Writ he treated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with such happy elucidations, that the judicious
Doctor was much satisfied with his pains therein, and
admiring the endowments of Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> exhorted
him instantly to be Ordained to the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
whereby those his gifts might be authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
exercised for the publick good, and improved
for the building up of the Church, and withall, offered
him his assistance in that business: But Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi>
well weighing the burden of that Calling, and judging
modestly of his own abilities, which he conceived dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable
for that Office (to the full discharge

thanked the Doctor for his kinde offer, but

The Fabrick of <hi>Sidney-Sussex</hi> College being now
finished,<note place="margin">His return to <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                     </note> he betook himself to the station, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereunto he was before designed, and to the
work depending thereon, wherein his pains in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
young Students with principles of Piety and
Learning,<note place="margin">His Diligence</note> were both great, and very successful: For
some of them that watered their Gardens at his
Spring, or kindled their Lamps at his Light, grew up
to great eminency, as Mr. <hi>John Hoyl,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas
Pell,</hi> who were afterwards worthy Fellows of that
Society.</p>
                  <p>About that time there were certain persons in the
University, zealous of promoting the glory of God,
and of gaining souls to Christ, that lay in a sad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through the defect of Pastors able to teach, and
lead the people in the wayes of truth, life, and peace,
especially Mr. <hi>Abdias Ashton</hi> of St. <hi>Johns</hi> College,
and Mr. <hi>William Bedel</hi> of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> who set on foot a
design of preaching in places adjacent to <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
even to a considerable distance. These men invited
Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> to be a partner in this good imployment,
who being drawn, and encouraged by them, preached
every Lords day at <hi>Everton</hi> (a Village in the meeting-confines
of <hi>Cambridge,</hi>

respect, which by him was construed to be an effect of
his Piety.</p>

                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:62956:75"/>
After he had thus religiously imployed himself for
the space of half a year, manifesting his publick spirit
therein, he had some causes that moved him to retire
from the University at the motion of Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>This place and imployment occasioned a more

                     </note> some
principal persons of that Honourable Society (who
had been his Auditors occasionally elsewhere) made
addresses unto him, inviting him unto that place,
offering their assistance, and alledging the facility of
his Introduction by the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Pophams</hi>
interessing himself in the business, whom they knew
to have loved his Father Mr. <hi>Thomas Gataker</hi> (being
once his intimate friend, and contemporary in the
study of the <hi>Law)</hi> and to favour this his son very
highly for his own worth and work in the Ministry:
But he, according to his usual modesty, declined the
undertaking of it, and resisted the importunities even
of his Friend Mr. <hi>Stock;</hi> till Dr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> Master
of <hi>Sidney</hi>-College, repairing to <hi>London,</hi> and being

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) laying that aside, he pressed Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62956:76"/>
Arguments, and Authority, encouraging him against
his own dissidence, and so wrought him at last to an
assent, that without any suit made by him the Lord
<hi>Popham</hi> should recommend him to that Society.</p>
                  <p>Thus was he chosen Preacher at <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi>
where he spent ten years to the great advancement of
Piety amongst them, and with an happy Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some abuses of the Lords day, as he himself
testifies in his <hi>Apologetical</hi> Discourse against <hi>Lilly,</hi>
p. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding that engagement, Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi>
did not totally abandon the Family of Sir <hi>William
Cook,</hi> to whose Lady he was near by blood, and dear
to them both upon the account of his pious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
labours amongst them. Therefore in the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation-times,
being dis-ingaged from his attendance
at the <hi>Innes of Court,</hi> he resided in that Family, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
his Ministry either in their Chappel, or in the
Parish Church as occasion offered it self; and this he
did with an <hi>Apostolical</hi> minde, not for filthy lucre,
but freely, making the Gospel a burden onely to the
Dispenser of it; yet such was the care and piety of
that Religious pair, that they also would not serve
God with that that cost them nothing: For aftewards,
in consideration of those his pains freely taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, they settled upon Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
of 20 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> which also he received for
some few years, but afterwards he saw reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to the Heire of that Family, forbearing to
make use of his right he had to it, and forbidding
his Executor to demand any Arrears of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity.</p>

                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:62956:76"/>

But his own pen wrote the best Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,

that will give him a just Character, have need of his

                  <p>Whilst he attended on that Flock at <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi>
Sir <hi>William Sidley,</hi> a learned <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> and pious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
of the Church, proffered him a fair Benefice; and
when Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> declined the burden of a Pastoral

from those worthy Gentlemen (of whose favour he
had such good experience) he endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him that by taking an assistant, all those incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences

poised the burden in the ballance of the Sanctuary,
alwayes judged one cure of souls to be sufficient for
one man, and therefore ventured the unkinde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
of the Noble Gentleman upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal,
rather than the multiplying of preferments to

                  <p>After ten years labours profitably imployed at

a transaction with the mother of certain Orphans in
whose hands the Patronage was supposed to rest) some
of the Religious Inhabitants, valuing the means of
Grace above all their other outward enjoyments, cast
their eyes, and thoughts upon Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> to gain
whom, to their own intreaties, they added the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his good Friend Mr. <hi>Richard Stock,</hi> who, when
he had by many reasons remonstrated unto him that
God did give him a clear call to that place, whose
honour, and Ordinances might suffer prejudice by
the intrusion of an unworthy man if he should refuse
the call, he at last suffered himself to be perswaded,
and prevailed with to undertake that charge; which
being represented to Sir <hi>Henry Hobart,</hi> the Kings
<hi>Atturney General</hi> by Mr. <hi>Randolph Crew</hi> (afterwards

lay in the way, or that might hinder his acceptance of
the presentation of Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> which, being signed

                  <p>The report of this his removal was no welcome

would fain have retained him, and some of them
offered an enlargement of his maintenance for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

the consistence of both imployments by the help of
an assistant: But he that made not his Ministry a

complained that some did in his time, and too many
do in our times, would not multiply his burdens,

with the abatement of natural heat, his indisposition
would grow less vigorous and violent.</p>
                  <p>To the work of his Ministry in publick upon the
<hi>Sabbaths,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</note> he added a <hi>Catechetical</hi> weekly Lecture on
<hi>Fridays</hi> in the evening, which was designed by him, to
lay the foundation of saving knowledge in the hearts of
the children, of whom a certain number every Lecture
day did give an account of their knowledge by set
Answers to Questions delivered out to them afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
for their instruction (this course of holding <hi>a
form of sound words,</hi> agreeable to the Doctrine of the
Gospel consigned in holy Writ, of what importance
it is, we may gather from that ignorance, and those
errours which have invaded the Church in these our
times; which mischiefs can hardly be imputed to any
thing so much as to the neglect of that usefull duty of
<hi>Catechizing.)</hi> But that exercise was performed by him
with such an accurate, and methodical explication of
the whole <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> that Christians of riper
years, and of long standing in Christs School, did
resort to be partakers of those discourses, wherein
their well-exercised senses did find not only <hi>milk</hi> fit <hi>for
babes,</hi> but also <hi>solid meat</hi> suitable to <hi>grown men</hi> in <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This course he continued till he had compleated a
pefect <hi>Summary of Divinity,</hi> and gave it over when
he saw that the least part of his Auditory consisted
of those for whose sakes he principally intended this
work; his Parishoners being grown at least to a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62956:78"/>
neglect of his free labours in that kinde.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> constant retirement in his study cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to make choise of an help meet for him that
might oversee his Family,<note place="margin">His first Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> which was a necessary act
of prudence; and therefore not long before he left
<hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> he married the widow of Mr. <hi>William
Cupp,</hi> to whose two daughters he was so providently
kinde in their education, that he disposed of them in
marriage to two Divines of note in the Church, and
continued such a fatherly love to them, and theirs,
that the world mistook them for his own children.
That wife dyed in child-bed of a son that did bear the
Fathers name, who, after that he had seen the most
remote parts of the world, wherewith we keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
returned home to his Father, and dyed in peace.</p>
                  <p>The same motive still being in force, he after a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
interval of widow-hood, chose for himself the
daughter of a Reverend Minister,<note place="margin">His second Marriage.</note> Mr. <hi>Charles Pinner,</hi>
who was brought up in the worthy, and religious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of Mr. <hi>Ellis Crisp,</hi> brother to Mrs. <hi>Pinner;</hi>
and it pleased God to give him a Son by her, whom in
process of time he dedicated unto God in the work
of the Ministry, but immediately to take away the
mother, so that the mothers <hi>Funerals,</hi> and the childes
<hi>Baptisme</hi> were celebrated together. Thus our wise
and gracious Father tempers the cup for his children,
lest they should surfet upon earthly enjoyments, as
they might easily do if they were unmixed with occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of sorrow.</p>
                  <p>Then did Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> remain for many years in a
disconsolate condition,<note place="margin">His third Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> till at last he adventured and
married a Gentlewoman of a very considerable Family,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62956:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being sister to Sir <hi>George,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Farwell,</hi> and a
good esteem for knowledge and piety. By her he had
three children, whereof a son, and a daughter were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the ground before their mother, but the third
yet lives to walk by the light of her Fathers life and
Doctrine. This his third wife being of a contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
minde, fell into a consumption, which so wasted
her body, that her soul took its flight from thence into
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Last of all he took to wife a Citizens widow,<note place="margin">His fourth Marriage.</note>
whose comfortable conversation he enjoyed for the
space of four and twenty years, but without any issue
by her. His love to her was one motive that induced
him to remove out of his Parsonage house into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
habitation of his own revenue. For, supposing
that she might survive him, he would make a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
provision for her, that she might not be subject
to the curtesie of another for her removal; and that
affection extended it self in his great liberality to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

from him, and that both in her life time, and
since her decease.</p>
                  <p>He survived her two years within a few dayes, and
because he numbred his dayes with wisdome, and
thereupon presumed that the time was approaching
wherein his soul should be married to the Lamb, he
would not endure to listen to the motion of some,
who would have advised him to a new entanglement
in the world.</p>
                  <p>Having thus related his several Marriages in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Narrative, let us now step back to take notice
of some passages in time that went before the last of
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:62956:79"/>
                     <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1620,<note place="margin">He views the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> having a justifiable curiosity
to see our neighbour Churches in the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi>
and something of the <hi>Spanish Provinces</hi> in
the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> he took advantage of the Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> for a
free passage between both Countries. Thereupon
with his entire friend, Captain <hi>Joshua Downing,</hi> and an
old acquaintance, Mr. <hi>Roger Hughs</hi> (his <hi>Mnason,</hi> whose
house he frequented at <hi>London</hi>) he took his voyage,
taking also along with him a Nephew of his, who was
a young Student, to be a partner with him in his
Travels. His mother being then alive, had some
fears, lest he being a known and noted adversary to
the Popish cause (which he had mortally wounded
with many and sharp weapons) should suffer incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
from that generation of Vipers, whose vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and virulent malice often prompts them to base
course of secret revenge; but God was his guide, his
<hi>Sun,</hi> and his <hi>Shield,</hi> and so prospered his journey, that
within a months space (for they took Boat <hi>July</hi> the 13,
and returned safe <hi>August</hi> the 14,) he had viewed the
most considerable places in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> In
this his travel he gave better satisfaction to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Church in <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> where he gave way to
the importunity of friends, who were desirous to
hear him as well as glad to see him, than he did to the
<hi>English Papists</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with whom he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
debates, wherein he drove some to a confusion
whom he could not draw to a conversion.</p>

                     <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1642. A violent fit of the Colick
assaulted him, and brought him to the very brink of
the Grave; but it pleased God to bring him back
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62956:80"/>
again that he might do him further service. For the
year ensuing, before he had well recovered his strength,
he was called by the Parliament to sit as one of the
<hi>Assembly</hi> which was summoned to be consulted with
about Religion;<note place="margin">He is chos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

truth, and suppressing errour were sincere and serious:
And his study of peace with modesty was in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that when his Reasons delivered concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christs obedience in order to our Justification
(wherein he differed from his Brethren, could not
obtain assent from the <hi>major</hi> part, which determined
the Question contrary to his sense, his great love of
unity imposed upon him silence, and wrought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
upon him resolutions, not to publish his discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
upon that subject from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. that so he might
not publickly discover dissent from the Votes of that
Reverend <hi>Assembly.</hi> I wish there had been the like
prudence and modesty in some others, who profess
themselves to differ but in circumstantials.</p>
                  <p>During his attendance upon the work of that
Convention,<note place="margin">His Self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.</note> the Earle of <hi>Manchester</hi> (being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his great worth, and fitness in regard of his
Learning of all kindes for <hi>Academical</hi> transactions)
offered him the Mastership of <hi>Trinity</hi> College in
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> which is the greatest preferment in that
University. For that Noble Lord being intrusted
by the Parlament with the Reformation of that <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy,</hi>
was not passionately transported with a blinde
partiality of mens persons upon any sinister respects,
but desired to prefer them whom he judged most
worthy, and most hopeful to do Christ service in that
place, and therefore being perswaded that Mr. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:62956:80"/>
might (both in regard of his gravity, and vast
Scholastical abilities) be a choise ornament to that
University, and fair copy for others to write by, he
was very desirous to place him there. But this good
man, though often importuned by many friends to
accept of the motion, according to his accustomed
modesty, with many thanks to the Noble Earle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to undertake that place, though of much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
service, and outward advantage; pleading, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his unworthiness, the weakness of his body
by reason of age, and thereupon his inability to take
journies: and because he looked upon himself, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one foot in the Grave, he humbly desired, that a
younger man might be thought upon, more likely to be
longer serviceable than himself, in a place of so great
eminency and trust. And indeed the sense of his own
weakness was not a vain presage of his decayes;<note place="margin">His Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</note> for
not long after he was again surprised by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
which before had shaken him, and made his
crazie body less able to endure new conflicts, and
these were so sharp, that his recovery appeared despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
not only to his other friends, but even to his
Physitians also. Yet it pleased God though he <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
him sore, not to give him over unto death.</hi> For
his studies, which seemed to be his meat and drink in
his health, were his physick also when he was sick:
For whilst he was confined to his chamber, he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the Press his Dissertation <hi>de Tetragrammato,</hi> and
a <hi>Grammatical</hi> discourse <hi>de Bivocalibus;</hi> and though
this for the subject be not comparable to the other,
yet it may be averred, that what he did by the by,
and for the refreshment of his languishing body, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62956:81"/>
minde, was of more worth than the main work of
many Students.</p>
                  <p>After a long time that he had been a Prisoner
in his own house, he, by Gods assistance recovered
so much strength as that he was able to go to Gods
house: and now he believed himself bound to imploy
his Ministerial Gifts in Gods service, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he again adventured into the Pulpit, where he
spent himself so far that he strained a veyn in his lungs,
for which (being then about Seventy three years old)
he was let blood, by which, and other good means
God was pleased to carry him through that danger.</p>
                  <p>When he had recruited his veyns, and sinews with
fresh abilities, he, being unwilling to fall under that
Woe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. for <hi>not preaching the Gospel,</hi> acted
more according to the willingness of his spirit, than
was proportionable to the weakness of the flesh;
whereupon he fell into a relapse of spitting blood (for
which he again permitted a veyn to be opened) which
laid on him a necessity of forbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ring the Pulpit; yet
would he never forgoe the administration of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi>
nor his usual short discourse at <hi>Funerals</hi>
suitable to the present (whensoever he was sollicited
thereunto) though even those shorter exercises of his
lungs were painful to him, &amp; wasted that oil, which, like
a burning light he spent for the enlightning of others.</p>
                  <p>The main of his time was now spent in his study,
and that was not designed as a meer entertainment of
himself in a quiet privacy, but to the publick benefit
of the Church for the present, and for posterity, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
amongst other works, by those exquisite <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>
upon the Prophesies of <hi>Isaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62956:81"/>
the <hi>Lamentations;</hi> and we should have gained more by
his later industry, if the malicious slanders of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the truth had not diverted his time, and
studies to some necessary <hi>Apologies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither did he,<note place="margin">His care of his Flock.</note> when he was by the hand of God
disabled to preach, betray his Flock into the hands of
Wolves, that would make a prey of precious souls,
nor desert it. For being troubled, lest the foundation
that he had laid (after the example of the wise <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-builder</hi>
St. <hi>Paul)</hi> should either not be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or destroyed, he retained the title of <hi>Rector,</hi>
with a charge beyond the Revenue (as it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
proved) till provision might be made of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and Orthodox Minister, to whom he might

                  <p>To his care of feeding his Flock in publick,<note place="margin">His Family imployments.</note> very
agreeable was his diligence in instructing his Family
in private; for on <hi>Friday</hi> nights weekly after supper
he used to expound that short <hi>Catechisme</hi> which he
had published for the use of his Parishioners; in which
course he so laid forth the Nature and Attributes of
God, the state of man, both intire and corrupt, the
means of his Fall, and Recovery; the nature of Faith
and Repentance, with the Doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
that his Parlour was one of the best Schooles
for a young Student to learn Divinity in; and indeed
his house was a private Seminary for divers young
Gentlemen of this Nation, and far more Forreigners,
who did resort to, and sojourn with him, to receive from
him direction, and advancement in their studies; and
many who afterwards were eminent in the Churches,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62956:82"/>
both here, and abroad, were brought up under his
eye, at least, as <hi>Paul</hi> was at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel.</hi>

Benzon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Georg de Mey,</hi> Dr. <hi>Treschovius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The strength of Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> memory was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,<note place="margin">His great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note>
as may appear by this, that though he used
no <hi>Common-place</hi> book, yet had he in readiness what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he had read, as is manifested by his manifold
Quotations in all his works.</p>
                  <p>His Gifts for edification may be conjectured by his
works which are extant,<note place="margin">His great Learning.</note> in which he hath shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
like the ingenuous and industrious Bee for his rare
extraction of all manner of knowledge from almost
all Authors, and the solid digestion of it first, and
then storing it up for the publick good. His <hi>Polite
Literature</hi> was admired by the great Lights of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62956:82"/>
abroad, as the excellent <hi>Salmasius,</hi> and others
with whom he held correspondence. And the exercise
of it with condescention to children hath been enjoyed
with wonder and pleasure at his Visitation at <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
School with the Right Worshipful Company
of <hi>Skinners,</hi> the worthy Patrons thereof; and that
which made all his knowledge both usefull and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
was, that he was neither vain in ostentation, nor
morose, or illiberal in reservation of it. But beyond
all, he sacrificed his Talents to God, while he made
<hi>Hagar</hi> serve <hi>Sarah,</hi> and contributed the <hi>Egyptian</hi>
spoyls, all his forreign learning towards the building
of the Tabernacle: For with a strange felicity, he
made his Humane Literature (both his <hi>Moral</hi> and
<hi>Critical</hi> studies) to become subservient to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and instrumental to the explication of heavenly
Truths.</p>
                  <p>His Graces of sanctification were very eminent in
every condition, to all purposes, and towards all
his Relations. In the private course of his life, his
Piety, Humility and Charity were very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>His Piety appeared not only by his diligence in
preaching,<note place="margin">His Piety.</note> but also by his own frequenting Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
dispensed by others; in order whereunto he
did once a week at least, repair to some Lecture in
<hi>London,</hi> so long as he had liberty to look beyond the
bounds of his own Parish: He manifested his Piety
also by his strict, careful, and conscientious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lords dayes, which he wholly consecrated
(except the seasons of repast) unto holy duties, and
imployments; and besides he was free in his Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62956:83"/>
upon divers occasions to the maintaing of
the Lords house of Prayer: And because there is
a connexion between sacred persons and things,
his love to godly and faithfull Ministers may be
looked upon as an act of Piety, as well as of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>Another evident instance of his Zeal for Gods
Glory,<note place="margin">His Zeal.</note> was his constant consideration of the state of
Gods Churches abroad, with a diligent enquiry how
it fared with them, and a tender sense of their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which begat his meditation on <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 6. entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Sorrow for Sion:</hi> As also his earnest desire of a
Reformation of things amiss amongst our selves, was
doubtless acceptable unto God, though this sinful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is yet unworthy to have it accomplshed. One
special effect and property of his Piety was,<note place="margin">His holy life.</note> that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of life expressed in a constant tenor of good
duties, with the abridgement of his liberty in things
indifferent, especially of Recreations (for he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
no Recreations besides study, and made the
pleasanter part of his study, the sawce to the more
severe) that he might give no scandal to the good, nor
encouragement to the bad; alledging often those two
golden Rules of St <hi>Paul, All things are lawfull, but all
things are not convenient, or expedient; and all things
are lawfull, but all things edifie not,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 6. <hi>&amp;



10.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>His Humility appeared,</p>
                  <p>1. In that low esteem he had of his own gifts,<note place="margin">His Humility</note>
which yet all others that knew him admired: He was
a true <hi>Moses,</hi> that took not any notice of that shining
lustre of his own countenance. Like a fair ear of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62956:83"/>
Corn loaden with grain, he bended his head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
For he had nothing of the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> temper,
either to advance himself, or to vilifie his Brethren of
meaner gifts.</p>
                  <p>2. In his freedome from ambition of outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.
For he declined not only large means in the
Country, but also both Ecclesiastical Dignities, and
Courtly preferments. For he studiously waved the
counsel of some who had given notice of him to that
hopeful Prince <hi>Henry</hi> (whom God only shewed to
this Land, and then snatched him away to himself)
and had it in their design to make way for his being
admitted Chaplain to his Highness; and for the same
reason he constantly declined publick appearances, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as he could not, without much reluctancy, be
drawn by those who had most interest in him unto
more solemn Assemblies.</p>
                  <p>3. In his meek conversation with, and condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the meanest Christians: For he refused not
familia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>y to converse with the poorest Christian
that repaired to him for counsel or satisfaction in their
doubts.</p>
                  <p>His Charity was large,<note place="margin">His Charity.</note> though for the most part
secret, both in giving, and forgiving to poor persons:
For he would not permit it to blaze, only allowed it
to shine when his example was requisite to lighten and
lead others to glorifie God, and gratifie men. In
redemption of Captives, relief of poor Protestants,
especially of the Ministry; to the repairs of publick
and common losses, and general calamities, and to the
setting forward of any good work he was strangely
liberal, the fruit whereof the Lord returned into his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62956:84"/>
own bosome, according to that promise, <hi>The liberal
soul shall be made fat.</hi> Yet did he not so exhaust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his life, but that in his last <hi>Will</hi> and Testament
he did also bequeathe unto the poor of the Parish of
<hi>Redrith</hi> 50 l. To ten of his Brethren in the Ministry,
whose wants and necessities, especially if occasioned
by the iniquity of the times, he gave 50 l. <hi>i. e.</hi> to each
of them 5 l. and to eight Ministers Widows 5 l. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
in all 40 l. to them. Thus his good works

robbery for sacrifice, <hi>Isa</hi> 61. 8. And Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> was
exactly just in giving every man his due, though very
frequently he remitted of his own right, so that he
was, according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phrase, a <hi>just man,</hi> that
is a kinde, equitable person, of a milde disposition,
no severe exacter of his own, and a free dispenser of

very eminent; the later attended with a deep sense of

                  <p>The first step to his decease (for <hi>morbus est via ad

                     <note place="margin">His Sickness.</note> sickness is the rode way to death) was a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62956:84"/>
fainting fit that surprized him on <hi>Friday</hi> night, <hi>July</hi>
the 7, or rather on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, <hi>July</hi> the 8,
yet of this he made no great account (for he disturbed
not the rest of a servant by calling for assistance) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had at sundry times such faintings, wherein
he gave Nature leave to work out her victory over
those vapours, or viscous humors that oppressed her.
Yet thus far he made use of it, that he compared his
infirmity to that of <hi>Seneca,</hi> which according to his
relation, the Physitians of that age called, <hi>meditationem
mortis,</hi> and wished that it might prove to him a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to his dissolution. The indisposition, not cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with the fit, discovered it self within a short
time to be a <hi>Tertian Ague,</hi> which how gentle soever,
yet falling upon a person of his age, and crazie tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
(who had long supported a weak frame with a very
regular course of diet) made his condition doubtful to
his <hi>Physitian,</hi> who was one of learning and worth, that
imployed his best care and skill about that Patient,
whom he looked upon as a considerable person to the
whole Church.</p>

such order as he thought fit for the settlement of his
outward estate, he composed himself to God; his
<hi>Tertian</hi> growing too strong both for Nature and Art,
resolved it self into an almost continued <hi>Feavor,</hi>
the extream heat whereof was very painful unto him;
yet during those conflicts he shewed a sweet calmness
of minde, a heart weaned from the world, to which
he had no affection, though his memory exactly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him for ordering his charity even to the last; and
in one word, he represented a soul wholly submitting
to Gods good pleasure.</p>

                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:62956:85"/>
He professed more than once, that no outward
thing troubled him so much, as the condition of that
Reverend Minister Mr. <hi>Sainthill,</hi> who had but lately
undertaken that charge at <hi>Redrith</hi> upon the uncertain
Title of Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> life, which now failing so soon,
besides the expectation of his Friends, that Minister
he foresaw was like to be unsettled, and thereby to
suffer some inconvenience.</p>
                  <p>Though Friends, and <hi>Physitians</hi> gave him incouraging
words at their visits, yet he, being sensible of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

to perform the last office for him? He not startled
at the Question, appointed that Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to do that work, because he had done the same
at his last wives Funerals; and one opportunity ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
offered it self to set forward that design. For
<hi>July</hi> the 18, Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> out of his kinde respect to
Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> sent him two <hi>Funeral Sermons</hi> preached
by him, one at Mr. <hi>Whitakers,</hi> the other at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

to Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> in the return for that favour, to
request the last that he could be capable of.</p>
                  <p>Upon the receit of a Letter to that purpose, Mr.

struggle. These, and other of his expressions,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62956:85"/>
Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> presently wrote down, and related them at the
end of his Sermon.</p>
                  <p>That day in the afternoon being <hi>July</hi> the 22,<note place="margin">His return to Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
                     </note> he
called for some Papers of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> which were
sent to him by the Author, with a desire of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning them. He wished some short Notes
(for the perusal of them had been his last work) to be
read over to him, in which he altered something: And
having dictated a Letter to that his Learned and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veren
Friend, he appointed that that with the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
inclosed, should be sent to him. So vigorous
was his minde in a body drooping, and dropping into
the dust.</p>
                  <p>He had now given over the use of Physick as to
any prolongation of his life:<note place="margin">He waits for Death.</note> For he said that he would
struggle no more, because he found that what was
prescribed for the refreshing of nature, did rather op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it, and therefore he was resolved to wait the
Lords leisure. An ancient servant that waited on
him, desiring leave to rectifie the bed-cloaths, and
saying withall, Sir, your head doth not lye right; he
answered, <hi>It will lye right in my Coffin.</hi>

                     <hi>July</hi> the 25,<note place="margin">Death seizeth on his leg.</note> at one a clock in the morning, Death
began to seize on his left foot, from which the spirits
retiring, he felt the deadness of that part, and a very
sharp pain in the part of the leg adjoyning to it.
Hereupon he called for his Son, and told him, <hi>He feared
that he should have a difficult death.</hi> He then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
two Surgeons to be sent for to look upon his

by them that there could not be any ground for
such an apprehension, he rested with patience. In the
evening of that day being visited by Mr. <hi>Santhil,</hi> and
lying in great anguish by reason of the violence of his
heat, he prayed for pity and patience; support here,
and a comfortable issue.</p>

gasping, and panting, he cryed out, <hi>How long Lord,
How long? Come speedily.</hi> But though Death had
made an encroachment upon his outward perishing
part, yet his inward man felt no decay. For with a
full use of reason, he that morning ordered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of a weekly relief to certain poor persons, as
also of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>some small monethly Pensions to some widows
for a season: He also caused his <hi>Physitian</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
with about taking something that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
rest, and was erected to a more cheerful dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
He also enquired after News, and dicoursed
freely, yet confessed himself to be in pain.</p>
                  <p>About three a clock that afternoon,<note place="margin">His last charge to his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> feeling some
great change after the putting forth of Nature, he
called his Sister, Son, and Daughter to receive his last
charge, and when they were come, he thus spake unto
them; <hi>My heart fails, and my strength fails, but God is
my Fortress, and the strong Rock of my salvation: Into
thy hands therefore I commend my soul, for thou hast
redeemed me, O God of truth:</hi> Then turning his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to his Son, he said, <hi>Son, you have a great charge,
look to it: Instruct your wife and family in the fear of
God, and discharge your Ministry conscientiously.</hi> To
his Sister (a Gentlewoman two years elder than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)
he said, <hi>Sister, I thought you might have gone
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62956:86"/>
before me, but God calls for me first, I hope we shall meet
in Heaven, I pray God to bless you.</hi> His Daughter he
admonished, <hi>to minde the worldless, and God more, for
that all things without Piety, and the true fear of God
are nothing worth.</hi> He advised also that his Son <hi>Draper</hi>
(being a man of means) should entertain some godly
Minister into his house to teach his children, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
his family. He exhorted them all to love and
concord, which (he said) he hoped the rather, because
he had cleerly settled his estate, so as to prevent
differences. He inlarged himself in each of these a
little, wishing them all to lay to heart the words of a
dying man. After this he desired that all should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
and leave him to his rest, which he hoped was
at hand: But all his conflicts were not yet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the 27, His voice began to be less intelligible,
the putrid preternatural heat having furred up his
mouth, as is usual in Feavors; yet both his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and senses were very quick and active: About
six of the clock in the evening he called for his Son to
recommend his soul unto God by prayer, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to express what he desired, but could not do it
so clearly as to be well understood; yet by his gestures
he gave assurance that he understood perfectly, and
concurred fervently with the devotions used on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
Within an hour after, Nature being quite spent,
he gave up the ghost,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> and was translated into that Rest
which he so often and earnestly had desired to finde
in another World, because he could obtain none in
this.</p>
                  <p>Thus after forty three years inspection of this pious
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62956:87"/>
and diligent Pastor of <hi>Redrith,</hi> he left his Flock, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the <hi>great, and chief Shepherd of our souls,</hi>
from his gracious hands to receive an <hi>incorruptible
Crown of glory,</hi> having almost compleated fourscore
years.</p>
                  <p>For his Person,<note place="margin">His Character</note> the express whereof (though he
was often importuned by dear Friends) he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
allow to be taken either by pencel, or sculpture.
He was of a middle stature, of a thin body, and of a
lively countenance, of a fresh complexion, that looked
young when he came to preach at <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>incolns Inne,</hi> and
yet was grey betimes, which made him to be thought
elder than he was, because he had long appeared
ancient in the eyes of the world; of a choicely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
diet; of a free and cheerful conversation, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
much to study, yet not secluding himself from
fit company. He was of a quick apprehension, sharp
reason, solid judgement, vast memory, which (through
Gods mercy) continued fresh to the last of his dayes.
He was <hi>Helluo librorum,</hi> one that did not vainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his Liberary for ostentation, but chose books
for use, which also he made of them so happily, that
he had conquered a strong portion of learning, which
he made to serve him upon all occasions. He was not
so great a treasurer, as a free dispenser of those riches
of the minde, which he did communicate readily,
expeditely and cleerly. He was an ornament to the
University, and of that Society designed for the study
of the Law; a Light of the Church, the salt of the
place where he abode; a loving Husband; a discreet
Parent; a faithful Friend; a kinde Neighbour; a
courteous entertainer of strangers; a candid encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62956:87"/>
of Students; a stout Champion for the Truth,
yet a lover of peace, preserving the unity of Charity
even where there was difference of judgement; an
Adversary to novel fancies, as well as to antiquated
superstitons in Religion; of a Christian Magnanimity
in despising the world, and therefore resolute, through
<hi>bad report,</hi> as well as <hi>good,</hi> to maintain a clear consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
In brief, he was a faithful Shepherd, and a fit
mirrour for Pastors, as well as an exact patern for
people; who having almost compleated eighty years,
departed full of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <head>The Life and Death of Mr. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy
Whitaker, who dyed Anno
Christi, 1654.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>JEremy Whitaker</hi> was born at <hi>Wakefield</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,
Anno Christi</hi> 1599, In which place also he was
trained up in the <hi>Grammar</hi> School;<note place="margin">His Birth.</note> and it seems that
the Lord betimes did draw forth his love towards
himself, for even whilst he was a School boy, his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
did flow out towards those who were most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously
disposed, in whose company he used fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to go eight or ten miles to hear a wakening-soul-warming
Sermon;<note place="margin">His early seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</note> he used also to joyn with them
in Prayers, and other holy exercises and duties; and
being able to take Sermon Notes, both understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
and largely, he was very helpful to those pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christians in repeating what they had publickly
heard, being from his child-hood full of affections in
whatsoever business he undertook. Thus this Plant
of Gods own setting, did both blossome, and put
forth fruit quickly, which Providence did afterwards
make a very fruitful Tree.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was at the <hi>Grammar</hi> School, though his
Father endeavoured often,<note place="margin">His esteem of the Ministry.</note> and earnestly to divert his
thoughts from the Office of the Ministry, yet was he
unmoveable in his desires to be a Minister, and he
never afterwards repented of this his choice, but
would all his life long upon all occasions, magnifie that
his Office, insomuch as he hath often been heard to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62956:89"/>
utter this speech, <hi>I had much rather be a preacher of the
Gospel, than an Emperour;</hi> and when a motion was
once made to him to be the Head of a College in the
University, he readily returned this answer, <hi>My heart
doth more desire to be a constant Preacher, than to be the
Master of any College in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was sixteen years old,<note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                     </note> being well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the <hi>Grammar</hi> School, he was sent to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and admitted a Sizar in <hi>Sydney-Sussex</hi>
College, where he soon discovered, and was
taken notice of, and much valued for his pregnant
parts and Scholarship.</p>
                  <p>At twenty years of age he Commenced Bachelor
of Arts,<note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Okeham.</hi>
                     </note> and a while after he was sent to <hi>Okeham</hi>
(the chiefest Town in <hi>Rutlandshire)</hi> there to teach the
Free-School.</p>
                  <p>At that time there was one Mr. <hi>William Peachy,</hi> the
Minister at <hi>Okeham,</hi> a godly man, and a painful
Preacher of the Gospel, and eminent for his skill in
the sacred Languages, who dearly loved, and highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
our Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> from his first acquaintance with
him; which he manifested by proffering to him his
Daughter in Marriage, as Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> hath since
told some of his Friends; he was the rather inclined to
accept of the motion, because she was the Daughter of
a pious, painful, and learned Minister of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
and occasionally hath told his Friends, that
he was the better pleased with his choice, because of
that relation.</p>
                  <p>About four years after his coming to <hi>Okeham</hi> he
married <hi>Chephtzibah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Marriage and Children.</note> the Daughter of the said
Mr. <hi>Peachy,</hi> by whom God gave him four Sons, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62956:90"/>
three Daughters. All his Sons he designed for the
Ministry, but it pleased God in his life time, to take
one of them away whilst he was a Student in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;</hi>
the other three survived, and he lived to see
two of them Ordained, and set apart for the work of
the Ministry; the third he appointed to be educated
for the same work.</p>
                  <p>Having staid about seven years at <hi>Okeham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Stretton.</hi>
                     </note> he was
removed to a Pastoral charge at <hi>Stretton</hi> in the same
County, where he continued about the space of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he continued School-master at <hi>Okeham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His great pains.</note> he
undertook and preached a weekly Lecture there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many Sermons which he preached occasionally
in neghbouring Congregations: And during his abode
at <hi>Stretton,</hi> besides his Pastoral imployment, wherein
he preached twice every Lords day, he also constantly
preached his weekly Lecture at <hi>Okeham,</hi> and was a
principal prop to hold up some other Lectures in the
Neighbourhood. His manner also was to set apart
every Holy-day (if there were but one in the week) as
a day of seeking God in reference to the necessities of
the times,<note place="margin">His frequent Fastings.</note> and no man was more free, and frequent in
assisting in dayes of Humiliation in private, both in
<hi>Rutlandshire,</hi> and in the adjacent Counties whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was called, and invited thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Such was his love to Christ,<note place="margin">His Family-duties.</note> that his publick imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(though many and great) did not take him off
from attending his Family duties, nor from more
private exercises of communion with God; his ordinary
course in his Family was, together with Prayers, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
some part of the holy Scriptures, and that twice
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62956:90"/>
every day, besides other parts of Scripture which he
daily read in secret; so that usually he read all the
Epistles in the <hi>Greek</hi> Testament twice every fortnight;
yea, when by reason of extremity of pain, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he could not read himself, he herein imployed
others for his help. Hence it came to pass that he was
a man mighty in the Scriptures, like unto <hi>Apollos,</hi>
Act. 18. 24. as was observed by all that conversed
with him, or that heard him preach or pray, and this
course he earnestly commended to the practice of his
dearly beloved eldest Son, as an excellent means to
make him both a ready, and a profitable Preacher.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he lived in <hi>Rutlandshire,</hi> came forth the
Book allowing Sports on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Zeal and Courage.</note> which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to read, though it was with commands and
threatning pressed upon him. And afterwards when
he was called to give in his answer about a contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongst Ministers to maintain the War against the
<hi>Scots,</hi> he openly told the Bishop, or his Chancellor, that
his conscience would not permit him to do it. This his
answer exposed him to the hazard of losing both his
Living and Ministry, as the times then were; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
one of his neighbours, through misguided love,
(compassionating him and his Family) payed the money
required, and subscribed Mr. <hi>Whitakers</hi> name without
his knowledge. This was long concealed from him;
but when he came to the knowledge of it, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
his dislike with many complaints, and much
grief of heart.</p>
                  <p>As he had early, so he had constant vigorous work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of heart towards the calling and work of the
Ministry,<note place="margin">His delight i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Ministry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and that upon this ground, because he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62956:91"/>
wayes conceived, that therein a Christian might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
most fellowship with Christ, and have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of doing him the best service; and he often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
Christs speech to <hi>Peter, If thou lovest me, feed
my Sheep, feed my Lambs,</hi> Joh. 21. 15, 17.</p>
                  <p>He was never so well pleased with any imployment
as when he was about the works of his Ministry: In
the Pulpit he was (as it were) in his own element, like
a Fish in the water, or a Bird in the air. Though many
times he went thither halting, and full of pain, yet
did he not manifest any sense of distemper whilst he
was in the Pulpit.</p>
                  <p>When an <hi>Assembly of Divines</hi> was to be chosen to
consult,<note place="margin">He is chosen to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> and advise the Parliament about <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
affairs, he was, for his eminent piety and learning, no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minated
for one, and how usefull and advantagious he
was to those affairs, is well known to all that were
Members of that Assembly; and when Providence
had thus brought him to <hi>London,</hi> he was (as <hi>Paul,</hi>
2 Cor. 11. 23.) <hi>In labours more abundant,</hi> than many,
yea than most others.</p>
                  <p>Not long after his coming to <hi>London,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He is chosen to <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens Bermondsey</hi>
                     </note> he was called,
and chosen to the Pastoral charge of <hi>Mary Magdalen
Bermondsey</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> about which he consulted
with many godly and judicious Ministers, and with
their consent and approbation accepted of it, after
which, for the most part, his task was to preach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
four Sermons every week, two in his own
Charge, one at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and one at <hi>Christ Church
London;</hi> and after he had laid down his <hi>Christ Church</hi>
Lecture, at the importunity of the Inhabitants, he
took up one at <hi>Stepney,</hi> besides his preaching two
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62956:91"/>
Lectures quarterly at <hi>Michaels Cornhill:</hi> Adde to
these his preaching monethly at the morning Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,<note place="margin">His great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</note>
or else he assisted on the Fast dayes in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of those Exercises; besides his many occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sermons, as for preparation to the Sacrament in
his own Church, and at Funerals, both at home and
abroad; yea, it is truly reported of him, that he would
never deny any request for preaching and praying, if
Godgave him bodily ability, or other unavoidable
occasions did not necessarily hinder him. Many week
dayes he preached twice, even then when he attended
the work of the <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> to wit, the
morning Exercise, either at <hi>Westminster,</hi> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and upon some other occasion in the afternoon
of the same day. This may minde us of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> Phil.
2. 30. <hi>For the work of the Lord he was nigh unto death,
not regarding his life.</hi> So its well known to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
that this might fitly be applied to painfull
Mr. <hi>Whitaker;</hi> yea many conceived that his painfull
diseases, which hastened his removal from us, were
occasioned, and encreased by his many constant, and
indefatigable labours in this kinde.</p>
                  <p>And though he preached so often, yet were not his
Sermons j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>june, wordy, empty Sermons; but alwayes
full of Scripture strength, savoury, and affectionate, as
his Auditors can well testfie.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this to be wondred at,<note place="margin">He was a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</note> if we consider
that he was a universal Scholar, both in the Arts, and
original Languages: By much study he had digested
the whole body of Divinity; he was well acquainted
both with the Fathers and School-men: An acute
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62956:92"/>
and solid Disputant, excellently versed in Cases of
Conscience, and second unto none in his acquaintance
with the sacred Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Since our times of wofull desertion and Apostasie,
both from Gospel Truths and practices, he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly
both in private Conferences, and in his
publick Ministry express his dislike, yea his detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, to the faces of them how great soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
who too much favoured <hi>Heresies,</hi> Errours, and
Ranting courses, though he knew that thereby he
did run the hazard of procuring many frowns to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                  <p>He refused to sign and subscribe the late Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">His Zeal and Courage.</note>
though thereby he was in danger of losing his
Lecture at <hi>Westminster;</hi> and if his Sermons preached
there upon <hi>Eph. 2. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 3. concerning mens <hi>walking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the course of this world, &amp;c. Fulfilling the
lusts of the flesh, &amp;c.</hi> could be collected, and published,
it would thereby appear, that Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> out of his
zeal for Gods glory, and love to his Lord Christ, was
of an undaunted courage, and full of Christian magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.
One further testimony whereof we have in
this following Story:</p>
                  <p>Since these stormy times began, wherein the liberty
and livelyhood of Ministers hath been so much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned
and struck at, as he was riding with one of his
intimate friends by <hi>Tiburn</hi> (which he had not seen, or
not observed before) he asked what that was? and being
answered that it was <hi>Tiburn,</hi> where so many Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
had lost their lives; he stopped his Horse, and
uttered these words with much aflection, <hi>Oh what a
shame is it that so many thousands should dye for the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62956:92"/>
satisfaction of their lusts, and so few be found willing to
lay down their lives for Christ? why should not we in a
good cause, and upon a good call be ready to be hanged
for Jesus Christ? It would be an everlasting honour,
and it is a thousand times better to dye for Christ, to be
hanged, or to be burnt for Christ, than to dye in our
beds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He did often, and zealously defend the Office of a
Gospel Ministry both in publick, and in private, and
that especially amongst those persons, and in those
places, where (as he conceived) there was most need. In
one of his morning Lectures at <hi>Westminster,</hi> this passage
came from him with much affection, <hi>Though</hi> (said he)
<hi>I have read, and heard of some good men, who unadvisedly
in their passion, have persecuted the persons of some
godly Ministers (as</hi> Asa <hi>was angry with the Prophet,
and cast him into prison) yet I never knew, I never
read, nor heard of any godly person who durst oppose the
Office and Calling of the Ministry.</hi> And whereas at
the end of his Sermon, a Souldier (expressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be dissatisfied with what he had spoken) came
to him in private, and asked him, whether he meant
this of the Ministry of <hi>England,</hi> as now constituted?
He returned him this answer, <hi>Although I will not justifie
the calling of every individual Minister in the Church
of</hi> England <hi>(as you dare not justifie the Saintship of
every member in your Independent Congregations) yet
I will be ready when, and where you please, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Office, and Calling of</hi> Englands <hi>Ministry at
this day</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And that he continued unmoved,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His high esteem of the Ministry.</note> 
                     <hi>and unchanged in
his judgement, and esteem of the Ministerial Calling
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62956:93"/>
to the last, may be manifested by this passage in his
last</hi> Will <hi>and</hi> Testament, <hi>which is here set down in his
own words, and written with his own hand,</hi> For my
Son <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> my desire is that he be bred a Scholar, and
that the Lord would spiritually incline his heart, freely to
give up himself to the Lord to serve him in the work of
the Ministry, which Calling and Imployment (though
now despised) I do esteem above all others in the world,
and do commend it to all mine, that if the Lord bless
them with Sons, they would commend this Calling to
their Posterity.</p>
                  <p>And truly this deserves seriously to be considered,
whether there be not herein much to credit and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Ministry of the Gospel, that a learned
man, and so eminent for piety, who also had throughly
studied the Controversie of the times, and had heard
and read what could be said against the Ministry,
should yet upon his Death-bed give such a Testimony
unto it, when he daily expected to make up his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
before God, and also give such great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to his Posterity, to addict themselves to
this calling now, even now, when such disgrace is cast
upon it, and when the Ministers setled maintenance
is threatned to be taken from them: And may not
those men, who knew Mr. <hi>Whitakers</hi> worth, be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
awed and moved to take heed how they oppose or
slight that Calling of men, whom he, living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
judged to be so highly honoured by God himself?
To this also adde, that it was an <hi>Ordained</hi> Ministry,
which he thus valued, which appears by these two
lively Testimonies; 1. In that he joyned with that
<hi>Classis</hi> whereof he was a member in Ordaining of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62956:93"/>
2. In that he had an hand in the Book not
long since published by the Province of <hi>London</hi> in the
defence of such a Ministry, not onely by his assent
to it, but also by his assistance in drawing it up.</p>
                  <p>As Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> loved God dearly,<note place="margin">Gods love to him.</note> so God loved
him, which he manifested by those grace wherewithall
he enriched him; and truly love tokens are real Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
of his love that sendeth them; and what surer
signs can we have of Gods love, then when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows
upon us the Graces of his Holy Spirit? Now
of these the Lord had given him a more than ordinary
measure, and besides, what hath been said before,
there were five Graces more which were very Orient,
and shining in his Crown.</p>
                  <p>1. His tenderness of heart:<note place="margin">His tender-heartedness.</note> Who ever knew a
man of a more melting frame of heart before God,
whether in Confessions, Petitions, or Thanksgivings?
Is there any one living that can say, that I have at
sometimes joyned with him in Prayer, and he shed no
tears? How did his own sinfulness (though it was no
more than the ordinary imperfections of the fairest
Saint upon earth) the evils of the times, and the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Gods displeasure breaking out upon us,
break his heart into pieces? We may truly believe
that for the space many years, he did never come off
from the serious consideration of these things with
dry eyes; and how many thousands be there of
Gods children, that would account it a sign of much
love from Christ, if they could finde such thawings in
their frozen breasts?</p>
                  <p>2. His meekness of spirit, with which precious
Jewel he was richly adorned:<note place="margin">His Meekness.</note> Who ever saw him
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62956:94"/>
transported by passion, on a fire through foolish anger,
or disgused by discontent? Though his zeal would
waxe hot, and burn in him for God and his Glory;
yet he was a man of a cool spirit, and meek, like <hi>Moses,</hi>
in all his own concernments; and this he hath often
manifested in a remarkable manner, when disputing
with men of dissenting Principles and opinions, yet his
spirit was so even that their unhandsome provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
could not discompose him, and drive him into
passion.</p>
                  <p>3. For his Patience,<note place="margin">His Patience.</note> he may well be called a second
<hi>Job.</hi> Many who saw him under those racking pains
in his last sickness, so frequently reiterated, and so
long continued, were confident that God did put him,
and keep him in his Furnace to be a pattern of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
unto Posterity. It is confessed that he did roar
many times till his throat was dry; but who ever
heard him speak any one word of murmuring or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
because of Gods afflicting Providence? He
himself indeed would sometimes through tenderness
of conscience charge himself of impatiency, because
he made a noise in his extremity: but that expressed
onely Natures sensibleness, not sinful frowardnes; and
when (accusing himself causelesly) he was minded of
Christs roarings, yet free from all sin, he would be
silent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I confess indeed, that in his desires to be dissolved
he would take up</hi> Jobs <hi>complaint,</hi> Wherefore is light
given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter
in soul? which long for death, but it cometh not, and
dig for it more than for hid treasures, &amp;c. For my sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cometh before I eat, and my roarings are powred out
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62956:94"/>
like waters, <hi>Job 3. 20, 24. But he alwayes concluded
with submission to the good pleasure of God. When
he had been asked how he did? this was frequently
his answer,</hi> The Bush alwayes burning, but not consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
and though my pains be above the strength of
nature, yet they are not above the supports of Grace.</p>
                  <p>4. The Lord was pleased to vouchsafe him such a
measure of the Spirit of Grace and Supplications,<note place="margin">His spirit of Prayer.</note> that
his soul was never out of tune for that service. Most
of his words when he was under torment, were holy
complaints and prayers to God. It will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
or unprofitable, if I here set down some of
them.</p>
                  <p>O my God help! Father of mercies pity! Do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for ever! Consider my frame that I am but dust!
My God that hath made Heaven and earth, help me! Oh,

                     </gap>t! If my
patience was more, my pain would be less. Dear Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
where are thy bowels? why dost thou make me an
astonishment to my self and others? Why dost thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thy self with a thick cloud, that our prayers cannot
pass? Blessed is the man that endureth temptation.
Lord this is a sad temptation, stand by me, and say, It is
enough! Am I not thy servant? Consider Lord that I
am thy servant. O these bitter waters of <hi>Marah!</hi> Lord drop
sweet comfort into these bitter water of <hi>Marah.</hi> O the
blood of sprinkling, Lord, the blood of sprinkling Lord!
That blood which extinguisheth the fire of thine anger;
O that it might allay my burning pains! I am in a fiery
Furnace: Lord be with me as thou wast with the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ree
Children, and bring me out refined from sin! when I have
sailed through the Ocean of these pains, and look back, I
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62956:95"/>
see that none of them can be wanting. I flye unto thee, O
God, hide me under the shadow of thy wings till these ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
storms be overpast.</p>
                  <p>5. God added Humility as a Crown to all his other
Graces,<note place="margin">His Humility.</note> which yet shone bright in the eyes of all that
were acquainted with him: Indeed he was <hi>cloathed
with Humility:</hi> And hence it was that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
so familiarly with the poorest Christians, and
with them who were of the lowest parts for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
even with babes in Christ. This his ordinary
expression of himself before God, did clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
his great humility, <hi>Poor worm! Sinful wretch!
O pardon my transgressions for they are very great.</hi>
Hereupon he would weep much, when he was told
how much he was prayed for, wondring at Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that so sinful a wretch, and worthless a creature
should have so much interest in the hearts, and prayers
of the people of God. And his language in his <hi>Will</hi>
speaks how little he was in his own eyes; the words
are these, <hi>I desire that at my Funeral there may be no
pomp;</hi> but <hi>that so poor a worthless wretch may be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
laid in the ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as his Graces were many,<note place="margin">His Comforts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aith and Joy.</note> so were his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
many, and great, which God vouchsafed as
singular manifestations of his love to this his dear
Servant, and Childe. O what Kisses of Christs
Mouth, and what imbraces from the Arms of his
Love were bestowed upon this Saint of the most
High? He enjoyed all along his afflicted condition,
an uninterrupted assurance of Gods Fatherly love in
Christ. In his addresses unto God, he constantly
claimed propriety in God, calling him, <hi>my God, and my
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62956:95"/>
Father.</hi> His inward peace, and joy were the support
of his heart under all his grievous, and grinding pains.
he was confident of mercies mixtures with all his
greatest distempers, not at all doubting of the sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of them to him through Grace. Thus he spake
many times in his applications unto God, <hi>Consider, and
save me, for I am thine. How long, how long Lord, shall
I not be remembred? yea, I am remembred, blessed be
thy Name. This is a fiery Chariot, but it will carry me
to Heaven: Blessed be God that hath supported me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto;
and he that hath delivered, will yet deliver. Thou
Lord never forgettest them that put their trust in thee.</hi>
Alwayes when the extremity of pain was over, he
would with smiles speak of Gods mercies. Though
trembling took hold upon him when his violent pains
began, yet would he with confidence say, <hi>Now in the
strength of the mighty God, I will undergo these pains:
O my God put under thine everlasting Arms, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
me.</hi> Many times he told a bosome friend of his,
that notwithstanding all his rentings and roarings
(from which he expected no deliverance but by death)
he would not for a thousand worlds change estates
with the greatest man on earth, whom he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as in a way of sin, and enthraled thereto. And this
much bespeaks Gods Fatherly indulgence towards
him, that Satan could never shake his confidence,
nor assault his hopes all the time of his irksome,
irksome distemper. And this was further very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that he counted all these inward cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the fruits of Prayers that were made for him,
though God saw cause to deny that ease, and recovery
to his body which was so much begged; and withall,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62956:96"/>
he valued those spiritual cordials, and refreshings far
beyond deliverance from the Gout, and the Stone, yea
and Death it self.</p>
                  <p>These things are the rather mentioned, to prevent
that discouragement, or offence which some may be
too apt to take at the violence, and continuance of his
wasting and tormenting pains, notwithstanding his
own godliness, and the uncessant prayers, both ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and extraordinary, which were made unto God
in his behalf, for he found the sweet fruits of them in
his own bosome, even when he felt the continuance,
and increase of his bodily grief.</p>
                  <p>Another thing very remarkable in holy Mr.
<hi>Whitaker,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His love to the Saints.</note> was his love to his fellow Christians, he
was a man made up (as it were) of love. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
was in the Saints upon earth whom he esteemed
most excellent, and their society was a constant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
to his spirit. His frequent visits of them that
were in trouble, and his stirring up of others to the
like practice, were testimonies of this his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
love; which indeed was not verbal, but real. He
was also abundant in works of charity,<note place="margin">His Charity.</note> few men of
his estate did equalize him therein. He would often
say, <hi>It is a brave thing when a man together with a full
estate, hath a charitable heart.</hi> Sometimes upon spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
occasions he hath given away all the money that
he had in the house. It was not unusual with him to
give twenty shillings to a poor Saint, and he had many
experiencences of Gods gracious returns in such
cases. By his last <hi>Will</hi> he gave twenty pounds to the
godly poor of his own Parish.</p>
                  <p>There were two Cases wherein his loves were most
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62956:96"/>
enlarged to the people of God,<note place="margin">His Sympathy</note> whereof you may take
these two Instances; The one when the sufferings
were publick. He often told an intimate friend of
his, that <hi>Englands</hi> late breach with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the
blood that was shed, together with other sad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
thereof, had taken such impression upon his
heart, that the sorrow would never be removed till
his death; and the sufferings both in <hi>Holland</hi> and
in <hi>England</hi> in our late Sea-sights were an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
upon his spirit. The other Case was in respect
to the inward perplexity of such as were afflicted
in minde; having moved a special friend of his the
week before his death, to bestow a visit upon one
in that condition, the very morning before his death
(when speech was grievous to him in respect of his
great weakness) he asked him whether he had remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
the party that was troubled in spirit? which was
a remarkable evidence of his strong love to such. And
besides what hath already been mentioned, I might
here set down his many wrestlings with God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the flood or troubles which he apprehended the
Protestant Churches were now in danger to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
withall; as also his compassionate respect to
Congregations in the Country, which were like sheep
wandring upon the barren mountains without a
Shepherd.</p>
                  <p>And as his love s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>owed forth to the Saints,<note place="margin">He was much beloved.</note> so was
theirs no less towards him: Not to speak of the many
frequent, and friendly visits of godly men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the Neighbourhood round about him; there
was scarce ever heard of any man that was so much
prayed for both in publick and in private<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both upon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62956:97"/>
and extraordinary occasions, as he was. There
was no particular case so frequently, so affectionately
spread before God in most of the Congregations
about <hi>London</hi> as his. Three dayes were set apart by
Ministers, and many other praying friends to seek
God in his behalf, one in private, and two in publick,
which also were observed much better than such dayes
usually have been of late; yea, in remote Countries,
besides the ordinary Prayers made for him, there were
some Fasts kept also with special reference to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
The multitude of people that came to his
Funeral, with the many weeping eyes, did clearly
shew how much he was beloved. Here might also be
remembred the readiness of the <hi>London</hi> Ministers to
supply his place at home, and his Lectures elsewhere,
as also the willingness of his Fellow-lecturers at
<hi>Westminster</hi> to preach for him there, when he himself
by reason of weakness could not possibly do his own
work, but its needless, for still every where upon
the naming of Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> love is some way disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by such as had any knowledge of him.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was able, he never neglected his Minste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
service;<note place="margin">His delight in Preaching.</note> he hath often gone upon Crutches unto
the Congregation of his own people, to fulfil his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry;
yea, once at least he adventured to preach at
<hi>Michaels Cornhil,</hi> when he was scarce able to get into the
Pulpit, and his Friends with much difficulty holp him
out of the Church homewards; and at other times when
his legs would not serve him, he used to ride to Church.
And when he was by extremity of pains taken off
from his Ministry, he would sometimes profess to
some special friends, that the pain felt was not so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62956:97"/>
to his spirit, as his inability, by reason thereof, to
mannage his wonted work: Indeed it was his meat
and drink, to be doing the will of his Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Many times these were his words, <hi>If I could but
preach, I should be much better;</hi> and he would rejoyce
with cheerfulness and thankfulness, when in the times
of his weakness he found not himself more distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
by his preaching, and would mention such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences,
as arguments to move; and induce his friends
to yeeld to his preaching when they disswaded him
from it as prejudicial to his health.</p>

the violent pain of the Stone, did in such a

                        </gap>ians</hi> in the City were
consulted with, and were from time to time very ready
to serve him with their advice, who did unanimously
conclude, that his sharp pains proceeded originally
from an Ulcer in the Kidnies, but immediately from
an ulcer in the neck of the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>dder, caused by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual

                     </gap>tter dropping down upon
that part; and by reason of the acuteness and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the sense there, his pains were almost conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
in that place, though the fountain of them was
from the Kidnies.</p>
                  <p>About two moneths before his Death, his pains
grew more extream, yet Divine indulgence vouchsafed
at some times some mitigation of them, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

the long continuance and extremity of them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

his Faith nor Patience did abate, yea they much
encreased, and grew higher; and as he grew nearer his
end, so his longings for death were much increased,
yet accompanied with holy submission to the good
pleasure of his gracious Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These were some of his expressions,</hi> O my God
break open the Prison door,<note place="margin">His holy Spee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches.</note> and set my poor captive soul
free: But enable me willingly to wait thy time! I
desire to be dissolved: never aid any man more desire

be dissolved, that I may be cloathed upon with
that House which is from Heaven? Blessed are the dead
which dye in the Lord, for they rest from their labours,
and follow the Lamb whither soever he goeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So great was his love to his God and Saviour, that
he maintained and expressed high estimations, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
thoughts of his Majesty, when he was under
the most tormenting providences: He feared nothing
more, than lest he should do or speak any thing that
should red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>und to the dishonour of his Name. These
were some breathings of his large love, when through
pain he was as in the fire, or upon the rack:</hi> Good Lord
keep me from dishonouring of thy Name by impatie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency!
Oh, who would not even in burnings have honourable
thoughts of God! who that knows thee, would not fear thee,
O Lord, love thee, and honour thee? Lord, thou givest

<hi>By these, and many such like expressions and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

against God.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sabbath</hi> sevennight before God released him,
though his pains were very sharp, yet he bestowed
most part of the time of publick Ordinances, in prayer,
together with those that were about him, and his
Petitions were most in the behalf of Ministers, that
God would cloath his Ordinances with his own power,
and enable his Ministers to speak to the souls of his
people. Then did he also with many tears bewail his
detainment from the Sanctuary, and <hi>Sabbath</hi>-oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of doing, and receiving good, which had been
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62956:99"/>
his delight: Professing also, that his being taken off

his bodily pains. And because this apprehension (to
wit, of his present unserviceablness) did much afflict
him; this therefore was often suggested to him (which
the Lord pleased to make a relief to his spirit) <hi>viz.</hi>
that now by the practice of Faith, Patience, Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and spiritualness (which he had formerly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to, and pressed upon others) he was very profitable
unto them who visited him, and might also prove
very advantagious unto others who might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
therewith, through Gods grace by Christ.</p>
                  <p>So great was his tender respect to his friends,<note place="margin">His torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pains.</note> that
when his pains were coming with violence, he would
intreat them to withdraw from him, that they might
not be grieved with his roari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bless God, that his compassionate friends were not
necessitated to abide within the reach of his doleful
lamentation.</p>
                  <p>As his death drew more nigh, so his fits of pain
were more frequent, either every half hour, or many
times every quarter, yea two or three in a quarter of
an hour, which did exceedingly abate his strength.</p>
                  <p>The night before God took him out of this vale
of tears, Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> hearing that he was not likely to

that he could not speak without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> spake the more unto him in reference to

intended to set apart that day in seeking the Lord for
him, and asked him, in what things e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be remembred before the Throne of Grace?
His answer was, <hi>Do not complain, but bless God for me,

his hand upon his cold hand, covered with a clammy

                  <p>Thus his friends having by prayers and praises (on
his behalf) given him to God,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> and having prepared
their hearts for the loss of him, the Lord was pleased
that evening to take him to himself, <hi>June</hi> 1654, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above Fifty five years old.</p>
                  <p>After his death Mr. <hi>Holiard</hi> opened his body in the
presence of Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> Dr. <hi>Micklethwaite,</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Bevoir;</hi> (some other more ancient Doctors would
have been there, if, either their being out of Town,
or present urgent occasions had not hindred) being
opened, they found both his Kidnies full of ulcers, and
and one of them was swelled to an extraordinary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
through the abundance of purulent matter in it.
Upon the neck of his Bladder, they found a stone,
(which was about an inch and an half long, and one
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62956:100"/>
inch broad, weighing about two ounces when it was
first taken out and withall they found an ulcer which
was gangrenized, and this was judged to be the cause
of his death. All other parts of his body were found
firm and sound.</p>
                  <p>He was so humble, that he feared lest Gods people
praying for him, should speak too well of him before
the Lord.</p>
                  <p>He was a self-denying man, never daring to look
after great matters in this world; whereby he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
many whose self-seeking in earthly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
renders them very offensive and unsavoury in
the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> speaking of him saith; If I should
enter upon his Commendations, I might truly say

have more cause to fear lest I should speak below,

Adamant, and a Loadstone. To all that conversed
with him, he was as a Loadstone to draw their hearts
to love him: But in the cause of God, and in reference
to the truths of Christ, he was as an unconquerable
Adamant. He was a <hi>Jeremy,</hi> both in mourning for,
and in witnessing against the sins of the times. He

as effectually by his death, as by his life or Doctrine,
for so great was the patience which God measured
out to him, that though in his extremity of torments

                     <l>God shew'd how welcome one Death was to thee,</l>
                     <l>Who did so meekly entertain all three.</l>

                     <l>The power of love, which then would set them free.</l>

                  <p>
                     <hi>James Usher</hi> was born in <hi>Dublin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Birth and Parentage.</note> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Parish of St. <hi>Nicholas, January</hi> the 4,
<hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1580. His Father, Mr. <hi>Arnald Usher,</hi> was
a student in the Law, one of the Clerks of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
in that Nation, and a person of excellent parts
and endowments. His Mother was Mrs. <hi>Margaret
Stainhurst,</hi> who in her later time was seduced by some
of the <hi>Popish</hi> Priests to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their opportunity, whilst this her Son was upon
some occasion in <hi>England;</hi> and they, by their subtilty,
had engaged her in such vows, that when her Son
came back he could not possibly reclaim her, which
they have often boasted of in Print; yet her Sons hope
was, at least upon her Death bed, to have prevailed
for the reducing of her to the Truth: But it pleased
God, that she dyed suddenly at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> when he
was absent at <hi>Dublin,</hi> whereby, to his no small grief
those his hopes were frustrated and disappointed.</p>
                  <p>His Grandfather by his Mothers side was <hi>James
Stainhurst</hi> (whose Christian name he bore) who was
chosen three times Speaker of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in the <hi>Irish</hi> Parliaments, in the last whereof he
made the first motion for the founding and erecting
of a College, and University in the City of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
He was also Recorder of that City, one of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Chancery, and a man of great wisdome,
and integrity.</p>
                  <p>His Uncle was <hi>Richard Stainhurst,</hi> a man famous
in <hi>France,</hi> and other Nations for his great learning,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62956:105"/>
which he manifested in several Books published by
him, one of them, when he was eighteen years old,
between whom, and this Reverend person there passed
many learned Letters.</p>
                  <p>His Uncle by his Fathers side was <hi>Henry Usher,</hi> who
was trained up at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and proved a prudent
and learned man: He was afterwards Arch-Deacon
of <hi>Dublin,</hi> at which time he was first sent over into
<hi>England</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Council, with a
Petition for preserving the Cathedral of St. <hi>Patricks
Dublin</hi> from being dissolved, wherein he prevailed,
the fruits whereof this his Nephew reaped afterwards,
being made Chancellor of it, and receiving his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
from it for many years. The second time he
was sent over by the Council of <hi>Ireland</hi> to Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> to procure her Patent for the founding
of a College,<note place="margin">The College at <hi>Dublin</hi> founded.</note> and University in <hi>Dublin,</hi> wherein he
prevailed also: So that the College (of which this
worthy person was the first fruits) had its being
from his Grandfathers motion, and his Uncles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</p>
                  <p>He had a brother named <hi>Ambrose Usher,</hi> who, though
he dyed young, yet was a man of excellent parts, very
skilful in the <hi>Oriental</hi> Languages, who had translated
the Old Testament from the beginning, to the Book
of <hi>Job,</hi> out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> into <hi>English,</hi> which is still
preserved under his own hand; but upon the coming
forth of the New Translation in King <hi>James</hi> his
time, he desisted from making any further progress
therein.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>James</hi> was taught first to read by two of his
Aunts,<note place="margin">His Education</note> who were blinde from their Cradles, and so
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62956:105"/>
never saw letters, yet were they admirably versed in
the sacred Scriptures, being able suddenly to have
given a good account of any part of the Bible. At eight
years old he was sent to the <hi>Grammar</hi> School, where
he had the happiness to meet with two excellent
Schoolmasters,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> Sir <hi>James Fullerton,</hi> afterwards Leger
Ambassador in <hi>France,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Hamilton</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Lord Viscount <hi>Clandeboise)</hi> who was Usher of
the School. These two learned men were sent over
by King <hi>James</hi> out of <hi>Scotland</hi> upon an other design,
though they were disguised in this imployment: And
indeed they came very opportunely by the good hand
of Gods Providence, for this youths founding in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at such a time when there was a great defect of
learned Schoolmasters, which he often acknowledged
as a special mercy of God to him therein.</p>
                  <p>At ten years old was the first time that he could
remember to have found in himself any evidences of
his saving conversion unto God,<note place="margin">His timely Conversion.</note> which was instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wrought by a Sermon which he heard preached
upon <hi>Rom. 12. 1. I beseech you brethren by the mercies
of God, &amp;c.</hi> About the same time also meeting with
some notes taken from famous Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his Works
being not then printed) concerning the sanctification
of the Lords day, proved, through Gods blessing, so
effectual with him, that ever after he was the more
strict in the observing of it. About the same time
also he read over St. <hi>Augustines Meditations,</hi> which
so affected him, that he wept often in the reading of
them.</p>
                  <p>This young,<note place="margin">Satans malice.</note> yet hopeful plant, thus inuring, and
accustoming himself to secret duties in his tender
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62956:106"/>
years, the Devil, that grand enemy of our salvation,
thinking to nip him in the bud, assaulted him with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
terrours and affrightments, both sleeping and
waking,<note place="margin">Prayer power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> hoping thereby to discourage, and take him
off from the same: But he (with St. <hi>Paul)</hi> betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to prayer with earnestness to be delivered from
these Satanical delusions, and assaults, and at last
was <hi>heard in that which he feared,</hi> by being freed
from them, and strengthened against them with more
than ordinary courage, and comfort; which made
such an impression in him, as that he could not forget
it to his old age.</p>
                  <p>The Devil now finding that he could not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
out of his course of godliness,<note place="margin">Satans subtilty</note> made use of
another engine, which was to allure him with the bait
of pleasure, some of his friends teaching him to play
at Cards, wherewith he was so much delighted, that
it began to prevail over his love to his book; yea it
came in competition with his love to God, and care to
serve him;<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> which being seasonably by Gods Spirit
discovered to him, he presently gave it over, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
played afterwards.</p>
                  <p>At twelve years old he was so affected with the
study of <hi>Chronology</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that, reading over
<hi>Sleidans</hi> Book of the four Empires, and some other
Authors, he drew forth an exact <hi>Series</hi> of the times
wherein each eminent person lived; and during the
time of his abode at School, which was five years, he
was throughly instructed in <hi>Grammar, Rhetorick,</hi> and
<hi>Poetry,</hi> wherein he so excelled, and with which he was so
delighted, that he was fain to take himself off, lest it
should have hindred him from more serious studies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:62956:106"/>
At thirteen years of age he was admitted into the
College of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His admission into the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</note> being the first Student that was
initiated into it; and as it seems, it was so ordered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
design by the Governours thereof, upon their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of his pregnancy, and rare parts, that it
might be a future honour to the College to have his
name recorded in the <hi>Frontispiece</hi> of their <hi>Admission
Book,</hi> and so accordingly he was the first Graduate, the
first Fellow, the first Proctor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the same time Sir <hi>James Hamilton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.</note> hitherto
Usher of the School, was chosen Fellow of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
and thereby became his Tutor, who oft-times
admired his accuteness and proficiency, whereby in a
short time he equalized his Instructers. Here he first
began to study the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Languages, in
both which he afterwards excelled, and made himself
in a little time Master of the Arts, most of which he
modelled in a method of his own, especially that of
<hi>Musick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this time the education, and helps which that
College afforded were very eminent: For though at
first there were but four Fellows, yet the Tongues
and Arts were very exactly taught to all the Students
who were divided into several Classes. Each Tutor
read <hi>Aristotles</hi> Text in <hi>Greek</hi> to his Pupils; yea each
Fellow read three Lectures a day, at each of which
there was a Disputation maintained either upon the
present, or the precedent Lecture, and sometimes they
were ordered to dispute <hi>More Socratico.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On <hi>Saturdayes</hi> in the afternoon each Tutor read a
Divinity Lecture in <hi>Latine</hi> to his Pupils, dictating it
(as they did all other their Lectures) so deliberately,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62956:107"/>
that they might easily write after them, to their great
benefit and advantage.</p>
                  <p>At fourteen years old he was judged fit,<note place="margin">His admission to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; and
his usual custome was, the afternoon before, to retire
himself in private, and to spend it in a strict self-examination,
and deep humiliation for all his sins;
wherein he had such enlargements of heart, that a
stream of tears flowed from his eyes,<note place="margin">His prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereto.</note> which afterwards
he oft recalled to minde, both as a provocation, and
censure of himself: When he was of elder years,
there was a certain pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce by a water side whither he
oft resorted, sorrowfully to survey his sins, and with
floods of tears to confess, and bewail them; wherein
he found so much sweetness and communion with
God, that he thirsted for such comfortable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and it was his usual custome to spend <hi>Saturdayes</hi>
in the afternoon in these duties. Amongst other sins
he much bewayled his too much love to humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which made him as glad when <hi>Munday</hi> came that
he might renue his studies, as he was when <hi>Sabbath</hi>
day came, wherein he was to apply himself to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God; and it cost him many tears that he could
not be more heavenly-minded at that age.</p>
                  <p>At fiftten years old he had made such a progress
in the study of <hi>Chronology,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His skill in Chronology.</note> that he drew up in <hi>Latine</hi> an
exact <hi>Chronicle</hi> of the Bible as far as to the Books of
the <hi>Kings,</hi> which did not much differ from that of his
late <hi>Annals,</hi> excepting his enlargements by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
observations, and the <hi>Syncronismes</hi> of Heathen
story. About this time also he was much afflicted with a
strong temptation, which moved him to question Gods,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62956:107"/>
love to him, because he was so free from afflictions,
which was occasioned by some inconsiderate pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
which he met with in some Authors, and long
was he under some trouble before he could get rid
of it.</p>
                  <p>Before he was Bachelor of Arts he read <hi>Stapletons
Fortress of the Faith,</hi> and therein finding how confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
he asserted Antiquity for the <hi>Popish</hi> Tenets,
withall, branding our Church and Religion with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
in what we dissented from them, he was much
troubled at it, not knowing but that his quotations
might be right; and he was convinced that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientest
must needs be best, as the nearer the Fountain
the sweeter, and clearer are the streams; yet withall,
he suspected that <hi>Stapleton</hi> might mis-report the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or wrest them to his own sense; and therefore
he took up a setled resolution, that in due time, if
God prolonged his life and health, he would trust one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his own eyes by reading over all the Fathers for his
satisfaction herein;<note place="margin">His study of the Fathers.</note> which work he afterward began
at Twenty years old, and finished that vast la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
at Thirty eight, strictly tying himself to a
certain portion every day what occasions soever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervened.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was Batchelor of Arts, he read divers
of the Works of the Fathers, and most Authors
which had written the Body of Divinity both <hi>Positively</hi>
and <hi>Polemically</hi> in consuting the <hi>Popish</hi> errors, and
had read many of their Authors also, by which means
he was so well acquainted with the state of those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
that he was able to dispute with any of the
<hi>Popish</hi> Priests, as he often did with the principal of
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:62956:108"/>
                     <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1598, The Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> newly
coming over Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and being
chosen Chancellor of the University of <hi>Dublin,</hi> there
was a solemn Act appointed for his entertainment,
and Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> being then Batchelor of Arts, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the <hi>Philosophy</hi> Act with great applause and
approbation.</p>
                  <p>About this time his Fathers intention was to send
him over into <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Innes</hi> of Court,<note place="margin">He is designed to the study of the Law.</note> for the
study of the Common Law, which was a great trouble
to him, yet in obedience to his Fathers will he assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and resolved upon it; but it pleased God that his
Father shortly after dyed, <hi>viz. August</hi> the 12. <hi>Anno
Christi</hi> 1698, so that then he being at liberty to make
choice of his studies, devoted, and applied himself
wholly to Divinity,<note place="margin">His study of Divinity.</note> and thereupon was chosen Fellow
of the College, being before uncapable of taking the
Oath which was required of all Fellows at their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the present intent of their studies
should be for the Profession of Divinity, unless
God should afterwards otherwise dispose their
mindes.</p>
                  <p>And here again was an other occasion of distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
to his mind ministred to him.<note place="margin">His contempt of the world.</note> For his Father left
him a good estate in land; but finding that he must
have involved himself in many Suits of Law before
he could attain to the quiet enjoyment of it, to the
interrupting of his other studies, he gave up the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of it to his brothers and sisters, suffering his Uncle
to take Letters of Administration for that end, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
to cast himself upon the good Providence of
God, to whose service in the work of the Ministry
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62956:108"/>
he had wholly devoted himself, not doubting but he
would provide for him; yet that he might not be
judged weak or inconsiderate in that Act, he drew
up a note under his hand of the state of all things
that concerned it, and directions what to doe about
it.</p>
                  <p>When he was nineteen years old he disputed with
<hi>Henry Fitz-Simonds,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Disput<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as himself acknowledgeth in his Preface to his
Book called <hi>Britanno-mochia Ministrorum;</hi> the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of which Dispute was this, The <hi>Jesuit</hi> by way of
challenge, as it was interpreted, gave forth these
words, <hi>That he being a Prisoner was like a Bear tyed to a
stake, but wanted some to bait him:</hi> Whereupon this
eminent man (for so he was though very young) was
thought fit, and able to encounter him, though at
their first meeting he despised his youth, as <hi>Goliah</hi> did
<hi>David.</hi> Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> proffered to dispute with him about
all <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Controversies, for which a meeting
was appointed once every week, and it fell out that
the first subject proposed was <hi>De Antichristo,</hi> about
which they had two or three solemne Disputations, and
Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> was ready to have proceeded further; but
the <hi>Jesuit</hi> was weary of it, yet gives him a tolerable
commendation, and much admired his abillities in such
young years: concerning which he saith, <hi>There came
once to me a youth of about eighteen years of age, one of a
too soon ripe wit, scarce you would thank that he could have
gone through his course of</hi> Philosophy, <hi>or that he was got
out of his childe-hood, yet was he ready to dispute upon
the most abstruce points of Divinity.</hi> And afterwards
the same <hi>Jesuit</hi> living to understand more of him,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62956:109"/>
saith, that he was <hi>A catholicorum doctissimus,</hi> the most
learned of such as were not <hi>Catholicks;</hi> being (as it
seems) unwilling, or ashamed to call him <hi>Heretick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1600,<note place="margin">He is Master of Arts, and Catechist.</note> when he was about twenty
years old he commenced Master of Arts, and answered
the <hi>Philosophy</hi> Act, and was chosen <hi>Catechist</hi> of the
College, in which office he went through a great part
of the Body of Divinity in the Chappel by way of
Common place; and Ministers being scarce at that
time, there were three young men of the College
chosen out, and appointed to preach in <hi>Christ Church</hi>
before the State: One was Mr. <hi>Richardson,</hi> afterwards
Bishop of <hi>Ardah,</hi> who was appointed to preach an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository
Lecture upon the Prophesie of <hi>Isaiah</hi> every
<hi>Friday.</hi> Another was Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> afterwards Dr. of
Divinity, who was designed to handle the Body of
Divinity on <hi>Sabbaths</hi> in the forenoon; the third was
our learned <hi>Usher,</hi> who was to handle the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
for the satisfaction of the <hi>Papists</hi> on the Lords
dayes in the afternoons, which he did fully and cleerly,
alwayes concluding with some emphatical Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it tended much to the edification and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the <hi>Protestants</hi> in their Principles, as
many of them in their elder yeares have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
                  <p>Having thus preached for a while as a Probationer,
he refused to continue it any longer, having not as yet
received Ordination: He also scrupled to be as yet
Ordained by reason of his defect of years, the <hi>Canons</hi>
requiring twenty four, and he being yet but twenty
one: But by some grave and learned men he was told,
that the Lord had need of his labours; and so upon
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62956:109"/>
their perswasions and importunity, his age being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
with according to some former presidents, he
was ordained at the usual time, the <hi>Sabbath</hi> before
<hi>Christmas</hi> day,<note place="margin">His O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1601, by his Uncle <hi>Henry Usher,</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> with the assistance of some
other Ministers.</p>
                  <p>The first Text that he preached publickly upon
before the State,<note place="margin">His first Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon after it.</note> after his Ordination, was <hi>Rev. 3. 1.
Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead,</hi> which
fell out to be the same day upon which was fought the
Battel of <hi>Kinsale,</hi> which being a day specially set
apart, by prayer to seek unto God for his blessing and
assistance in that engagement, and being his first fruits
after his entrance into the Office of the Ministry, God
might in a more than ordinary manner make his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
efficatious and prevailing; the rest of that
Epistle to the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> he finished after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was well known that if the</hi> Spaniards <hi>had gotten
the better that day, the</hi> Irish Papists <hi>had designed to
murther the</hi> English Protestants <hi>both in</hi> Dublin <hi>and
other places,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tentation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,</note> 
                     <hi>but especially the Ministers. Hence
(said he)</hi> arose a tentation in me to have deferred my
Ordination till the event of the Battel had been known,
that so I might the better have escaped their fury; but I
repelled that suggestion, and resolved the rather upon it,
that dying a Minister, and in that quarrel, I might at
least be the next door to a Martyr.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being (as was said before) over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
at <hi>Kinsale,</hi> and the hopes of the <hi>Irish,</hi> as to
that design, being frustrated, they began generally to
subject themselves to the Statute, which was now
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62956:110"/>
put in execution, in their coming to Church; and that
it might tend the more to their profit, the <hi>Lord
Lieutenant,</hi> and his <hi>Council,</hi> desired the Ministers at
<hi>Dublin,</hi> so to divide themselves, that (in imitation of
what he had already begun at <hi>Christ Church)</hi> there
might be a Sermon on the Lords dayes in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
at every Church upon those Controversies.
St. <hi>Katherines</hi> (a convenient Church) was assigned
for Mr. <hi>Usher,</hi> who removed accordingly, and duely
observed it; and his custome was, that what he had
delivered in one Sermon, he drew it up into Questions
and Answers, and the next Lords day, several persons
of note voluntary offered themselves to repeat those
Answers before the whole Congregation, which
made them more clear and perspicuous to the <hi>Popish</hi>
party.</p>
                  <p>It pleased God by his, and the labours of others of

in other parts of the Kingdome, that the <hi>Papists</hi> came
so diligently to Church, that if they had any occasion

to the <hi>Church-wardens,</hi> and there were great
hopes in a short time to have reduced the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Upon this,<note place="margin">His Zeal.</note> the spirit of this holy man (like <hi>Pauls</hi>

as preaching before the State at <hi>Christ Church</hi>
upon a special solemnity, he did with as much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
courage, and boldness as became his young
years, give them his opinion of that <hi>abominable Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Idolatry;</hi> making a full and clear application
of that passage in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Vision, Chap. 4. 6. where
the Prophet, by lying on his side, was to bear the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of <hi>Judah</hi> for forty dayes.<note place="margin">A Prediction.</note> 
                     <hi>I have appointed thee
(saith the Lord) each day for a year.</hi> This (said he) by
the consent of Interpreters, signifies the time of forty
years to the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and of that
Nation for their Idolatry; and so (said he) will I reckon
from this year the sin of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and at the end of the
time those whom you now imbrace shal be your ruine,
and you shall bear this iniquity, wherein he proved a
Prophet: For this was delivered by him, <hi>Anno
Christi</hi> 1601, and <hi>Anno</hi> 1641, was the <hi>Irish Rebellion,</hi>
and Massacre; and what a continued expectation he
had of a great judgement upon that his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
I, saith Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> can witness from the year
1624, at which time I had the happiness first to be
known to him; and the nearer the time approached,
the more confident he was of the event, though as
yet nothing that tended towards it was visible to
other men.</p>
                  <p>The Body of Divinity which is printed in his name
is highly commended by Mr. <hi>Downam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Body of Divinity.</note> who set it
forth, and so it is by a stranger, <hi>Ludovicus Crocius,</hi>
who much desired that some <hi>English</hi> man would turn
it into <hi>Latine</hi> for the benefit of forreign Churches, but
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62956:111"/>
it was not intended by him for the Press. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
by him in publick, but finished some years after
in private in his Family, constantly instructing them
twice a week, unto which persons of quality and
learning resorted, and divers of them took Notes,
whereby several Copies were dispersed abroad, some
imperfect and mistaken, and many passages are in it
which were not his, neither is the whole so polished as
his other Pieces which were published by himself; and
indeed he was displeased that it came forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his knowledge, yet understanding how much good
it had done, he connived at it.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after the aforementioned defeat given to
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Kinsale,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Souldiers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of Learning.</note> the Officers of our <hi>English</hi>
Army gave 1800 pounds to buy Books for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
Library at <hi>Dublin</hi> (then Souldiers were advancers
of Learning) the ordering of which was committed to
Dr. <hi>Challoner,</hi> and this Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> who made a
journey into <hi>England</hi> on purpose to buy Books with
it. He then met with Sir <hi>Thomas Bodly,</hi> who was buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Books for his Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and they were
very helpful each to other in procuring the rarest
Pieces. In his journey he visited Mr. <hi>Christopher Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
who had been Professor of Divinity in <hi>Oxford</hi>
in King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixths dayes, then lying on his
death-bed at <hi>Chester,</hi> and he would often repeat some
grave and wise speeches that he heard from him.</p>
                  <p>After this he constantly came over into <hi>England</hi>
once in three years,<note place="margin">His great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> spending one moneth at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
another at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in searching the Books, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Manuscripts, in each University (amongst
which, those of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:62956:111"/>
he most esteemed) the third moneth he spent at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
intending chiefly Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Library, and
conversing with learned men, amongst whom, even in
those his younger years he was in great esteem. In his
after-years he was acquainted with the rarities in other
Nations: There was scarce a choice Book in any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
persons Library in <hi>France, Italy, Germany,</hi> or
<hi>Rome</hi> it self, but he had his way to procure it, or what
he desired, transcribed out of it, so that he was better
acquainted with the <hi>Popes Vatican</hi> than some that daily
visited it.<note place="margin">His Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondents.</note> The <hi>Puteani fratres,</hi> two learned men in <hi>Paris</hi>
holp him much with many Transcripts out of <hi>Thuanus,</hi>
and others, between whom and him, many Letters
passed. Now, though the reading of the Fathers all
over was a vast work, yet the pains he took out of
the common road of learning in searching of Records,
and all the <hi>Manuscripts</hi> he could get throughout Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
together with the knotty study of <hi>Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>
and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> was equal with, if it did not exceed
the other. Many Volumes he also read onely to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the knowledge of the use of words in several
ages, as <hi>Galen, Hipocrates, &amp;c.</hi> and most of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
in the Tower of <hi>London:</hi> Besides there was
scarce the meanest book in his own Library, but he
remembred it, even to admiration, and had in his head
readily whatsoever he had read.</p>
                  <p>The first Church-preferment which he had,<note place="margin">His first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</note> was
given him by Archbishop <hi>Loftus</hi> a little before his
death, which was the Chancellorship of St. <hi>Patricks
Dublin,</hi> unto which he took no other Benefice. In that
place Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> found him when he was writing his
<hi>Britannia, Anno Christi</hi> 1607, and in his observations
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62956:112"/>
concerning <hi>Dublin,</hi> saith of him, <hi>Most of these I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to owe to the diligence, and labours of</hi> James
Usher, <hi>Chancellor of the Church of St.</hi> Patricks, <hi>who in
various learning, and judgement far exceeds his years.</hi>
In this preferment, though the Law required not his
preaching,<note place="margin">His constant preaching.</note> but onely in his course before the State, yet
would he not omit it in the place from whence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his profits, and though he endowed it with a
<hi>Vicaridge,</hi> yet went he thither in person, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi>
a mile from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and preached there every
Lords day, unless he were detained upon some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
occasions; and the remembrance that he
had been a constant Preacher, was a greater comfort
to him in his old age, than all his other labours and
writings.</p>
                  <p>His experiments in Prayer were many,<note place="margin">His prevalency in prayer.</note> and very
observable, God ofen answering his desires in kinde,
and that immediately, when he was in some distresses;
and Gods Providence in taking care, and providing
for him in his younger years, as he often spake of it,
so it wrought in him a firm resolution to depend upon
God in his latter dayes, what ever extremity he might
be brought into.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1607,<note place="margin">He is Bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor.</note> when he was twenty seven years
old he commenced batchelor of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after be was chosen Professor of <hi>Divinity</hi> in
the University of <hi>Dublin:</hi> At first he read twice a
week, and afterwards once a week without intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
throughout the year, going through a great part
of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Controversies. In this employment he
continued thirteen or fourteen years, and was a great
ornament to his place. Three Volumes of those his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62956:112"/>
Lectures written with his own hand he hath left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him, and it would be a great honour to that

others if they were published.</p>
                  <p>When he performed his Acts for his degree,<note place="margin">His strong memory.</note> 
                     <hi>Latine</hi>

Act, he wrote nothing but only the heads of the
several Subjects, putting all upon the strength of his
memory, and present expressions, as also he did his
<hi>English</hi> Sermons. His readiness in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue
was inferiour to none in these latter times, which (after
seventeen years disuse, from the time that he left his
Professors place) appeared when he moderated the
<hi>Divinity</hi> Act, and created Doctors to all mens admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>The Provostship of the College of <hi>Dublin</hi> falling
void,<note place="margin">His Self-denial</note> he was unanimously elected thereto by all the
Fellows, he being then about thirty years of age, but
foreseeing that upon the settlement of Lands belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, and the establishing of other matters, he
should be much impeded and distracted in his studies,
he refused it, and so another was sent out of <hi>England</hi>
to fill it. The revenues of it were very considerable,
whereby we may see how mean and little the things of
the world seemed in his eyes even in those his younger
years.</p>
                  <p>About this time the <hi>Irish</hi> Prelates, especially Dr.
<hi>Hampton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Episcopal subtilty.</note> his predecessor in the Sea of <hi>Armagh,</hi> had
obtained King <hi>James</hi> his grant for reducing <hi>Ireland</hi>
to the same <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Government of the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> the principal occasion whereof was
this, The <hi>English</hi> Prelates a little before had used a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62956:113"/>
great deal of severity against the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi>
their High Commission, and other Courts, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
had driven many worthy and learned men into
other Countries, and some of them went into <hi>Ireland;</hi>
the <hi>Irish</hi> Bishops being weary of this resort, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to advance their power to the same height with
the <hi>English Hierarchy,</hi> combined together, and
obtained King <hi>James</hi> his Commission to Sir <hi>Arthur
Chichester,</hi> Earle of <hi>Belfast,</hi> a famous Souldier and
prudent Governour, who was at this time Lord <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,</hi>
and bore the Sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there eleven years together
with very much honour, and esteem in that Nation.
For the effecting of this, a great Assembly of the
whole Nation was convened. In the Commission the
King required them to consult with Mr. <hi>Usher,</hi> whose
learning, judgement, and esteem would much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the promoting of that work: But if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
it not, the King required that they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
no further, for that he would not be the author
of any Innovation amongst them.</p>
                  <p>This reserve troubled the Prelates exceedingly,
and therefore they resolved to carry it closely; the
Kings Letters to them, they transmitted from one to
another, but acquainted not Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> with them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to surprize him when the Assembly was met;
they should come prepared and fortified, he would be
taken on the sudden. Howbeit God that intended
him for so great a good at that time in crossing their
design, that many faithful labourers in his Vineyard
might not by this their power be displaced, by a special
Providence gave him some light (though but very
little) into the matter; and the manner was thus,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:62956:113"/>
Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> going to visit one of them,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vidence.</note> found him
perusing the Kings Letter; but upon his coming, he
laid it down in his window, closed at both ends, onely
there was an open place in the middle, and as they
were discoursing together, Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> glancing his eye
upon it, espied his own name, and some other vvords
about himself, of which he could not pick out the
meaning; but yet he judged them to be of importance,
as <hi>Discipline, Ireland, England, &amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> thought
it not prudence for him to take notice of those hints,
neither could he handsomely fish out the business from
the Bishop,<note place="margin">A holy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</note> wherefore he went another way to work;
and indeed the surest way, by seeking counsel from
God, communicating the matter to Dean <hi>Hill</hi> a very
godly man, whom he requested, that with some
others, they would seek unto God for his assistance,
for he believed that something was in brewing that he
might not know of. Herein imitating the practise of
wise <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 2. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>This done he studied the Rights of the <hi>Irish</hi> Church,
some fruits whereof we have in that Learned Piece of
his called, <hi>The Religion professed by the ancient Irish and
Britains.</hi> Yet he heard nothing till the Assembly was
summoned, and himself the next day was to be present
at it; then went he to the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> to know
the occasion of their meeting. The Lord <hi>Deputy</hi>
would not believe at first that he could be a stranger
to it; but afterwards, when Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> had assured him
that he had no information from the Bishops about it,
he was much displeased, and told him that without him
all the the rest were but Cyphers, for that the King had
referred the whole business to his judgement, whether
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62956:114"/>
the power of the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> should be established there
as it was in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day the Kings Commission and Letters
were read in the Assembly, and Speeches were made
concerning the excellency of the Kings intention to
reduce that Kingdome to one uniformity with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Government; they also told him
what honour the King had put upon him, whose esteem,
learning and judgement the King so much depended
upon for the promoting so great and good a work.
Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> replied, that he believed that in a business
of so great concernment wherein he was so far inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested,
the Kings intentions were that he should have
convenient time to consider of it before he delivered
his opinion, which he also humbly desired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Bishops answered, that his judgement was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
known by his practise, and that they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no more from him but his consent, and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with them. He replied, that the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
more than himself,</hi> For <hi>(said he)</hi> if I had all
mens consciences in my keeping, I could in these dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
cases give Laws unto them, as well as unto my self;
but its one thing what I can do, and another thing what
all other men must do.</p>
                  <p>Then they asked of him if he had any thing to say
why they should not satisfie the Kings desire?<note place="margin">His Speech in the Assembly.</note> He, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a short pause, wherein he lifted up his heart unto
God for direction, told them that if they would grant
him no longer time, he would as well as he was able
give them his judgement, if that Honourable Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
would grant him three Requests, 1. A free hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without interruption. 2. Liberty for him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62956:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any man that should be unsatisfied. 3. That
there might be a final determination of the business at
that meeting. These being all granted, Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to prove, that such a Jurisdiction could not be
introduced into that Kingdome, neither by the Laws
of God, nor by the <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of that Kingdome, nor yet without the violation
of the Kings Prerogative in that Nation: All which
he performed to admiration. But before he descended
to particulars, he shewed the difference between Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
as it was set up in <hi>England,</hi> and as it would be,
if it were set up in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kings <hi>(saith he)</hi> and Queen of <hi>England</hi> imposed
those Ceremonies, that thereby they might decline the
charge of Schismaticks, wherewith the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
laboured to brand them, seeing it did appear hereby that
they left them only in such Doctrinal points, wherein
they left the truth. Again, hereby they would testifie how
far they would willingly stoop to win and gain them, by
yeelding to meet them as far as they might in their own
way: But <hi>(saith he)</hi> the experience of many years hath
shewed, that this condescention hath rather hardened
them in their errours, than brought them to a liking
of our Religion: This being their usual saying, If
our Flesh be not good, why doe you drinke of our
Broth?</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein the <hi>English</hi> Canons were never
yet received, and the generality of the Inabitans were <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi>
Recusants, and even in <hi>Popish</hi> Kings times, there
was no receptions of the <hi>Popes Ecclesiastical</hi> Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
because he encroached upon their temporals, if such
Laws now should be set up under so Religious a Protestant
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62956:115"/>
King, this would be to set the Pope on Horse-back, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, which needed not.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Deputy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The success of his Speech.</note> when he had finished his Speech,
and answered what was objected against it, told him
that he was much affected with every part of his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
speech, but that he was more especially concerned in
that which touched upon the Kings <hi>Prerogative</hi> part;
wherein he had discovered such hidden flowers of the
Crown, as he thought the King himself knew not;
and therefore (he said) as he would endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his Majesties right therein, whilst he was his
<hi>Deputy,</hi> so he would present them to the King, and
take care, that it should be very hard for any that came
after him to rob him of them.</p>
                  <p>By this we may easily see, that he was then so far
from a <hi>Prelatical</hi> spirit, that on the contrary he was an
Advocate for, and Patione of godly and conscientious
<hi>Non-Conformists.</hi>

it, that it proved an occasion of his advancement;
for King <hi>James</hi> being jealous of him upon that score,
by reason of the eminency of his learning, fell into
serious discourse with him, and therein received such
abundance of satisfaction, both of the soundness of
his judgement and piety, that notwithstanding the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
made by some great ones,<note place="margin">He is made Bishop by the King.</note> without his seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he made him Bishop of <hi>Meath</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which
just then fell void whilst he was in <hi>England,</hi> and the
King often boasted that he was a Bishop of his own
making.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was thus Bishop Elect,<note place="margin">He preaches to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> he was chosen to
preach before the House of Commons, <hi>Feb.</hi> 18. 1620,
in <hi>Margarets Westminster:</hi> The Sermon by order
of the House was printed, and it is a most learned
one.</p>
                  <p>Upon his return into <hi>Ireland,</hi> he was consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Bishop of <hi>Meath</hi> at <hi>Droheda</hi> by Archbishop <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
with the assistance of two Suffragan Bishops, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custome; at which time there was given
him an <hi>Anagram</hi> of his Name, as he was then to write
himself, which was this, <hi>James Meath, I am the same;</hi> and
he made it good ever afterwards. His preferment did
not cause him to grow slack in his constancy of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as it did too many, who having caught the Fish,
laid aside the Net: But, as <hi>Possidonius</hi> saith of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His constant preaching.</note>
he was still the same; which he bound himself the
rather unto by the <hi>Motto</hi> of his Episcopal Seal, <hi>Ve mihi
si non Evangelizavero,</hi> Woe is me if I preach not the
Gospel, which he continued in the Seal of his Primacy
also.</p>
                  <p>He had many <hi>Papists</hi> in his Diocess,<note place="margin">His success in his Ministry.</note> whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62956:116"/>
to reclaim by private conferences, and at
length they were willing to hear him preach, so it
were not in a Church, which he condescended to, and
preached in the Sessions-house, and his Sermon
wrought so much upon some of them, that their
Priests forbad them hearing him in any place ever
after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1622, there were some <hi>Papists</hi> censured in the
Star-chamber for refusing to take the <hi>Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi>
at which time he was called thither to inform
them of it before the sentence passed, which occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

of Christ, and the Unity of the Catholick Faith, in
a Sermon preached before King <hi>James</hi> on <hi>Eph. 4. 13.

                  <p>Being thus promoted to the highest preferment his

was so far from being puffed up with Pride, that he

Ministers, who importuned him to preach on the

on the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> he fell into a <hi>Quartane Ague,</hi> which
held him three quarters of a year.</p>
                  <p>After his recovery,<note place="margin">His disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a Jesuit.</note> the Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> (afterwards

draw his Lady to the same Religion, he was willing
that there should be a meeting of two eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of each party to dispute what might be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
between them. The Lady made choice of
our Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> and prevailed with him, though
newly recovered from the aforesaid long sickness, and
scarce able to take such a journey. The <hi>Jesuite</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
by the Earle went under the name of <hi>Beaumond,</hi>
but his true name was <hi>Rookwood</hi> (brother to <hi>Ambrose
Rookwood,</hi> one of the <hi>Gunpowder</hi> Traitors.) The
place of meeting was at <hi>Drayton</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi>
where there was a great Library, so that no Books of
the ancient Fathers were wanting upon occasion for
their view. The points to be disputed on, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Transubstantiation, Invocation</hi> of Saints, <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping</hi>
of Images, and the <hi>visibility</hi> of the Church.
Three dayes they were in this Disputation, three hours
in the forenoon, and two hours in the afternoon each
day; and the conclusion was this, After the third
day of meeting, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> having been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
opponent, now the Tables were to be turned, and
the <hi>Jesuit</hi> according to his desire, was to oppose, and
the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> to answer: But when the time
came, and the <hi>Jesuit</hi> was expected, instead of coming,
he sent his excuse to the Lord <hi>Mordant,</hi> which was, that
all the Arguments which he had framed in his head,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62956:117"/>
and premeditated, so that he thought he had them as
perfect as his <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> were now slipt from him,
and he could not possibly recover them again; and that
he believed it was a just judgement of God upon him,
for undertaking of himself to dispute with a man of
that eminency and learning without a licence from his
<hi>Superiour.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</note> The Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> seeing his tergiversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
upon some further discourse with the Lord <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi>
was converted, and became a <hi>Protestant,</hi> and so
continued to his death. One <hi>Challoner,</hi> a <hi>Secular</hi>

Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> said to <hi>Solomon, Happy are these thy
servants that stand continually about thee, and hear thy

not with their credit, and reputation to stoop so low, &amp;c.
But let the learnedest of us all try it when we will, and we
shall finde, that to lay this ground work right, that is, to
apply our selves to the capacities of a common Auditory,
and to make an ignorant man to understand these My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
in some good measure, will put us to the trial of

                     <hi>who</hi> determined to know nothing but Christ, and him

of the Spirit, and of power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2, 4.</p>
                  <p>2. In his private conversation he framed himself
to the capacity of the meanest that conversed with
him. He had an excellent gift of expressing himself
both in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> and as he could sore with
the <hi>Eagle</hi> in <hi>Polemick</hi> discourses when he met with
<hi>Giants,</hi> so he would stoop to the lowest <hi>Pigmies</hi>
in practical subjects, and would apply himself to the
poorest and weakest Christians. He was no <hi>Dictator,</hi>
nor would impose upon other mens judgements or
consciences, but was as ready to receive from others,
as to impart to them, and would much incline to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Christians, rather than unto others that were
more learned.</p>
                  <p>3. In his demeanour and behaviour he had high

to a plain Country Auditory: And whereas there
were in that part of the Country (where I lived about
five years when I first began my Ministry) divers
plain Christians, which were never called but by their
Christian names; yet indeed were such as had not a
bare form, but the life and power of godliness in

them, so that I was never acquainted with more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christians for men and women of their rank; these
he grew into familiar acquaintance with, would enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them in his chamber, discourse with them, answer
their questions, and satisfie their doubts: And when
he was made Archbishop, some of them told him, that
now they must know their distance, and durst not be
so familiar with him as formerly: To whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that he was the same man still, and they
should be as welcome to him as formerly, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
used the same familiarity with them as he
had wont to do: And when he lay at <hi>Chester,</hi> he
would as soon preach at the request of Mr. <hi>Ashbrook,</hi>
and Mrs. <hi>Kirkman</hi> (a godly woman of the meaner
rank, whom I well knew) as at the intreaties of the

some cases wherein we could not so well satisfie our
selves; we found him at his lodgings in <hi>Christ Church,</hi>
where, before he would admit any speech with us, he
caused us to put on our hats, to sit down by him, and
then to speak our mindes; when I told him that we
were come to request his judgement in some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
he presently stopped me, saying, Mr. <hi>Clarke,</hi> I

about the <hi>Et caetera</hi> Oath, concerning which I did

I have newly received a Letter from two Doctors
(whose names I forbear to insert out of respect to
them) who take me up as if I was a School-boy, (and
withall he pulled the Letter out of his pocket) adding,
that in that regard he would say no more about that
matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I replied, that we were sufficiently satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

                                 <p>This Judgement of the Bishops, Dr. <hi>George
Downham,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> at the next meeting of
the Assembly, which was <hi>April</hi> the 23, 1627,
published at <hi>Christ Church</hi> before the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi>

                                 <p>Are not many amongst us for gain, and outward
respects, willing, and ready to consent to a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of false Religions, thereby making themselves
guilty of a great offence, in putting to sale not onely
their own souls, but also the souls of others: But
what is to be thought of Toleration of Religion, I
will not deliver my own private opinion, but the
judgement of the Archbishops, and Bishops of this
Kingdome, which I think good to publish unto you,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62956:121"/>
that whasoever shall happen, the world may know
that we were far from consenting to those favours
which the <hi>Papists</hi> expect.</p>

                  <p>After he had published it, the people gave their votes
with a generall acclamation, crying, <hi>Amen.</hi> The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Bishops prevailed so much with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
that now the Proposals drove on very heavily;
and after much debate of things, the L. <hi>Deputy</hi> finding
the discontents of both parties encreasing, desired our
Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> as the fittest person, both in regard of
his esteem in the Assembly, and being a member of
the Council, and therefore concerned in promoting of
the Kings business, to sum up the state of things, and
to move them to an absolute grant of some compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
that might comply with the Kings necessities,
without any such conditions, with which upon their
answer, he would cease moving any further; which
(upon very little warning) he did with much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
according to his double capacity of a Privy
Counsellour, and a Bishop: A copy of which Speech
desired of him by the Lord <hi>Deputy,</hi> was immediately
transmitted into <hi>England:</hi> But it not being prevalent
with the Assembly, to induce them to supply the
Kings wants, it was dissolved.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the Lord <hi>Deputy Falkland</hi> being
called back into <hi>England,</hi>

at the water side, he reserved our Lord Primate as
the last person to take his leave of, and fell upon his
knees on the sands, and begged his blessing, which
reverend respect shewed to him, gained a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to himself, both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England;</hi>
and indeed from his younger years, the several Lord

It was no small labour to him to answer those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Letters which came to him from forreign parts,<note place="margin">His incessant pains.</note> and
our own Nations upon several occasions; some for
resolution of difficulties in Divinity, others about
Cases of Conscience, and practical subjects. Twelve
of the most eminent Divines in <hi>London</hi> (who at his
being here, were wont to apply themselves to him as
to a Father, as Dr. <hi>Sibbs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Preston, &amp;c.</hi> between
whom, and him there were most entire affections)
wrote to him for his directions about a Body of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Divinity, which he returned them accordingly.</p>
                  <p>He much endeavoured the augmentation of the
maintenance of the Ministery in <hi>Ireland,</hi>

end he had obtained a Patent for Impropriations to be
passed in his name for their use as they should fall, but
it was too much neglected by themselves, whereby
his desires were frustrated.</p>
                  <p>He preached every Lords day in the forenoon,<note place="margin">His constan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

failing unless he was disabled by sickness, in which
he spent himself very much: In the afternoons his
directions to Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> his assistant, were, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
publick Prayers he should <hi>Catechize</hi> the youth, and
that after the first, and second Lesson, he should spend
half an hour in a brief and plain opening the Principles
of Religion in the publick <hi>Catichisme;</hi> and therein he
directed him to go, first through the <hi>Creed</hi> at once,
giving but the sum of each Article, the next time to
go through it at thrice, and afterwards to take each
time one Article, as they might be more able to bear
it; and to observe the like proportionably in the Ten
<hi>Commandements,</hi> the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and the Doctrine
of the <hi>Sacraments:</hi> The good fruit of which was
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62956:122"/>
apparent in the common people upon their coming to
the Communion, at which time, by orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
were to send in their names, and some account
was constantly taken of their fitness for it. His order
throughout his Diocess to the Ministers, was, that they
should go through the Body of Divinity once a year,
which he had accordingly drawn out into fifty heads.
When any publick Fast was enjoyned he kept it very
strictly, preaching alwayes first himself, and therein
continuing at least two hours, in a more than ordinary
manner enlarging himself in prayer; the like was done
by those that assisted him in the duty.</p>
                  <p>His expences for Books was very great,<note place="margin">His expences in Books and Manuscripts.</note> especially
whilst he enjoyed the revenues of his Archbishoprick,
a certain part whereof he laid aside yearly for that end,
but especially for the purchasing of <hi>Manuscripts</hi> and
other Rarities, as well from remote parts of the world,
as near at hand. He was the first that procured the
<hi>Samaritan</hi> Bible (which is onely the <hi>Pentateuch)</hi> to the
view of these <hi>Western</hi> parts of the world. It was sent
him from <hi>Syria</hi> by the way of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whom he imployed to search for things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and these were thought to be all that could there
be had. One of these he gave to the Library of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi>
A second to <hi>Leyden</hi> (for which <hi>Ludevicus de

dedicated to him:) A third he gave to Sir <hi>Robert
Cottons</hi> Library: And the fourth, after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
it with the other, he kept himself. The Old
Testament in <hi>Syriack,</hi> an other Rarity also, was sent
him from those parts not long after.</p>

the changes which since are come to pass both in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>England,</hi> both in Church and State, and of
the poverty which himself should fall into, which he
oft spake of in his greatest plenty. Some took much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of that Text which he preached of in St. <hi>Maries</hi> in
<hi>Cambridge, Anno Christi</hi> 1625, upon the late Kings Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation

that he preached on at the Court immediately before
his return into <hi>Ireland,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 33. <hi>God is not the

of the Saints:</hi> In his application, he spake of the

                  <p>In his Book called <hi>Ecclesiarum Britannicarum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitates,</hi>

                     </gap>he hath this remarkable passage,
after he had largely related the manner of the utter
destruction of the <hi>British</hi> Church and State by the
<hi>Saxons</hi> about the year 550, as he found it in <hi>Gildas,</hi>
he gives two reasons why he was so prolixe in setting
it down, 1. That the Divine Justice might the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from thence appear to us, the sins of persons of
all sorts and degrees being then come to the heigth,
which occasioned, not onely shaking of the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>British</hi> Church and State; but the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and almost utterly overturning of them.
2. That even we now might be in the greater fear
that our turn also is coming, and may be minded of
that of the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 11. 22. Behold the goodness
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62956:123"/>
and severity of God: On them which fell, severity, but
towards thee goodness, if thou continue in his goodness:
Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He often acknowledged that sometimes in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
he hath resolved to forbear speaking of some
things, but it proved like <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> fire <hi>shut up in his
bones,</hi>

unless he would have stood mute, and proceeded no
further. He was very bold and free in the exercise of
his Ministry, sparing sin in none, yea <hi>even before Kings
he was not ashamed</hi> to do it. He often (to his utmost)
stood in the gap to oppose Errours and false Doctrines;
he withstood to the face any Toleration of <hi>Popery</hi> and
Superstition,<note place="margin">His zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Popery.</note> by whomsoever attempted: He was so
fervent in his preaching, that that of the <hi>Psalmist</hi>

and often repeated it afterwards, that he was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the greatest stroak to the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
was yet to come; and that the time of the utter
ruine of the <hi>Roman Antichrist</hi> should be when he
thought himself most secure, according to that
Text, <hi>Revel. 18. 7. When she shall say, I sit as a
Queen, and shall see no sorrow, &amp;c.</hi> His farewell
Sermon, in, or very near the place where he had
lived in <hi>England,</hi> was then much observed upon <hi>Jam.
1. 25. Sin when it is finished brings forth death;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he spake of the fulnes of the sins of this Nation,
which certainly would bring great destruction: Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that the <hi>Harvest of the earth was ripe,</hi> and the
<hi>Angel was putting in his sickle,</hi> Rev. 14. 18. applying
<pb facs="tcp:62956:123"/>
also that of the <hi>Epha</hi> in the Vision, <hi>Zach.</hi> 5. when
it was filled with wickedness; and that of the
<hi>Amorites,</hi> who when their iniquities were come to the
full, were destroyed. He often also hinted the same in
his private discourses, and many that heard them,
laid these his sayings up in their hearts, and by what
hath already fallen out, do measure their expectations
for the future.</p>
                  <p>At the last time of his being in <hi>London,</hi>

                     </note> he much
lamented, with great thoughts of heart, the wofull
dis-unions, and the deadly hatred which he saw kindled
in the hearts of Christians one against another, by
reason of their several opinions in matters of Religion;
and observing how some opposed the Ministry, both to
Office and maintenance: Others contemned the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:
Others raised, and spread abroad <hi>Damnable
Dectrines, Heresies,</hi> and <hi>Blasphemies:</hi> Upon which
considerations he was confident, that the enemies
which had sown these up and down the Nation, were
<hi>Priests, Friers,</hi> and <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and such like <hi>Popish</hi> Agents,
sent out of their Seminaries from beyond the Seas in
sundry disguises, who increasing in number here in
<hi>London,</hi> and elsewhere, do expect a great harvest of
their labours; and he was perswaded, that if they were
not timely prevented by a severe suppressing of them,
the issue would be either an inundation of <hi>Popery,</hi> or
a Massacre, or both; adding withall, how willing he
was, if the Lord so pleased, to be taken away from
that <hi>evil to come,</hi> which he confidently expected,
unless there were some speedy Reformation of these
things.</p>

nothing as to their persons, but in relation to their

hardly drawn to speak to that Argument; but being
commanded, he shewed in it a great deal of learning,
and rare observations in matters of Antiquity, so that

                  <p>A Lords eldest son, who from his cradle had been
trained up in <hi>Popery,</hi> but was of excellent parts, and
learning was at last prevailed with by his Father to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ
for a while with this learned Prelate in <hi>Drogheda;</hi>
The prudent Prelate studied nothing more than how
he might take him by craft (as the Apostle did the

presently fall into discourse with him about his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but recreated himself for a time in discoursing
with him about some Philosophical questions, and
Schol-points, in which studies he perceived the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was well versed, and took much delight in them:
This he continued till at last he gained so far upon his
affections, that of his own accord he moved some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
about matters of Religion; and then finding
him studious, he did not presently go about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
him in the Truth, but sought to puzzle him with
doubts about his own Religion: By this means the
Gentlemans conscience began to be awakened; nor
were his scruples removed, though he had recourse to a
<hi>Monastery</hi> hard by where they were debated; so that at
last he came with tears to the Learned Primate for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
and he promised to deal faithfully with him;
but (saith he) <hi>those whom you trust do not so, for they will
not suffer you to see with your own eyes, nor to understand
the Scripture but according to their Churches Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</hi>
Then did he advise him to go amongst them,
and to ask them, whether he that understood the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals</hi>
might examine their Interpretations, and to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62956:125"/>
bring him word what they said. Accordingly he did
so, and brought him word, that they were divided in
their judgements.</p>
                  <p>Then did the learned Prelate wish him no longer
to trust to their implicit Faith, and he would demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to him how much they perverted the sense of the
Scriptures, and abused the writings of the Antient
Fathers, whilst they sought to make the world believe
that the Fathers and Councils were wholly for them,
and against us: <hi>And if</hi> (saith he) <hi>you distrust your own

                  </p>
                  <p>This was an introduction to much confidence which
the Gentleman had in him;<note place="margin">Prayer power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> and it pleased God after
much temptation which he had to the contrary (as he
confessed) to direct him to betake himself to prayer;
after which time, he acknowledged that he understood
more of the way of truth, both when he conferred
with the Primate, and when he meditated apart, than
ever he could attain to before; and the issue was, that
he came into the Church unlooked for of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and after Sermon, made a confession of his Faith,
offering to seal the truth of it (if they pleased to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him) by receiving the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper, which was then to be administred.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papists,</hi> especially the <hi>Priests</hi> were so enraged
hereat, for losing such an one of whom they conceived
so great hopes, that they made much disturbance, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the Gentleman, for safety, was sent over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> that he might decline their
fury; and the forces of the City were raised to prevent
<pb facs="tcp:62956:125"/>
the present danger: and the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> hearing of
it, sent a Troop of Horse, and (as it was said) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
dissolved one of their <hi>Monasteries.</hi> Another

                     </note> they found them engaged
about <hi>Image-worship;</hi> the <hi>Jesuits</hi> denied that they
gave them Divine worship; the Ministers were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that they were no fit <hi>mediums</hi> to worship God
by. After they had tugged at it, and were wearied,
and ready to give over that Question, Bishop <hi>Usher</hi>
said, <hi>But Gentlemen, pray you tell me, do not you give
them Divine worship?</hi> they answered no: <hi>How then</hi>
(said he) <hi>will you be tryed?</hi> they answered, By the
Council of <hi>Trent. Indeed</hi> (said the Bishop) <hi>that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
doth require the giving of worship to them, but who
shall expound what that honour, and worship is, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us that it is not Divine? Will you be determined
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62956:126"/>
by</hi> Thomas Aquinas? they said, Yes. Then was the
Book sent for, and he turned presently to that place
where he concludes, that the <hi>same reverence is to be
given to the Image of Christ, as to Christ himself,</hi> and
by consequence, seeing Christ is adored with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>Latria,</hi> his Image also is to be adored with the
same worship. Now (said the Bishop) have you any
higher worship than the <hi>Latria</hi> that you give to God?
Upon this one of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> whispered to the Lady
<hi>Falkland</hi> to know his name that thus disputed? she
answered, that he was a Country Minister. No (quoth
the <hi>Jesuit)</hi> there is more in him than in both the other.
<hi>Try him</hi> (said she) <hi>further.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Question being laid aside, that of Free-will
was taken up; the Bishop sate silent as before whilst the
state of the Question was canvassed between the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and much ado there was about it,
so that they had like to have broken off, without
coming to any issue; the Bishop seeing that, said;
<hi>Gentlemen, if you will give me leave I will bring you to
the point in difference presently by this similitude. If
you make Free-will to be the Horse, I will make Grace to
be his Rider. Now true it is, my Horse can go of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but he knows not whither I intend to go: Besides
he is dull, and tyred, and I spur him on; my spur doth not
properly go, but it makes my Horse to go. You may easily
apply it:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">They are foyled.</note> But the <hi>Jesuits</hi> had enough, and listed not
to encounter him any farther, pretending a necessity to
be gone, and so left the place; So mightily it pleased
God by him to convince them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another was this:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Another Dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>putation.</note> 
                     <hi>A</hi> Protestant <hi>Knight in</hi> Ireland,
<hi>had prevailed so far with his Lady, who was then a</hi>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:62956:126"/>
Papist, <hi>as to admit of a Parley about their Religion,
and she made choice of one for her, that was called
amongst them,</hi> the Rock of Learning. <hi>The Knight made
choice of this our Primate to encounter him, and upon
the day appointed many persons of note were there
assembled; the learned, and prudent Primate before
the Disputation began, spake thus to the Lady,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>(said he)</hi> let us know the end of our meeting. Is it
that this Gentleman, and I should try our strength before
you? If so, then it is like that we can speak Languages,
and quote Authors which you do not understand, how
then will you know who gets the better? Therefore this
is not our end: If this Gentleman desires to shew his
learning and reading that way, if he please to come to the
College of <hi>Dublin,</hi> where there are men that will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
us both, and can judge between us, I shall willingly
deal with him at those weapons: but now our business
is something else: It is supposed that we two, whom your
Husband and you have chosen, can speak more for the
defence of our Religion than you that chose us, and your
desire is to know, by hearing our discourse in your own
Language, how to rectifie your judgements. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will give you a rule, which if you please to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
you shall be able to discern which of us two have the
truth on our side, and it is this:</p>
                  <p>The Points we will discourse of shall be such, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some knowledge whereof no man may in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way attain to the end of his Faith, the salvation
of his soul. In these you may easily lose your selves,
not onely by <hi>Heresie,</hi> which is a flat denying of them,
but by Ignorance also, by a bare not know of them.
The word of truth contained in the Scriptures, is the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62956:127"/>
rule both of Faith and Life, common to small and
great, concerning these things: Now whilst we keep
to the true sense of the Scriptures in these points, you
may understand us both; but when we shall fly to
subtle distinctions to evade plain Texts, or flye from the
Scriptures to take sanctuary in Authors which you
know not, assure your selves that we are at a loss, and
seek victory rather than truth. Keep this Rule, <hi>Madam,</hi>
in you minde, for this Gentleman dares not deny it to
be a true one, and then you will be the better for our
meeting. <hi>And now</hi> Sir (said he to the <hi>Jesuit,</hi> her
Champion) <hi>I am ready to engage with you in any such
points.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Dispute was begun, and after a short encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the <hi>Jesuit</hi> was driven to those shifts; whereupon
the Primate said, <hi>Madam, do you understand my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that I propounded to this Gentleman?</hi> She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
Yes, <hi>and do you</hi> (said he) <hi>understand this
Gentlemans answer?</hi> She answered, No indeed, It is
too high for me: <hi>But</hi> (said the Primate) <hi>I do, and can
answer him in his own way, but then you would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
me neither: Therefore Sir</hi> (said he to the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit)
I pray you help the Lady to understand your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
as she doth my Argument, then I will further
reply.</hi> But it pleased God within a while, so to disable
the <hi>Jesuit</hi> from proceeding, that he left the place
with shame;<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and the Lady by this, and some further
endeavours, became not only a good Protestant, but
a very gracious woman.</p>
                  <p>The last instance I shall give of the successfulness of
his labors,<note place="margin">The success of his Ministry.</note> is this, About twelve or thirteen years ago we
had an Ordination of Ministers in our seventh <hi>Classis;</hi>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:62956:127"/>
at which time (according to our custome) we called
in the young men that were to be Ordained one after
an other, and examining of them about the work of
Gods Grace in their hearts, three of them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that they were converted by Gods blessing
upon the labours of this our Lord Primate, whilst he

distinction of a <hi>personal</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> conscience to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the late King that he might consent to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading
of the said Earle, telling him, that though the
first resisted, yet he might do it by the second; but
to clear him of this, a person of quality affirmed under
his hand, that some years agone a rumour being spread
of the death of this Reverend Prelate (whose loss
was much lamented at <hi>Oxford)</hi> when this concerning
the Earle was then by one objected against him, the
late King answered that person in very great passion,
and with an oath Protested his innocency therein.
Besides, he left under his owne hand a relation of
that whole business, a true Copy whereof followeth.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>That <hi>Sunday</hi> morning wherein the King consulted
with the four Bishops, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>London, Durham,
Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Carlisle)</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Armagh</hi>
was not present, being then preaching, as he then
accustomed to do, every <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the Church of
<hi>Covent Garden,</hi> where a message coming to him
from his Majesty, he descended from the Pulpit,
and told the Messenger, that he was then, as he
saw, imployed in Gods business, which as soon as he
had done, he would attend upon the King to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his pleasure: But the King spending the whole
afternoon in the serious debate of the Lord <hi>Straffords</hi>
Case with the Lords of his Council, and the Judges
of the Land, he could not before evening be admitted
to the Kings presence.</p>

There the Question was again agitatated, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King in justice might pass the Bill of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
against the Earle of</hi> Strafford. For, that he
might shew mercy to him was no Question at all, no
man doubting, but that the King without any
scruple of conscience might have granted him a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
if other reasons of State (in which the Bishops
were made neither Judges nor Advisers) did not
hinder him. The whole result therefore of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
determination, was to this effect; That herein,
the matter of Fact, and the matter of Law were to
be distinguished; that of the matter of Fact, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
might make a Judgement, having been present
at all the proceedings against the said Lord; where,
if upon hearing all the allegations, on either side,
he did not conceive him guilty of the Crimes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was charged, he could not in justice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him. But for the matter in Law, what was
Treason, and what was not, he was to rest in the
opinion of the Judges, whose office it was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the Law, and who were sworn, therein to
carry themselves indifferently betwixt him and his
subjects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

In Winter the casement was often set open for him to

                  <p>He complained that he was much troubled, finding
himself unable to continue his Ministry; his thoughts
were on it in the day, and his dreams in the night, and
though he had been a preacher about fifty and five
years, and so, like the <hi>Levites</hi> might well be excused
from this service of the Sanctuary, and have imployed
himself (as his manner was) in directing of others, yet
he resolved, if God continued his life the Summer
following, to return to it again in some small Church
or Chappel.</p>
                  <p>He sought not great things for himself: In the time
of his distress by reason of his losses in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the

Parliament for some years was bountiful to him; but
the two last years of their sitting, it fell out to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.
But after they were dissolved, the care of him
was renewed by the Lord Protector, by whose Order
a constant competent allowance was given him, which

drew up an Expedient to accommodate some of our

men of both parties were ready to subscribe. But
in matters of Doctrine for the substantials, it was often
his charge, that Ministers should not preach any thing,
as to please men, but God, who hath put them in trust,

                     <note place="margin">His Humility.</note> Oh! the humble
expressions he used of his own unworthiness, demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself as if he had been the least of Saints, which he
uttered with many tears: He wished those about him
to prepare for afflictions and trials, which he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
were not far from them. Having abode at
<hi>London</hi> one and fifty dayes, for so it was punctually
noted by himself in a Book, it being his custome,
with <hi>David</hi> so to number his dayes, both for the place
where, and the manner how he spent them, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Rygate, Feb.</hi> 13. 1655, to the Countess of
<hi>Peterboroughs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> the 20 following,<note place="margin">His last Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> was the first day of his
sickness, upon which day (as every day) he had been
well busied. Most part of it, as long as he had light, he
had spent at his study, proceeding in his <hi>Chronologia
sacra,</hi> clearing all the doubts in his <hi>Annals</hi> of the Bible,
in which he had gone as far as to the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi>
where the last words he wrote were these, <hi>Hic praeterea
notandum,</hi> but returned not to make any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress.
From his study he went to visit a sick Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
in that Family, and prescribed to her most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
preparatives for death, with other most holy
advice in practical matters, in which he spent three
quarters of an hour, but in such an heavenly manner,
as if, like <hi>Moses</hi> upon Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> his eyes had
been strengthened to take a prospect of the heavenly
<hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:62956:131"/>
That night about eight a clock, he first complained
of his hip, judging it to be a spice of the <hi>Sciatica,</hi>
which he had been troubled with about five and thirty
years before, contracted by sitting up late in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
Library at <hi>Dublin;</hi> but by the application of an
ointment, he was presently eased of that pain, so that he
took some rest that night. In the morning he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of a great pain in his side, whereupon a <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
was sent for, who used such means as he judged
fit for him; but the pain continuing, and his spirits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying,
he wholly addicted himself to prayer, only upon
the abating of the torment, he advised those about him,
in health to prepare for sickness, and death, that then
they might have nothing else to do but to dye; and
after a short settlement of the things of this world, he
took great content in his approaching death.</p>
                  <p>A Minister there present assisted him with his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">His Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note>
but afterwards he desired to be left to his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.
The last words he was heard to utter which was
about one a clock in the afternoon, and a little before
his death) were these; praying for the forgiveness of his
sins, he added, <hi>But Lord in special forgive my sins of
Omission:</hi> Herein he had his wish, which he often used,
that he might dye as holy Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> did, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
with crying for mercy and forgiveness.</p>
                  <p>But did he pray for pardon of his sins of Omission?
and yet he was a person that was never known to
omit an hour, but was alwayes imployed in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
business, either in preaching, reading, writing,
or hearing others (as of late) to read to him; either
resolving doubts, or exhorting, instructing, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selling
such as came to visit him; yet did he dye with
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62956:132"/>
this humble expression, <hi>Lord forgive my sins of Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
A speech that may give us all matter of solemn

                     <hi>March</hi> the 21. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1655, this glorious Sun
set, and from earth was translated to Heaven, having
been Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> just one and thirty years, and
a Preacher five and fifty years, and having lived about
seventy five years. What he had to leave was only his
Library, and divers imperfect Copies of his intended
Works, which death prevented his finishing of.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Protector (as he was then called) gave
him an honourable burial at the publick charge,<note place="margin">His Funeral.</note> in the
Chappel of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and
extended to his, what was before intended for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the grant of some of the Lands belonging to the

years.</p>
                  <p>He was highly admired,<note place="margin">His learning admired.</note> and much honoured by all
the famous Lights of his time through the Christian

Anno Christi</hi> 1639, in his Epistle Dedicatory to him,
before his third Part <hi>Dubiorum Evangelicorum,</hi> spends
above two leaves in extolling him: Some of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions

but in ours, and wheresoever else there is honour given

much of his Charity to strangers, his Humility, Piety,
Works, his Library, of which he made such use for
the publick good, that it was not so much his own
as the Library of all learned men: <hi>In a word</hi> (saith

everlasting grateful memory: A man so excelling in the

doth surpass it.</p>

A certain <hi>Jesuit</hi> in a Book called <hi>Hyberniae
Vindiciae,</hi> writing against <hi>Dempster,</hi> a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> who
had undervalued the <hi>Irish</hi> for learning, after he had
reckoned up many Learned men of his own, and other
Orders of that Nation, at length he addes this of our
Primate, <hi>And if I should put in men of a different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
I might truly say,</hi> Scotland <hi>never saw another</hi>
Usher, <hi>whose sublime wit, and most curteous behaviour,
I wish that unlucky education amongst Sectaries had not
been his stepmother.</hi> Divers others of his <hi>Popish</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
might be mentioned, but I forbear, and
shall adde onely the Testimony of Dr. <hi>William Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
sometime Fellow of <hi>Christs</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
and afterwards Provost of <hi>Trinity</hi> College, <hi>Dublin,</hi> who
was very judicious, and a great learned man: He gave
three reasons why he thought our Primate to be the
greatest Schollar in the Christian world.</p>
                  <p>1. Because of his rare natural parts, having a quick
invention, a prompt wit, a strong memory, a clear
understanding, a piercing judgement, and a ready ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance.
<hi>Seldome</hi> (said he) <hi>do all these meet in an
eminent degree in the same person; but in him they so
concurred, that it is hard to say in which of them he most
excelled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Because few men had made so rich an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of these parts; nor indeed had such means,
by reason of the choice Libraries which he had the
use of, <hi>viz.</hi> his own, Dr. <hi>Challoners,</hi> the University
Library at <hi>Dublin,</hi> which he had frequent access
unto, besides the University Libraries, and Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Cottons</hi> in <hi>England</hi> He had also taken indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable
pains in studying, and that for many years
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62956:134"/>
together, which few other mens bodies and brains
could bear.</p>
                  <p>3. Because in these, and in the Universities beyond
the Seas, he was so esteemed; and whosoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with him, found him a skilful Linguist, a subtile
Disputant, a fluent Orator, a profound Divine, a great
Antiquary, an exact <hi>Chronologer;</hi> and in brief, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and walking Library: Insomuch that the greatest
Professors admired the concatenation of so much
learning in one person.</p>

A mercy that most men of superlative parts use not to
be too rich in. There is scarce any strong brain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                        </gap>ni,</hi> the youngest begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
might understand. He kept close to the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of our choicest Worthies: as famous Mr. <hi>Dod</hi>
(who used to say, that so much <hi>Latine</hi> was so much
flesh in a Sermon) Mr. <hi>Cleaver,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hildersam,</hi> and
such other holy men of God, led by the self same
Spirit. He would deliver the whole, and wholesome
truths of God, in such an holy, and wholsome way,
that it bred very good bloud in the hearts of his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
He would stoop so low as to speak to the poor
Country people in their own proper dialect, so as they
could not but even see, and feel, and find out God,
and be occasioned to speak of him all the week after.
If he met with a deep mystery, he would make it plain
to the shallowest capacity. Whatever Subject he
sell upon, he would handle it so Divine-like, that the
hearts of his Auditors would be wrapt up into Heaven,
whilest they heard him winding, and turning a point
of Divinity, like a workman that needed not to be
ashamed.</p>
                  <p>Whereas, now adayes, whilest some of our great
Divines,<note place="margin">Note.</note> seem to be too much taken up with quaint,
and <hi>Historicall</hi> flourishes, there is a sensible decay of
the power of God amongst us. An <hi>Exotick,</hi> or
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62956:137"/>
strange tongue in the publick Congregation (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
men think of it) is set out as a sign of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 21, 22. It feeds such humors as
should rather be purged out. It had no good effect in
the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Mens wits will waxe wanton,
when they be not over-awed by the plain power of
Gods Word. When Preachers keep not close to the
very words of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3.
and to the <hi>Doctrine that is according to godliness:</hi> but
love to be tampering with another Doctrine, though
not with another in the main; but even in the manner
of delivery only, (as when it savours too much of the
pomp of humane eloquence (saith <hi>Calvin)</hi> when it
differs from the stile of the Holy Ghost, (saith <hi>Danaeus)</hi>
the people be in danger of turning aside to vain jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
to perverse disputings, desiring to be teachers,
and such like matters. The Gold upon the Pill may
please the eye; but it profits not the patient. The
Paint upon the Glass may feed the fancy; but the
room is the darker for it. The Sword of Gods Spirit
can never wound so deep, as when it's plucked out of
these gaudy Scabbards. Nakedness deforms too too
many in these dayes; but it is the best garnishing, and
Ornament the truth can have. A sober dress best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a grave Matron. There be words as well as
things which <hi>the Holy Ghost teacheth,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 13.
The Arrows fetched out of Gods own Quiver will
pierce the deepest, and make the people fall the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
under Christ. <hi>The weakness of God is stronger than
men. Pauls</hi> weapons <hi>were mighty.</hi> The <hi>sincere milk
of Gods Word</hi> will make Christs Babes to grow

                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:62956:138"/>
This curious age is too too much given to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of words, and phrases, and cadencies: and
holy Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> was wont to say, that great affectation,
and good affections seldome goe together. The <hi>swell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words of vanity</hi> may tickle the ear, tip the tongue,
and please in matters of discourse: but when it comes
to push of Pike, they afford but little comfort. Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
had another manner of wisdome than that of words.
<hi>He was an able Minister of the New Testament, not of
the letter, but of the Spirit,</hi> that hath given, doth
give, and will give life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. Having this
hope then, he <hi>used great plainness of speech:</hi> and by
the manifestation of the truth, <hi>he commended himself
to every mans conscience in the sight of God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hath so well seasoned the Country where he lived,
that the fruit of it (without doubt) will remain, and
be seen many years after.</p>
                  <p>His Prayers were lively, and fervent. He was a
man that had a very large measure of that <hi>Spirit of
grace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ervent Prayers.</note> which is a <hi>Spirit of Supplication.</hi> He was so
well fitted with abilities to open his mind to God, as
if (with blessed <hi>Bradford)</hi> he had been almost ever
upon his knees. He could tell his own errand, or
any other mans, at the Throne of grace, with as good
freedome, and to as good purpose, as any man living.
He would not <hi>be rash with his mouth</hi> when he came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, nor set out what he had to say there, with
painted eloquence, or Court-like complement: but
his mouth used to be filled with such savoury Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as very well became an humble Suppliant. He
was far from those <hi>battologies,</hi> and miserable extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies,
that too many prayers are stuffed with. He
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62956:138"/>
would pour out his soul to God at all manner of times,
upon all manner of occasions, with all manner of
Prayer, and Supplication, and with that admirable vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of all sorts of quickening and feeling meditations,
that it would even ravish the hearts of those who had
the happiness to be partakers with him therein.</p>
                  <p>Yet for all this,<note place="margin">Set forms of Prayer lawful</note> he was clear in his opinion for the
lawfulness of the use of set Forms of Prayer, according
to the tenet of all our best, and most judicious Divines,
and according to the practice of all Churches, even
the best reformed, saith Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> now, and in all
former ages. So saith Mr. <hi>Hildersam:</hi> yea, and
Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> himself saith upon the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> (though
as then he was warping, and afterwards wandred far
in the wayes of Separation) that it was the practice of
the ancient Church, and of all the Reformed Churches
in <hi>Christendome:</hi> of the Churches immediately after
the Apostles; nay (saith he) of the Church in the
time of the Apostles, as may probably be gathered
out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. This hath also been the practice
of the best lights that ever were set up in the Churches
of Christ. It is very well known that the flower of
our own Divines went on in this way, when they might
have done otherwise if they had pleased, in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
before their Sermons. Nay, Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> himself
would seldome end his devotions in his own Family
but with the use of the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi> Nay yet more,
Mr. <hi>Cartwright (Hist. Christ. p. 3. p. 535.)</hi> thinks it
very probable that Christ his own self made use of a set
Form at meales.</p>
                  <p>It is not good to cast stones of offence in the way of
our weak Brethren, who being of meaner parts, want
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62956:139"/>
ability, memory, and audacity to conceive Prayer,
especially before others, that they be not taken off
from, nor disheartened in this so comfortable, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
a service of God: nor may we lay a trap, or
snare for our own feet. Who knoweth what times
may pass over him? If God should plunge us into the
Ditch, and leave us labouring in the noose, the lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of us all may be faign to take relief from, and to
make use of these poor contemptible props, and crutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
(as some deem, and call them) When the soul is
so troubled that it cannot speak; but <hi>Chatter</hi> only,
like <hi>a Crane,</hi> and <hi>Swallow,</hi> Psal. 77. 4. When it is
so full of grief that it can do no more than sigh, and
groan, and make a confused noise, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 2. it
will then be glad to catch at any thing to give it self
vent by. Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> tells us of a second <hi>Bradford,</hi>
that in time of his distress, was fain to adopt Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi>
words, and to spread them before God as his
own, because he had said more for him (as he
thought) than he could say for himself. I knew
(saith mine Author) a rare, and eminent Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that would be as often upon his knees as any
man that ever I conversed with, that would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be in such damps, that had no more to set
before God to give his heart ease by, than the words
of <hi>David</hi> in the one and fiftieth <hi>Psalm.</hi> Well might
then this knowing Divine of ours, that had been so
tossed with tempests, be tender of that, that might
be so usefull for poor trembling hearts in a stormy
day.</p>
                  <p>Get to God therefore as thou canst. Sad judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be upon our people. Spirituall judgements are
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:62956:139"/>
the forest judgements. What if thou hast but the

<hi>Capel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was of a sound, and setled judgement. He pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at first upon a good foundation,<note place="margin">His sound judgement.</note> and being <hi>nourished
up in the words of Faith,</hi> he continued in the things he
had learned, and been well assured of, <hi>knowing from
whom he had received them,</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. He was well
grounded in his opinion: one that stood like a brazen
wall, as firm as a very Rock in the middest of all the
dashings and clashings of tempestuous times. He saw
with a clear eye through all the painted glosses of
those that were given to change; and therefore was
not moved at all with any thing that was said or done
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:62956:140"/>
in that kinde; he was true to his Religion, and clave
close all along to his first principles,<note place="margin">His constancy</note> 
                     <hi>holding fast
the Faith that was once,</hi> and (as he himself would
often express it) but once <hi>delivered to the Saints.</hi> He
lived and dyed a true Orthodox Divine, according to
the known Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He
knew full well, for all the great talk of the Gospel, as
though it were but newly dropt out of the clouds,
that there is not any other Gospel, but the <hi>everlasting
Gospel,</hi> Rev. 14. 8. that was preached before unto
<hi>Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3. 8. and hath been entertained all
along still by Gods faithful people, and shall be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
to the end of the world. Yet some there be
that are no mean pretenders to the Gospel, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the same, are in great danger of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                  <p>This constant, and stable man was set up as a sure
Sea-mark. Let us stand to his steps though we stand
alone. God and a good conscience are alwayes good
company. <hi>Elijah</hi> was but one, yet did he very good
service. One <hi>Athansius</hi> in the <hi>East,</hi> one <hi>Hillary</hi> in the
<hi>West,</hi> was of mighty great use in a staggering time.
What if we meet with storms. It is but a poor Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that is not worth suffering for. It will <hi>turn to a
Testimony,</hi> Luke 21. 13. When the wilde humour is
spent, men will return home again. A Statue of
<hi>Mercury</hi> wil be looked upon then. Those poor silly souls
that be tossed to and fro, and whirled about, and about
again <hi>with every wind of Doctrine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The danger of inconstancy in Religion.</note> Eph. 4. 14. will be
glad of such a sight in the day of their visitation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they which know, or should know more of God,
be not steddy in their steering, but vary in their
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:62956:140"/>
course, poor bewildred hearts will be at their wits ends,
not knowing which way to turn, nor to whom to go,
nor whom to walk after.</p>
                  <p>As there is but one God, so there is but one <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp;
one <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and one way to eternal life, and one Rule
for us all to walk by, why be we not then all of one
heart? why walk we not all in one tract? So many
men as we see, so many mindes there be. Every
moneth almost produceth a new Faith. It is easie to
swim with the Tyde: To perswade the heart of the
rectitude of that that is favoured by the times, and
yet to pretend still that it is from more light. We may
talk of the Spirit, but its certain that <hi>Schisme</hi> is a <hi>fruit
of the Flesh.</hi> The <hi>old way is the good way,</hi> Jer. 18. 15.
He shall stumble, and ensnare his feet that swerves
from the antient paths. What is got by gadding?
Men itch for change still, and there is no rest but with
<hi>our first Husband,</hi> Hos. 2. 7. It is good to be all of one
minde in God. Where there is not unity in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there is scarce unity in affections. We are too
fierce against such as close not with our Notions. It
was <hi>Bell, Book,</hi> and <hi>Candle</hi> once: It is not much better
now. Wilde fire flyes amain: We cannot all cut to
a thread; there will be some variation in the Compass:
But whilst we aim at the white, the odds is to be passed
by without bitterness. Why should there be such
huge Rents and Divisions in the Church? Where is
our mutual forbearance? We have not yet learned our
Lesson well, to wait one for another till God shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. Whilst we be so sharp in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests,
Satan makes his Markets: Religion goes to
wrack; our differences are widened. Some are ready
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:62956:141"/>
to give up all, seeing there is no better Harmony:
Others could well wish themselves out of the world,
that they might be delivered (as <hi>Melancthon</hi> said) from
the implacable difference, even amongst some Divines.
Oh! that we could hearken unto God, who would
have the truth followed, but in love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15. If
the Word will not prevaile, the Cross will come,
and make a <hi>Hooper,</hi> and a <hi>Ridley</hi> imbrace one another.</p>
                  <p>Let us fall upon that one,<note place="margin">How to be constant therein.</note> and onely solid way of
God, it will ever be our glory. Get we to God, he can

firmly knit to God, and his Truth, and then we shall not
waver. Tamper not with opinions, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17. nor
with opiniative men, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. Rom.</hi> 16. 17, 18. Nor
yet with Books that scatter Tares. This grave, and
prudent Divine gives a very good caution to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in his <hi>Treatise of Temptations,</hi> from famous
Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> a man of vast experience. <hi>An honest heart
may be sorely puzled with a forked Argument.</hi> The
Martyr could dye for Christ, that could not dispute
for him. Some pretend that they must <hi>try all things:</hi>
But they speak besides the Book. Who will try Rats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,
or a sharp Sword whether it will pierce into his
bowels? Some think that they can withdraw when they
see danger; but Satan is subtle: Venome will get <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before we be aware, and error will stick, and eat <hi>like a
Gangrene.</hi> What gets the Fly that playes with the
Candle? They that nibble at the bait, shall hardly
escape the hook. Again, gingle not with tearms that be
improper in matters of Religion; they savour of
singularity, breed rents and divisions between Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:62956:141"/>
and people, and take off the minde from things
more essential. Learned men have observed, that
<hi>Hereticks</hi> gat great advantage by the unwary speeches
of the Fathers. Some of <hi>Calvins</hi> expressions that
were not so well pondered, have done no great good
to some in our times. <hi>Nestorius</hi> fell into his <hi>Heresie</hi> by
defending an improper speech of his; and <hi>Eutyches</hi>
thinking to mend it, fell into the other extream.
Dr. <hi>Thomas Tailor</hi> speaks much to this point to very
good purpose in his <hi>Progress to Holiness,</hi> p. 134,
135, 154. and concludes, that if we will keep the faith
of our Fathers, we must keep the words of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>Our Mr. <hi>Capel</hi> was a man of a single heart:<note place="margin">His single-heartedness.</note> He
was (with <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 25. 27.) a plain man, <hi>i. e.</hi> A

though there was some infirmity, yet <hi>there was no

and was as far from Hypocrisie as most men living.
If all others were of his temper, <hi>Momus</hi> had no need
to complain of the want of a window into any mans

without dissimulation: He was very high in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Capel</hi> was a very useful man in his life. He was
(with <hi>Melancthon)</hi> born for the common good,<note place="margin">His Usefulness</note> and
lived for the publick benefit of the whole Country.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was at his Pastoral charge, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
fully, and <hi>wholly to Reading, to Exhortation, and
Doctrine;</hi> and his <hi>profiting</hi> appeared <hi>unto all men:</hi> so
that he was generally, and that justly reputed a man
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:62956:142"/>
                     <hi>approved of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His frequent preaching.</note> 
                     <hi>rightly dividing the word of truth:</hi>
It is well known what pains he took, and to how
good purpose, during the whole time of his abode
there, which was about one and twenty years. He
preached constantly twice every Lords day; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
preached a Lecture constantly every week,
though he had but an infirm body, till by reason of
sickness he was taken off: And then besides his
<hi>Sabbath</hi>-dayes work, he preached onely upon the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival
dayes. His lips were <hi>touched with a coal from the
Altar.</hi> It may truly be said of him, as it was of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi>
that his words pierced like a two-edged sword.
He could when he pleased be a <hi>Boanerges,</hi> a son of
Thunder; but his bent was most to be a <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a
son of Consolation. He was a true <hi>Evangelical</hi>
Preacher, and comforted many a drooping heart by
his labours in publick, and gave abundance of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in private to many troubled spirits that used
to resort to him out of all Countries, both far and
near.</p>

When the times were such (some flying so extreamly

that had never been looked upon if he had not come
thither (no more than <hi>Islebium,</hi> and <hi>Bretta,</hi> if not
for <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon)</hi> and there he had more
health and cheerfulness of spirit than formerly,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62956:143"/>
which he improved well for the publick advantage:
For,</p>
                  <p>There he fell upon the Practice of <hi>Physick.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He practiseth Physick.</note> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
had bent his studies that way before hand (fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
what would follow) yet would he do nothing in
that kinde (it not being his Calling) so long as that
great work of the Ministry lay upon him: But when he
had quit the more special tye of the care of mens souls,
he then took himself to be at more freedome, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a License sent him by the Bishop of <hi>Gloucester</hi>
to authorize him, he fell upon the cure of mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and being of great sufficiency, his fame was
quickly spread abroad. He was looked upon as a very
<hi>Trismegistus,</hi> or a second <hi>Aesculapius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> He could do
much at the diving into a disease, and in applying such
medicines as were proper and fit. Not like some that
will be tampering with that Profession, and give their
<hi>doses</hi> at adventure. He was quick, yet in cases of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
and danger he would weigh things well. In des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
diseases he would adventure far, according to
the rules of Reason, what he gave should be safe. He
mixed all with his own hands, he would stoop to the
meanest, and serve all at an easie rate. His Receits
amounted not to the half, nay not to one quarter of a
common <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Bill. He was blessed by God
with great, and good success, and had resort, especially
towards his latter end, out of his own, and other
Countries, so that he had not leasure to sit at his own
meals in quiet. Yea many times he was quite tired out
till God called him to rest.</p>
                  <p>His words were seasonable and savoury:<note place="margin">His fruitful discourses.</note> His tongue
was a <hi>Tree of life:</hi> His lips <hi>fed many.</hi> Whosoever
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:62956:143"/>
came near him, should have something dropping (if
he did but heed it) that was worth carrying away with
him. It is true, he would be pleasant, and jest more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than many did, or could well like. (Some of his best
friends wished that it had been otherwise) but there
will be something of humane infirmity cleaving to us
all in this world. Yet the times are to be considered,
and the nature of a many with whom he had to deal,
that could no more away with a downright blow, than
some can away with sound Doctrine. Yet there was
never a prudent heart but it might have picked sweet
out of that which some did most of all distasie. It is
said, that <hi>Erasmus</hi> did more hurt to the <hi>Pope</hi> by his
jesting, than <hi>Luther</hi> did by his ruffling: So this man
gave a deadlier blow to the iniquity of the times in
his <hi>jocular</hi> way, than most others can do in their most
serious undertakings; yet would he be as serious as
any man living upon a just and fit occasion, and would
be as tender to trouble the spirits of the meanest as
heart could desire. <hi>Urbanus Regius</hi> having had one
dayes discourse with <hi>Luther,</hi> said, that it was one of
the sweetest dayes that ever he had in his life: Some
can say as much of this rare man, when they had him
(as all might have had him) in the right veyn.</p>
                  <p>He was singular in that faithful advice and counsel
which he used to give to all of all sorts upon every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent
occasion.<note place="margin">An excellent Counselor.</note> It was said in old time, <hi>They shall
ask counsel of Abel,</hi> 2 Sam. 20. 18. <hi>and so they ended their
matters.</hi> The common conflux of almost all in those
parts, was still to his house. <hi>Oyntment and perfume re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
the heart,</hi> Prov. 27. 9. so did the sweetness of this
man <hi>by his hearty counsel.</hi> To some he was as another
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62956:144"/>
                     <hi>Nestor;</hi> others found him ever a most faithful <hi>Achates,</hi>
and such made him (as <hi>Tully</hi> did his <hi>Atticus)</hi> their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<hi>Assylum,</hi> and his dexterous counsel (like <hi>Ariadnes</hi>
thred) led them out of many a perplexed <hi>Labyrinth.</hi> He
was (as that famous <hi>Augur</hi> in <hi>Homer)</hi> one that could see
things past, and present, &amp; guess shrewdly also at those
that were to come. <hi>Oldmens counsels</hi> (they say) <hi>are young
mens lances:</hi> Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> were very profitable, so
were Mr. <hi>Capels:</hi> Many a young beginner, and tired
conflicter, did fetch all their best weapons out of this
mans Armory.</p>
                  <p>He preached the Gospel freely for the most part of
his last twenty years.<note place="margin">He preached freely.</note> 
                     <hi>Freely he had received, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
he would give. Not that he thought it unlawful
for a Minister to take maintenance, or to take that
maintenance by Tithes, which hath been publickly set
aside in this Land; for his Tithes he paid himself, and
that freely and duly too (all the whole time of his
preaching thus freely) and that to one who did not
much in the work of the Ministry; and he did it upon
this ground, because he knew it to be his due. I will
not dispute this point at this time with those that be
hampered in their opinions, but heartily wish them,
with all those that in these times are such enemies to
Tithes, and are so extreamly defective in making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to pay them, to consider what hath faln from
the Pens of holy men that have been far enough
off from being this way interessed.<note place="margin">Tithes asserted</note> Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi>
saith plainly, that they that take away the Tithes of
the Ministers, and turn them to their own use, would
doubtless crucifie Christ again if he were here upon
earth. <hi>Beza</hi> speaks of some that leave Christ, as the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:62956:144"/>
Souldiers did, which crucified him either stark naked,
or but sorrily clad; and so to do (saith he) is not to
love God, but the goods of God more than God.
Dr. <hi>John Reynolds</hi> saith, Our Ancestors provided
houses, Glebe-lands, Tithes, and other profits for the
maintenance of Pastors; and a little after he saith, The
Churches Goods allotted to the maintenance of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Teachers, are not profane, but sacred; and
therefore the sin of them that purloyn them, is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
not Theft, wherein God is spoyled, <hi>Prov.
20. 25. It is a snare to devour that which is holy, and
after the vows to enquire. Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were
made a dreadful spectacle, for filching of a little of
that that was set apart for God. The Eagle fired her
whole Nest by one poor piece of flesh plucked from
the Altar. The people of this Land are <hi>cursed with a
Curse,</hi> and they will not see the cause of it, <hi>viz. Their
robbing of God,</hi> Mal. 3. 8, 9. <hi>in Tithes and Offerings.</hi>
When shall we prove God, and see if he will not
pour us out a blessing, as he hath promised, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 10.
It would be a great joy to some that will get nothing
by it, to hear Gods <hi>Israel</hi> once again tuning it out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, as <hi>Deut. 26. 13, 14. I have brought away
the hallowed things out of mine house, I have not taken
away ought thereof, for any unclean or common use,</hi> as
<hi>Junius</hi> reads it. For then they might say with heart
and hope, <hi>Lord look down from thy holy habitation, and
bless thy people, and the Land that thou hast given us,</hi>
as <hi>Deut.</hi> 26, 15.</p>
                  <p>The practice of this judicious man will sway with
some, who was such a <hi>burning &amp; shining light,</hi> the more
to be admired that it blazed so long, and so clearly too,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62956:145"/>
without any of this sublunary Oil. His mind was so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfied with his small gain in the practice of <hi>Physick,</hi>
together with what he had of his own temporal estate,
that he would accept of nothing for his preaching of
any man living, though tendred, and never so much
pressed upon him. He took not himself bound (as the
case stood) to labour in the work of the Ministry,
there being another Incumbent in that place. What
he did was meerly in love to God and mens souls. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he met with many diversions, as the tempests of
the times; his own domestick troubles, age creeping
on, store of sick and sad people, and recourse of all
sorts, so that he had scare an hour free for study; yet
nothing would take him off from this imployment,
till God took him off from all his labours.</p>
                  <p>As he preached,<note place="margin">His holy life.</note> so he lived down the iniquities of
the times. He did not onely cry them down by his
publick Ministry, but gave them a more deadly blow
by his contrary walking. <hi>Noah</hi> condemned the world
more by what he did, than by what he said, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The way which Mr. <hi>Capel</hi> took, put some to a stand,
caused others to relent, and repent, and encouraged
others in the good and right way, whilst they had his
patern that could not be contradicted. Now that he is
gone, such have a harder task; but God will carry on
his own work.</p>
                  <p>He was eminent for Self-denial:<note place="margin">His Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.</note> Indeed Self-denial
is in every mans mouth, but hardly to be found in
any mans practise. Self hath ever been, is, and will
be the great <hi>Diana,</hi> notwithstanding all mens fair
pretences. We read of him that could give smoothe
and golden words, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4, 4. 6. but when it came to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:62956:145"/>
the point, he would not mar his Inheritance. Self
hath too great a stroke in the best of us all, both
Preachers and Professors, both in Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
It began to work betimes. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
us in his dayes, that <hi>all sought their own things,</hi> Phil.
2. 21. and it is now grown to a greater head in our
age, when we neither eat, nor drink, nor fast, nor pray,
nor, do any thing to speak of, but too too apparently
we seek our selves therein. How much then was this
brave man to be admired, seeing all that knew him,
can bear him witness, how far he excelled in this rare
Grace! he could deny himself in his own understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and go after God in a way that he knew not, as
<hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 11. 8. he could deny himself in his
own will, when he that is above would lead him in a
way that he would not, as <hi>Joh. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> 18. He could deny
himself in his own affections also, when he came to be
crossed in what he could have most desired, ever ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them by reason, and Religion, as a wise man
should do, subjecting himself to bear with quietness
what could not be holp, without raising too much dust.
It is strange to see how far he could deny himself in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
diet, attendance, and what not!</p>
                  <p>He was very exemplary for his contempt of the
world.<note place="margin">His contempt of the world.</note> He had gotten the start of most men in that
particular. He used to be beating upon this point
mainly, both in his publick preaching, and in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
conference, and shewed the reality of what he
pressed when he came to act himself. Indeed he could
not say as <hi>Luther</hi> did, that he never had been tempted
unto covetousness, but he kept himself from any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
taint in that kinde; nay from the least suspicion of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62956:146"/>
that foul crime, with famous Dr. <hi>Whitaker.</hi> When
he had things under his hand, he still charged his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to do what few men practice, that they should
never set up Corn, nor bring home Cattel, but take
as the Market would afford. All that knew him knew
that he was far enough from encreasing his estate by
any indirect means; and never was there any man
more willing to part with money upon a just and fit
occasion. It is well known that he gave over a Living
of good value, one of the best in those parts above
twenty years before his death, and betook himself to
a poor little corner, from which he would never be
withdrawn, no more than <hi>Musculus</hi> from his <hi>Berne.</hi>
And even there he might have picked mens purses if
he had been that way given: But many, and many a
time he put back money, and took but a small matter
from those that were able, and would have been
willing to have given him more; they sought to
force him to take it, but he would utterly refuse
it.</p>
                  <p>He was no less exemplary fo his great humility.<note place="margin">His Humility.</note>
This was the Grace that graced all the good that was
in him. He would be often speaking of what he had
heard concerning Dr. <hi>John Rainolds,</hi> that he was as
learned a man as any was in the world, as godly as
learned, and as humble as godly. Mr. <hi>Capel</hi> loved,
and reverenced this Doctor, and trod in his steps. He
could speak with Tongues more than most men, yet
would he never make use of them in the publick
Congregation. He used to honour all men; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the gifts, and parts of those that were far
below him, and to rejoyce in them, as <hi>Hooper</hi> did in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:62956:146"/>
the blinde Boy. He would not meddle in things that
were too high for him, nor intrench upon that that
was beyond his sphere. He would not stand in the
place of great men. He could refuse honours, as <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>
did, and contented himself with plain; and mean
things. Its observed by <hi>Cajetan,</hi> the Flower of the
Cardinals, that he would never be in his silks and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
but kept his old fashions to his lives end. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi>
would not disdain to do that, which his
meanest servant would scarcely have put his hand to.
So was it with Mr. <hi>Capel,</hi> and he would bear things
that went awry without distempering himself about
them.<note place="margin">His Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Moderation he pressed, and moderation he
practised. <hi>Staupicius</hi> told <hi>Luther</hi> concerning his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
that in the first three years, he did all things
according to the utmost rigour, and that would not do:
In the next three years he did all according to the
Laws and Counsels of the Antients, and that would
not hit: And in the last three years, he did all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the will of God, and yet neither would that
succeed; and then he was fain to be content with what
he could have.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have a taste, and but a little taste (in
this that hath been said) of the precious Liquor that
was powred into this earthen vesssel. To which might
be added the quickness of his apprehension, the
strength of his Memory, his sense of the publick
evils, his passing by of wrongs and offences; his special
regard to such as loved their Wives and Ministers,
and the like: but where should I make an end? These,
and his other eminent parts, vertues, and graces de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be laid in oyl-colours by the most skilful Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:62956:147"/>
Towards his latter end he met with some pinching
griefs,<note place="margin">His Patience.</note> which he did bear with invincible patience, and
fortitude: He willingly submitted, because it was
Gods will to have him so exercised. All of us must
expect to drink of the self-same cup: our last dayes
usually are our worst dayes, as <hi>Moll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rus</hi> observes; the
<hi>clouds will then be returning after the rain.</hi> We must
be taught to know, and speak it out, that we are but
<hi>Pilgrims:</hi> we must be more truly and thoroughly
taken off from the world; more ripened, and mellowed,
and seasoned for God, and be made more serious in all
our undertakings. <hi>Melancthon</hi> used to say, That if he
had no cares, he should have no Prayers. Our comfort
is, our time is but short; the most and best of our
treasure is gone before: Our hope is laid up in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Get we more communion with God, more faith,
more patience, and let us put on the whole Armour of
God, and then we shall be able to stand, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
in the evil day, and in the end shall be <hi>more than
Conquerours through him that hath loved us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This clear-sighted, and understanding man fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
storms approaching, and rejoyced that he should
be in his grave before they sell, whither also he came
as a shock of Corn gathered into the Barn in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The <hi>Sabbath</hi> day was the last day of his life, the
strict observation whereof he often pressed? He would
say that we should go to sleep that night (as it were)
with meat in our mouthes.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Sabbath</hi> day being <hi>September</hi> the 21. 1656,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> he
preached twice, taking his leave of the world by pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
faith in God. That evening he repeated both his
Sermons in his Family, somewhat more largely than
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:62956:147"/>
ordinary. He read his Chapter also, went to prayer,
and so to bed, and dyed immediately, by that the
words were well out of his mouth, being threescore
and ten years old. Who can desire to dye better than
<hi>Stephen</hi> did, calling upon God: He would often say,
<hi>That if God saw it fit, one had better to dye of a quick,
than of a lingring Death:</hi> And God answered his
desires.</p>

                  <head>The Life and Death of Dr.
Robert Harris, who dyed
Anno Christi 1658.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Robert Harris</hi> was born in a dark time,<note place="margin">His Birth.</note> and place
at <hi>Broad-Campden</hi> in <hi>Glocestershire Anno Christi
1578.</hi> His Father had the repute of a very wise, and
understanding man, and his Mother of a very devout,
and charitable woman, under whose wings he spent
his childhood: but he acknowledged it as a matter of
grief to him all his life, that he preferred his play be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reading the Scriptures to his parents at their
call. So soon as he was fit for it, he was set to a Free-school
at <hi>Chipping-Cambden,</hi> where he met with a
double discouragement; the first was from the often
change of his Schoolmasters by reason of the small sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
that came to them: The second proceeded from
the fierce and cruel carriage of others, which (as he used
often to say) was the bane of many young Schollars;
and though for his own part, he remembred not that
he had smarted under a Rod in any School, yet the
sight of the severity used to others, brought such a
trembling and sadness upon his spirit, that he could not
shake it off to his dying day.</p>
                  <p>From thence he was removed to the School at
<hi>Worcester,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His going to <hi>

                     </note> under the care of Mr. <hi>Bright,</hi> and on the
<hi>Sabbaths</hi> he heard that Reverend and Learned Dr.
<hi>Robet Abbots;</hi> and being furnished with School-learning,
he went from thence to <hi>Magdalen-Hall</hi>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:62956:148"/>
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> being allyed to the Principal, Mr. <hi>Lyster.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There he shewed a more than ordinary desire of
Learning, and having but little help either from the
Principal, or his Tutor, he followed his private
studies with the more earnestness; yet all this
while he enquired little into the wayes and truths of
God.</p>
                  <p>His Tutor not long after leaving the Hall, he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
solicited the Principal, that he might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the care of one Mr. <hi>Goffe</hi> of <hi>Magdalen</hi>
College, who was noted for a very good <hi>Logician</hi> and
Disputant, but withal he was accounted a <hi>Puritan,</hi> which
made the Principal (who was <hi>Popishly</hi> affected) to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
his choice; but he (not out of love to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but Learning) persisted in his desires, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Goffe</hi> having thus received him into his charge,
required him, that with the rest of his fellow-Pupils, he
should joyn in reading the Scriptures, Repetition of
Sermons and Prayer; which new course, he being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomed
to, was somewhat troubled at it, observing
that none of the <hi>Seniors</hi> imbraced that way, and yet it
was such as he knew not how to contradict. This
caused him oft to betake himself to his private Prayers,
wherein he begged of God, either to discover to him the
falshood, if his Tutor had any design upon him to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
him,<note place="margin">His Convers</note> or if this course were pleasing to God, that
then he would confirm him in it; and it pleased God
after a while so to resolve him, that he bought a
Bible, and with indefatigable pains he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the reading of that, and other good Authours
in <hi>Divinity.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:62956:149"/>
Shortly after Mr. <hi>Goffe</hi> refuseth to continue his
Tutor, onely agrees that they would conjoyn their
studies together, Mr. <hi>Goffe</hi> reading <hi>Philosophy</hi> to Mr.
<hi>Harris,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> reading <hi>Greek</hi> to him, and
from <hi>Greek</hi> they proceeded to <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in which study
some other of the Fellows joyned with them, whereof
one afterwards was President; and besides these studies,
his Tutor and he agreed to read <hi>Calvins Institutions</hi>
by turns, which course they continued as long as their
other occasions, and exercises would permit.</p>
                  <p>Having for a while been Bachelor of Arts, he was
willing to try his fitness for the Ministry, because
otherwise his Father would have him to the study of
the Law; and having prepared a Sermon, he proffered
his pains at <hi>Chipping-Cambden;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Woful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> but such was the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ignorance of those times, that in the greater
Town he knew not where to procure a Bible to carry
with him into the Pulpit; yet at last being directed to
the Vicar there, he indeed had a Bible, but it could
not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before; yet search being made he was furnished with a
Bible, and after Prayer made, he took for his Text
those words, <hi>Rom. 10. 1. Brethren, my hearts desire and
prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His first Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> and
his Sermon was highly commended, and yet himself
would say, that he was a loser by the bargain. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his heart swelled upon it. 2. Because his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Friends hereupon called on him to give over
University studies, and to come amongst them, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
learning enough.</p>
                  <p>His Father also (having many other children to

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:62956:149"/>
applied himself to some persons of eminency both
in Church and State, to get some preferment for him:
But he, being willing to decline publick imployment
for the present, humbly intreated his Father, that
what he would hereafter bestow upon him for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
he would be pleased for the present to allow

behold Gods providence! He had not been long at
<hi>Oxford</hi> before a fearful Plague brake out in that place,
which so scattered the University that few were left
remaining, in which case he was again put to his shifts;
loath he was to return home, and whither else to betake
himself he knew not; till at last, by a special Providence,
he was invited to the house of one Mr. <hi>Doyly,</hi> five
miles from <hi>Oxford,</hi> a Gentleman of a very antient
Family in that County,<note place="margin">A special P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

Gospel, whose wife also was eminent for knowledge,
and piety, to them therefore Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> goes for the

                  <p>Coming to Mr. <hi>Doylyes,</hi> he there met with one
Mr. <hi>Prior,</hi> a prudent godly man, and of an excellent
spirit, who being much weakned by two wracking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
of the Stone and Gout, and overburdened with
preaching both on the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> and <hi>Fasts,</hi> enjoyned
upon the occasion of the Plague, in meer pity, Mr.
<hi>Harris</hi> holp him a turn or two, which he performed
with so good approbation, that presently he was set
upon, both by Mr. <hi>Doyly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prior,</hi> and some others,
that he could not withstand their importunity, but
was necessitated to preach with them, at least during
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:62956:150"/>
the continuance of those extraordinary <hi>Fasts.</hi> Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
pleaded that he was not an Ordained Minister, and
therefore durst not meddle with any thing but preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
neither with that, but till he could be Ordained.
This they assented to, and during his abode amongst
them, he met with ample requit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ls from the good

from the people.</p>
                  <p>About this time there was a fearful Eclipse upon

both from their Office and Benefices, and amongst
them, those three bright shining Stars, Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> Mr.

as being wholly unwilling to part with one whom he
so much prized, yet after a long debate, it was judged
most beneficial for the publick, and therefore could
not be resisted.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> went to <hi>Hanwell</hi> with much grief and
fear,<note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Hanwell.</hi>

ejected: At last it was concluded that Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>

would permit, and so long as there was any hope of

peoples displeasure, who though they could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
against his Ministry (he being endowed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
parts) yet they quarrelled, because his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
about Ceremonies was not the same with that
of their former Teachers; and the truth is, they
both had a sad time of it for a great while, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the prudence and moderation which
Sir <hi>Anthony Cope,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> shewed to the quieting
of them.</p>
                  <p>After a while, Archbishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> finding that the
silenced Ministers would not yeeld, presented two
Chaplains to <hi>Hanwell</hi> and <hi>Drayton,</hi> upon pretence of a
lapse: But Sir <hi>Anthony Cope,</hi> sitting then in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
took one or two of the House with him, and
presented his two <hi>Clerks</hi> to the Archbishop, who after
a long contest, was content to admit his presentation;
but Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> having spoken in that Parliament
against insufficient Ministers, not without reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Archbishops, and Bishops, Archbishop <hi>Bancroft</hi>
could not but resent this, and therefore referred his
Clerks to be strictly examined by his ablest Chaplain.
The Chaplain, having as it seems, his lesson before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
brings in the Clerk designed for <hi>Hanwell</hi> (which
Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> had declined) as altogether insufficient,
though a grave and discreet Divine. Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> was
returned, <hi>mediocriter doctus,</hi> moderately learned. The
Archbishop being not satisfied with this last account,
desires Bishop <hi>Barlow,</hi> who was present with him, to
make some further proof of Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> and the
Bishop being an active and witty man, was glad of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:62956:151"/>

<hi>Divinity,</hi> but most in other Learning, and <hi>Greek,</hi>
wherein the Bishops excellency lay, and both of them
so long <hi>Greeked</hi> it, till they were both gravelled for
want of words, whereupon they both laughed, and so
gave over. The Bishop going in to the Archbishop, in his
report (as Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> expressed it) set him up as much
too high, as the Chaplain had set his Fellow too low. The
Archbishop hearing the Bishops testimony, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

might have <hi>Hanwell,</hi> which was easily assented to by
Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> having before designed it for him, and
Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> also was present to testifie his concurrent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
the only stick with Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> was, that he was

withall, <hi>Drayton</hi> being furnished with a godly prudent
man [Mr. <hi>Scudder]</hi> there were now three neighbours,
who were linked together, not onely in judgement
and affection, but also in affinity; for Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>
married Mr. <hi>Whatelyes</hi> sister,<note place="margin">His Marriage.</note> and Mr. <hi>Scudder</hi> his

caused them to desist.</p>
                  <p>Not long after there befell Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> his wife, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the birth of her first childe, a long and sore afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">His Affliction</note>
which was (as Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> told him) but to season, and
fit him for his work; and Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> himself would
oft say, that he had been quite spoyled, had he not
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:62956:151"/>
thus been taken down; for young Ministers know
not what ground they tread on, till God layes them
flat.</p>
                  <p>This, and some other clouds being blown over, the
weather seemed now to clear up, and his people began
to relish his Ministry, and much comfort he found in
the neghbourhood of many godly Ministers, on one
side he had Mr. <hi>Cleaver,</hi> a very solid Text-man, on the
other Mr. <hi>Lancaster,</hi> a very humble, and self-denying
man, who though by birth he was a good Gentleman,
and had sometime been Fellow in <hi>Kings</hi> College in
<hi>Cambridge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Lancaster</hi> a learned and humble man.</note> where he had read sundry publick Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,

in as pure <hi>Latine</hi> as ever <hi>Tully</hi> spake, having no
other Notes to help him, but what he wrote upon his
own nails; yet this good man, thus accomplished with
all learning, contented himself with a Living that was
not worth 40 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> and in his preaching made
no noyse of any learning at all. When I was young I
knew this Mr. <hi>Lancaster,</hi> he was a very little man of
stature, but eminent, as for other things, so especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for his living by Faith.<note place="margin">Life of Faith</note> His charge being great,
and his means so small, his wife would many times
come to him when she was to send her maid to <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>

had no money; his usual answer was, <hi>Yet send your
maid, and God will provide;</hi> and though she had no
money, yet she never returned empty, for one or
other that knew her to be Mr. <hi>Lancasters</hi> maid, either
by the way, or in <hi>Banbury</hi> Town meeting her, would
give her money, which still supplied their present

But above all his Neighbours,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dods</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> still
most respected Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> and concerning him was fully
of Mr. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> minde, that he was the fittest
man in <hi>England</hi> for a Pastoral Office; he was able to
speak to any mans capacity; he was never out of the
Pulpit, for all his discourses were Sermons, which he
intermixed with such variety of delightful expressions,
and similitudes, as would take with any man. The
truth is, he was a very eloquent man both in <hi>English,</hi>
and <hi>Latine,</hi> and so facetious and pithy, that Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>
used to say often, <hi>That if all his Apothegmes were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, they would exceed all that</hi> Plutarch <hi>had
written in</hi> Greek, <hi>and others since his time in</hi> Latine
<hi>had published.</hi> For some years Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> had the
happiness to live with, and near this man of God,
and that in such a conjunction as greater could not
be.</p>
                  <p>During the time of their converse, they studied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,<note place="margin">How Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> prized him.</note>
and daily read a Chapter in the <hi>Original</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And after Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> was restored to the liberty
of his Ministry in another Diocess, he would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
a Text, preach a Sermon, answer a case of
Conscience (whereof many were daily brought to
him) without the concurrence of Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> with him,
so highly did that eminent Divine prize him, and
would often blame him for his reservedness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness
to put forth himself.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> being (as was said before) removed into
<hi>Northamptonshire</hi> to <hi>Fausley,</hi> God was pleased to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his want by the resort of sundry young Students
from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Hanwell,</hi> so that Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> his house
was a little <hi>Academy;</hi> and amongst others, he took
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:62956:152"/>
much comfort in Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> (who would do nothing,
especially in <hi>Divinity,</hi> without his advice) as also Mr.
<hi>Capel,</hi> who oft resorted to him in his grievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
and temptations for advice and succour, and also
in his well known <hi>Treatise of Temptations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilst he was at <hi>Hanwell</hi> he had frequent calls to
<hi>London,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His invitatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> sometimes to <hi>Pauls Cross,</hi> sometimes to
preach before <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and other sometimes at
<hi>Country-Feasts,</hi> which occasioned many invitations to
places there: But of all the Auditories, that of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours</hi>
in <hi>Southwark</hi> was most grateful to him, and
there he could have spent the remainder of his dayes
if his voyce would have reached so great an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
From thence he was invited to some lesser
Churches, but God had not yet finished his work by
him at <hi>Hanwell,</hi> and therefore something or other still
interposed. Probably he had closed with <hi>Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
had not the then Bishop of <hi>London [Land]</hi> comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
him out of it, commending his <hi>Conscio ad
Clerum</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and promising him better prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than he thought he should merit. Some other
offers were made to him, but still he met with some
cross Providence, which made him come to a resolution
to end where he began.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Hanwell</hi> he went over many Scriptures,<note place="margin">His Labou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> at <hi>Hanwell.</hi>
                     </note> but his
people found least good from that which cost him
most pains, <hi>viz.</hi> his Sermons upon the <hi>Colossians,</hi>
which Epistle he preached throughout. Indeed at that
time he thought he could not speak too highly to a
people who had been so taught, but upon further trial
he found that he could not go too low, so that (as
some of his hearers after told him) his pains upon that
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:62956:153"/>
Epistle was wholly lost as to them. His Sermons upon
<hi>Historical</hi> Scriptures, best pleased most of his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
but with himself, and the more spiritual sort,
his labours upon the Book of the <hi>Canticles</hi> prevailed
most, the Notes whereof he was often pressed to make
publick, which he refused upon a double account. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a great part of them were lost, and dyed with
Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> to whom he had lent them, and whom he
used to call, <hi>A needlese engrosser of other mens Notes.</hi>
2. He less satisfied himself in his elder years, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
passages of that mysterious Book. Yet if the
world were at leasure to hear old men speak, it might
be very useful to collect those dispersed Papers, and
it is hoped that some of his near Relations (who best
know his hand, and method in writing) may take
some pains therein for the publick good.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Hanwell</hi> Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> continued preaching for

                        </gap>abbaths,</hi> and other occasions
which fell out often; for when he came thither, he
found that there had been an accustomed course of
preaching upon such <hi>Festival</hi> dayes (then so called)
which might not enter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ere with the Lecture or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
at <hi>Banbury,</hi> which he also kept up, especially on
<hi>Easter,</hi> and <hi>Whitson</hi> Mundayes, unto which, multitudes
of Christians resorted far and near, <hi>as the Doves to
the windows,</hi> yet without any superstition. And on
the morrow, they were entertained with the like Feast
at <hi>Banbury</hi> by Mr. <hi>Wheatley.</hi> O, what a Faire of souls
was then held at <hi>Hanwell</hi> and <hi>Banbury</hi> by these two
Brothers? How did Religion then flourish, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
thrive <hi>like the Calves in their stalls?</hi> The truth
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:62956:153"/>
is, these Preachers carved out sound and wholesome
food, and their hearers came with good stomacks, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
what they found, <hi>viz. Milk for Babes,</hi> and
<hi>strong meat for strong men,</hi> and accordingly did <hi>grow
thereby.</hi> In those dayes godly Preachers stuffed not
their Sermons with aiery notions, and curious specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
but sought out profitable matter, which they
delivered in <hi>sound words,</hi> and in plain method of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Reason, and Use, accommodating themselves
to every mans capacity, and God gave them a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Harvest in that Country.</p>
                  <p>These his imployments at home (together with his
natural Bookishness) made him less forward to engage
in Lectures abroad, onely he was one in a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at <hi>Dedington</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire;</hi> and for sometime he
kept a Lecture alone at <hi>Stratford upon Avon</hi> in <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickshire</hi>

him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>About this time a great Living in the Country was
offered him, about which he was very indifferent, and
indeed, was but very indifferently dealt with in it,
which occasioned him to say,</hi> That he never bore any
thing more impatiently than the abuse of Religion to base
and private ends, and, that carnal policy, would render
Profession despicable at least, whilst some men took such
a liberty to themselves in equivocating and dawbing; and
the reason of such mens success was, not because they had
more wit than others, but more boldness to say and do
what others durst not.</p>

                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:62956:154"/>
All this while he continued at <hi>Hanwell</hi> in much
prosperity, and the Neighbours thereabouts fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
his Sermons, amongst whom he received the
greatest seals of his Ministry:<note place="margin">Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

much encouragement from abroad, yet we must not
forget his people at home, who were so far brought into
a conformity, that at sometimes there was not a Family
in the Town where Gods Name was not in some
measure called upon, nor a person that refused to be
prepared by him for the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>And as the Lord was thus pleased to bless,<note place="margin">Gods blessing upon his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estate.</note> and
succeed his labours, so he caused him to thrive in his
outward estate likewise, which himself could not but
take notice of; for though his means was not great,
and his children many, for whose sakes he kept a
Schoolmaster, and the resort of Friends to his house
not small, both on <hi>Sabbath</hi> dayes, and Lecture dayes,
yet was he in a thriving condition, which occasioned
him to say, <hi>That there was a secret blessing attending
on house-keeping. For</hi> (said he) <hi>I am not able to give
an account of my expences and of Gods supplies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now began those cloudy times, and his sadder
dayes, when Troops and Armies marched into those
Quarters, about <hi>Edghil,</hi> where was fought a bloody
Battel,<note place="margin">The Battel at <hi>Edgebill.</hi>

for a great mercy) that he heard not the least noise of
it (the wind sitting contrary) till the publick work of
the day was over; nor could he believe the report of
a Battel, til a Souldier besmeared with blood and
powder came to witness it. From this very time his

troubles encreased:<note place="margin">His Troubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

still he kept his station, and some of his Guests would
joyn with him in Family-duties, which he intermitted
not, when others would scoffe at them, because not
mingled with <hi>Book-prayers.</hi> Every <hi>Sabbath</hi> he held on
the course of his Ministry, and most of those which
quartered with him, being Commanders and Officers,
they shewed themselves civil to him, and his; onely
at one time there was a company who were so outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
in swearing and blasphemy, that he could not
forbear preaching upon that Text, <hi>James 5. 12. Above
all things, my Brethren, swear not, &amp;c.</hi> which so netled
some of them, that they damned themselves to Hell
if they did not shoot him in case he preached again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Text, which they judged to be purposely cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
against them; the next <hi>Sabbath</hi> he proceeded pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
upon the same Text,<note place="margin">His Courage.</note> wherein he backed what
he had said before, and as he was preaching he saw a
Souldier take his Carbine, and fumble about the
Cock as if he was preparing to shoot; but Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi>
apprehending that he did it onely to disturb him, went
through his work, and heard no more news of his
Souldier.</p>
                  <p>Thus he continued his labours in those sad times,<note place="margin">He is chosen one of the Assembly.</note>
and though he was chosen a member of the <hi>Assembly

thoughts, he judged his presence less needful there

till he saw his Tenements in the Neighbourhood fired,

                  <p>When he came to <hi>London</hi> he went to the <hi>Assembly,</hi>
where he found much more undone than done: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he met there with many excellent and learned
men; but his thoughts were sollicitous for his people,
his wife and children, whom he had left behinde: and
indeed he found little rest in his spirit, till the same
good hand of Providence had safely brought them
unto him. Then went he with more comfort to the
<hi>Assembly,</hi> where he did <hi>Antiqum obtinere,</hi> hear all, and
say little.</p>
                  <p>Upon his remove from his house, both his Books,
and his Notes (some few only excepted which he had
conveyed away beforehand) together with all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
goods, were seized upon, and his Living given
to another; but that might soon have been supplied,
many offers being made to him, from several places,
and <hi>Country Committees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first motion that he hearkened to was the
<hi>Temple;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He is setled at <hi>Buttolphs</hi> Bishopsgate.</note> but upon trial, he found that Church too
large for his voyce, and thereupon refused, and at last
he was sent to <hi>Buttolphs Bishopsgate,</hi> where, though
the Congregation was too large for him, yet being
necessitated to do something for the maintenance of
his Family, he remained there during his attendance
upon the <hi>Assembly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After his continuance there for some time,<note place="margin">He is sent to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                     </note> himself
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:62956:155"/>
with four more Divines were commanded down to
<hi>Oxford,</hi> which was then under <hi>suspension</hi> by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
which imployment, he often professed, that
he did earnestly decline, and that principally for two
reasons;</p>
                  <p>1. Because the Committee for <hi>Hampshire</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him a free call to <hi>Petersfield,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He is chosen to <hi>Petersfield.</hi>
                     </note> and thither he would
willingly have gone.</p>
                  <p>2. Having long discontinued from the <hi>University,</hi>
he looked upon himself as very unfit for such a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
but in conclusion he was plainly told, that such
as would not be intreated, must be commanded, and
so he was ordered to prepare for his journey. This
much troubled him, and therefore he first goes to
<hi>Petersfield,</hi> and acquaints them how the case stood
with him, and because he could not come suddenly to
them, he desires them, either to pitch upon some
other Minister, or else to take the care upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to provide supplies for both the Churches (for
two they were) and to pay the Preachers out of the
Revenues of the place. The people liked neither of
the offers, yet were content to wait a while in hopes
that he might come to settle with them, requesting
him in the mean while to provide them such supply as
himself should approve of. This proved a troublsome
work to him, though for a time he sent them help
from <hi>Oxford,</hi> and thereabout; for preachers were now
hard to be gotten, there being more want of Ministers,
than of places; yet at last two were procured, the one
of whom gave no good content. At last he was put
upon it, either to relinquish <hi>Oxon,</hi> or <hi>Petersfield;</hi> the
former he could not decline,<note place="margin">He leaves <hi>Petersfield.</hi>
                     </note> and therefore he left
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:62956:156"/>
the latter, though with great regret, because he could
not seal up such respect, and thanks as he conceived
was due from him to that Country. Neither had he
less trouble in providing for <hi>Buttolphs Bishopsgate</hi> (it
being no easie matter to please Citizens) yet at the
last they were supplied to their content.</p>
                  <p>About this time many Libels were cast abroad in
<hi>Oxford</hi> against other Preachers,<note place="margin">He is traduced.</note> and one amongst the
rest reflected upon Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> reckoning up his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Livings, and great Revenues, wherein they
mentioned what was past, present, and to come, and
happily if they had heard of the rest, which at several
times were offered him, they would have put them
also into that Catalogue: Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> being informed
hereof, he wrote to some Friends (which Letters are
already extant) wherein he vindicated himself in the
main, yet withall he professed unto others, that it
would, and should be to him matter of humbling, and
caution to him whilst he lived, that he had given the
least advantage to such as sought it; for though he
stood clear in his own, and others consciences, who
best knew him, that he was far from allowing non-residency,
and plurality of Livings, yet to such as
were ignorant of all circumstances, there was some
appearances of evil; which also he took the more to
heart, because from that time forward he found the

                  <p>The Preachers that were sent to <hi>Oxford</hi> found but
ill entertainment; on the one hand they were aspersed,
and libelled against by their own Mothers Sons, and
on the other hand they were challenged to a publick
Disputation by one Mr. <hi>Erbery,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Disputation at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                     </note> a Sectary, and his

associates. Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> was unwilling that this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
should be entertained,, having observed that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
of that kinde, send away each party more
strengthened in their opinions, than when they came
thither; yet his brethren being of another minde,
they desired his concurrence, at least so far with them,
as to begin the work with prayer. This he condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
unto, and the Disputation proceeded, and
the issue was, that all were censured, some for speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
others for their silence, in which latter rank he
was willingly placed.</p>
                  <p>Not long after came the Chancellor of <hi>Oxon</hi> [the
Earle of <hi>Pembroke]</hi> to visit the University, who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custome, bestowed Degrees upon
some of the Schollars, and amongst others, Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>
was admitted Doctor of <hi>Divinity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Doctor.</note> who yet, neither
thought himself the better Schollar, nor the better
Preacher for this new honour, and had it not been
that he was loath to sleight the favour from his
betters, he had refused it: having learned, <hi>That an
empty hand from a Prince, and a naked title from his
Chancellor, must be counted an honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this time many Headships of Colleges (before
made void) were now to be supplied, and Dr. <hi>Harris</hi>
professed, that seeing it was noised abroad, that these
Reforming Preachers came thither to play their own
game, <hi>viz.</hi> to thrust out others, and to invest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their places, he therefore resolved to keep
to his old course; namely, to stand silent without open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his mouth for any Headship at all, and presently
the best places were all disposed of; neither was any
thing spoken of for Dr. <hi>Harris,</hi> till a Noble man, of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:62956:157"/>
the other University,<note place="margin">He is made Head of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> College.</note> made mention of him, as not fit
to be forgotten, whereupon <hi>Trinity</hi> College was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to him. This some of his Friends much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at, considering, that, though he was the meanest
in his own eyes, yet was he the oldest man, and one
that had suffered more by the times than any, if not
than all the rest; yet he himself said little to it, onely
he enquired who was the Head that was ejected, and
what was the nature of the place: for he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to entertain the proffer, if the former Head
could finde favour to hold it, and thereupon he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
as long as he could be permitted; and as for the
place, the smalness of the College, and the scituation of
it gave him great content, who desired no more than
what would keep him from distractions in his studies,
and the only thing that he stuck at was, because there
was a Parsonage annexed to the College.</p>
                  <p>But when he understood that its distance from <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
was not great, and the conditions easie, <hi>viz.</hi> That
he was required to preach but eight Sermons <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
at it, he the more willingly inclined to it, though
after acceptance, he could not satisfie himself under
two Sermons a week; and so at last there he sate
down, and took much content in the Fellows of
that College, betwixt whom, and him there was ever
a very fair correspondence.</p>
                  <p>At the Parsonage he found most of the people
(though they had been long taught) very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and much addicted to their old Customes,
and (which he looked upon as a sad prognostick to
the place) no sooner did any there look Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in any special manner, but the Lord presently
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:62956:157"/>
took him away, some few, and those very few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
                  <p>About this time a motion was made by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
at <hi>Oxford</hi> of removing him to <hi>New College,</hi>
which was now void, but as the motion began with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, so it was stifled by him, the rather, when he
heard that some exception was taken above against
him as being uncapable of that place,<note place="margin">He refused New College</note> because he was
not a <hi>Winchester</hi> Schollar. The truth is (as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to some of his Friends) he rather desired a little,
than a great College, being one who was very much
addicted to privacy, and his Book, which made him
often say, <hi>That if</hi> Trinity College <hi>were a competency
without the Parsonage, he would not leave it for any
place, except it were an Hospital:</hi> So much had he
seen into the vanity, and troublesomenesse of the
world.</p>
                  <p>In his latter dayes journies began to be tedious to
him, which occasioned some well affected Citizens in
<hi>Oxford</hi> (who were moved thereunto by a Sermon
which. Dr. <hi>Cheynell</hi> preached unto them) to make some
overtures to him of reading a <hi>Catechisme</hi> Lecture,<note place="margin">He is chosen to preach a Lectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> or
of preaching upon the Principles of Religion (which
liked him best) in one of their Churches; in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
whereof, they would maintain him an assistant at
his Parsonage. The motion was good, the exercise need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
the onely question was, how such a work would be
accepted in such a place amongst the Wits, and Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of the University; yet because he had bemoaned
himself to God in private, bewayling that his comfort
was little in the place where he preached, and made it
his humble sute that God would not lay him aside,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:62956:158"/>
but finde some imployment for him, whilst he had
ability to perform it, because (I say) he had prayed
thus, and this motion presently ensued, he durst not
reject it, but set upon the work, wherein the Lord
assisted, giving him strength even beyond what could
be expected from a man of his age, and caused his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to finde great acceptance with his Auditors;
and thus he continued preaching once every <hi>Sabbath</hi>
at his Parsonage, and once in the week this Lecture:
besides which he preached when his turn came in the
University, and that both in <hi>English,</hi> and in <hi>Latine</hi>
also. Yet we are not come to the end of his labours;
for having now freed himself from worldly affairs,
disposed of all his children, and having left himself
nothing else to do, but to prepare himself, and his
wife for their graves, who had lived about fifty years
together, it pleased God to exercise him in this strange
manner.</p>
                  <p>His wife,<note place="margin">His wives sore temptations.</note> who was born of Parents eminently pious,
had been religiously educated, and her self a constant
worshipper of God all her time, who seldome rose
from her prayers with dry eyes, was delivered up by
God to Satans buffetings, and to such hellish tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and horrors of minde, as struck a grief and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
unto all the spectators, which occasioned him
often to say, <hi>That God made appear to all beholders,
that the best man is no more than the Lord makes him
hourly.</hi> For as the receiving of Grace, so the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
using the comfort and enjoyment of it, is all
from him, which is not onely true in supernatural
Graces, but in the gifts of Nature also; our wits,
senses, phantasies, all are in Gods hand; nor are the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:62956:158"/>
wisest men any thing longer than he pleases to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
them so.</p>
                  <p>This good woman was a sad instance of all this,
whose temptations were so violent, so horrid, and
withall so subtil, that they put the ablest, and most
experienced men to their wits end to answer them,
and her poor self even beyond her self: whilst she
was in this perplexed condition, sundry eminent
Preachers and Professors visited her, and her husband
(who had been a happy instrument of satisfying many
others) could give her no satisfaction. One day as she
was complaining that she could finde no comfort, O
(saith he) <hi>What an Idol do some make of comfort, as if
their comfort were their Christ!</hi>
                  </p>

these comforts and mercies, 1. That she was kept
from blaspheming the Highest (for so she stiled God)
and from hurting her self, and others. 2. That this
affliction awakened him and his children; for they
esteemed her the most conscientious and innocent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them all. 3. It put him upon more work
than his age could well bear, that so he might call out
his thoughts upon business, and not eat up his own
heart with grief and care. And lastly, it wrought in
him an holy despair of all creature-comforts; for now
he could neither enjoy childe, nor friend, nor food, nor
sleep, having her continually before him in his eye,
ear, and heart; and all friends fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

lest they should wound themselves, or trouble her;
onely continual p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ayers were offered up for her upon
all occasions, which gave hopes that the Lord might
yet make her end comfortable, and conquest glorious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:62956:159"/>
However (her Husband would often say) <hi>That the
difference was not great whether comfort came at death,
or an hour after, since comfort would come assuredly.</hi> But
leaving her under a general expectation of a blessed
issue in the best time, we return once more to her
Husband now ready to enter into his Haven of
rest.</p>
                  <p>After a long and laborious life, which could not but
be painful to him that underwent it, we come at length
to his last, long, and painful sickness, which is the usual
Harbinger of Death.</p>
                  <p>In the Summer he began to droop, and finding his
decay,<note place="margin">His last Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> he sent for two <hi>Physitians</hi> [Dr. <hi>Bathurst,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Willis]</hi> who were well known to him and his, by
former experiences, and eminently known in the
University; to whom he professed, that he used means
meerly in obedience to God, but for his own part he
<hi>could live, and durst dye.</hi> His <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hysitians</hi> (as himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed)
had proceeded so far as Art and Learning could
carry them, but herein they would lose of their worth,
that they had to deal with complicated diseases, which
were seldome removed, but most of all with old age,
a disease which was never cured. His first encounter
was with a vehement <hi>Pleu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itical</hi> pain in his left side,
which was attended with a Feavor, as also with a
great defluxion of Rheume, and oppression of his
lungs with Flegme, and when after divers weeks all
these his Assailants seemed well-nigh vanquished
through the tender care of his skilful <hi>Physitians,</hi> yet
then that enemy which had so long lodged in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
brake forth into an <hi>Empyema,</hi> which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorated
daily in so great a measure, for the space
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:62956:159"/>
of two moneths or more, that hereby (together with
some fits of his old diseases, the <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Strangury)</hi>
he was not able to speak much to those that visited
him.</p>
                  <p>And herein indeed it fell out according to what he
had often foretold in his best strength, <hi>viz. That little
was to be expected from him on his death-bed,</hi> which
occasioned him to write (fearing that his tongue might
not then be able to utter it) his advice and counsel to
his Family many years before his death. The truth is,
he the rather forbore to speak, because he perceived
that some had a design to make his speeches publick,
which he was utterly averse to, neither would he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
that any thing of his Life or Death should be
written:<note place="margin">His Humility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> Nay, he could never be perswaded at any
time to fit, that his Picture might be drawn; so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
he was that all of him might be buried with
him. And albeit he spit up those Lungs which he had
wasted in the Pulpit, yet could not that light of Grace
be so smothered under a Bushel, but that oft-times
the beams thereof would shine forth, and himself
would breathe forth himself in pithy speeches, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
discourses.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of his sickness, being desired to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of company, he answered, <hi>I am alone in company,
its all one to me to be left alone, or to have Friends with
me; my work is now to arm my self for Death which
assaults me, and I apply my self (as I am able) for that
great encounter.</hi> And accordingly he spent his whole
time in meditation, prayer, and reading the holy
Scriptures, especially the Book of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
of <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

delight in the 10, 14, 15, 16, and 17, Chapters
of that Evangelist.</p>
                  <p>After which time his nights were long, and sleeps
short;<note place="margin">How he spent his time.</note> and when he could neither sleep nor sit up in his
bed to read, his manner was to command others to
read to him, and then himself would collect the most
useful things that were contained in the Chapter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
such things as were difficult, and sweetly
feeding upon the rest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His constant practice was,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His counsel to his friends.</note> 
                     <hi>to exhort such as either

shall be glorious; onely forget not to call in the help of
your General: Do all from him, and under him.</p>
                  <p>On the Lords dayes he would not hinder any from
the publick Ordinances for any thing that was to be
done about him,<note place="margin">His strict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Sabbath.</note> till Sermons were ended, and then he
would say, <hi>Come, what have you for me?</hi> (meaning
something of Repetition) unto which he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with such diligence, as that he would summe up
the heads of every Sermon, and say, <hi>O what excellent
truths are these! lay them up charily, you will have need
of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When Friends came to visit him, he used to say,</hi>
I cannot speak, but I can hear: <hi>And when he was
asked where his comfort lay? His answer was,</hi> In
Christ, and in the free Grace of God: <hi>One telling him,
Sir, you may take much comfort in your labours, you
have done much good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>His answer was,</hi> All is
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:62956:160"/>
nothing without a Saviour, without him my best works
would condemn me. Oh, I am ashamed of them, being
mixed with so much sin! Oh, I am an unprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
I have not done any thing for God as I ought; loss
of time sits heavy upon my spirit.<note place="margin">His divine speeches.</note> Work, work apace; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
your selves, nothing will more trouble you when you
come to dye, than that you have done no more for God
who hath done so much for you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sometimes he used thus to breathe out himself,</hi> I
never in all my life saw the worth of a Christ, nor tasted
the sweetness of Gods love in that measure as now I do.
<hi>When he was asked what should be done for him?
His answer was,</hi> Do not onely pray for me, but praise
God, for his unspeakable mercy unto me, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
that he hath kept Satan from me in this my
weakness. Oh how good is God, entertain good thoughts
of him. How ever it be with us, we cannot think too
well of him, or too bad of our selves.</p>
                  <p>And this sense of Gods goodness was very deeply
imprinted upon his heart to his very last; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in all his <hi>Wills,</hi> this Legacy was alwayes renewed,
<hi>Item, I bequeathe to all my children, and to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
children, to each of them a Bible, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi>
None but Christ. Being upon a time visited
by two Reverend Doctors, his choice Friends, who
before they prayed with him, desired him to tell them
what he chiefly requested? He answered, <hi>I praise God
he supports me, and keeps off Satan; beg that I may
hold out: I am now in a good way home, even quite
spent: I am now at the shore, I leave you tossing on the
Sea. Oh, it is a good time to dye in:</hi> Yet when his end
approached nearer, being often asked how he did? He
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:62956:161"/>
                     <hi>answered,</hi> In no great pain (I praise God) onely weary of
my unuseful life. If God hath no more service for me to
do here, I could be gladly in Heaven, where I shall serve
him better, freed from sin and distractions. I pass from
one death to another, yet I fear none; I praise God I can
live, and I dare dye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If God hath more work for me to do
here, I am willing to do it, though my infirm body be
very weary.</p>
                  <p>Desiring one to pray with him, and for him, that
God would hasten the work; it was asked whether
pain, &amp;c. put him upon that desire? He answered
<hi>No, but I now do no good, and I hinder others which
might be better imployed, if I were not: Why should any
desire to live but to do God service? Now I cease from
that, I do not live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this time the violence of his distempers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
him, and the advice of his <hi>Physitians</hi> was, that
he should forbear speech, yet he called upon those
which attended him to read some part of the Scriptures
to him constantly, especially he put one of his Sons
that was with him, to pray frequently, and whilst his
life and speech lasted, he used to conclude all the
Prayers with a loud <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The nearer he approached to his end, the more he
slumbered. Once when he awoke, he found himself
very ill, whereupon calling for his Son, he took him
by the hand, and said, <hi>Pray with me, it is the last time
in likelihood that I shall ever joyn with you;</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
to him of his wearisomeness, his Son answered,
There remains a rest: To whom he replied, <hi>My</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
<hi>is not far off, and yours is at hand, ere that, I shall
be rid of all my trouble, and you will be eased of some.</hi>
                  </p>

At length his ruinous house (which onely inobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the will of God had held out beyond his own
desires, and all mens expectations, from the heighth
of Summer till the depth of Winter) comes to be
dissolved. About <hi>Saturday</hi> in the even, he began to
set himself to dye, forbidding all cordials to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
upon what extremity soever, and gave
his dying blessing to his Son (who onely of all his
children was present with him) and (upon his request)
enjoyned him to signifie, when he had opportunity, to
that Country, where he had lived longest, <hi>that he lived
and dyed in that Faith which he had preached and printed,
the comfort whereof he now found.</hi> Something else he
began to speak, but his distempers interrupted his
purpose, and from that time he never entertained any
discourse with man, onely he commanded the eight
Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> to be read to
him. And herein God was exceeding good to him in
the return of those Petitions which had been put up
for him that afternoon, by those two eminent Divines,
and his dearest Brethren before mentioned: For
whereas his great distempers gave occasion to fear
his death would be exceeding painful, yet did it prove
so easie, that his Son, and other attendants could but
guess at the particular time of his departure: His
breathings were easie, and even, his eyes open, and full
of water, till at the last (having lifted them up towards
Heaven) they closed of themselves, and his soul,
without the least motion of resistance of the body,
entred into everlasting rest,<note place="margin">His death.</note> whilst those whom he
left behinde were entring upon the day of their rest.
For then began he a perpetual <hi>Sabbath</hi> in Heaven,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:62956:162"/>
when they began theirs on earth, betwixt twelve and
one on <hi>Saturday</hi> night, <hi>December 11. Anno Christi
1658.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He dyed in a good old age, and full of dayes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
overlived fourscore years: His loss was much
bewayled by the College, by the City, and whole
University of <hi>Oxford.</hi> He was (as all that knew him
confessed) a man of admirable prudence, profound
judgement, eminent gifts and graces, and furnished
with all qualifications that might render him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
man, a wise Governour, a profitable Preacher,
and a good Christian.</p>
                  <p>First, look upon him as a Christian, for that was
his, and is every mans greatest Ornament. He was a
man that had much acquaintance with God, much
communion with him in private meditation and
prayer, accounting those his best dayes wherein he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
most converse with him.</p>
                  <p>In the time of his sickness, one asking him how he
did? <hi>oh</hi> (saith he) <hi>this hath been a sweet day, I have had
sweet communion with God in Jesus Christ.</hi> He was
not like them who are all for promises and priviledges,
though in the mean time they neglect duties: He
made them his exercise, but not his Christ: He was
much in those severe parts of Religion, as private
Humiliation, Mortification, and Self-denial, whereby
he gained the conquest over himself. The truth is, he
was (as far as is consistent with humane frailty) Master
of his corruptions, passions, reason, appetite, language,
and all.</p>
                  <p>The Lord was pleased to work upon him in the
Primrose of his life,<note place="margin">His timely Conversion.</note> though he certainly knew not,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:62956:162"/>
either the Preacher or Sermon whereby he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
His course was in the dayes of his strictest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
to set down in writing his evidences for
Heaven, sometimes in Propositions from Scripture;
other sometimes in <hi>Sylogismes,</hi> and these he often sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to in a Book that he kept for that very purpose.
But these evidences were best read by others in the
course of his life, by his exact walking with God in
piety, charity, humility, patience, and dependance
upon him. He was far unlike to those who sit in <hi>Moses</hi>
Chair, and teach what themselves practise not. He
had well digested that Fathers precept to Preachers,
<hi>Either preach not at all, or live as you preach.</hi> His life
was a Commentary upon his Doctrine, and his practice
the Counterpane of his Sermons. What was said of
that precious Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> was true of him, <hi>That he
adorned a heavenly Doctrine, with a heavenly life.</hi> In a
word, he did <hi>vertere verba in opera,</hi> he lived Religion,
whilst many onely make it the subject of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
He was much more than he seemed to be, not
loving to make a noise in the world, but accounting it
better to do, than to speak.</p>
                  <p>In his works of charity to the poor, he was no less
discreet,<note place="margin">His Charity.</note> than private. When he met with fit objects,
his hand was more ready to give, than his tongue to
proclaim it. Indeed he was no friend to idle, lazy,
canting persons who live on the sweat of other mens
brows. These he looked upon as the Pests of the
Commonwealth, nor could he think it charity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
such to the prejudice of the publick, and to their
own destruction. But Gods poor, and the <hi>Houshold of
Faith</hi> lay neer his heart. Whosoever shall survey his
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:62956:163"/>
large Bills of weekly, and quarterly allowances (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides)
considerable summes given to poor Ministers,
and especialiy to their Widows, and Orphans, who
never knew whence it came) and shall adde thereunto
his Legacies bequeathed in his <hi>Will</hi> to charitable uses,
cannot (what ever others thought of him) but judge
that his charity exceeded the ordinary proportion of
his revenues. Naturally he was of a stout and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
temper, yet through Grace, he attained to a
great measure of humility: He was mean, and low
in his own eyes,<note place="margin">His Humility.</note> and had more undervaluing thoughts
of himself, than all the world besides had of him. He
was very sensible of that enemy, which he often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of, <hi>viz.</hi> Discouragement, which he used to stile,
<hi>The childe of Pride and Unbelief.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His pithy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>p eches.</note> It must needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
a great measure of humility that could
keep a man lowly under such abilities, attainments, and
such general applauses as he met with in every place.
His usual saying was, <hi>that he valued no man for his
gifts, but for his humility under them: Neither should
he expect much from any man, were his parts never so
great, till he was broken with Afflictions and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was his observation, <hi>that the humblest Preachers
converted most souls, not the choisest Schollars, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ilst
unbroken.</hi> He would sometimes use this speech, which
though a seeming contradiction, yet hath it much
truth in it, <hi>It is better to be an humble Devil, than a
proud Angel.</hi> He never affected popular applause,
variety of Pulpits, Printing, &amp;c. as one conscious to
himself of, I know not what unworthiness; neither
ever came he thus abroad, but when by importunity he
was haled to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:62956:163"/>
2. Consider him as a man in his Morals, whether
in the Government of himself in particular, or of his
Family, or his greater trusts, and in all you shall finde
him like himself, excellent, and almost without a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</p>
                  <p>In regard of himself,<note place="margin">His Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> he was exactly temperate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
himself to hours for diet, sleep, &amp;c. He would
often say, <hi>That he would rather pour liquor into his
Boots, than into his mouth between meals.</hi> He was a
strict observer of those Laws of Sobriety, which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> had pressed upon Ministers, and which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his <hi>Drunkards Cup</hi> had taught others. He used
to eat seasonably and sparingly, which (without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion)
was one great means of preserving such vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
spirits to so great an age: His onely play time
was <hi>Saturdayes</hi> in the afternoon, then he used to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend,
and disburden himself by some innocent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
but onely <hi>ad Ruborem.</hi> He was a man of an
excellent deportment, and sweet behaviour, whereby
he won much upon all with whom he conversed.
Grave he was without affectation, pleasant without
levity: Indeed he never loved to hear himself talk,
and therefore by some was judged too reserved; but
when he knew with whom he had to do, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative
enough. No man was more candid, or
fuller of civility; none more open or free to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or return discourses. He was very cautious before
he struck a league of intimate friendship with any man;
but when he had once chosen, he was cordial, firm,
and constant, his head, hand, tongue, pen, feet, purse,
all, were now no longer his own but his friends. It is
said of the <hi>French,</hi> that <hi>whatsoever cloaths they wear,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:62956:164"/>
whatsoever Garb they accost you in, becomes them so well,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mr. R. M.</note>
                     <hi>as if nothing else did;</hi> and a great <hi>Critick</hi> in men as
well as in Books, used to say of our doctor, that
<hi>whatsoever he did or spake became him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was a rare thing to see him angry.<note place="margin">His Patience.</note> If at any time
the folly of others had discomposed him, or their
sin had provoked him, yet could he quickly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
himself, and convert his passion into wholesome
instruction.</p>
                  <p>Though himself had great parts, both natural, and
acquired, yet would he never sleight or undervalue,
much less contemn, or discourage any whom he judged
to be right in the main. He was very sparing in his
censures of others, gentle to all, and severe onely to
himself.</p>
                  <p>He had a special gift of forgetting injuries, but
would offer none. His memory was never more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
than in retaining civilities received, to which he
would industriously make what proportionable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
lay in his power. He much feared lest he should
give any occasion of suspicion that he either forgot, or
neglected any, because he could not readily recall mens
names, which occasioned him to say, <hi>That if he lived
long he should forget his own name, with him in</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius.</p>
                  <p>At meals his manner was to be sociable, and face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious;
yet still he took occasion to enquire of the
Publick, and how it feared with particular Towns and
Families, whence he would alwayes extract some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for matter of Prayer or Prayer or Praise in his Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
after meat.</p>
                  <p>In his Family he had that qualification of a good
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:62956:164"/>
Bishop mentioned by the Apostle, <hi>that ruled well his
own house.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Family Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> He had an excellent method in the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Children, which was this:</p>
                  <p>In general, his care was to maintain his authority
over them, yet even that authority was equally tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
with lenity and gravity. He loved them without
fondness, and ruled them without rigour. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
so soon as they could use their tongues, they were
made acquainted with the Historical part of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
As soon as they could use their legs, they were
set to School, and when they could remember any
thing of a Chapter read, or bring home any part of a
Sermon, his care was to instruct them in the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of Religion. Their childehood being past, he
would call upon them for the practice of Religion, and
was a diligent observer of their private performance
of Religious exercises, wherein their Mother was no
small help to him.</p>
                  <p>When they grew up to more maturity, he diligently
observed their capacities, inclinations, but especially
their constitutions, when he could guess at that sin
which was like to prove their <hi>dilectum delictum,</hi> their
darling corruption, he accordingly suited their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
so as that sin might be least nourished, and most
beaten down. The rule which he gave them was this,
<hi>When you are youths chuse your Callings;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His advice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> his children</note> 
                     <hi>when men chuse
your wives, only take me along with you: It may be, old men
may see further than you.</hi> Thus whilst he condescended
to them, and they submitted to him, both parties
were gratified.</p>
                  <p>Though he had a numerous issue, yet (through
Gods blessing upon his estate) he disposed of them
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:62956:165"/>
to no mean imployments. Many he sent to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities;
some to Merchandise, &amp;c. To his Sons
whom he bred in the University his Rule was, <hi>Study
work, more than wages:</hi> To those whom he bred in
the City, he would say, <hi>Do not waste a halfpenny, and
you will not want a penny.</hi> And truly so well did they
all improve, as his advice, so their own time and parts,
that they became Masters of their particular Callings,
which ministred unto him no small comfort. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
it a great mercy to his dying day, that
none of his children were blemished, either in their
bodies, or in their reputations. He was one of them
in whose children that <hi>Popish</hi> slander concerning the
ungraciousness of the children of the married Clergy,
received a real confutation.</p>
                  <p>Many of his Sons he buried in their prime,<note place="margin">Gods blessing upon his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> some
at home, others in forreign parts, and some dyed
shortly after himself, yet all of them gave comfortable
hopes to conclude upon a rational charity (both by the
pious Letters of those which dyed abroad, and from
that particular account which they gave of themselves
who dyed at home) that they all meet in Heaven; they
which survive need not this attestation. Amongst the
dead, there was Mr. <hi>Tho. Harris</hi> of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who was eminently learned beyond his age,
an Ornament to that Noble Foundation, whereof he
was a member; once the joy of his friends, and still
their sorrow; and probably this arrow from Gods
hand stuck deep in the Fathers heart to his dying
day.</p>
                  <p>For his servants,<note place="margin">His servants Gods servants.</note> there are some yet living that
served him in his younger dayes, who still bless God
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:62956:165"/>
that ever they came under his roof, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the beginnings of Grace, and such a measure
of knowledge as kept them from warping in the late
giddy times.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he remained with his antient Flock,<note place="margin">His good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the College.</note> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
manner was to keep a Religious Fast before his
administration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.
And after he came to his small College, he so prudently
managed all his affairs, that he was both feared, and
loved. Indeed his government there was such as
caused a wonder: For whereas that College before,
was famous for factions, during his time there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any complaint made to any Visitors; and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
for the Foundation there, honoured him as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and he looked upon, and loved them as his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and accordingly he scaled up his love to them in
his last <hi>Will and Testament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He called Gifts, Bribery, and hated the very sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of it. Examples are known in the College of
Gratuities refused long after faire, and free Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>But look upon him as a Schollar,<note place="margin">His great Learning.</note> and there we have
him in his proper Element. Though he left the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
early, and preached constantly, yet being of a
retired disposition, a constant student, and endowed
with great parts, he became Master of all manner
of Learning to qualifie a Divine. In the sacred
Languages, especially in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> he was very
exact.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Conciones ad Clerum,</hi> declare him to have been a
pure and Polite <hi>Latinist:</hi> His first, which was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and printed long since, hath undergone the test,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:62956:166"/>
and gained the approbation of all knowing men in that
Language; the younger by full forty years, is of as good
a complexion, and of as vigorous a constitution as its
elder brother; and its hoped that in due time it may be
made as publick.</p>
                  <p>What his abilities in Disputation were,<note place="margin">A good Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant.</note> hath upon
several occasions been made to appear in that College
Exercises in the Chappel, where oft-times in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
absence of the Opponents, himself would
<hi>ex tempore</hi> take up the Cudgels, and make good their
ground. In which Exercises he approved himself a
subtle, clear, and ready Disputant, without any grains
of allowance either for his age or discontinuance.</p>
                  <p>Indeed his chiefest Learning lay where he made
least shew of it in publick, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Chronology,</hi> Church-History,
Councils, Case-Divinity, and his insight into
the Fathers.<note place="margin">His fervent Prayers.</note> But his parts were best seen in the pulpit.
His gifts in Prayer were much more than ordinary,
wherein his affections were warm, and fervent, his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
pithy and substantial, his language pertinent,
unaffected, and without <hi>Tautologies.</hi> Oh, how would
he raise up a dull and sinking spirit! How would he
warm a cold and frozen heart! How would he carry
a man out of himself, and by degrees mount the soul
heaven-ward!</p>
                  <p>His Sermons in Print are well known to the world,<note place="margin">An excellent Preacher.</note>
and <hi>his works praise him in the Gates.</hi> The particular
excellencies of <hi>Nazianzen, Basil, Chrysostome, Austin,
Ambrose, Bernard</hi> seemed all to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enter in him. He
taught <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to speak in our Mother-tongue, and
(without falshood, or flattery) he may be stiled, <hi>The
English Orator.</hi> His Doctrines carried light with them,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62956:166"/>
and his Uses heat: His Reproofes were weighty, and
his Exhortations powerful. But enough of this, lest
we hear as he did who spake much in commendation
of <hi>Hercules, Quis unquam vituperavit?</hi> who ever
dispraised him? yea, what either Christian or Schollar,
but approved, or commended him? If you would
know the worth of his Sermons, read them (though
read they come short of what they were when
preached) yea read them again and again, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to read them with the same spirit they were
preached, and you cannot but acknowledge an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in them.</p>
                  <p>Amongst other his excellencies in preaching, which
were many, these were not the least, that he could so
cook his meat that he could make it relish to every
pallate: He could dress a plain discourse, so as that all
sorts should be delighted with it. He could preach with
a learned plaineness, and had learned to conceal his Art.
He had clear Notions of high Mysteries, and proper
language to make them stoop to the meanest ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
                  <p>His way in contriving and penning his Sermons
was this:<note place="margin">His method in preaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. He so contrived the parts of his Text, and points
of Doctrine, as might afford him most scope in his
Application, wherein his, and indeed, a Sermons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
doth consist; and therefore he used to say,
<hi>That in a Sermon he contrived the Uses first:</hi> He did
often handle the same Texts, and the same Points,
and yet still would pen new Applications which might
be most suitable to the quallity and condition of the
Auditory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:62956:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. In penning, when he once began, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
take Pen from paper, nor turn to any Book till he
had written all. All his younger dayes, for about
twenty years together, he wro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght all, and could
without much difficulty preach the same <hi>verbatim.</hi> He
was wont to say, <hi>That he had a fluid, and waterish memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
I can</hi> (said he) <hi>quickly remember any thing of my own,
and as quickly f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rget it again.</hi> Yet questionless his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
was vast and tenacious; for though sometimes he
had but short Notes in his Bible, and that but seldome,
yet did he never use them, except when he preached
a <hi>Clerum</hi> of late years, in which he sometimes glanced
upon his Papers. His custome was, presently after he
had heard a Sermon, to write down the heads thereof,
and he scarce either forgat, or misplaced any of them.
Upon Fast-nights he would by the strength of his
memory repeat two,<note place="margin">His strong Memory.</note> sometimes three Sermons that
he had heard that day, in the same order as they were
delivered.</p>
                  <p>Speaking with a Friend about Memories,<note place="margin">His pithy speeches.</note> he said,
<hi>That his Memory never failed him: For</hi> (said he) <hi>I durst
never trust it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He used to say, that a Preacher had three Books to
study, 1. The Bible. 2. Himself. 3. The People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He looked much to the Ordinance, and Relation
between Pastor, and People, and would say,</hi> That
preaching to them was but one part of the Pastors
Duty. He was to live and dye in them, as well as for,
and with them.</p>
                  <p>He complained much of some mens too large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
upon the Doctrinal parts of their Points, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they left little or no room for Application; and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:62956:167"/>
found that few, either in the Cities or Universities
bended themselves to enlarge upon their Uses,<note place="margin">What Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are best.</note> which
made their Sermons to differ little from Divinity-Lectures;
and though all Preachers could not enlarge
themselves therein, yet he would often call upon
them to accustome themselves to it as being most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.
He would relate a passage of Mr. <hi>Dods</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> (who often in his dayes
preached occasionally at <hi>Hanwell) Me thoughts</hi> (said
Mr. <hi>Dod) when I heard the Doctrinal part of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
I was in heaven: but when he came to apply it, I
sometimes thought that if I had been in his place, I could
presently have applied his Point more closely. Non
omnia possumus omnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many young Preachers resorted to Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> for
counsel,<note place="margin">His advice to young Preac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> both for direction in their private studies, and
in their Sermons; and he used to perswade them for
many reasons to pen largely, and to keep their Notes
for all emergent occasions, often commending Mr.
<hi>Dods</hi> words, who professed, <hi>That he would rather
preach an old Sermon ten times, than speak any thing
new without preparation.</hi> Hee would say, that
he would have a Preacher to exceed himselfe upon
just occasion, and not alwayes to keep the same
pace, yet did not that alwayes hold in his own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
for generally his hearers commended those Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
most which cost him least, and himself would
say, <hi>That he never came off with less comfort, and worse
content to himself, than when he was in appearance best
provided:</hi> and he gave this reason for it, <hi>Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had used such diligence in preparing (for that
was his duty) but because he was then aptest to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:62956:168"/>
upon himself, and to neglect his dependance upon
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many sought to him for advice in choosing Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
Books,<note place="margin">His advice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Books.</note> to whom he would open himself freely.
Some he perswaded to read <hi>Ames</hi> his <hi>Medulla, Tileni
Syntagma, Bucanus,</hi> and such like. To some others,
he would commeend <hi>Aquinas</hi> his <hi>Summes</hi> (which Dr.
<hi>John Reynolds</hi> used to call <hi>That absolute Body of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity)
Melcheor Canus,</hi> and of late, Mr. <hi>Bowles</hi> his
<hi>Pastor Evangelicus.</hi> But above all, he would call upon
every one to read the Text in the Originals, and to
<hi>Analyse</hi> Chapters. This he perswaded Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> to,
and set him to practice it in the Book of the Preacher,
or <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> (which he accounted a very hard Book,
till he met with that brief, but pithy Exposition, of
that incomparable Divine, Dr. <hi>Edw. Reynolds)</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that upon <hi>Zachary.</hi> When any consulted with him
about Writers, he would ask what they aimed at in a
Writer, for several men had their several excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
For acuteness he used to commend Mr. <hi>Baines,</hi>
and his second, Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Capel,</hi> &amp;c.
If they aimed at the spiritual part of Divinity, he
would leave them to Dr. <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Preston:</hi> If the Historical, to Bishop <hi>Usher.</hi> For solid
Preachers, he much prized Dr. <hi>Sandersons</hi> first Works
(to his later he was a meer stranger) Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Hildersam,</hi> Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> &amp;c. And for all the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites
for a Preacher, both for method, matter, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
pronunciation, all, he would often say, that he
seldome met with an abler man than his Brother
<hi>Whateley</hi> of <hi>Banbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When his judgment was asked about <hi>Commentators,</hi>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:62956:168"/>
he used to answer, that he was now more of Dr. <hi>Jo.
Reynolds</hi> his minde than ever concerning Mr. <hi>Calvin;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His judgement of Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                     </note>
for <hi>upon experience</hi> (said he) <hi>I finde that the most of the
late Writers do but descant upon his plain Song;</hi> and
the <hi>Jesuits</hi> are very <hi>Plagiaries,</hi> who first rob him, and
then rail upon him.</p>
                  <p>Next to <hi>Calvin</hi> he used to commend sundry late
Writers,<note place="margin">And of other Writers.</note> as <hi>Pareus, Rivet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> especially,
together with some <hi>Popish</hi> Writers, as <hi>Maldonate</hi>
(whose wit, and learning he preferred before his spirit)
before him, Learned <hi>Masius,</hi> modest <hi>Ribera,</hi> and (for
ought he found by him) honest <hi>Estius.</hi> And being
asked about the best Editions, his answer was, that
what was said of <hi>Homer,</hi> was true of the Fathers, and
the first Popish Writers, <hi>viz. That was ever the best
which was least corrected.</hi> Of the Antient Fathers he
would say, <hi>That unless it were for their Polemical and
Historical parts, their Writings were more for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
and Affection, than for their judgement and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About modern Authors this was his opinion ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally;
that what <hi>English</hi> men did <hi>ex professo</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
they did best perform it. No men excel them
in expounding Scriptures, in answering <hi>Papists, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi>
&amp;c. None equal to them in the Pulpit, or in
Practical, or Case-Divinity. And he held <hi>Cambridge</hi>
very happy in her <hi>Whitakers, Downams, Davnant,
Perkins,</hi> besides many others. And for <hi>Oxford,</hi> he
would lay one <hi>Jo. Reynolds</hi> (to pass in silence a younger
<hi>Reynolds,</hi> and his son in Law, born a Schoolman) in
the ballance with hundreds, as a man never sufficiently
admired for his Humility, as well as for his Learning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:62956:169"/>
For the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> he liked many things in them,
but not their aukward, and ignorant quoting of
Scripture, nor their multiplying of useless questions,
with needless obscurities.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Lutherans,</hi> he commended divers of them for
their learning and industry, but disliked their tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Arminius</hi> (though he were none of the best)
yet he liked him better than his Disciples and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
who were more desperate and dangerous in the
five controverted Points, than many of the <hi>Papists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Socinianisme,</hi> he accounted it to be but a
kinde of blancht <hi>Mahometisme.</hi> And this he observed
in general, that those <hi>Papists</hi> who were most conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in the Scriptures, come nearest to us; the like
he said of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as <hi>Chemnitius, Gerard, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingius,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He was sparing to deliver his judgement about our
condition at home,<note place="margin">His judgement of our times.</note> yet some things lay sadly upon his
spirit; as,</p>
                  <p>1. He complained that the power of Godliness,
and exercise of Love, and Self-denial, were much
abated in these later dayes; and he much bewayled the
vast difference, both in garb and practice, betwixt new,
and old Professors.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Indulgence that was shewed to tender
Consciences, was much abused to prophaneness, whilst
men of no conscience most pleaded that liberty of
choosing their own Churches, and Teachers; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
on the matter abandoned all.</p>
                  <p>3. That the liberty of Prophesying which some
pretended to, was abused to meer licentiousness and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:62956:169"/>
confusion, whilst some would have none, and others
all Prophets and Preachers.</p>
                  <p>4. That in the University few could be called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Students, but the most made a short work of it,
and posted into the Pulpit before they understood their
grounds, so that few were able to encounter our grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Errours.</p>
                  <p>5. That in the Church men were in their extreams,
some pressing nothing but Law, others preaching no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Gospel, and Christ.</p>
                  <p>6. He complained of the want of <hi>Catechizing,</hi> and
instructing youth in the Principles, the want of which,
he saw by experience was a great occasion of the
peoples giddiness.</p>
                  <p>7. But most of all he bewayled the readiness of
many to side, and make divisions. He loved not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to use, or to hear used, dividing names, and titles;
upon which occasion he often related Mr. <hi>Greenhams</hi>
answer to the Lord Treasurer <hi>Cecil,</hi> who being asked
on which side the blame lay in that great rent between
the Bishops, and their <hi>Antagonists,</hi> answered, <hi>That the
fault was on both sides, and in neither side: For</hi> (said he)
<hi>the godly wise on both sides bear with each other, and
concenter in the main; but then there be sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> peevish
spirits, on both sides some, and these be they that make the
quarrel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This he applied to our times by reason of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>and</hi> Independents, saying,
Men of humble, and sincere hearts, though differing in
opinion, can, and do walk together, pray togther, and
love one another; but men who wholly look a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> their own
interests, blow the coals, and make a stir, as if the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:62956:170"/>
were irreconcileable, and as every one was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to Christs cause that goes not their pace and
path.</p>
                  <p>He professed freely, that for his own part he was
not convinced of some things that were earnestly
pressed about Church Government: He did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceive
any one external form to be so essential to a
Church, but that it might still deserve that name,
though under a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Independent,</hi> or <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi>
form, so long as it was kept within the bounds
of those general Rules laid down in the Scriptures.
Its true, some of these had been abused to Tyranny,
and the rest might in time be abused also; but the use
and abuse of things are far different, and he would not
commend either the one, or the other in their rigid
exactions in some cases.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Presbytery,</hi> though he thought that Bishop
<hi>Bilson</hi> could never (with all his learning) disprove the
being of <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> in the Apostles times, yet he
thought withall, that it was not so easie a thing to
prove the perpetuity of such an Ordinance to the
worlds end, especially so cloathed and attended with
all those perquesites which some heretofore called
for. He thought that there was some reason in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of <hi>Jure Human<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>,</hi> what
ever his application was who first used it: But for the
thing it self, sith it is not altogether disproved, but
allowed, yea once commanded, and not since retracted
(for ought he knew) he saw no reason why any man
should, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> be aspersed, because a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi>
by any dissenting Brethren.</p>
                  <p>For the to her of <hi>Independency,</hi> he confessed that it
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:62956:170"/>
was a Politick way, and free from much trouble, and
opposition:<note place="margin">About Ind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> For who shall oppose the Minister, when
all are of his minde before they are admitted? yet
could he never satisfie himself (though upon occasion
he often desired it) in some particulars; As,</p>
                  <p>1. What warrant men have to take out of anothers
Flock his best sheep, and to entertain them without
his consent, or testimony. He asks whether any man
would willingly be so served? whether this would
not open a gap, that so soon as a member is offended
with his own Pastor (happily upon deserved reproof)
presently to flye to another Congregation.</p>
                  <p>2. To leave the cullen sheep in a hard condition:
For how shall they be looked upon? the answer must
needs be, little better than Heathens: For the Minister
may preach to such, and what more may he do to these,
when the chief are gone?</p>
                  <p>3. This way seemed to him to be very destructive
to that relation between Pastor and People.</p>
                  <p>4. He conceived this way of gathering of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
into private places, and companies, to be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to the publick worship of God: Experience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
that in many places of late, the publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
are grown into disuse, preaching onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,

                  <p>5. Lastly, For Congregations to consist of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

whereby inspection cannot be performed on the
Pastors part, and on the Peoples part, they can enjoy
little communion and edification one from another;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:62956:171"/>
this he used to say, that he did not understand, nor
could he finde any precept for it in the Word, nor any
president or practice of it in Antiquity, if we speak of
Churches constituted, and out of persecution, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp;c. These things he neither wrote, nor spake
but with much fear, and grief.</p>
                  <p>Amongst other things, he did very much bewayl
the great sleighting of solemn Ordination of Ministers,<note place="margin">About Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note>
the Office being so sacred, the work of the Ministry
so important, and the Minister of so publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.
He wondred that when as in all other Offices
there is such solemnities at the Officers instalments,
that a Minister, and Ambassador of Jesus Christ
should be silently admitted without Fasting, Prayer,
and some publick solemnity.</p>
                  <p>As to private passages it were endless to write all
his Observations: onely take these few;</p>
                  <p>He observed that such as often changed their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and Faith professed, usually fell from <hi>Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme</hi>
to <hi>Atheisme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That so much Humility as any man had,<note place="margin">His excellent Speeches.</note> so much
grace, and worth he had, and no more.</p>
                  <p>That nothing was to be accounted good in, or to
any man, but that which was his proper fruit, and
done by vertue of his calling, from a principle of
God, and for God.</p>
                  <p>That the best man hath no security from any one
sin, or fall, or temptation, any further, or longer than
he was held up by Gods hand, and Christs Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>That God doth oftentimes leave us to own Satans
suggestions for our own, because we do not own
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:62956:171"/>
God in his holy motions, and breathings.</p>
                  <p>That its just with God to deny us the comfort of
our Graces, when we deny him the glory of them.</p>
                  <p>In himself he observed, that what he forgat in the
week, would unseasonably press in on the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> so
that he could, if he durst, contrive more worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> than he could dispatch all the
week.</p>
                  <p>That he found no greater enemy than discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which he called, <hi>The childe of pride and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He used to say, that some duties which were oft
in mens mouthes, he found very difficult to him:
As,</p>
                  <p>1. To deny himself in all his Selfs, was a work to
be learning whilst he lived.</p>
                  <p>2. To live onely by faith, and a bare promise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a pawn is a great work.</p>
                  <p>3. To give all to free Grace, and to Christ alone is
a mighty work.</p>
                  <p>4. To love where we meet with unlovingness, and
contempt, is no easie matter.</p>
                  <p>5. To do ones proper work without some present
pay, and countenance from God and man, is a hard
task.</p>
                  <p>6. That its far harder to adopt others comforts, than
their sorrows, and to hold ones self exalted in anothers
exaltation.</p>
                  <p>7. That to dye in cold blood, and to be active in
it as an act of obedience, is the work of a Christian.</p>
                  <p>In his sickness he would occasionally vent himself
thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:62956:172"/>
Its a hard thing to think ill of our selves, and well
of God at the same time.</p>
                  <p>Its a hard thing for a Saint to forgive himself some
faults, when God hath forgiven them.</p>
                  <p>Its hard to think holy thoughts long, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
them to anothers prayers.</p>
                  <p>We know but little of Christs love, till all be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
and spread before us in heaven.</p>
                  <p>For his children, he referred them to an old Will,
which he had made <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1636, when they

<hi>viz.</hi> That second Husbands are very uxorious, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:62956:172"/>
Wives very prevalent, and therefore take heed
that you do no ill office in estranging your Husband

kill in him natural affections: I have said, and do
with all the strength and power that is in me, thank

                                 <p>1. More particularly, get your pardon in Christ:
It is not impossible to get it assured to you, if you will
learn, 1. To deny your selves. 2. To live by faith.
3. To understand the nature of the New Covenant.
Settle your judgements in these Points, and the thing
is feasible.</p>

concern your places and conditions, and make head
against those sins which most threaten you: As first,
Hereditary sins. I was naturally <hi>Melancholy,</hi> that is a

I give you that advice, which I gave your Brother,
now with God; Be more than you seem: Do more
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:62956:173"/>
than you talk of in point of Religion: Satisfie your
own consciences in what you do; all men you shall
never satisfie; nay, some will not be satisfied, though
they be convinced.</p>

must fear it the more.</p>
                                 <p>The Remedies are, 1. Disclaim Hereditary sins.
2. Keep Heads clean, Feet warm, and Hearts cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

counsel, relieve, succour, help, admonish one another.

yearly. When she is dead, pitch upon some other
place, if it may be, your eldest Brothers house, or if
you cannot meet, yet send to, and hear from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Mother, be so many Fathers and Mothers each to

of <hi>Swanto,</hi> the Lords of <hi>Sueden</hi> chose
<hi>Steno Stur</hi> to be their Governor, against
whom <hi>Gustavus,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Upsal</hi> opposed himself,
loving his place, more than his Country; and being cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in his expectation, he promotes the interest of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who to set forward his claim to the
Crown of <hi>Sueden,</hi> spent one year in the pursuit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by force of Arms, but effected little. Nor did the
Archbishop of <hi>Upsal</hi> get ought in <hi>Denmark,</hi> who saw
that he played his own game, nor could he escape the
seisure of his Temporalities in <hi>Sueden</hi> for his treachery
against his native Country; whereupon the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
he obtained the <hi>Popes</hi> sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
against the Governour of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and all his
partakers, for invading the rights of his Church and
Bishoprick; and hereupon the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
takes courage to invade <hi>Sweden</hi> once more with
an Army under his General, who in a Battel over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
the <hi>Suedes,</hi> and wounded <hi>Steno</hi> their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
who thereupon retired to <hi>Stockholm</hi> (the Regal
City) and unto him repaired all such as intended to
adventure their all in the defence of their Country.
The rest of the <hi>Suedes</hi> submitted to the <hi>Danish</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:62956:178"/>
who encouraged thereby, marched to <hi>Stockholm;</hi>
but meeting with many difficulties in his march, and
when he came to the City, finding no hope to draw
them to a Treaty, and his Army being now much
wasted, he sent to <hi>Denmark</hi> for Recruit; and after
a while the King in person comes to him, and so <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme</hi>
is beleagured, which yet held out bravely, so
that the <hi>Danish</hi> Army being wasted, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
being wind-bound, and almost famished, a Treaty
of peace is set on foot, and at last agreed unto by both
parties. But the King intending nothing less than to
stand to it, pretends that he could not come into
<hi>Stockholme</hi> to finish the Treaty till pledges were first
given for the safety of his person. This the <hi>Suedes</hi>
assent to, and send him pledges of the Sons of the
Nobles, who were sent aboard his Ship, and the Kings
minde, changing with the wind, away he sails with
them into <hi>Denmark,</hi> and there committed them to safe
custody: And after four years returns into <hi>Sueden</hi>
with a great Army, and gives a second overthrow to
the <hi>Suedes</hi> in the Field, wherein the Governour <hi>Steno</hi>
was slain: then the King marching to <hi>Stockholme,</hi>

practice under <hi>Suanto,</hi> the next Governour. For after
the death of <hi>Steno</hi> the first, the difference between
the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Suedes</hi> about the Government grew so
high, that they fought two Battels, in both which the
<hi>Suedes</hi> were the Victors, <hi>Gustavus</hi> carrying the Royal
Standard of <hi>Sueden,</hi> though at that time he was but
eighteen years old; and being now about the age of

they ought to enquire into the true state of <hi>Gustavus</hi>
his Captivity, and to determine the same upon

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:62956:179"/>
parties to the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> oppressions
(if the case prove so) before they understand what
they do. The Authority of the Consul, and the

him, but some mercenary Souldiers, raising a muteny,

advised for his safety to withdraw himself into his

and danger;<note place="margin">His Danger.</note> For his Way lay through <hi>Smalland,</hi> where
the <hi>Danish</hi> Emissaries were very active to draw the

yoke: yet through it he adventures, but with much
grief of heart to see the Country people so miserably
deluded; insomuch that he could not forbear, but told
them, That they should consider the cases of many of
their Country-men, who had as fair promises from
the <hi>Danes,</hi> yet met with nothing but miserable bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
Adding that there was much less danger in
standing the push of the <hi>Danish</hi> Pike, than in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves, and all that was dear unto them to so
broken a Reed as their fair words, which had not only
failed, but mortally wounded the Liberties of their

                  <p>Say what he could, divers <hi>Suedes</hi> of the better
rank in those parts, being pre-ingaged to the <hi>Danes,</hi>
perswaded the people otherwise, saying, That the
<hi>Danes</hi> aimed onely at the suppressing of such of the
<hi>Suedish</hi> Nobility, as combined themselves against the
Kings Government: But as for the people, the King
was resolved to win them, and that they should never
need to fear want so long as Salt and Herrings lasted:

but dead men, except speedily they forsook their

wherefore he disswaded <hi>Gustavus</hi> from stirring,
alleadging the great advantage that the King had,
having an Army in the Field, and the Towns gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
under his command, affirming that the King
desired nothing more than to ingratiate himself with
the people, for whose assurance he had granted Letters
of Grace, and a general pardon, and therein particularly
mentioning <hi>Gustavus</hi> himself; wherefore he advised
him to give credit to the King, and to submit to his
Government. And <hi>for my part</hi> (said the old man) <hi>I
dare engage to procure from the King a special, full, and
free pardon for you if you shall desire it. Gustavus</hi> heard
him with silence, but liked not his undertaking; For
(thought he) this old man may hope hereby to screw
himself into the Kings favour: Neither indeed did he
like to adventure himself upon the Kings promises,
wherefore he resolved to wave this old mans counsel,
and to retire himself back to <hi>Rafsnass</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this while the King continued in the siege of

                     <hi>Stockholme,</hi> where we formerly left him, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
partly by force, partly by messages of Grace to
get possession of that City: For which end he first
confirmed the agreement which his General had made
with the Lords in the Field, and then granted a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
pardon, and Act of Oblivion for whatsoever
former faults. Then sent his hearty commendations,
and fair promises to the people in the Country by the

and now he hath them in one place within walls,
and a sufficient guard upon them: But it must be done
under the fairest pretence that may be, for the thing

the <hi>Danes,</hi> as in their own defence, should assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

might in the event turn to the destruction of the <hi>Danes</hi>

                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:62956:181"/>
Then another way was propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
King must look upon the <hi>Suedish</hi> Lords as under the
<hi>Popes</hi> curse, and sentence of Excommunication, and
to draw forth the Kings justice with more colourable
zeal, the Archbishop of <hi>Upsal,</hi> who had procured that
sentence, must openly accuse the <hi>Suedish</hi> Lords as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
persons, for Treason against the King,
robbery of the Church, and as spoylers of the dignity
and estate of the Archbishop, and therefore he must
demand Judgement against them? And this was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of.</p>
                  <p>And the better to draw these <hi>Suedish</hi> Lords toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a Feast is appointed the third day after the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
at which also the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and then before them all, the Arcbishop of <hi>Upsal</hi>
(though unwillingly when he saw what would be the

                  <p>After these horrid Murders,<note place="margin">Covetousness.</note> and outrages, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
began to ascend the Stage, the King seizing
upon all the estates, both of the dead and living, and to
make all sure, the Liberties of <hi>Sueden</hi> being thus brought
into the state of a dead man, they thought to buy them
also so as they might never rise again: To which end,
they set Guards in all places, published Edicts, and did
not onely deprive the <hi>Suedes</hi> of their Armour, but of
their Arms and Legs also, saying in scorn, <hi>That a</hi>
Swede <hi>could plow his ground well enough with one arm,
and a wodden leg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the last,<note place="margin">Hypocrisie.</note> and worst of evils was abominable
Hypocrisie. For this Christian Kings conscience (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth)
is pretended for what he did: He was touched
with much compassion, and would not have done it,
but that his conscience tyed him thereto in zeal to the
Church, and obedience to the <hi>Popes</hi> sentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication;
and thus <hi>Religion is made the Patron
of all these Villanies.</hi> Yet all this quieted not the
Kings conscience, but he hastes out of <hi>uecden,</hi> possibly
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:62956:182"/>
fearing lest the ground should open her mouth, and
swallow him up, or lest the fame of his cruelty should
arrive before him in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and make that Nation
abhor, and vomit him out.</p>
                  <p>But behold how vengeance follows him! Now is
he gone home, King of the three Kingdomes of the
<hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, and to secure <hi>Sueden,</hi> he had left Guards
in every place: But cruelty never conquered mens
spirits; <hi>A Tyrant may be feared of all, but is hated of all,
and his own conscience so pursues him, that he can be quiet
no where.</hi> And so it fell out with this King; for within
three years he lost all his three Kingdomes without
adventuring one drop of blood, or striking one blow
for them. The manner shall be after glanced upon;
but my present work is to shew how <hi>Sueden,</hi> now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <p>That he should not need to make any preface to
gain their attention,<note place="margin">His speech to them.</note> being perswaded that the matter
of his discourse would ease him of that trouble; He
therefore prayed them to take into consideration
the perplexed condition of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Nation in
those later years, that through their own distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and civil, or rather uncivil discontents they had
betrayed the Liberties of <hi>Sueden</hi> into the hands of
strangers, who instead of seeking the publick weal,
had wrought altogether for the advancement of their
own interest, the people of <hi>Sueden</hi> being in the
mean time glutted with misery, and drunk with
tears, having themselves, their wives, children, and
estates, prostituted to Murthers, Torments, Rapine,
and all manner of contempt. I appeal (saith he)
to the old men, they know it, they cannot forget it,
and the young men may know it, if they will ask
their Elders. And shall there never be an end of
these miseries? Are the <hi>Suedes</hi> become a people
alwayes to be trampled upon, devoured, and made
food for forreigners? Call (I pray you) to minde
the Government of that Tyrant, <hi>Ericus</hi> of <hi>Pomer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
his Cruelties, Oppressions, and Extortions;
and remember that you, that you I say of the Dales,
rose unanimously in defence of your Country
against him, and therein hazarded all that was dear
to you, even to your lives, and thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
him with shame to return to his own
Country. And now look about you and consider,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:62956:184"/>
Are you in any better condition under the enraged
<hi>Danes?</hi> a people that bear an immortal hatred to
our Nation, and are themselves hateful to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
but themselves: Can you expect better deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now from them, than you have found hitherto
after an hundred years experience? Hear the cryes
of the Survivers at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> the fatherless and
widows, the dying groans of so many brave men of
this Nation, under the cruel torments, and unsatiable
butcheries; the abhorred Massacre of all sorts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and sexes, and ages, contrary to all Faith,
Promises, Oaths, Execrations and Engagements
under hand and seal. It may be they will now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
you Peace, Justice, and what not? Did they
not give all these assurances to our dead Friends at
<hi>Stockholme?</hi> and yet they brake all bonds and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
and will you believe their words? No,
no; the <hi>Danes</hi> are still the same men, or rather inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Monsters that ever they were; their hatred is
now broken forth into a flame, which will never be
quenched, so long as the riches, or any blood of the
<hi>Suedish</hi> Nobility lasteth, nor will ever cease till it hath
run over all the Country. Do you not every day
hear the sad news of this approaching evil? Is it not
almost come to your own doors? and will you sit still
till it hath seized on your neck? Is it not much better
(if we must dye) to dye like Souldiers, than like slaves?
Are the <hi>Danes</hi> more than men, and we less than wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?
I am here present this day: Command my
estate, person, and life, and I will adventure all in
this service, if you will joyn with me in any way,
though I should serve but as a private Souldier. For
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:62956:185"/>
I had rather dye a free Nobleman of <hi>Sueden,</hi> in the
defence of my Country, than live to see it underper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
vassallage.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>Moreans</hi> being much affected with this speech,<note place="margin">Their answer.</note>
professed their readiness to appear in the defence of
their dear Friends and Country-men, in whose liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and lives their own were wrapped up. Yet they
prayed him, for the present, to retire himself to some
place of privacy for his own safety, till their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of the <hi>Western Dales</hi> might be in a sit posture
to joyn with them, assuring him that in the <hi>interim</hi>
they would not slack their preparations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> took this answer courteously, and away
he flyes to the Western <hi>Dallcarles</hi> bordering upon the
Mountains, to gain them into a posture; and there also
meeting with fresh news of the bloody cruelty of the
<hi>Danes,</hi> he goes once more amongst the Mountains,
where having to deal with sharp weather, rough and
unknown wayes, more trodden by wilde beasts than
men; yet indignation against the enemies, and zeal for
his Country, adde new courage, and resolution against
all difficulties, and dangers, and at last he makes trial
of the peoples minde again:<note place="margin">He meets with new dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties.</note> But they, scarcely sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of any thing but what was under ground, and
knowing no happiness above mining, nor any misery
worse than it, turned a deaf ear to all that he spake, till
at length <hi>Gustavus</hi> came to the house of <hi>Laurence
Olai,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Laurence Olai</hi> assists him.</note> an active, and brave Knight in those parts, who
had sometime served <hi>Steno Stur,</hi> the Governour, with
much valour and faithfulness. He, joyning with <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stavus,</hi>
told the Mountainers that <hi>Gustavus</hi> had given
them true intelligence concerning the <hi>Suedish</hi> miseries
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:62956:185"/>
under the <hi>Danish</hi> cruelties at <hi>Stockholme,</hi> and other
places: Further adding, that he had received late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
that the <hi>Danish</hi> King intended a Royal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
through all <hi>Sueden,</hi> to receive homage of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and had by Proclamation enjoyned Gibbets to be
erected in all places, and that Letters were coming
down into the Country to provide quarter for the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Souldiers that were to be as a guard to the King in
his Progress.</p>
                  <p>This news wrought effectually upon them, and as
they were considering what to do, messengers came
from the Country of the <hi>Dallcarles</hi> round about to
seek after <hi>Gustavus;</hi> but he was gone further out of
reach, to <hi>Lima.</hi> Hereupon the Mountainers resolve
to joyn with those of the <hi>Dales</hi> to request <hi>Gustavus</hi>
his speedy return, whom they would make their
Captain; and accordingly he came back with the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
where he found the people assembled, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him with loud acclamations of joy,<note place="margin">He Arms.</note> and made
him Governour and Captain of the <hi>Dallcarles,</hi> swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fealty, and obedience to him, assigning him a Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
of choice young men for his honour and
safety.</p>
                  <p>Thus one great work is over. <hi>Gustavus</hi> had all this
while to do with a people whose principles were fixed
in their manufactures; and though they had many
eyes, and could discern things nigh at hand well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
yet could they not discern the times, nor from
thence make conclusions what they ought to do. For
God never made all men for all things. Miners are
no good States-men, nor States-men good Miners;
and therefore its the less marvel that <hi>Gustavus</hi>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:62956:186"/>
spent an whole year in this painful Pilgrimage, with
continual labour and danger, and all to make this
people sensible of their condition, and willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Liberties before it was too late; and yet
could he prevail nothing, till the <hi>Danish</hi> Feast at
<hi>Stockholme</hi> (not above two moneths past) roused them
out of their security. But now <hi>Gustavus</hi> was in a
posture for the Field, as a Captain for the Liberties
of <hi>Sueden,</hi> against a known enemy, or Tyrant rather,
who thought that he had setled his Government in
<hi>Sueden,</hi> both by Law and Arms.</p>
                  <p>Nor indeed can this work be looked upon but as a
special work of Divine Omnipotency,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the <hi>Suedes.</hi>
                     </note> in compassion
to an oppressed, and undone people, that so strong a
principle of Magnanimity, Zeal, and Constancy,
should lead one man thus in this service through all
opposition and danger; but these are but small things
in comparison of what remained, and was further done
by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> being thus engaged, proceeds to gather
his Army,<note place="margin">He raiseth an Army.</note> and to him <hi>Laurentius Olai</hi> joyns, together
with the friends and servants of those Noble men
who were murthered at <hi>Stockholme,</hi> and others dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interested
who were in danger of the <hi>Danish</hi> interdict,
and with these he begins first to march on <hi>Candlewas</hi>
day, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1520, leading his men to the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
mountains, where he surprised the Governour and
other Officers belonging to the Mines, seizing upon
all the <hi>Danish</hi> goods,<note place="margin">Seizeth on the Kings Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</note> the Kings Revenue, and the
Tenths, and so returned into the Valley.</p>
                  <p>By this means he gained in some measure a stock
for the encouragement of his Souldiers, whereby his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:62956:186"/>
Army encreased daily, and he facing about, went to
the other Mountains, where, by general consent, he
was made their Lord and Governour: After which
he divided his Army into two parts, leaving one in
the Mountains under the command of <hi>Peter Sueno,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He divides his Army.</note> a
famous Captain, to whom many of the Inhabitants
joyned themselves, and these he kept as a reserve, to
assist him as occasion required.</p>
                  <p>With the other part of his Army he marched into
the Country of <hi>Helsing,</hi> which on one side bordered
upon the Sea, having the valley of the <hi>Dallca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>les</hi> on
the other; and this he did, as well to gain a passage by
Sea, if occasion should require, as to secure his Army
the more by such good neighbourhood: But whilst
he thus advanced into <hi>Helsing,</hi> Letters were sent unto
the Mountainers from the Archbishop of <hi>Upsal,</hi> the
old enemy of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Liberties, signed by himself,
his Father <hi>Ericus Trolli,</hi> and <hi>Bennet Canutus,</hi> who stiled
themselves the Council of the Kingdome of <hi>Sueden;</hi>
the purport whereof was, to beseech them to be
mindful of their duty to their Sovereign the King,
and of the peace of the Kingdome of <hi>Sueden,</hi> with
large promises of the Kings grace and favour to them,
and of a safe conduct to <hi>Gustavus,</hi> if he would lay
down Arms; adding that by so doing, differences
might be composed for their great advantage: But
all the entertainment these Letters met with was,
Indignation, and Scorn.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Helsingers</hi> gave <hi>Gustavus</hi> no harsh entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">He advanceth into <hi>Helsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note>
yet was his presence not very acceptable, they
besought him that they might be spared from present
engagement in Arms, their Country being exhausted
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:62956:187"/>
and much impoverished by the late troubles: <hi>Gusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>
hereby found that their temper was not for
his turne; he must have men of resolution, and
therefore he accepted of their submissive answer, and
leaving them to second thoughts, he marched thence
into <hi>Gestrict,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">From thence into <hi>Gestrict.</hi>
                     </note> where the people readily submitted to
him, and so he returned to the Dales again, having by
this march encreased his Army to the number of
five thousand good old Souldiers, who having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
hidden themselves in several places, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to him.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop of <hi>Upsal</hi> finding what little respect
his Letters had with the Mountainers, he resolved to
do that by force, which his fair language could not
effect; and therefore he sent <hi>Henry de Milen,</hi> with a
commanded party of Souldiers into the Dales, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them betimes, and to crush the Bird in the
Egge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> being informed of his coming, advanceth
to meet him, <hi>de Milen</hi> hearing this, retires from him,
professing to the Archbishop, that <hi>Gustavus</hi> was not
to be dealt with by parties: But the truth is, a spirit
of trepidation had possessed the <hi>Danes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Danes</hi> are infatuated.</note> or else being
in the Field, as they were, they would never have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
an enemy thus to gather under their noses, nor
have dallied thus with <hi>Gustavus</hi> by parties, when they
had a just Army in readiness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> was otherwise minded, he had begun, and
now there was no retreating; He will now let all men
know that he was so far from fearing the <hi>Danes,</hi> that
he undertakes a long march to finde them out, and
fight them within their own walls, and accordingly
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:62956:187"/>
he advanceth to <hi>Westerass,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He marches to <hi>Westerass.</hi>

there the <hi>Danes</hi> had placed a Garrison.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> by this march also had much encreased
his Army by the confluence of the Country to him,
whereupon he divided his Army into three Battels,
the Van was commanded by <hi>Laurentius Olai,</hi> the
middle by <hi>Laurentius Ericus,</hi> whom he commanded
to march through the valley of <hi>Balingsass,</hi> and to
encamp near to St. <hi>Olais</hi> Chappel, but not to attempt
any thing without further order.</p>

which was so bravely entertained by <hi>Laurentius,</hi> that
the <hi>Danes</hi> gave ground, and at last both Horse and
Foot were driven to a disorderly retreat, whom <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius</hi>
pursued. <hi>Gustavus</hi> hearing hereof, and fearing
lest his mens forwardness might carry them beyond
their Post, he hasted into the Van, though with some
danger to his person, and with the loss of some that
were nigh to him, and when he came, he found <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius</hi>
engaged even unto the streets of the City in
pursuit of the flying Enemy, so that it was dangerous
to bring them to a stand, whereupon he gave them
their liberty, and with them he follows the enemy
through the streets. But the <hi>Danes,</hi> when they came
into the Market place, ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lied themselves, and made a
stand behind their Ordinance, which were ready planted
to give the <hi>Suedes</hi> a salutation upon their first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach:
But <hi>Laurentius Fricus</hi> with the middle Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:62956:188"/>
found out a nearer way, and was already gotten
into the City,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Westerass</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> and now charged the <hi>Danes</hi> in their
Rear, making them quit their place, and their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and thereby saved much blood which might
have been shed of the <hi>Suedish</hi> side. The Souldiers in
the Castle seeing their Friends thus beaten, shot fiery
bullets, whereby the City was fired in sundry places;
but the <hi>Suedish</hi> Souldiers quenched the fire, and saved
the City. The <hi>Danes</hi> in the City being sled to their
intrenchments, defended themselves till they had
strengthened the Garrison in the Castle, and then
by the help of their Boats, gat them to <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Victory, as it discouraged the Enemy, so it
much encouraged many secret Friends to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to forsake the <hi>Danes,</hi> and to take part with <hi>Gusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi>
amongst whom was <hi>Arvidus,</hi> a West <hi>Goth,</hi>
whom <hi>Gustavus</hi> knew so well, that he presently sent
him with part of the Army to besiege the Castle of
<hi>Steckburrow,</hi> and to watch the motion of the people in
those parts. Other Castles also were besieged; but
<hi>Laurentius Ericus</hi> was sent with his Brigade to <hi>Upsal,</hi>
and <hi>Laurentius Olai,</hi> with the Country people that
now flocked to him from all parts, was appointed to
second him. As they marched thitherward they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted
the Scouts of the Governour of <hi>Upsal;</hi> and
the next day Letters were sent from the Governour,
and Magistrates of <hi>Upsal</hi> to the <hi>Suedish</hi> Commander
in chief, to desire liberty according to their wonted
manner every year upon St. <hi>Ericus</hi> day, to hold their
Procession with the shrine of St. <hi>Ericus,</hi> to the
Church of old <hi>Upsal,</hi> being half a mile without their
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:62956:188"/>
City; to which, answer was returned, That it belonged
to the <hi>Suedes,</hi> not to the <hi>Danes</hi> to hold that solemnity.
The Governour though he missed the Procession, yet
would not lose his Feast; he therefore would let the
<hi>Suedes</hi> know, that he could keep his Feast though the
<hi>Suedish</hi> Army waited upon his Trenches; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
held his Feast in the Archbishops Garden. But
the next morning before break of the day, the <hi>Suedish</hi>
Army came to the walls, seized upon the Guards, and
entred the City,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Upsal</hi> taken.</note> whilst the <hi>Danes</hi> half asleep, and as
yet scarce sober, being surprized with a Pannick fear,
fled out of the City, fiering of it as they went: But
the <hi>Suedes</hi> appointing a party to quench the fire, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
the <hi>Danes</hi> till they had passed the River, in which
passage the Governour was shot with an arrow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he died at <hi>Stockholm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About eight dayes after comes <hi>Gustavus</hi> from

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d calling the Canons of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
together, he asked them whether they were
<hi>Suedes</hi> or <hi>Danes,</hi> charges them with the blood, spoyl,
and misery of <hi>Sueden,</hi> affirming that they, and their
Archbishop had nourished all the Rebellions in <hi>Sueden</hi>
against their lawful Governours, that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers
of their Countries Liberties into the hands of
Forreigners; that ere long they must be responsible
for those actions, and in the mean time he required
Fealty from them, and security that in their stations
they would maintain the peace and liberty of the
Country. They humbly answer by Petition, desiring
that he would consider their engagement to their Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,
now at <hi>Stockholme,</hi> and that they might have
leave to send to him to see if they could prevail to take
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:62956:189"/>
him along with them in this engagement, promising
to write to him to invite, and perswade him hereunto.
This <hi>Gustavus</hi> was content to grant, and wrote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by the same messenger: But what other message
the Canons sent privately, the event renders some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
doubtful. For the Letters were received with
contempt, and the messenger detained, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
saying, that he would carry an answer in his
own person; and accordingly he caused a Body of
Horse and Foot immediately to be drawn forth, with
which he marched with that speed and secresie, that
they were within two miles of <hi>Upsal,</hi> before <hi>Gustavus</hi>
heard any thing of their coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> now too late, began to consider his own
weakness, his Army being divided in so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
imployments, and the enemies (if he was not
misinformed) exceeding him in strength: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he debated with himself what were fittest for
him to do: the City was unassured to him, if not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
against him: If he retreat, it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued
for a flight: If he stay, he must put all to the
hazard: He considered also that though he might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in his Honour by a Retreat, yet that might be
repaired again, but if he lost his men, that loss would
be irreparable both as to his own honour, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and the safety of his Party.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon he speedily withdrew out of the City in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Wood not far off:<note place="margin">Gustavus <hi>quits</hi> Vpsal.</note> and the Archbishop without
opposition entring the City, is soon informed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and as eagerly pursues him to the Wood, where
the <hi>Suedes</hi> had made a stand, and gave not ground for
all that the <hi>Danes</hi> could do against them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:62956:189"/>
As <hi>Gustavus</hi> was bestirring himself from place to
place,<note place="margin">His danger and delivery.</note> his Horse fell into a Quagmire, where, being
espied by the <hi>Danes,</hi> he was knock't from his Horse,
and had been at their mercy; but that a party of about
twenty of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Horse came seasonably to his
rescue, and horsed him again; after which, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to charge the enemy afresh, they retired, but yet
in good order, which <hi>Gustavus</hi> observing, he was
willing to make a golden Bridge for a flying enemy,
and so let them go quietly to <hi>Upsall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> had now leisure to consider what to do:
and found by experience a double error in his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
First that he had divided his Army into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts, that none of them was of it self sufficient to
oppose the enemy in case they should gather to an
head: the other, that in his March (contrary to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
Rule) he had not reduced the enemies Castles;
but le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t them, as Birds of prey, to fall upon any of
his Parties, when they should be weak. He conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
also, that if now he should leave the wood, he was
environed with those Castles, and had the enemies
Army entire, and near him. What shall he now do?
Men bring themselves into straits,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and plunges, but
God brings them out. <hi>Gustavus</hi> had a party now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging
the Castle of <hi>Westerass,</hi> who hearing of the
fight between the Archbishop, and <hi>Gustavus,</hi> rose, and
hasted to him. <hi>Gustavus</hi> being thus recruited, turns
to the left hand, leaving <hi>Upsal</hi> on the right, and so
bended his march towards <hi>Stockholme,</hi> supposing that
they might meet with the Archbishop, before he
could recover <hi>Stockholme;</hi> and herein his expectation
was not frustrated: For if <hi>Gustavus</hi> committed two
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:62956:190"/>
errours, the Archbishop fell into one which was worse
than both of them, and that was, that being returned
to <hi>Upsal,</hi> he considered not that he had left <hi>Gustavus</hi>
in a posture of defence, who also might possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
his Army, and so meet with him in his return
to <hi>Stockholme</hi> if he made not the better haste; and
so indeed it fell out, <hi>Gustavus</hi> met him, fought
him,<note place="margin">The <hi>Danes</hi> again are bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> and after an hours dispute, <hi>Gustavus</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were of that force, that the Archbishop
hardly escaped into <hi>Stockholme</hi> with tenth part of
his Army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> follows him, and entrenches his Army
near to the City,<note place="margin">His Army much encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</note> but considering that the City was
full of <hi>Danes,</hi> and that most of the <hi>Suedes</hi> after the late
Massacre had forsaken their houses, and that it was
like to hold out long, he was casting with himself how
to encrease his Army; but he was soon eased of that
care: For the <hi>Helsingers,</hi> that hitherto had concealed
themselves, now come unanimously, and offer their
service to him, and the like did many old Souldiers of
<hi>Germany,</hi> insomuch as he was less able to provide
quarter for them than men.</p>
                  <p>But what doth the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> all this while?
Is not he ready by this to march with a compleat
Army to save a Kingdome that is ready to be lost?
No doubt but he had a good minde to it;<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> hated at home.</note> but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was such that he durst not stir from home. For
as he went out of <hi>Sueden</hi> without one <hi>God-speed,</hi> so he
came into <hi>Denmark</hi> without one <hi>Welcome-home.</hi> He
was so dyed in blood that all were afraid of him: His
Victory was abominated, his person odious, and his
Government grown intolerable; wherefore finding
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:62956:190"/>
that he could raise no Army at home, and that if he
should go out of <hi>Denmark</hi> he might lose all there, and
get nothing but blows abroad; he commands his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
in the Isle of <hi>Gothland</hi> to relieve the <hi>Danes</hi>
in <hi>Sueden</hi> as occasion should require; in pursuance
whereof, he repairs thither, and after one repulse suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
he relieved the Castle of <hi>Steckburg,</hi> besieged
by <hi>Arvidus,</hi> and then changing the Garrison, he
committed the keeping of it to one <hi>Bernard de
Milen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> considering that the siege of that place
would prove dangerous to <hi>Arvidus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Convention of the Estates in <hi>Sueden.</hi>
                     </note> if the Country,
and neighbourhood were not assured to him; he sent
to the Bishop of <hi>Hincopen,</hi> and having prevailed with
him, by his advice, he summoned a meeting of all the
States of East and West <hi>Gothland, Smalland, Verme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and of the <hi>Dales;</hi> and when they were assembled,
he prayed them to take into consideration the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Country: that the misery thereof was
occasioned onely through their divisions and variety
of interests; and the Government having been of late
in the hands of Forreigners, the Publick weal hath
thereby been much endamaged. He said, he should
not need to enlarge upon the particular burdens which
they felt and groaned under. The great business which
he desires them to take into consideration was, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise,
and conclude upon the means of redress: As
for himself he would deliver his opinion freely and
cleerly, <hi>viz.</hi> That no means on earth could cure
these evils, but a speedy and effectual unanimity, and
joynt endeavour to restore the old principles of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by one supreme Governour, and a free
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:62956:191"/>
Parliament of the States, as formerly had been used:
But if they had any further advice therein, he earnestly
desired to be informed by them, assuring them that
whatsoever they should judge meet to be done in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to a settlement, he would endeavour the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of the same, though to the sacrificing of his
life, and all that was dear to him.</p>
                  <p>This Speech being ended, there was a joynt accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and assurance given, that they all fully, and
freely assented to his opinion, and were ready to assist
him therein to the utmost, withall, giving him great
thanks for his undertaking their rescue out of the
Tyrants hands, earnestly requesting him to proceed till
he had perfected the same, whereunto they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
contribute their prayers to God for his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
assistance, and for the protection of his person;
and for his further assurance, they do not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,<note place="margin">They proffer him the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>
and promise submission to him as their
lawful Governour; but they pray that it may not seem
grievous to him to take upon him the place, and title
of their lawful Lord and King.</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Gustavus</hi> answered, That he took up Arms
against the common enemy of his Country,<note place="margin">Which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth.</note> not aiming
at Rule, but at the peoples liberty from the iron yoke
of the <hi>Danish</hi> Tyranny, under which themselves, their
wives and children lay bound day, and night; That he
called not himself to the work, but onely offered his
assistance therein; That he was invited to command
by the <hi>Transilvanian Suedes</hi> of the <hi>Dales;</hi> That his
detestation of that abhorred Butchery at <hi>Stockholme</hi>
(wherein, not onely many Personages fit to do their
Country service, but many of his own blood lost their
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:62956:191"/>
lives and estates) did enrage his spirit to it, so that he
thought nothing dangerous for him to adventure,
so that he might take vengeance for it, which made
him yeeld to the invitation of the men of the <hi>Dales:</hi>
and if you also (said he) will joyn your aid in this
work, and can conside in my command, I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to be your Captain and Governour untill the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
be fully vanquished, and our Country cleared from
them. But as touching the making of a King, you
may take that into consideration when the War shall
be fully finished; For then whomsoever the States of
<hi>Sueden</hi> shall elect to be King or Governour, his will I
be to serve in any condition.</p>
                  <p>This Speech was received with joyful acclamations,
and an unanimous vote that <hi>Gustavus</hi> should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
for their Lord and Governour; and accordingly
all that were present sware Fealty to him, and faithful
obedience next under God.</p>
                  <p>This was a little Parliament of part of the Nation,
and chiefly intended to assure those places where the
War was, and to unite them in a more vigorous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
thereof; and the success was answerable:
For hereupon many Towns and Castles of <hi>West-Gothland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Many joyn with him.</note>
and <hi>Small and,</hi> readily surrendred, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to <hi>Gustavus,</hi> whose Deputies being sent to
the Council, and convinced in their judgements of the
justness of the cause, the people had obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to stand to what their Deputies should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.
Hereupon <hi>Gustavus</hi> finding less need of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
so many Souldiers in these neighbouring parts,
he sends a party into <hi>Finland,</hi> to which many of the
people joyned: Amongst whom was one <hi>Grabb,</hi> a
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:62956:192"/>
valiant man, and skilful Sea-Captain, who having
armed a few ships, with them assaulted such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
upon the Coast as held for the <hi>Dane,</hi> sometimes in
one part, sometimes in another; surprising Towns,
slaying many, doing all by night, and before the next
morning he was gone, no body knew whither, nor
which way. This caused the Enemies to divide their
Forces, to guard so many places at once; and in the
mean time the <hi>Suedes</hi> sat down before <hi>Abbo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Abbo</hi> besieged</note> though
they were there hard matched, and sometimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched
by the <hi>Danes;</hi> for as yet that part of the
Country had not felt the <hi>Danish</hi> cruelty, though if
they had prospered, they should not long have esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the same.</p>
                  <p>The Castle of <hi>Steckburg,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Steckburgh</hi> surrendred.</note> after above half an years
siege, was taken by <hi>Arvidus,</hi> the Governour whereof
being committed to Prison, after he had lain there
two moneths, he submitted to <hi>Gustavus,</hi> and sware
Fealty to him. The Governour of the Isle of <hi>Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
being ignorant of these passages, came with a
Fleet, well provided to relieve the Castle; but when
he came to the <hi>Promontory,</hi> he was suddenly assailed
by the <hi>Suedish</hi> ships which lay behinde the same; and
after the loss of six hundred of his men, he was glad
to betake him to his wings. Shortly after, <hi>Arvidus</hi>
was sent with part of his Army to block up <hi>Calmar,</hi>
the rest being sent to the Camp before <hi>Stockholme;</hi>
For the <hi>Danish</hi> Admiral,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Stockholme</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the</note> after the late defeat, having
repaired his losses with a new supply of men and ships,
came to the relief of them in <hi>Stockholme,</hi> and the
<hi>Danes</hi> being strengthened by this recruit, sallied out
of the City, and beat up one of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Quarters,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:62956:192"/>
so that for a moneths space, the City remained dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> now finding by experience that <hi>Stockholme</hi>
was a morsel too big for him to swallow, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strength, he bent his principal industry for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of other places Garrisoned by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and
amongst other places the City of <hi>Nicopen</hi> was at
length yeelded up to him by the Governour,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nicopen</hi> yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Suedes.</hi>

                     <hi>Henry
Canzow,</hi> with whom Letters were found from the
<hi>Danish</hi> Tyrant, which required him to put to death all
the <hi>Suedes</hi> that came into his power, especially those
of the Nobility: But as he had too much humanity in
him to execute so bloody a Decree, so he liked it not
in others, and therefore he told <hi>Gustavus,</hi> that Letters
of the same purport were sent to other places, and he
believed they would be put in execution, which fell
out accordingly in <hi>Finland;</hi> for the Governour of
<hi>Abbo,</hi> being blocked up (though not formally besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged)
by the <hi>Suedes,</hi> caused divers of the chief men of
<hi>Finland</hi> to be assassinated: But <hi>Ericus Flemming</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forewarned of the danger, and now in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
hand, offered his service, with so many
<hi>Suedes</hi> as adheared to the <hi>Danes,</hi> to adventure their
lives the night following to beat the <hi>Suedes</hi> before the
City out of their quarters, which being liked by the
Governour, he asigned him such men as he desired,
who accordingly entred the <hi>Suedish</hi> quarters, but
liked their entertainment so well, that they returned
no more into <hi>Abbo:</hi> and thus he escaped that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
which many others shortly after smarted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> having gained <hi>Nicopen,</hi> the Castles of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:62956:193"/>
                     <hi>Tineslor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tineslor</hi> and <hi>Westerass</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note> and <hi>Westerass,</hi> presently after were delivered
up to him, the latter having endured a siege of nine
moneths: But finding all his labour before <hi>Stockholme</hi>
lost, unless he could encrease his strength at Sea, he
sent to <hi>Lubeck</hi> for men of War, and Ammunition,
who readily assented being oppressed by the <hi>Danes</hi> in
their Trade. Nine ships were sent to <hi>Gustavus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a few moneths with Ammunition, and Souldiers,
who had a great minde to see <hi>Gustavus</hi> before they
would engage;<note place="margin">The <hi>Lubeckers</hi> assist him.</note> but being satisfied when they had seen
him, they all swear to be faithful to him; part of these
<hi>Gustavus</hi> sent to the siege of <hi>Calmar,</hi> the other part
he carried along with him to the siege of <hi>Stockholme</hi>
(as it was the policy of War amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> to
divide their Auxiliaries) and then he sent the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to their several habitations. Within a few weeks
after, eight more ships of War arrived from <hi>Lubeck</hi> at
<hi>Stockholme,</hi> and being thus more secured at Sea,
<hi>Gustavus</hi> re-inforced the siege in a more regular way
than formerly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Suedes</hi> before <hi>Abbo</hi> finding the work too hard
for them, withdrew their Forces, and the Governour
being now at liberty, by order from the <hi>Danish</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
prepared a ship of War, with Ammunition, and
Souldiers, for the relief of <hi>Stockholme,</hi> which early in
a morning coming to the Fore-land, sent out a Skiffe
for discovery, which was intercepted by <hi>Ericus Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi>
now Admiral of the <hi>Suedes,</hi> who clearing the
men out of the Skiffe, and manning it with <hi>Suedes</hi> in
the same fashion, he sent it back, into which, when
the Governour of <hi>Abbo</hi> was entred to enquire after
news, they presently apprehended him, and carried him
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:62956:193"/>
away, and being hardly chased by the <hi>Danish</hi> ships,<note place="margin">The <hi>Danes</hi> beaten at Sea.</note>
they suddenly fell amongst the <hi>Suedes,</hi> and being
charged by them, some were taken, and others esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
But the Governour of <hi>Abbo</hi> being brought to
<hi>Gustavus,</hi> he presently hanged him on a Tree, for his
cruel assasinating the Nobility of <hi>Finland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Within a few weeks after the <hi>Danish</hi> Admiral came
with five Ships for the relief of <hi>Stockholme,</hi> but being
within view, and not liking the Coast, he returned
without doing any thing, and <hi>Gustavus</hi> now finding
the Sea safely guarded,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Stockholme</hi> straitly besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> he prosecuted his siege more
vigoriously, making his approaches to the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs,
and by Bridges closing his Quarters. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the City began to be in distress, and many esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
out, submitted to <hi>Gustavus:</hi> Amongst these, a
Spy is sent out, who under colour of submission, was
to make discovery, and as occasion served, either to
return into the City, or to haste into <hi>Denmark</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the King with the state of their affairs. This
Spy was discovered, and being searched, Letters
were found sown up in his cloaths, whereupon he was
convicted, and executed: And this being known in the
City, and judged to be by intelligence from some
within, all the <hi>Suedes</hi> were ordered to depart, but such
as would take up Arms for the <hi>Danes.</hi> On the other
side, <hi>Gustavus</hi> having intelligence of preparations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the relief of the <hi>Danes</hi> in <hi>Sueden,</hi> he sent a

and after some time he found means to raise an Army

a second time; whereupon despairing of good
success,<note place="margin">Then into <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                     </note> he fled into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he lost his Queen,
the greatest comfort he had left him in the world; not
onely in regard of her relation to the Emperour, but
in regard of her excellent vertues, whereby she was so

to her as to their lawful Queen if she would stay
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:62956:194"/>
in <hi>Denmark;</hi> but she, like her self, chose to live in exile
with her Husband,<note place="margin">A good Wife.</note> rather than to reign without him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> in <hi>Sueden</hi> understood these things, and
those of them that were besieged in the Castle of
<hi>Calmar</hi> were ordered to hold out as long as they could,

came to <hi>Stockholme,</hi> they proffered to surrender, but

them, that now things were in a hopeful way of peace;
that it was necessary for the publick peace, and justice
of the Nation, that the antient form of Government
should be revived: That for the present they see the
Nation without a supream Magistrate, and without a
Senate: That the former hath murthered the later,
and the people ejected the former: That he hoped in
a short time to render an account of the Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united,
and in a peaceable condition, which is the end
of War; but some person must be elected to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
them when in a peaceable condition, and a Senate
must be constituted according to the antient custome
of <hi>Sueden,</hi> who may elect the supreme Governour:
That they, the States of <hi>Sueden,</hi> are the only first
movers in this work, and have power to constitute
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:62956:195"/>
this Senate anew, and therefore he prayes them to

heavy for his shoulders.<note place="margin">which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses.</note> That it was one thing to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
in Warre, wherein he was trained, and another
thing to be a King, wherein he was not skilled. That
he was well wearied already with the dangers, cares,
and labours of the Warre, and now having brought
the Nation into a posture of subsistence in peace, he
hath his ends, and therefore desires them to rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
therewith, and that they would make choice
of some other person of the Nobility of <hi>Sueden</hi> to be
their King, assuring them that himself would gladly
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:62956:195"/>
serve under him whom they should choose, and so
thanking them for their good opinion of him, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
the Messengers.</p>
                  <p>The States,<note place="margin">They press him again.</note> and Senate having heard this answer,
were no wise satisfied with it, and therefore renew
their requests (the Popes Legate also joyning with
them) and tell <hi>Gustavus</hi> plainly that they will not
receive any negative, nor can he evade the election if
he regard the Senate, or convention of States, or the
peoples good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> hereupon is at length overswayed, and
yet abhorring all unworthy self-ends,<note place="margin">He submits.</note> he professed his
acceptance only upon the same grounds which moved
them to elect him: and that withall he was convinced
that the work was of that nature that he was unable to
go through with it,<note place="margin">His Piety.</note> &amp; therefore he would rest upon the
Lord of <hi>Sabbath</hi> for his assistance, and protection, and
next under him, upon the Lords of <hi>Sueden,</hi> whose
wisdome, care, and industry he much prized; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
desiring the earnest, and daily prayers of all the
people, upon which account only he would submit to
their desires. And so, according to the ancient
custome, by mutuall obligations of Oaths, <hi>Gustavus</hi> is
solemnly declared, and proclaimed King of <hi>Sueden:</hi>
yet refused he to be crowned till five years after.</p>
                  <p>The first thing that was done after this election was
the requitall of the <hi>Lubeckers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Lubeckers</hi> required.</note> for adventuring their
men, Ships, and estates, with the <hi>Suedes,</hi> against
the <hi>Danes;</hi> in recompence whereof the <hi>Suedes</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they would never make peace with the <hi>Danes</hi>
without the consent of the <hi>Lubeckers.</hi> That upon the
surrender of <hi>Stockholme,</hi> such wares, goods, and debts
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:62956:196"/>
therein,<note place="margin">The Articles of agreement.</note> as the <hi>Lubeckers,</hi> and <hi>Dantzickers</hi> should
own upon Oath, should be secured, and returned to
them. That the <hi>Lubeckers</hi> shall be paid for their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
That the Sea should be free for them, and that
they shall have a free trade in <hi>Sueden.</hi> That they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of all forreign Nations shall have a free Trade in the
Ports of <hi>Stockholme, Calmar, Sarcopen,</hi> and <hi>Abbo.</hi>
That the King shall do them right. That he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
set prizes upon any of their Merchandise, nor
compell them to sell, or leave their goods against their
wills. That their goods and estates wracked, shall be
restored to the owners, without loss. That their
goods sold in <hi>Sueden</hi> by their Mariners, or servants
without order, shall be restored to their owners, and
the offenders punished. That the King of <hi>Sueden</hi>
shall not harbour any of the enemies of <hi>Lubeck.</hi> That
if any difference shall arise between the <hi>Suedes,</hi> and
<hi>Lubeckers,</hi> the same shall be ordered by four Lords of
<hi>Sueden</hi> sent to <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and so many Citizens of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi>
joyning with them. These were confirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the hands, and Seals of the King, and Lords of
<hi>Sueden,</hi> and Commissioners of <hi>Lubeck.</hi> This was
more than a recompence to the City of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> had
they been as careful to keep touch with the <hi>Suedes</hi> as
the <hi>Suedes</hi> were with them.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after <hi>Stockholme</hi> was surrendred to the
King,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Stockholme</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note> who entred the same in the month of <hi>June,</hi> after
welnigh three years siege, wherein the <hi>Danes</hi> had time
enough to have relieved it, if they had been convinced
of any right that they had to the Kingdome of
<hi>Sueden.</hi> Upon his entry he was proclaimed King of
<hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Gothland,</hi> with great applause and joy of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:62956:196"/>
all sorts. Hereupon divers Towns and Castles were
surrendred to him; and in the reare, the Dukedome of
<hi>Bleking,</hi> and the Town and Castle of <hi>Elsburgh,</hi> the
onely commodious Port that the <hi>Suedes</hi> have into
the Western Sea. But still the Dukedome of <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the adjacent Countries were out of the Kings
possession; and therefore beginning now to study good
Husbandry for those people whom he must own, he
dismissed his Forreign forces, and the residue of his
Army he sent into <hi>Finland</hi> under the command of
<hi>Ivar,</hi> and <hi>Ericus Fleming,</hi> who within the space of
one year reduced all that Country into obedience,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Finland</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</note> and
the Northern people submitted upon the credit of
their Neighbours, so that the whole Kingdome was
now united under the Kings command, and he had
nothing to do but to study peace and justice.<note place="margin">Peace settled.</note> And
accordingly he first made peace with the <hi>Muscovite,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Peace with the <hi>Muscovite.</hi>
                     </note>
having none other enemy whom he need to fear, nor
indeed any that bordered upon him, but the <hi>Muscovite</hi>
on the East, and the <hi>Dane</hi> on the West; and as for the
<hi>Danes,</hi> their condition was this:</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Christian</hi> being fled,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Holst</hi> chosen King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Frederick,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Holst,</hi> being sent for, came into <hi>Denmark,</hi> and by the
Nobility was elected and crowned King some years
before <hi>Gustavus</hi> was crowned in <hi>Sueden,</hi> though
<hi>Gustavus</hi> was in Arms divers years before him. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oth
these coming to the Throne upon the same title of
the peoples liberty; and knowing how necessary
peace with one another would be, a mutual Treaty is
propounded by the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and in order
thereto, the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> propounded an interview,
wherein he stood not upon punctilio's, but proffered
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:62956:197"/>
to come to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> in some convenient
place upon security of a safe conduct,<note place="margin">The two new Kings meet.</note> which the King
of <hi>Denmark</hi> granted as soon as it was demanded. The
place of meeting was <hi>Ancona,</hi> in the confines of
<hi>Scania,</hi> where, in the presence of the Lords of both
Nations, an interview is had; and after mutual saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and complements, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> spake
of the miseries, and calamities that had befaln both
the Nations for divers years last past, declaring their
present dangers also by reason of the continual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
of <hi>Christian</hi> their late King, which (saith he)
will be much heightned if our discords should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue:
For my own part therefore I am for peace
with <hi>Sueden</hi> upon just and honourable tearms. <hi>Gustavus</hi>
answered, that he held peace between the Nations
convenient and commendable, and was willing to
hearken thereto upon equal conditions.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> began with proposing the
continuance of the union of the three Northern King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>domes
according to the Articles of <hi>Calmar;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> speech.</note> which
(said he) were confirmed by the Oaths of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
of all the three Nations; yet he desired not the
change of the present Government of <hi>Sueden,</hi> but
onely that <hi>Gustavus</hi> should acknowledge him Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
<hi>Gustavus</hi> secretly disliking this proposal, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
modestly, that for his part he was unwillingly
drawn to accept of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Crown.<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Suedens</hi> answer</note> That he could
wish that both Nations could flourish under one head.
But (said he) <hi>the agreement of</hi> Calmar <hi>is dissolved by
the misgovernment of the late King; and if the</hi> Danes
<hi>could not all this while gain their expectations by force
of Arms, much less can they think it rational for the</hi>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:62956:197"/>
Suedes <hi>to yeeld up by Treaty the Liberties of their
Country, which are dearer to them than their lives, as
the late Wars have demonstrated. Neither can himself,
who is sworn to maintain the Liberties of his Country,
allow of such tearms, much less advise his people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thereto. Yet for my own part, though I will not be
a subject, yet I desire to be a friend, true, and faithful to
the King of</hi> Denmark, <hi>and am ready to gratifie him in
all things agreeable to equity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> perceiving hereby the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness
of his former demands, tells the King
of <hi>Sueden</hi> in plain terms, that himself was desirous of
a firm peace, and league with him, if <hi>Sueden</hi> would be
content with its antient limits, and would yeeld up
what in these late Wars they had gained from <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
especially the Dukedome of <hi>Bleking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Sueden</hi> answered, that himself valued
the peace of both Nations beyond that petty Dutchy,
and therefore he would consult with his Lords about
it, and accordingly it was assented to.</p>
                  <p>But the proposal about the Isle of <hi>Gothland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> proved
more difficult: It was in the possession of the <hi>Danes,</hi>
but claimed as belonging to the Crown of <hi>Sueden,</hi> yet
at last they agreed to lay that debate aside till a more
convenient time: and thus peace was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these two Kings, as well for the <hi>Hans</hi>-Towns, as
for themselves, against <hi>Christian</hi> the deposed King;
and all the <hi>Suedish</hi> Captives in <hi>Denmark</hi> were set at
liberty, and such of the <hi>Suedes</hi> as formerly had any
particular interest in <hi>Denmark,</hi> were restored to their
right.</p>
                  <p>About this time a spiritual disease was newly breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:62956:198"/>
in <hi>Germany,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gospel light in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </note> which soon grew to be almost <hi>Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi>
in those Eastern parts. Gospel-light was newly
sprung out of <hi>Popish</hi> darkness, discovering the very
bowels of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, to be a meer garbage
of pride and covetousness: To prevent which, the
Devil raiseth up another light,<note place="margin">Envied by the Devil.</note> or a thing as like to light
as himself is, when he is <hi>transformed into an Angel of
light.</hi> He found the people as desirous to gain their
Civil as their Religious Liberties. This he coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
helps on by a company of Professors,<note place="margin">Anabaptists trouble all.</note> pretending
to a more pure light, and perfect way of holiness by
a second Baptism, suggesting that men of light must
walk according to their light, and that they were
bound by no other Law, and so needed, neither Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,
nor Ministry: Nay, those Ordinances sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of <hi>Antichristian</hi> Tyranny. Hereupon they rose,
and ran up and down <hi>Germany,</hi> and like the waves of
the Sea, swallow up, and bear down all before them,
till dashing on a Rock, they break themselves in
pieces.</p>
                  <p>But before this storm,<note place="margin">Two of them come into <hi>Sueden,</hi> and cause much trouble.</note> two drops fall upon <hi>Sueden</hi>
by the coming over of two men with the <hi>Holland</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
during the interview of these two Kings.
These were <hi>Melchior Rincus,</hi> and <hi>Knipper Dolling,</hi>
who arriving at <hi>Stockholme,</hi> instill new principles into
the people, whence followed, that entring the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
down go Images, and Organs, and all such things
as they will call monuments of Idolatry. They made
also publick invectives against publick Worship, and
the Clergy, as <hi>Antichristian,</hi> suggesting that it were
better to have none at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> the King returning to <hi>Stockholme</hi> finds
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:62956:198"/>
much need of his presence,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gustavus</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth them.</note> and understanding of the
tumultuous Reformation, and the sad principles taken
up, he commits the two <hi>Evangelists</hi> to prison, and
afterwards banished them; but their poison was not
so easily cured.</p>
                  <p>The news of this Reformation at <hi>Stockholme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on spreadeth.</note>
spreads far, and wide over the Kingdome, and liberty
was so welcome to all, being newly crept from under a
Tyranny, that even good Government is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
question, and the King saw no way to pacifie the
storm, but by casting overboard to the people some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to keep the Whale from overturning the Ship:
and finding that he must adventure a breach with the
Pope,<note place="margin">The Pope ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme.</hi>
                     </note> who had lately sent a special Legate, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>de Potentia,</hi> with Authority to enquire of the
bloody Massacre made by <hi>Christian</hi> at <hi>Stockholme,</hi>
thereby to vindicate himself of so horrible a crime, and
that the Legate upon examination had judicially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
sentence, that nothing was done therein by
<hi>Christian</hi> but what was just and right;<note place="margin">The King vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> he therefore
told the people that he would visite all the Churches
in his own person, and make a reformation by the
advice of learned men; and accordingly the King in
person visited all the Churches throughout the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and informed himself of the state of them; but
coming to <hi>Upsal,</hi> he was opposed by the Archbishop,
and Canons; whereupon a Disputation was appointed,
wherein the King himself would be President: After
which he summoned all the States of <hi>Sueden</hi> to
meet, to whom he related what he found in his Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
requesting their help in directing some modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the work of Reformation,<note place="margin">A Convention of the Estates.</note> in Doctrine, and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:62956:199"/>
the worship of God, and in calming the violence
of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Clergy, which were such desperate
enemies to it; as also in regulating their abuse of the
Church-maintenance, which they spent in pride and
luxury, which ought to be imployed for the saving of
peoples souls.</p>
                  <p>Their answer was, that if the matter be made to
appear upon enquiry, they were of opinon that the
Temporalties belonging to the Clergy, may, and
ought to be seized, and the Church-maintenance also
secured, for the right ends and uses to which they
were appointed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> declaim against this, affirming,
that the Churches priviledges and revenues were
granted and confirmed to the Church by Kings and
Emperours; and therefore ought not to be invaded
under pain of damnation. To this it was replied, that
the true Elders were <hi>worthy of double honour,</hi> both of
reverence and maintenance; but such as are slow bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
neither serving God nor man, ought not to have
the Churches maintenance; and that if some Kings,
against all equity, permitted the same, other succeeding
Kings may, and ought to reform it; that there is not
one sentence in all the Scriptures that warranteth such
power in Church-men, or that countenanceth such
manner of living, especially in an unlawful way of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Civil Magstrate,<note place="margin">They leave the Church-reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposall of the King.</note> as hath been used in
<hi>Sueden</hi> for these last two hundred years. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
the States determined, that the Churches Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
are in the power of the King, according to
the condition of times, to encrease, maintain, or to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish,
as may best conduce to the safety of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:62956:199"/>
in Doctrine, and to the establishment of the
pure worship of God, and holiness of life.</p>
                  <p>Hence followed a storm of Imputations, and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations,<note place="margin">Popish lies, and slanders.</note>
Forreign Nations are made to believe that
the King is an <hi>Atheist,</hi> and that the common people in
<hi>Sueden</hi> obey a Devil in the shape of a man; but the
King sleighted these Scar-crows, as all Princes that
fixe their counsels upon good foundations, ought to
do; yet the common people in <hi>Sueden</hi> were enraged
hereby, and amongst these the <hi>Dallcarles,</hi> who were
the first in vindicating the peoples liberties,<note place="margin">The <hi>Dallcarles</hi> rebell.</note> are
now the first that appear to keep themselves and the
people in bondage; but they knew not who to pitch
upon for their leader; yet at length one was discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
called <hi>Nicholas Stur,</hi> reputed the son of <hi>Steno Stur</hi>
late Governour of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and he ascends the Stage
in <hi>West Gothland</hi> to act for the old Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the people also allured by his great name, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him, and so the War is now become <hi>Bellum
Episcopale,</hi> the Bishops War.</p>
                  <p>The King hears,<note place="margin">Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> and sees all, yet the hatred and
practices of these men move him not: He shewed
magnanimity in the Field, but never more than in this
case. He is but newly a King, and contrary to all
principles of policy, he is presently put upon an hard
task, even to change <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Government, and
their formerly received Religion, wherein he was to sail
against wind and tyde, and therfore though he was very
couragious; yet this daring adventure must rather be
attributed to his Faith, than to his Valour; and he met
with success accordingly, for the <hi>Dallcarles</hi> not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that bravery of spirit in their new Captain,<note place="margin">And are quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> as
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:62956:200"/>
might become a son of that famous <hi>Steno,</hi> began to
suspect that they might be in danger of a cheat, and
therefore they secretly sent to the Widow of <hi>Steno
Stur</hi> to enquire the truth: She tells the Messengers
plainly, that they were deceived, for that her son <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
was long since dead. This message caused the <hi>Dall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carles</hi>
presently to withdraw their assistance, fearing
that the cause of Religion will not bear them out,
unless patronized by one of the Royal blood of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
The <hi>Dallcarles</hi> now gone, the spirit presently
disappears, and is no where to be found, till he makes
another apparition at <hi>Rostock,</hi> where at the request of
the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> he was put to death; as also some
others of his party in <hi>Sueden</hi> were served in the like
manner,<note place="margin">Traytors exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</note> and so the storm blew away.</p>
                  <p>Yet the common people are still like a Sea;<note place="margin">A Famine causeth new stirs.</note> a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
comes upon the Land, and the Church-men
tell the people, that this is the fruit of their Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in matters of Religion, whereupon they are
again angry, and refuse to pay the Kings Tribute;
the King tells them that few of them understood
Gods words, and that fewer of them could make a right
judgement of his Works; that their stop of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
should not stop his course: He soon gathers an
Army, and marches to <hi>Westerass,</hi> and from thence
gives notice of his coming to them of the <hi>Dales,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quring
them to meet him at <hi>Terna,</hi> ready either to
fight for their cause, or to beg pardon for their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dalcarles</hi> like neither if they could help it;
Feign they would hold their old way of Religion,<note place="margin">Which are soon quieted.</note> yet
choose rather to submit, and to hazard their opinions
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:62956:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rather than their lives, and the issue was, some of
them were corporally punished, others reproved, and
sent home, giving security for their good behaviour;
and in the like manner, others in other places were so
served; onely the Archbishop of <hi>Upsal,</hi> being one of
the <hi>Popes</hi> sons, was admitted as a male-content to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
himself from his native Country.</p>
                  <p>The King being returned to <hi>Westerass,</hi> considered
with himself the danger of the Kingdome by reason
of the bad lives of the Clergy, and their neglect of
the peoples souls, and their restless endeavour to
bring his Government into dislike with the people,
and his person into contempt by imputations of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi>
and <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> to which some stop must be put
speedily,<note place="margin">Convention of Estates cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> or all would come to confusion: Hereupon
he called a <hi>Convention</hi> of all the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Sueden,</hi> to
whom he propounded to take into consideration the
State of the Nation,<note place="margin">The Kings Speech to them.</note> saying, that they all knew that
he neither sought, nor willingly undertook the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the same; that they all promised to assist
him therein, without whose help it was impossible for
him to Govern; that he now, contrary to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
found the people much dissatisfied through the
instigation of the Clergy, whose Lordship, and power
amongst them, you all (said he) know to be such, as
that now it is put into the ballance with the Kings; and
their luxury, pride, and idleness all the world knows
to be such, as is inconsistent with the duty of their
places, the good of the people, and righteous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
that their Castles and temporal Revenues
are exempted from the service and safeguard of the
Kingdome, to maintain Dissentions, Mutenies, and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:62956:201"/>
Rebellions; that for his part he must rather cease to
be a King, than to see all things in confusion under his
Government: and therefore <hi>I require</hi> (saith he) <hi>some
order to be taken by the Convention of the States for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
hereof, or else I am resolved to lay down my
Government, and leave it to them that can manage it to
better purpose; and hereof I desire a speedy and positive
answer from you the Bishops, and other States of this
Kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Bishops ears were deaf to these things:<note place="margin">The Bishops refuse to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</note>
their Authority, and Revenues were dearer to them,
than to part with them for words. They thought
they had the King at an advantage, which they purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to make use of: and the major part of the other
States, overswayed by the Bishops, did not so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
and resolutely appear for the King, as they
ought to have done, fearing the <hi>Popes</hi> Thunderbolt
more than the Kings displeasure.</p>
                  <p>The King being offended hereat, said, He would
never adventure one drop of <hi>Suedish</hi> bloud more, to
maintain his Government by a Civil Warre, wherein
the conquered must be miserable, and the Conqueror
unjust, and wherein friends must destroy one another:
and forthwith coming into the <hi>Convention</hi> of <hi>States,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He resigns his Kingdome to the States.</note>
he resigned up his Kingdome, and Government, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but a recompence for his service, and that
they would take his Inheritance at a moderate valew,
and so he departed into the Castle. This may seem
a strange example. <hi>Octavius</hi> only debated with the
Senate about laying down his Government,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but did it
not: <hi>Gustavus</hi> did it, and debated it not. <hi>They that
make Government their work, will be glad of rest: but
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:62956:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they that make it their sport, the people will sooner be
weary of them, than they of it. It seems Gustavus</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of those encouragements which were promised
from the <hi>Convention</hi> of <hi>States</hi> when he undertook the
Government; and for him to continue therein without
them in order to maintain the peoples liberty was
vain: and therefore if he herein followed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of some of his Ancestors, he may the rather
be excused, though hereby the Kingdome was left in
a confused condition.</p>
                  <p>The next day the States met again,<note place="margin">The Nobles oppose the Bishops.</note> and in cold
blood, and upon second thoughts told the Bishops,
that the Kingdome must not be ruined to satisfie their
lusts, and that if they would not be equal judges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
themselves, and the people, others must: yet
(said they) <hi>you shall be once more heard what you can say
for your selves:</hi> And hereupon a Conference was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
wherein Dr. <hi>Olaus</hi> appeared for the King,
and Dr. <hi>Gallen</hi> for the Bishops; and the point about
<hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> power was largely debated, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
the longer it lasted, the more it touched the
quick, so that many of the hearers saw cause to alter
their opinions about Prelacy, insomuch as upon the
third day the Voters for the people urged the Bishops
positively to submit to the King: But if they meant
otherwise to expose the Nation to extremity, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
should come thereby, they vowed to be revenged
upon the Authours thereof; and to this, the greater
part of the Nobles agreed. At length the plurality of
Votes prevailed,<note place="margin">They request him to reas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> and a message was sent into the
Castle to <hi>Gustavus</hi> by a person of quality, to beseech
him to return into the <hi>Convention</hi> of States, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:62956:202"/>
not, and a second message prevailed as little, till
a third message presented by persons of near Relation
to him prevailed to bring him to the <hi>Convention,</hi>
where he was received by all the States with the
greatest observancy that could be, all making it their
humble request, that he would not reject the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in such a juncture of affairs, withall, promising
their utmost, and faithful assistance. The King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
with himself, that though it was an ill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with him to be alwayes labouring, and yet never
to do the work; yet it was much worse to grow weary
before he had attained to the shore, for that was the
next door to drowning; whereupon he took up a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to neglect mens opinions and censures, and to
see to what issue he could bring the Counsels of the
<hi>Conventions</hi> of <hi>Estates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At last it was concluded that the Bishops should
render up their Castles and Temporalties to the Kings
disposal,<note place="margin">The Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties of the Bishops given to the King.</note> and submit to live upon such Pensions as
should be allowed them by the States, saving ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
the titles, interests and right of the Nobility,
and others, to any part of the said Temporalities,
which by the distemper of the times, had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached
upon: But the execution hereof proved
more difficult; many being unwilling to disrobe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
before they went to bed.</p>
                  <p>Such as were worst affected were soonest at the
issue, as desperate persons, through conscience of
their guilt, conclude that no mercy is to be had, and
therefore they had as good pass the Pikes at first as at
last. Only the Bishop of <hi>Hincopen</hi> was loth to part
with his Castle of <hi>Monkbed,</hi> about which he held
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:62956:202"/>
some debate, but in conclusion was ordered to deliver
possession at a day prefixed, and in the mean time to
put in security for the performance thereof, and not to
disturb the publick peace. The King would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his Army till all was done, and at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
he marched with it to the Castle of <hi>Monkbed,</hi>
where he was sumptuously feasted by the Bishop, who
gave so great content to the King, that he discharged
the Bishops Sureties, and at his request, allowed him
to visit the Churches of <hi>Gothland,</hi> where, having
gotten much Treasure, without taking leave of the
King, he took shipping, and sailed to <hi>Dantzick,</hi> where,
after some years,<note place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>Hincope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> flies.</note> he dyed. And thus <hi>Sueden</hi> gave a
leading example to the Eastern Nations of regulating,
and restoring the Church-revenues to the right ends
for which they were intended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> having now reigned five years since his
first election,<note place="margin">The Clergies pride abated.</note> and having thus far prevailed to pare the
nails, and clip the wings of the Lordly Clergy, he
thought that now he might hearken to the advice of
his States, and give them satisfaction by being
Crowned, and thereupon he appointed a day to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize
his Coronation at <hi>Upsal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gustavus</hi> is crowned.</note> which accordingly
was performed, after he had served at the helm of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
seven years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gustavus</hi> his spirit,<note place="margin">Reformatiou carried on.</note> which was alwayes daring,
grew yet more brave: His aims are yet higher, <hi>viz.</hi> at
a reformation in Doctrine, Worship, and holiness of
life; for which end he first placed in all the <hi>Cathedrals,</hi>
men eminent for learning, holiness, and eloquence, to
preach the word of God, enjoyning the Bishops out
of the Church-revenues, to provide them such Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:62956:203"/>
as might encourage them in the work. The
King also kept set times every week to hear them in
his own person before he sent them forth,<note place="margin">The Kings piety.</note> &amp; this he did,
as well to satisfie his own conscience, as to encourage
others to attend upon publick Ordinances. But now
comes the trial, the <hi>States</hi> had agreed, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
had in shew submitted as to their Temporalties;
but when the Reformation in Doctrine, Worship, and
conversation was promoted,<note place="margin">Satan rages.</note> the Devil roars, and will
not so easily be cast out of the whole Nation of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">So do the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</note>
The Minister that was sent to preach at <hi>Scaren,</hi>
was so entertained by the Bishop, and his party, that
he was forced to flye to <hi>Upland</hi> to save his life; and the
Rector of the College undertaking to expound St.
<hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel, was in danger of being stoned by
the Schollars, who were encouraged thereto by the
Lords, and great men that joyned with the Bishop, in
this undertaking. Some also both of the great men,
and Commons of <hi>West-Gothland</hi> hearing hereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirred
themselves,<note place="margin">And others that affected Popery.</note> not for the Bishops sake (say they)
but because our Religion is invaded by this new <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi>
Doctrine of <hi>Luther;</hi> and upon this account they
sent Letters to <hi>Small and</hi> to stir them up to take Arms,
who were easily perswaded thereto, and seized upon
such as would not joyn with them, and amongst others,
upon the Countess of <hi>Hoy,</hi> the Kings own sister.
They wrote also to those in the <hi>Dales,</hi> and other
neighbouring Provinces to send their Deputies to a
meeting appointed by them at <hi>Larva,</hi> so uncertain is
the love of the people. Thus the <hi>Scene</hi> of War is
changed, and though <hi>Tyranny</hi> was in the Van, and
<hi>Prelacy</hi> in the main Battel, yet <hi>Popery</hi> brought up
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:62956:203"/>
the Rear; and all tended to bring the Nation into
its old condition, rather than to suffer such a change.
So unsensible are men of their present happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>This storm the King might rationally foresee, by what
he found in the case of <hi>Prelacy;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Kings courage.</note> yet his courage leads
him on even to astonishment, having nothing to back
him but a good cause and a good conscience; and truly,
though Polititians might condemn him, yet the issue
justified him. For the Inhabitants of <hi>West-Gothland</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that the generality of the people,<note place="margin">The Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers disagree.</note> had sworn
Allegiance to the King, thereupon demurred upon the
business; as also the Kings merits, their enjoyment of
their Laws and Liberties, and that, as to the point of
<hi>Heresie</hi> objected against the King, they were no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judges; and that, considering the Kings piety,
they had no cause to beleeve it, but rather to judge it
a scandal raised by his enemies. Hereupon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
Lords grew into differences amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,<note place="margin">Some flye.</note>
and the Bishop, and one other of them fled
into <hi>Denmark,</hi> whither the Kings Letter pursued them,
alleging that it was contrary to their agreement, that
either King should harbour the others enemies, so that
they were feign to flye from thence into <hi>Mecklemburgh;</hi>
and the other Lords (forgetting what they had done)
stood upon their justification, alledging that they
were forced to it by the heads that were absent in
Forrein parts;<note place="margin">Others put themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on triall.</note> and that they never promoted, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
the Rebellion either by advice, letters, or
instructions, and therefore would stand to their trial
at Law.</p>
                  <p>The King and his Council wondered at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:62956:204"/>
advising them rather to stand to the Kings
mercy, and to crave his pardon: but they refused
any mercy but what the Law would allow. At last
the King produced their own Letters wherein they had
written to the Provinces to take Arms, and so being
self-condemned,<note place="margin">Are cast, and condemned.</note> two of them suffered death, one
was ransomed, and the rest begging pardon, were
received to mercy: which excellent temperature in
the execution of Justice commended, and confirmed
the King in his new-begun Kingdome,<note place="margin">The Kings prudence.</note> making the
people both to fear, and love him. And thus was
this stir (for Warre I cannot call it) about <hi>Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
quieted, not with the Kings sweat, and labour,
but by God alone, whose cause it was.</p>
                  <p>The King taking into his consideration that the King
of <hi>Denmarks</hi> carriage in this matter,<note place="margin">Another inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the two Kings.</note> suited not with
the former agreement made betwixt them, and being
unwilling that the same should be invalidated in the
least point <hi>(wise men who will preserve friendship, must
stop the breach whilst it is small)</hi> he prevailed for an
other interview, that they might understand each
others minde more fully, and hereby the former agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was explained, enlarged, and confirmed, and so
parting in love, they returned with joy.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Sueden</hi> after so many storms;<note place="margin">The Kings marriage.</note> now
hoped for peace, and a settled Government, and having
been three years a Crowned King, he purposed to
build up his Family by Marriage, which he solemnized
with the Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of
<hi>Saxony,</hi> at <hi>Stockholme,</hi> and now he must abide the
issues, and events of the affairs of the Kingdome, to
be theirs for better, and worse, and what he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:62956:204"/>
bound to do, meerly for the Nations-sake, he
must now do for the sake of his own Family and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
And thus having laid the foundation of his
own house,<note place="margin">His Piety.</note> he proceeds to the further building up of
the house of God; for though he had before seized
upon the Temporalties of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> yet their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
so far as they concerned Church Government, he
took not away, nor that maintenance which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the Ministry: The <hi>States</hi> also settled
Pensions upon such as should be <hi>Overseers,</hi> or Bishops,
to have care of the Churches, and to these places (as
was said before) the King had sent choise men for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
learning, and holiness of life, and now he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
two brethren,<note place="margin">He preferrs godly Bishops.</note> Dr. <hi>Laurentius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Olaus,</hi> the
one to be Archbishop of <hi>Upsal,</hi> the other to be Bishop
of <hi>Stockholme,</hi> through whose care and industry, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with other reformed Bishops, the Reformation
of Religion much prospered in the Kingdome during
their lives,<note place="margin">Reformation carried on.</note> which was for the space of about thirty
years;<note place="margin">The Bible translated.</note> and through their study and diligence it was
principally that the <hi>Bible</hi> was translated into the <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi>
Language; and being printed, was dispersed into
every Town through the Nation.</p>
                  <p>But the time of the Kings rest was not yet come:
A strange apparition proceeds from the <hi>Belgick</hi>
shore unto the Coast of <hi>Norway, Christian</hi> the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> now long since reputed, as bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

with twenty five Ships sailed from <hi>Enchusen</hi> to the
Coast of <hi>Norwey;</hi> but by the way having lost ten of
them, they arrived only with the rest, and before they
were aware they were imprisoned by the Ice, all that
Winter. Yet was <hi>Christian</hi> at liberty all that while
to work his designs upon that Country of <hi>Norwey,</hi> the
<hi>Danes</hi> being at that season wholly disinabled to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him. As many therefore of the great men of
<hi>Norwey</hi> as pleased,<note place="margin">policy.</note> had free correspondence with <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:</hi>
Only the Governour of <hi>Agger-house</hi> Castle
dealt subtilly with him, refusing to surrender it to
<hi>Christian,</hi> but upon such terms as might stand with his
honour. <hi>For</hi> (said he) <hi>though I acknowledge</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<hi>to be King of these three Northern Kingdomes; yet
for the honour of my Family, I desire leave to write to</hi>
Frederick <hi>the now King of</hi> Denmark, <hi>for present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi>
(which in common reason he cannot send during
Winter) <hi>otherwise I will tell him that I must surrender
the Castle to King</hi> Christian; <hi>and by this means your
Majesty will be no loser, and my honour shall be saved.
Christian</hi> was contented herewith, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
dispatched his messenger into <hi>Denmark,</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Frost, he had such supply sent him
as enabled him to stand upon his own defence. Upon
this <hi>Christian</hi> prepared for a siege, during the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
whereof, as the besieged were relieved by the
<hi>Danes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Some <hi>Suedes</hi> revolt to him.</note> so were the besiegers not onely by the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
but by many Runegadoes out of <hi>Sueden:</hi> such
was their old love to <hi>Christian,</hi> and their hatred to
<hi>Gustavus;</hi> and these flocking to <hi>Christian</hi> from all
parts, soliciting the <hi>Dallcarles</hi> (who were now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged
from their King) to revolt with them to their
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:62956:207"/>
former King, who (as they said) was through afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
become quite another man, changed into a meek
and compassionate nature, and a gracious deportment,
and would doubtless imbrace them readily, and give
them all the assurance they could desire; they told
them also that Forregn Princes would assist him, for
that they liked not such presidents of Subjects depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their King. And above all, they might hereby
assure themselves that they should be received into
the bosome of the Church, and into the favour of the
<hi>Pope.</hi> These, and such like motives were suggested
to the <hi>Dallcarles:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Others were more wise.</note> But old Birds would not be catched
with chaffe; few of them gave any credit to these
things, and many derided them, knowing that nature
is no changeling, except it be overpowred by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
principles: that the manner of <hi>Christians</hi>
coming, shewed little signs of repentance for any other
thing, than for that he had parted with the Crown upon
such easie tearms: that the differences between <hi>Gusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>
their King, and them, were but lately begun, and
might easily be composed; but those between <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
and them, were beyond a cure. The revolted
<hi>Suedes</hi> seeing this, soon disappear, and the Winter
being now almost ended, and <hi>Christian</hi> finding his
party discouraged, and the stream still after six years
so strong against him, and being grown weary of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
upon the <hi>Germain</hi> courtesie, he chose rather to
cast himself upon a Treaty with his Uncle the King of
<hi>Denmark,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">King <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> foolish credulity.</note> than to return into <hi>Brabant,</hi> and having
conditions proffered him by the <hi>Danish</hi> Admiral of
safe conduct whilst he treated with his Uncle, and in
case of non-agreement, that he should have liberty
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:62956:208"/>
to go whither he would, he sails with the Admira
into <hi>Denmark,</hi> never so much as enquiring whether
the Admiral had power to grant such conditions or
not.</p>
                  <p>Coming into <hi>Denmark,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He is made a prisoner.</note> before he was aware, he
was made a Prisoner, gaining onely this advantage,
that now he was maintained honourably upon the
publick charge of the Kingdome, as one that formerly
had been their King, whereas if he had been else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
he must have lived upon the curtesie of such
as would have pitied him; and yet this is observable,
that the <hi>Danish</hi> Admiral had no thanks for this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and many thought that it would have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for <hi>Denmark,</hi> if the Prisoner had been in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Country: For though it be true, that deposing
of Kings by their subjects is sadly resented by other
Princes; yet it is only whilst the sore is green, and the
flesh tender, which may occasion some anger from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
for the present;<note place="margin">Note.</note> but if upon some trial, they
get nothing, Forreign Princes so love their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and peaceable Government, that by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
the wound breeds stupefaction, and they will
engage no more.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching <hi>Sueden,</hi> who was not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this business of <hi>Norwey,</hi> its worthy our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
how the breach between the King and the
<hi>Dallcarles</hi> was first made; for though the occasion
was small, yet the mischief might have been exceeding
great. The matter was briefly thus:</p>
                  <p>The Kings debts to the <hi>Lubeckers</hi> for their service
in the time of his Was,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Sueden</hi> meets with new troubles.</note> were not yet fully satisfied,
and now payment was required with some eagerness,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:62956:208"/>
but how they should be paid, and how the money
levied, admitted great matter of debate; some were
for a Tax, but that was thought would go hardly
down with the people, who were so exhausted by ten
years Wars. Others were of opinion that the profit
of the Mines might be assigned to the <hi>Lubeckers</hi> for
certain years, but then they knew not how the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
should be maintained without them? At last
a project was propounded to give the King the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
Bell save one out of every steeple within his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
which (as was alledged) would do the work,
and no particular man should have any loss,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>
                     </note> nor the
publick be prejudiced. But this was a great mistake as
things then stood: for the Merchants had engrossed
much Copper, and if this proceeded, they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
they could get no Market. It was said, this was
no good reason, being of too private a nature, to be
ballanced with the publick good. Then the quarrel
was about the condition of these Bells: It was said,
they were anointed, and consecrated to an holy use,
and ought not to be imployed for prophane uses; but
this also was judged invalid, the opinion being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon superstitious principles: But be it granted that
the anointing, and consecrating them was superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
yet if any property be at all in such devoted
things, that property remaineth till it be legally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
and until then, the seizing of such things, and
converting them to other uses, will in the vulgar opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fall under the notion of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> which hath been
alwayes abominable even amongst the <hi>Heathen,</hi> though
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t were done in the wilde Wars: Or if it comes not
under that notion, then it must be in the nature of a
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:62956:209"/>
gift to the people of the Parish, either for
their pleasure, or for the more convenient assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
them to publick duties; in both which
cases the unlawful seizing upon them is looked upon as a
common plunder, and invasion of the goods of the
whole body of the people at once, which is a sad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
that no mans particular estate is his own any
longer under such a Government. And it seems the
people of <hi>Sueden</hi> had such an apprehension of this
president; for after it was resolved upon, and began
to be put in execution, an insurrection was made, and
the people stood up in defence of their Bells,<note place="margin">Tumults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Bells.</note> so that
some could not be removed, others that were taken
down, and carrying away, were pursued and rescued,
and the officers that were imployed, were well beaten
for their pains.</p>
                  <p>This being reported to the King, he called a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>
of the <hi>States,</hi> which would have been more
seasonable before the business of the Bells had made
such a jangling. This <hi>Convention</hi> of <hi>States</hi> met at
<hi>Upsall:</hi> But the <hi>Dallcarles,</hi> who were most eager for
their Bells, summon another <hi>Convention</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at <hi>Arbogg,</hi> so that here was one Parliament against
another. <hi>The people</hi> (saith the Historian) <hi>are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
of that temper, that they will either serve humbly,
or govern proudly. True liberty</hi> (which is the golden
mean) <hi>they neither know how to want, nor how to use,
especially such as the</hi> Suedes <hi>now were, trained up in
Warre; who therefore chose rather to lose their peace
than their Bells.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Parliament at <hi>Arbogg</hi> thrives not: few
hearkened to their summons: yet did they set a good
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:62956:209"/>
face upon the matter, and sending Messengers to the
King,<note place="margin">Subjects treat with their King.</note> they protest their fidelity, yet desired his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to two requests: One, that the King would not
send more forces into the Country of the <hi>Dallcarles</hi>
than they should deem convenient for them to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
The other, not to set any Governour over them,
but such an one as was of their own Country, and
neighbourhood. The Kings spirit was too great to
like of conditions from his Subjects, yet his wisdome
prevailed to take into consideration the condition of
his affairs. He considered that <hi>Christian</hi> was now in
<hi>Norwey:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Kings policy.</note> That Winter was newly begun: That the
<hi>Norwegians</hi> were inclined to assist <hi>Christian:</hi> And that
if the <hi>Dallcarles</hi> should be further provoked, the issue,
might be doubtfull. He therefore dissembled his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
and sent them a Governour according to
their desire: But at the end of three years, he raised
an Army,<note place="margin">He punishes the Rebels.</note> and seized upon the chief Authors of this
rebellion, and put them to death: and further, to
bring down the pride of the <hi>Dallcarles,</hi> he seized upon
their liberties, and so levelled them with the rest of the
people.</p>
                  <p>This was the first malignant design against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Gustavus,</hi> in favour of the cause of the
deposed King, which, like a <hi>Granado</hi> firing in the air,
spent it self before it fell: but it proved not the last.
For soon after the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> died, leaving
<hi>Christian</hi> a prisoner to the Lords of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who
differing in their opinions as to the election of a King,<note place="margin">The King of Denmark dies.</note>
spent two years in an <hi>Interregnum:</hi> during which
time, some sought to promote the Son of the deceased
King, which was but a child, and therefore more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:62956:210"/>
of counsell, and herein the Bishops joyned.
Others acted for the Duke of <hi>Holst:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An <hi>Interreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> there.</note> and some were
for restoring <hi>Christian,</hi> then a prisoner, to the Crown
again. This was one summons to the King of <hi>Sueden</hi>
to look about him, and kept him off from punishing the
<hi>Dallcarles</hi> for the matter about the Bells. But there
was another thing that was no less dangerous, though
the effect was not like to be so sudden, and that was this</p>
                  <p>About this time there was a change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Lubeck</hi> from the <hi>Popish</hi> to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> way,<note place="margin">Reformation of Religion in <hi>Lubeck.</hi>
                     </note>
which although in it self it suited well enough with the
King of <hi>Suedens</hi> mind, yet in such alterations there is
commonly one man more active than the rest, who in
such alterations of Religion becomes an instrument of
altering the Government. And such an one the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beckers</hi>
had fitted for the purpose: His name was
<hi>Woolweaver,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Woolweaver,</hi> a turbulent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> a man whose education was answerable
to his name: Him they made Consul of the City, and
he being gotten up, was blown higher by affecting po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity,
and undertaking to be a Protector to the
poor, who were now much encreased in the City, the
principal cause whereof, he alledged to be the King of
<hi>Suedens</hi> abridging them in their priviledges, contrary to
his agreement made with them, when they assisted him
in his Wars; as also that he had countenanced trade
from, and with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and other Nations; for a
remedy, whereof <hi>Woolweaver</hi> counselled them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to draw the <hi>Danes</hi> to joyn with the <hi>Lubeckers</hi>
against all trading with <hi>Sueden</hi> from without the
<hi>Baltick</hi> Sea.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Danes</hi> told them that they thought it not
meet to conclude in things of that nature till they
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:62956:210"/>
were better settled in their Government,<note place="margin">The <hi>Danes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to joyn with <hi>Woolwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
                     </note> and were
ageeed about the party that should be their King:
And finding it more necessary to keep good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with <hi>Sueden</hi> (because of the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of a party amongst themselves to advance <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
to the Throne again) they acquainted the King
of <hi>Sueden</hi> with the designs of the <hi>Lubeckers. Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaver</hi>
stormed at this, and without blushing, faces
about, and propounds to the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> to joyn
with him against the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> But <hi>Gustavus</hi> his
counsel was rather to manage well the matter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Denmark,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">So doth <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stavus.</hi>

<hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>the</hi> Danish <hi>affairs are as a Sea of many

keep not constant watch, you may be in danger of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack;
and therefore as imbarked in one, and the same

best conduce to the concurrent interest of both Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Woolweaver</hi> finding himself thus disappointed in
both these places,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Woolweavers</hi> pride.</note> grew angry, and like one lifted up
from below, lifted up his thoughts higher than his

had advanced <hi>Gustavus</hi> to the Throne, so he would
pull him down again, and thereupon entertained cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency

they fall lower.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Hoy</hi> thought it not enough to be the

King, his brother, his kindred, and Country; and
what he gained thereby, will afterwards appear.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time many retire to him out of <hi>Sueden,</hi>
principally by reason of the disturbances in <hi>Smalland,</hi>
which himself had kindled before his departure thence,
and which afterwards were fomented by a company
of lawless persons who had combined themselves
against the Kings Justices there, and carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with so high an hand, that it came to blood, even
to the slaughter of the Kings Lieutenant in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and when the King had suppressed them by force of

till they could retire themselves to the Earle of <hi>Hoy,</hi>
                     <pb n="397" facs="tcp:62956:211"/>
whose party being thus increased, waited all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
which occasioned the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> to stand
rather upon his watch, than upon his defence; for
they did him no harm, God having provided other
means to clip their wings without the labour of the
King of <hi>Sueden.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Woolweaver</hi> according to his design, being
strengthened by these aides, soon imployed it about
his principal work, which was to settle his Neighbours,
the <hi>Danes,</hi> in a fitting posture for his purpose. For the
present condition of <hi>Denmark</hi> was this: The Nobles
were divided (as was said before) about the election of
a King, divers were for <hi>John,</hi> the son of the former
King, though a childe, and that principally upon the
account of Religion, which his Father had changed
into the <hi>Lutheran</hi> way, and they hoped the sonne
would the rather uphold it. This the Bishops smelt
out, and sought the advancement of the <hi>Popish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and therefore would have the Government
managed by Administratorship; and in their own
names they published <hi>Injunctions,</hi> wherein they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
all the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Preachers to depart out of the
Country by a day prefixed. This being like to fall
heavy upon the Cities of <hi>Hafnia,</hi> and <hi>Malmogia,</hi> who
yet were loath to make a breach, they prevailed to
have the Government by Administratorship advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and withall invited <hi>Christian</hi> Duke of <hi>Holst</hi> to be
Administrator for <hi>John,</hi> the former Kings son, but
he disclaimed it. Then they had recourse to, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with the Duke of <hi>Aldenburgh</hi> (who professed
the Doctrine of <hi>Luther)</hi> to accept thereof, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
came to <hi>Hafnia</hi> with a party; and when he was
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:62956:212"/>
there, perceiving many whisperings about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
of their deposed King, the Duke to gain the
greater party, declared his willingness for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settlement
of him, whereby he won much upon the
common people. For <hi>Christian</hi> drove on the same
trade in <hi>Denmark</hi> as he had formerly done in <hi>Sueden,</hi>
flattering the people into a party against the Lords,
which (as an Historian saith) is the ready way to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
<hi>Woolweaver,</hi> though he was more passionate,
than wise, takes this opportunity, and sides with
the Duke of <hi>Aldenburgh,</hi> and prevails with him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
against the Duke of <hi>Holst,</hi> who had divers of
the Lords of <hi>Denmark</hi> that joyned with him to make
him King; but in this the Duke of <hi>Aldenburghs</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
was frustrated; for he lost the day, and was
beaten out of the Field by the Duke of <hi>Holst.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now was the Duke of <hi>Holst</hi> brought upon the
stage to act his part for the Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to procure his own rest and safety; and observing
that the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> was left out of the play, he
invites him to bear a part in the Game for <hi>Woolweavers</hi>
sake. The King of <hi>Sueden</hi> well knowing his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
made little difficulty of the matter; and
though <hi>Woolweaver</hi> endeavoured to stop that muse by
a fair message, yet the King would not so be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
but told the messengers of their Masters
entertainment of the <hi>Suedish Runnegadoes,</hi> and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
them; and being informed that the people
in <hi>Denmark</hi> sided with the Duke of <hi>Aldenburgh,</hi>
for their deposed King,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gustavus</hi> joyns with the Lords of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</hi>
                     </note> he thought it not fit to

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:62956:212"/>
of divers places for the use of the Duke of
<hi>Holst.</hi> The <hi>Danish</hi> Lords also seeing which way the
current ran, and themselves deserted by the people,
joyned with the Duke of <hi>Holst,</hi> and engaged him for
the Crown in good earnest.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Aldenburgh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Aldenburgh</hi> beaten.</note> seeing
what interest he had with the common people, thought
all safe, and therefore took his ease, and enjoyed his
pleasure. But the Duke of <hi>Holst</hi> did not so; he sent
the <hi>Danish</hi> Lords into <hi>Jutland</hi> with an Army, who
soon settled that Country, and from thence marched
into <hi>Fionia,</hi> where in one Battel all the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburghs</hi>
hopes were dashed, and the Earle of <hi>Hoy</hi>
was sacrificed to the King of <hi>Suedens</hi> pleasure; the
Archbishop of <hi>Upsal</hi> also, and divers other disaffected
<hi>Suedes</hi> were slain in the Battel.</p>
                  <p>The news hereof coming to <hi>Lubeck,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     </note> made <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaver</hi>
once more tack about, and hearing that <hi>Suanto,</hi>
the son of <hi>Steno Stur,</hi> sometimes Governour of
<hi>Sueden,</hi> was in the Duke of <hi>Saxonies</hi> Court, he
suborned a messenger to him as from his Mother, to
meet her at <hi>Malla,</hi> where (it was said) she waited
with convenience for him: Hereupon he repaired
to <hi>Malla,</hi> where instead of meeting with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he was met with by a Troop of Horse from
<hi>Lubeck,</hi> who offered him in the name of the City, great
honours if he will be advised by them, and so by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisal,
they conveyed him to <hi>Lubeck,</hi> where he was
saluted by <hi>Woolweaver</hi> the Consul, with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of joy, who minded him of the unsetled
state of the Northern Kingdomes, and of the private
disaffection of the <hi>Suedes</hi> to their King. Adding that
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:62956:213"/>
now there was a fair opportunity offered to him to
recover the Government of <hi>Sueden,</hi> which place was
so famously managed by his Ancestors. That <hi>Lubeck</hi>
had an Army in readiness,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Suanto's</hi> fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> wanting onely his consent
to be their Leader. That it was expected that he should
now shew himself worthy of such Progenitors: But
<hi>Suanto</hi> had sworn Allegiance to <hi>Gustavus,</hi> and meant
to observe it, and therefore refused the proffers, and
demanded liberty to depart, or else that <hi>Woolweaver</hi>
would shew cause why he was detained Prisoner.
<hi>Woolweaver</hi> seeing no good was to be done, told him
that he was no prisoner, and that it was free for him to
go when, and whither he pleased, only earnestly desiring
that where ever he went, he would retain a favourable
opinion of the City.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Sueden</hi> being informed of these passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
was thereby sharpened in the pursuit of the Duke
of <hi>Holsts</hi> interest upon the main land of <hi>Schonen,</hi> and
in a short time brought all the Country to submit to
him, onely the City of <hi>Malmogia,</hi> and some other
neighbouring Castles held out for the Duke of <hi>Alden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
from whom they expected relief; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
the Duke, with the Duke of <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> and
the Duke of <hi>Mecklenburgh,</hi> joyning all their strength
together, resolve to adventure all upon the issue of
one Battel with the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi>

                        <hi>Aldenburgh</hi> beaten.</note> wherein their

that within a few dayes all the Country was wholly
for the Duke of <hi>Holst,</hi> which but a week before was

                  <p>
                     <hi>Haffnia</hi> had now been besieged above half a year by
the Duke of <hi>Holst,</hi> which City was only left as the glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:62956:213"/>

<hi>Christian</hi> the deposed King had time enough to try the
curtesie of the house of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> but none of that
house would stir in his behalf, and which was more
unhappy for the besieged, the affairs of <hi>Lubeck</hi> were
faced about to the Reer. For the <hi>Hans-Towns</hi> in their
general meeting, perceiving that the affairs of <hi>Lubeck</hi>
had for these five years last past been wholly swayed
by <hi>Woolweaver,</hi> under a pretence of Religion, and
that the City by that means was brought into such
difficulties that they knew not how to come off, either
with credit or safety; they therupon concluded (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the counsel sent by the Emperor to the City) that
the former Government should be restored at <hi>Lubeck,</hi>
not at all medling with the matter of Religion; and
because they would salve the credit of <hi>Woolweaver,</hi>
they commended him to the Government of <hi>Bergeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doffe.
Woolweaver</hi> was not therewith contented, and
therefore at his departure out of the City, vowed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
and the Senate at <hi>Lubeck,</hi> being now changed,
considering the restless spirit of <hi>Woolweaver,</hi> were as

procured him to be imprisoned, and afterwards char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
him with Treason against the State of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> he
was put to death, and quartered. And now <hi>Lubeck</hi>
was setled upon its old basis, and flourished again,
leaving this lesson to such as would be States-men,
<hi>That miscarriages in Government, are not reformed by

                        <hi>Haffnia</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note> was surrendred upon tearms,
not altogether so honourable for the Duke of <hi>Holst,</hi>
as might have been expected: whereupon the King
of <hi>Sueden</hi> told the Duke, that being privy to his own
engagements in the Dukes behalf, he little expected
that such an agreement should ever have been made
by the Duke without his knowledge, and in one thing,
not without his consent. <hi>For</hi> (said he) <hi>why should I be
excluded out of this agreement, and you thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
your self not to aid me in case I should not agree
with the</hi> Lubeckers <hi>upon just tearms.</hi> The Duke plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he was necessitated to it to gain the present
surrender of the City; as also that the importunity of the
Lords, and his neighbour Princes drew him thereto:
nevetheless he assured the King, that if he would send
Ambassadours, he should finde that he should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any damage thereby. And accordingly the
King did send Ambassadours; but the <hi>Lubeckers</hi>
could never prevail to have a resettlement of their
priviledges in <hi>Sueden</hi> as they desired:<note place="margin">The King makes a truce with <hi>Lubeck.</hi>
                     </note> so that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
there was onely a bare truce concluded
betwixt them, and the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> for five
years.</p>
                  <p>Thus are the three Northern Kingdomes brought
once more into a settlement, and turbulent <hi>Lubeck</hi>
was calmed, and the Captive King in a manner twice
captivated, and now if not quite hopeless, yet less
hopeful than ever formerly. <hi>England</hi> indeed was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied,
and had done what it thought meet, and possibly
more than was meet. For Ambassadours were sent
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:62956:214"/>
from hence to draw the Lords to a Treaty; but they
liked not to adventure their necks upon purposes and
promises. The Emperour did less, either judging
<hi>Christians</hi> person despicable by reason of his unworthy
carriage to his Queen, and Lords; or the Lords were
more wise and wary than to adventure upon a second
trial of their late Kings curtesie, unless they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
thereto by force: To do which, the Emperour
had neither time, nor money to spare, though the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
lay as fair to do his brother a good turn as
he could desire, if he had intended it. And lastly,
though the common people did what they could, yet
they effected nothing.<note place="margin">Note.</note>

where both King and people might have leisure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
their several lots. The King had hitherto acted
the Souldiers part very well, and now he must try his
skill in a peaceable Government, wherein I shall onely
set down the brief Contents of many Laws, and Acts
of State, which shew rather the disposition of the
Government, than the several actions thereof. The
King now at leisure, taking into consideration that the
fewel which maintained the Civil War was now spent,
and that the people who had been trained up to the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:62956:215"/>
toyl of War, were fitter for labour than leisure; and
considering also that a time must come when a
Commonwealth, reduced by War, must be governed
and maintained by peace; he now applied himself to
acquaint his people with matters of profit, drawing
them to Mining, Husbandry, Fishing, and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
all which were much advanced by the Kings
own ingenuous contrivances; and by encouraging the
laborious, banishing idleness, punishing vagabonds,
and wanderers, he found a way to make the Sea to serve
the Land, the Land to serve Men, Men to serve their
Nation, the Nation to observe their King, and both
Nation and King to serve God; and thereby he laid a
far better building of <hi>Sueden</hi> than <hi>Augustus</hi> did of
<hi>Rome,</hi> of whom it was said, <hi>That he found it of earth,
and left it of stone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The people likewise soon found the sweetness of
this Government, and were not far behinde in requital
of the Kings favour to them. They had now lived
twenty years under his Government, and in a good
measure found the benefit of peace, though bought
with their sweat and blood in a long War; but how
sad would it be, if the last breath of the King should
put an end to their happiness?<note place="margin">The Crown of <hi>Sueden</hi> is made succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and why.</note> The Council there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at their meeting, taking this into consideration that
the Government of <hi>Sueden</hi> by Election was alwayes
uncertain, and seldome effected without deceit, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and oft-times at the price of the peoples blood;
that it is of short continuance, depending upon the
life of one man, and prejudicial to the publick good.
For that in such cases, Kings will deplume their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to feather their own nests, to keep their young
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:62956:215"/>
ones warm, when themselves are gone; and that it were
far better for the people to be sucked by one Leech,
which in time might be satisfied, than by the change
of many, who will but increase the pain, and suck
without satiety. That the advancement of one Family
to the Throne would be a cure to all this, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
to a wining aspect from it upon the people,
and of a due respect from them to it, and so of a kind
of conjugal affection between both against the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
day. That it is a means to suppress the turbulent
aimes of ambitious men, who croud into the Throne,
though of all others they be most unworthy. Besides,
that it secureth the present Government in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
possession of him that enjoyes it. And that upon
these, and such like grounds, <hi>Augustus,</hi> and other <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperours, who wanting issue, used in their life times
to adopt, and declare their successours in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and trained them up for that service; nor
did they finde it dangerous either for themselves, or
their successours so to do. That the people at the siege
of <hi>Stockholme</hi> offered to settle the Government upon
the King, and his children, when at that time he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had any, nor was married: But now that he is
married, and hath children, and hath given such large
experience of his love, industry, and faithfulness in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing
all that he had, even to his own life to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the honour of his Country: What acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
can be sufficient for so great a merit, less
than the settlement of the Crown of <hi>Sueden</hi> upon
him, and his posterity for ever?</p>
                  <p>This was the result of their debates, and thus it
was resolved unanimously at the Council held at
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:62956:216"/>
                     <hi>Orebrogia,</hi> that it should be propounded by them to
the <hi>Convention</hi> of <hi>States</hi> that it might be confirmed
for future ages. All which by an Instrument under
their hands they professed to be done by them freely,
and of their own accord without any constraint. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Kings Enemies scoffed hereat, as if he had
suffered a Crown to be forced upon his Family against
his will. Others pretended Religion against it, as if
God liked not that men should contrive perpetuities;
which is true, yet doth he like that men should be
provident in establishing Justice, Truth, and Peace in
a Nation; for which end himself did settle the Crown
upon the Family of <hi>David,</hi> and hath blessed the same
Rule in the Government of most Kingdomes with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
success, though not alwayes precisely fixing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same person that men design thereto. But
whatsoever was said, its clear that the Kings desire was
not very eager upon it, for that he summoned not a
<hi>Convention</hi> of <hi>States</hi> of four years after; and then at
<hi>Westerass</hi> the point was debated anew, the result
whereof was this Act; That after the death of <hi>Gusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus

Dukedomes of <hi>Holst,</hi> and <hi>Sleswick,</hi> in as ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

                  <p>The Title of <hi>Sueden</hi> was not at all mentioned, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the <hi>Suedes</hi> require any resignation, nor would

enough to countenance any quarrel that was

business of the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Lorain</hi> touching their Nieces Dowry (which, as they
pretended, the Kingdome of <hi>Sueden</hi> ought to take
care of) but the matter went no further than words.
The claim was published in Print, and so was the
King of <hi>Suedens</hi> answer also, who denied the matter
of fact, and alledged that if any thing had been formerly

<hi>[Magnus]</hi> was Duke of <hi>East-Gothland.</hi> Her third

was King upon the deposing of his Nephew

                     <hi>and there, stopping his desires of gaining more, to

to <hi>Tyberius,</hi> that he should not endeavour to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
the bounds of the Empire, lest he should meet
with more difficulty in keeping, and less in losing
what was gained. For the larger the borders are, the
more opportunity is given for invasion from abroad,
and for rebellion at home. The wisdome, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:62956:218"/>
therefore of <hi>Gustavus</hi> is to be commended;
for though he wanted not men of War, nor hope of
success in further undertakings, yet having adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the delivery of his Country from Tyranny,
and accomplished it, he desired no further happiness
upon earth, than to maintain what he had gotten, yet
was he once over-reached by the <hi>Livonians,</hi> who prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to commit themselves to his protection, which
he refused; yet when they were much endangered
by the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> he sent aid unto them, who enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
too far, and the <hi>Livonians</hi> hanging behinde, the
whole burden was left upon the <hi>Suedes,</hi> who finding
the <hi>Muscovite</hi> too heavy for them, and the <hi>Livonians</hi>
heartless, or faithless, withdrew their assistance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and made their own peace.</p>
                  <p>Its a usual policy amongst Princes to be slow in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
their eldest Sons (who are to succeed them)
into places of Government,<note place="margin">Policy of Princes.</note> and not without cause; for
in such cases, especially in times, and places of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
their designed successours, if well gifted by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or education, may prove heads of parties, and
factions, and thereby put the present Governours to
much trouble; the one being looked upon as the rising,
the other but as the setting Sun. Yet it seems more
prejudicial to the people to have a raw, and unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Governour set over them, who knows not how to
govern himself. And therefore if <hi>Ericus</hi> had been
more experienced in Government, he might have
proved, either more advised by the overruling direction
of his Father, or else he would have discovered himself
so far, as that he would never have been trusted, and so
many troubles might have been prevented, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
afterwards.</p>

But it is vain to call back things which are already
past,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> dies.</note> the time draws on a pace which must determine
the work of this great King: He had now governed
the Kingdome of <hi>Sueden</hi> long, and had seen many
changes in other Nations as well as his own, and yet
must outlive one more in <hi>Denmark</hi> before he leaves
the world. For about this time died <hi>Christian</hi> the third,
King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by whose decease the Kingdome
was put to the hazard of an other Election, which
concerned <hi>Sueden</hi> not a little; for <hi>Christian,</hi> the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
King was yet alive, and had another fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to try the curtesie of the Lords of <hi>Denmark:</hi>
But they being unanimous for the choice of <hi>Frederick,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Another cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.</note>
the Son of the Duke of <hi>Holst,</hi> him they Crowned,
and <hi>Christian</hi> was still set aside. Unhappy man, that
having lived a prisoner seven and twenty years in his
own Nation, could not in all that time, by his carriage
gain a better opinion amongst the Nobility of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
but that still he remained under the note of an
impenitent, and obstinate Tyrant.</p>
                  <p>It is the opinion of wise men that the breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a King, and his people, is like the Divorce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a man, and his wife, never to be made up again;
and yet the difficulty lyes not in any determinate
judgement, or rule upon the Case, as that of Divorce
doth (and therefore comes not within the compass of
impossibility) but in the distemper of the parties, by
ambition on the one side, and jealousie on the other,
both hard to be cured: yet the first leading the way
to the second, if that be first allayed, the second may
be cured. And this <hi>Christian</hi> might have observed in
the example of <hi>Carolus Canutus,</hi> his corival in the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:62956:219"/>
                     <hi>Suedish</hi> Throne, who having been Crowned King,
and fought successfully against the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegians,</hi>
ruled somewhat too imperiously, for which
he was ejected out of his Throne; and yet afterwards,
being re-admitted, he ruled in that manner, that he
dyed satisfied with honour, and the love of his people.
But <hi>Christian</hi> was of another temper, he would fain
come again into the Government, but not under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
nor with submission, nor by leave, nor with
the love of his Nation; but still depending upon a
forreign interest, and the power of the Emperour, he
was looked upon as an enemy, and his return, as that
of the unclean spirit, that would render the latter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Nation sevenfold worse than the former.
For he that is a King indeed, though wrongfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
will still bear the minde of a King to desire the
peoples good, and will endeavour to deserve their
love: But he that depends upon the forreign interest
of such as are professed enemies to a peoples Religion
and Liberties, disowneth interest in his people, and
therefore cannot rationally expect any re-acceptance
(if that Nations Religion be right) either by the leave
of God, or liking of the people.</p>
                  <p>Now whether <hi>Christian</hi> took conceit at this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">

not, but he dyed presently after, even within one

Seventy eight year of his age. And <hi>Gustavus</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived

                     <note place="margin">His Character</note> or <hi>Augustus,</hi> for the name is the
same, which perhaps, minding him of imitation, made
him exceed his patern. His aims out reached the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, and were higher than the world: His difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and dangers greater: His enemies more desperate
by conjuncture of the Devils: His labour and industry
not unlike: His success beyond all, even to wonderment.
If he came short of <hi>Austustus</hi> in his time of Government
(wherein the difference was not much) yet he exceeded
him in the manner: It being with such an excellent
temper of <hi>Monarchy</hi> with <hi>popularity:</hi> He preserved the
peoples liberty, with the honour of a King, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
security, without pride of Tyranny. The people
living as well under the King without servitude, as in a
popular estate without sedition, and yet he attempered
all, with just liberty of conscience, and the true worship
and service of God, which he owned as the chief <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
in his Crown, and conveyed all to his successours
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:62956:220"/>
by a better, and more enduring settlement than <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
did, or could attain unto: His worst enemies
never publickly taxed him with any crime but cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness:
And <hi>Thuanus</hi> (a Writer of credit in those
times) gives no countenance thereto: Nor did the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
left by him to his children, hold forth any
such thing; and therefore if any such thing were, it was
for the service of the state of <hi>Sueden,</hi> wherein, if he
spared not others, its confessed by all, that he spared
not his own estate. His infirmities were common to
other men, and must be acknowledged <hi>vitia naturae, non
animi,</hi> as infirmities of nature, not of purpose of minde.
If his fame rather mounted upwards, than spread
abroad, we may thank the subtilty of those times, who
liked not that the splendor of his Religion should dazel
their own, and we may pity the distempers of those
dawnings that knew not how to value that <hi>Morning
Star</hi> till it was set. It was <hi>Augustus</hi> his lot, after a long
and honourable Reign, to dye, and yet <hi>Tum quidem
pauci luxerant, postea temporis omnes:</hi> Few mourned
at his death, but a while after, all. For <hi>Tyberius</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him, who was as wicked, as <hi>Augustus</hi> was
good: And whatever the people thought of <hi>Gustavus</hi>
whilst he lived, a while after when <hi>Ericus</hi> came to
Reign, they knew what it was to want their <hi>Gustavus:</hi>
Of whom it may truly be said, that he dyed a King, a
a Patriot, a Knight, a Christian, true, and unconquered,
and yet lives a monument of the truth of that Golden
Sentence, uttered by the God of Truth, <hi>Him that
honours me, will I honour.</hi>

                  <head>The Life, and Death of Mrs.
Jane Ratcliffe, who dyed
Anno Christi 1638.</head>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Jane Ratcliffe</hi> was born of good Parents,<note place="margin">Her parentage</note>
who were morally Civil, and moderately Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
according to the temper of the times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they lived: Her Uncle was Mr. <hi>Edward Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
a learned Professor in <hi>Gresham</hi> College <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
In her younger years she was rather Civil than
Religious, and sometimes rather merry than Civil;
yet lightsome without lightness, or immodesty:
Though too much delighted with dancing, Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes,
and other publick vanities, according to the
fashion of young folkes, especially in those times
when these things were so well thought of, that they
were admitted to be acted in the Churches. But it
pleased God,<note place="margin">Her conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> according to his election of Grace, in due
time to call her by the Ministry of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Nicholas Byfield,</hi>
who was a powerfull, and a profitable Preacher of
Gods Word at that time in the City of <hi>Chester;</hi> which
also was seconded by the afflicting hand of God, who
took away her first Child (which she much took to
heart) but God made it an occasion to make her his
own Child by Adoption, and Grace. For from that
time the meanes of Grace had a more kindly operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon her, which made her ever after more to
mind her Father in Heaven, than any Child she had
upon earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="416" facs="tcp:62956:221"/>
Yet at first she rather feared God than loved him,
whence were engendred many perplexing scruples in
her soul,<note place="margin">The manner of it.</note> which for the present were very grievous
unto her: For her Spirit was sore wounded, and <hi>A
wounded spirit, who can bear,</hi> Prov. 18. 14. The
truth is, the pangs of her New Birth were so painfull,
and bitter, and sometimes so terrible, that it was a
difficult thing to fasten any comfort upon her. But
after the Lord had chastened her soul with his severe
Discipline, and thereby had prepared her for a Cure,
he shewed himself her most favourable and effectual
<hi>Physician,</hi> according to that <hi>Job 5. 18. He make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h
sore, and bindeth up, he wound, and his hands make
whole.</hi> For he quieted her troubled spirit, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it in the assurance of his love.</p>
                  <p>Being thus,<note place="margin">Her excellent parts.</note> through Gods goodness, converted,
and comforted, it pleased him to bestow many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
endowments upon her, both Intellectuall, and
Morall. For by her frequent, and attentive hearing
of Sermons, and reading good Books, the Bible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
(unto which she was addicted with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
desire, and delight) and by moving Questions
to such as she thought best able to answer them, she
became an excellent proficient in the most sound, and
usefull points of Religion: yet took she not upon her
to teach any but her own children, and servants,
though an <hi>Apollos</hi> might not have disdained to learn of
such a <hi>Priscilla,</hi> Act. 18. 22.</p>
                  <p>She medled but little in worldly matters,<note place="margin">Heavenliness.</note> and
when she did, she little minded them: yet (shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her self from acquaintance with the world) she
shined gloriously in her knowledge of God, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
matters.</p>

                     <pb n="417" facs="tcp:62956:221"/>
As she had occasion to converse with others she
shewed her self a very prudent <hi>Abigail:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her prudence.</note> 
                     <hi>The Word of
God</hi> (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> prescribeth) <hi>dwelt richly in her in
all wisdome,</hi> which appeared in her speech, in her si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
in her carriage, and in her actions.</p>
                  <p>In her speech:<note place="margin">In her speech.</note> for (as the same Apostle requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth)
<hi>being enriched both in knowledge, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi>
1 Cor. 1. 5. <hi>She opened her mouth with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
as that rare woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 26. having
(as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Jerome</hi> dictated to <hi>Celantia)</hi> thought before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
what she should speak, and while she was yet si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
forecasting that she might say nothing, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
she would wish to be unsaid again; and so
she was fitted, and well prepared either to counsell,
or to comfort, to reprove, or to plead for, as there
was occasion.</p>
                  <p>Yet was she not (as some women would have been,
with her abilities, and some without them have been)
obstreperously talkative, nor affected by her words
to make any oftentation of her wit, or other good
parts:<note place="margin">In her silence.</note> but very sparing of her speech, so that she was
as much observed for her silence, as for her discreet
discourse when there was just occasion, and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
For she had learned, That <hi>In multitude of words
there wants not sin,</hi> Prov. 10. 19. That <hi>Whosoever
keeps his mouth, and his tongue keeps his soul,</hi> Prov.
22. 23. That <hi>Death and life are in the power of the
tongue,</hi> Pov. 18. 21. That <hi>Tatling women</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 13. That <hi>Of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
idle word</hi> account must be given <hi>at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
Mat. 12. 36. And that they who profess
Religion, and <hi>refrain not their tongues, their Religion
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:62956:222"/>
is vain,</hi> Jam. 1. 26. This moved her, with <hi>David,</hi> to
resolve that her <hi>mouth should not offend,</hi> Psalme
17. 3.</p>
                  <p>Certainly such silence as she used (in those that
know how to speak) is an argument of wisdome: For
a <hi>wise man</hi> (saith <hi>Solom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n)</hi> and it is as true of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
<hi>holdeth his peace,</hi> Prov. 11. 12. And <hi>he that
rfr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ns his lips is wise,</hi> Prov. 10. 19. And so far
was she from speaking ill, especially of the absent, or
of her betters, that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Jeroms</hi> precept to <hi>Celantia,</hi>
was set forth in her practice, which was, rather to
look to her own life, than to carp at anothers. And
she well knew that where <hi>corrupt communication</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,<note place="margin">Her holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</note>
there that which is <hi>good to the use of edifying</hi>
is required: Yet was she so wise, and wary, even in
the use of good words, as to observe when, and
where, and before whom to use them, and the season
when to give over as well as when to begin her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
                  <p>She gave farther proof of her prudence in her carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,<note place="margin">Her wise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ur.</note>
and behaviour: And Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> in his <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations</hi>
makes this a very good proof of wisdome.
There are some (saith he) whose speeches are witty,
while their carriage is weak, whose deeds are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities,
whilest their words are <hi>Apothegmes.</hi> It is
not worth the name of wisdome that may be heard on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and not seen. Good discourse is but the froth of
wisdome: the pure, and solid substance of it is well-framed
actions. And according to this we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
her conversation for prudence in practice, above
that which, she shewed either in the use, or restraint
of her tongue: For as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> saith, She taught
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:62956:222"/>
others more by her example than by her speech,
much more, then by her silence. She was a woman of
a well composed spirit, discreetly advised, framing
her affairs by good direction of grace, and reason,
without any direction of humour or passion, which
bare no sway over her at all, and very seldome had any
shew, or appearance in her, but when her discretion
told her it was fit to make use of them for due adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
to others; and then she would order it with
such moderation, as that neither her words, nor her
looks, nor her gestures, carried any colour of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to her prudence, and piety: So that her wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was a protection to the reputation of her piety
against all scornfull reproaches: Yea it was a promotion
of the Christian profession to more estimation in her
person, and for her sake.</p>
                  <p>And though she was singularly gifted, yet was she
far from their disposition who think they do nothing
well unless they be singular: and though she had less
to do with worldly matters, than most would have
had in her condition, yet therein also she gave that
proof of prudence which <hi>Solomon</hi> observeth, <hi>Prov.
14. 1. A wise woman</hi> (saith he) <hi>builds her house:</hi>
For she was very provident in managing her Family
affairs both whilest she was married, and when she was
a widow also.</p>
                  <p>Now from her Intellectuall parts, let us pass to her
Morall, and we shall find, that though she had a very
good head, richly stored with ingenious, and religious
notions, yet she had a far better heart, more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
furnished with excellent graces, whereof we
will single out some.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:62956:223"/>
1. For her faith, which is the hand that turneth the
key to unlock the storehouse of divine beneficence:<note place="margin">Her faith.</note>
This appeared by a Paper written with her own hand,
wherein she did set down the <hi>Articles</hi> of her <hi>faith</hi> in
full, plain, and perspicuous terms with pertinent
proofs of Scripture to every point, and then she
maketh particular application thereof to her self,
as thus:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>I do believe the Scriptures to be the very Word
of God,<note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her faith.</note> 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 21. and I have
found them so to me by the witness of Gods Spirit,
which I have felt testifying of them, and by the unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
comfort which I have received by them,
wonderfully refreshing my heart when it was in the
deepest distress, whereby God hath made them so
good unto me that I account them <hi>better than thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of gold, and silver,</hi> Psal. 119. 72.</p>
                     <p>I do believe that God made man at first <hi>after his
own Image,</hi> Gen. 1. 26. which Image did chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>holiness,</hi> Eccles. 7. 29. Eph.
4. 24. and out of admiration of this Image, I do
long for that time when <hi>I shall be satisfied</hi> with it,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 15.</p>
                     <p>I do believe that all mankind hath sinned, 1 <hi>King.
8.</hi> 46. and that the nature of man is stained with sin
from the birth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 5. I know, and must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegde
that the cause of all the afflictions which
do befall me in this life is in my self, and I know no
cause to murmure at my crosses when I look upon
my sin.</p>
                     <p>I do believe that Jesus Christ is God, and my
God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 20. and in that he is a God, and
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:62956:223"/>
my God, it doth exceedingly comfort me: For he
is full of grace to supply my wants; a Counsellor to
direct me in my doubts; Almighty to defend me; and
an everlasting Father to love, pitty, and bear with
mine infirmities, and to spare me; a Prince of peace
to perform reconciliation with his Father for me, and
to fill me with the <hi>peace which passeth all understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and that he will establish, and order me hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
and for ever.</p>
                     <p>I do believe that the Passion of Christ was by the
eternall decree, and appointment of God, <hi>Act.
2.</hi> 23. and that his sorrows were sustained for our
sins, and for our sakes, so as he bore all our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. and that in his own person, he full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
and finished all sufferings needfull for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
1 <hi>Pet. 3. 18</hi> and that his Passion (so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
as cannot be imagined) is a sufficient price for
the sins of the world, <hi>Joh</hi> 2. 29. therefore why
should not I be willing to suffer any thing for his sake,
that hath suffered so great things for me: and say
(with St. <hi>Paul) God forbid that I should rejoyce in any
thing but in the Cross of Christ.</hi> I will for ever trust
in him; and relie upon him as the life of my life,
and as to me <hi>both in life, and death advantage:</hi> and
having such a proof of the infinite love of God to me
in not sparing his own Son, but giving him up to
death for me, shall I ever doubt of my freedome
from condemnation, such a price being paid for the
discharge of my debts by such a surety?</p>
                     <p>I do believe that Christ overcame sin, death,
the grave, and Hell, and rose again from the dead,
ascended into Heaven, and sitteth on the right hand
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:62956:224"/>
of God in Majesty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. and that he hath
purchased his Church by his bloud, and that he is a
Lawgiver to his Church, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 12. which is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by his voice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. seperated from
sinfull society with the world: For she is an holy
Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. yet dispersed over the world;
for she is <hi>Catholick,</hi> Eph. 1. 10. and though <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi>
and dispersed, yet but one, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4.
knit unto Christ by an indissolveable union, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18.
And I am sure that I am a member of this Church
For I am called out of sinfull communion with the:
world by the voice of the Ministers of Christ, who
are in his stead, and seperated from it by the power
of the Word, and I do relie upon Christs merits
for righteousness, and salvation. I do not delight
in the society of the wicked, but in theirs who fear
him, whom I love with sincere affections, as the
most worthy people of the world, and whatsoever I
want of an holy life, yet I do not live after my old
evil conversation; but I constantly endeavour to be
more, and more holy. What thanks shall I give
unto God, who hath <hi>called me out of darkness into
his marvellous light,</hi> and saved me from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
condemnation of the world? O the depth of
the love of Christ unto me!</p>
                     <p>I do believe that there shall be a generall Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 8. that Christ shall be the Judge,
a visible Judge in his humane nature, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 13.
that it shall be at the last day; but the precise day,
and hour is not known to any man, or Angel, <hi>Mat.
24.</hi> 36. that then every man shall be judged, <hi>Jude
15.</hi> and every secret thing shall be brought to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:62956:224"/>
light, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. and that the judgement will be
most just, and so confessed by all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5, 6. why
then should I fear the last Judgement, seeing he
shall be my Judge who is my Brother, Advocate,
and Redeemer? He that was willingly judged for
me, will give no hard sentence against me; yea he
hath already absolved me from my sins, and given
me the earnest of his Spirit, and the seal of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and I have judged my self that I <hi>may not
be condemned with the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32.</p>
                     <p>I do beleeve that the glory of Heaven is unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and incomprehensible by us here on earth,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. that is it eternal, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 45. and that it
is the gift of God proceeding onely from his free
Grace, not our merit, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. his free gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
onely upon the Elect, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. O that I
could by the effectualness of contemplation behold
the greatness of this felicity which is provided for
me! yet as I can conceive it, I cannot choose but
long to be absent from hence, that I may be <hi>present
with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 8. whose admirable beauty
I shall clearly see, and know as I am known, and
that with a perfection both of holiness and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
such holiness as will not onely free me from all
sin, but from all possibility of sinning; such hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
as that, ceasing from all labour and sorrow, I
shall enjoy an eternal <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and shall be free to
all the treasures of Heaven, and (with the fruition
of Gods glorious presence) shall enjoy the sweet
society of all the glorified Saints and Angels. And
all this, as it is unuterable, so it is unalterable: For
as I cannot be disappointed of it because it is certain,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:62956:225"/>
so I cannot be deprived of it because it is eternal.
How then should the hope of the future life, but
swallow up the afflictions of the life present? and
why should I fear Death, when being dead I shall be
so blessed?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Yet was not her Faith elevated so high,<note place="margin">Her Faith.</note> but that
she could readily apply it to promises of an inferiour
degree: For as she trusted <hi>in God at all times,</hi> as <hi>David</hi>
teacheth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 62. 8. so did she in all things, whether
temporal or eternal. In straits and difficulties for the
affairs of this life, she had that ready at hand: <hi>Commit
thy way unto the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall
bring it to pass,</hi> Psal. 37. 5. If at any time she was
sinisterly censured by any one, her faith applied that
promise to her heart, <hi>He shall bring forth thy righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as the light, and thy judgement as the noon day,</hi>
Psal. 35. 6. And whatsoever it were that came upon her
as a cross, her faith was either as a wreathe betwixt
her shoulders and it, that it did not pinch her, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mover
of it from her self to him, who was best able to
bear it, by vertue of that Warrant, <hi>Psal. 55. 22. Cast
thy burthen upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee,</hi> and
that done, her faith which teacheth to keep an eaven
pace with the promises, not making haste, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 16.
by anticipating the time of accomplishment, taught
her soul to wait upon God, as <hi>Davids</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 62. 1.
to effect his own work, at his own time, in his own
way and manner, wherein she would not prescribe any
thing at all.</p>
                  <p>By this daily exercise of her Faith,<note place="margin">Her Comfort.</note> she gained a
great deal of freedome, and lightsomness of spirit,
which admirably appeared in her deportment upon
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:62956:225"/>
great disappointments of that which was her own due,
and unexpected payments unto others: when she hath
seen no way of supply for the present occasions, she
hath believed that Gods providence would effect what
her forecast could not, when she was not wanting in
the use of means, and that he could furnish her with
that which should be sufficient, albeit for the present
she saw not how, nor by what means it would come to
pass; and therefore when she had done what belonged
to her duty, in the affiance of her Faith, she rested
quiet, and remained cheerful, and slept neither the
less, nor the worse for it; and that which confirmed
her confidence the more was, that she still found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that God was most worthy to be trusted.</p>
                  <p>That her Faith was as good as it was great, appeared
by the effect of it in her Devotion and Piety, which
was suitable to her knowledge of God, and her faith
in him; by both which, as she had a clear apprehension
of him, so none had more dear, and devout affections
to him, or more assured signs of such, than she, as
appeared in these particulars:</p>
                  <p>She was frequently,<note place="margin">Her frequent Prayers.</note> and fervently conversant with
God (besides the publick) in her private supplications,
and therein was he most favourably familiar with her;
for he sent forth his Spirit into her heart, whereby she
cried, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Gal, 4. 6. The <hi>Spirit of Grace and
Supplication,</hi> Zach. 12. 10. which enabled her in an
extraordinary manner and measure to pour out her
soul into his bosome; and though she duely esteemed
of the solemn prayers of the sacred Assemblies (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a learned and pious Divine said, that never any one
prayed well privately, who contemned, or neglected
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:62956:226"/>
the publick prayers of the Church) and never sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or censured set forms of Prayer, yet could she,
and that excellently well, conceive Prayer, and
vary her Petitions as the present occasion did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                  <p>Yea in this Devotion she was so abundant in apt
and pertinent expressions,<note place="margin">Her fervent Prayers.</note> that indeed it was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that one so silent in her common conversation
with the world, should be so fluent, and eloquent in
her entercourse with God. Nor was she more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in speech, than fervent in spirit: For such was
her holy violence in Prayer, as that she seemed not to
knock at Heaven Gate for another to open it, but to
make a battery upon it her self, and to break in by the
powerful importunity of her supplications.</p>
                  <p>Her service also of God in this kinde, was no dry
Devotion,<note place="margin">Her prevalent Prayers.</note> but steeped, and drenched in showres of
tears; and though her prudence used as much privacy
as might be herein, yet such a singular gift could not
be hid from her servants, and some secret female
friends, who sometimes, when they were sick, or
possessed with fears, or pains of child-birth, they
would move her with importunity to pray with them,
and when she yeelded to them, and God to her, by
answering her request, they were apt (as there was
cause) to impute the good effect to her fervent sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.
A female friend of hers (who was her
bed-fellow in <hi>London</hi> for many weeks together) and
thereby was a partaker of her daily Devotions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that she was so plentifully furnished for utterance
of her requests to God, that she never wanted variety
of meet words to be presented unto him, but when a
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:62956:226"/>
surcharge of sighs and tears put her Prayers to a
pause.</p>
                  <p>When the heart is full of love, the mouth is filled
with praise of a person most deservedly,<note place="margin">Her holy Speech.</note> and most
dearly beloved, whereof we have an example in this
vertuous Gentlewoman, who when time, company,
and occasion did invite her to communicate to others
the good matter which her <hi>heart</hi> had <hi>indited</hi> of God,
she used her <hi>Tongue as the pen of a ready writer,</hi> Psal.
45. 1. And when she had that great King for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of her speech, she spake of him with such hearty
and savoury relishes of sacred delight and reverence,
and with such an affectionate force, as if her soul were
ready to leap out at her lips into the ears of others, to
kindle the same holy fire in their hearts who heard her,
which burned in her own bosome, longing (as <hi>David</hi>
did) that others might <hi>taste, and see the goodn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ss of the
Lord,</hi> Psal. 34. 8. that they might be Rivals with her in
her Religious love; and glad she was when any sinner
was converted, or any already called, better enabled to
promote the glory of God, and that was the end
which she principally aimed at in her godly discourse
of him</p>
                  <p>In giving vent to her heart in this duty,<note place="margin">Her Humility</note> she could
spend her spirits with great delight, both to her self,
and to those choice friends who had opportunity to
hear her, when just occasion was ministred unto her;
and yet when she had spoken best, she found matter
of complaint in her own expressions, as being too
faint, and too flat, and so far below that which was
meet for the Majesty of the great God, insomuch as
all the acceptation which she desired of him, was but
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:62956:227"/>
to pardon her presumption (as the errour of her love)
for taking upon her to speak of his Excellency, and
the weakness of her spirit and speech, which made
her fall infinitely short of doing him right in the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his praise.</p>
                  <p>Another evidence of her dear affection unto God,<note place="margin">Her love to Gods children</note>
was the great love, which for his sake, she bore to
whom, or whatsoever had any near relation to him,
according to that 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 21. He that loves God must
love his brother also:</hi> and he must love him rather in a
direct, than in a collateral line, as Gods childe, rather
than as his brother, more for Gods sake than for his
own: The dearest degree of love belongs to those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and things which are nearest to him, and to such
she bore a sincere, and singular good will: As to his
Saints with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 16. 3. and to his true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and worship, both at home, and abroad, the happy
progress and prosperity whereof was with her (as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
with <hi>David) preferred above her chiefest joy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">and to the Church of Christ.</note>
Psal. 137. 6. and it was a great affliction to her heart, to
hear any ill tidings of any good man, or any good
cause.</p>
                  <p>She highly prized Gods word, and in the blessed
Sacrament of the Lords Supper,<note place="margin">Her love to the Word and Sacrament,</note> she felt such a sweet
refreshing as might make amends for the severity of
her frequent fasting, so that for her part, and portion
of it, in respect of the common sort of Communicants,
she might say, <hi>I have meat that ye know not of,</hi> Joh.
4. 32. Dainties, which infinitely exceed whatsoever
delighteth, or pleaseth a sensual pallate: For the house
of God, she shewed her self just of <hi>Davids</hi> minde,
when she said, <hi>I have loved the habitation of thy house,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:62956:227"/>
the place where thine honour dwelleth,</hi> Psal. 26. 8. and
<hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts, my
soul longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the
Lord,</hi> Psal. 84. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>If by any imperious impediment she were kept
from the Church (as by sickness in her body,<note place="margin">and House of God.</note> &amp;c.) her
soul was love-sick by her longings to be there; and
whereas many women take a little occasion to absent
themselves from it, she would many times force her
feeble body to carry her soul to the Sanctuary, though
the day before she were confined not only to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but to her bed; whereby though she hazarded her
health, yet it pleased God so graciously to accept of her
zeal to his House, that she was never the worse for
those pious adventures.</p>
                  <p>She kept a great distance from doting on the world,<note place="margin">Her weaned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from the world.</note>
which St. <hi>James</hi> condemns as <hi>enmity to God,</hi> Jam. 4. 4.
Though while she lived she could not choose but be
in the world, yet did she so love her dear Lord Jesus
Christ, that for his sake she was exceedingly estranged
from the world; which appeared,</p>
                  <p>1. By her estrangement from sensual delights,
which she shewed by her frequent fasting from meats
and drinks: By her abstinence from such sports and
pastimes as before her conversion she had been too
immoderately addicted unto, and by her fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to forbear Marriage after her widowhood, and to
rest in that condition wherein she might best attend
upon the service of God.</p>
                  <p>Indeed her love, and delight in communion with
God,<note place="margin">Her frequent Fasting.</note> made her mindeless of meat, and careless of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for the flesh. Well she knew, that though fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:62956:228"/>
makes the body weak (as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>My knees
are weak through fasting, and my flesh faileth of
fatness,</hi> Psal. 109. 20.) yet it strengthneth the spirit,
and maketh it vigorous in conflict, and victorious in
the event; yea fasting and prayer make a potent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination,
which is able to drive the strongest Devil
out of his usurped possession, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 21. These
two she used, not onely as weapons against the Devil,
but as wings to elevate her soul God-ward and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward;
yet herein was she observant of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 18. that she fasted without an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of fasting, onely the next day it might be
discerned by her faintness, she having spent her spirits
in spiritual exercises the day before.</p>
                  <p>For those sports and pastimes wherein formerly she
had taken too much contentment,<note place="margin">Her abstinence from Sports,</note> she not onely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
from them, but much complained of her vanity
in them: Her eyes (which before were used to behold
them with delight, now) shed tears of shame and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
that formerly she had set her minde so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and now she imployed them in the more
frequent and affectionate reading of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
wherein she took more delight than she had
done before in the most pompous Spectacles, set out
to take the eyes with gazing, and the minde with
wonder.</p>
                  <p>And as for Marriage, her heart was so devoted to
her Lord Christ,<note place="margin">and from Marriage.</note> that though she had divers fair invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to it, by such as both for profit, and credit, and
other considerable respects, were worthy rather to be
desired, than denied, yet she resolved not to change
her condition in that kinde, and that not onely in love,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:62956:228"/>
and loyalty to her former Husband, but that she might
be more free to serve God according to that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
1 Cor. 7. 34. <hi>The unmarried woman careth for the
things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and
spirit; but she that is married careth for the things of the
world how she may please her Husband.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. She had so chosen God for her portion,<note place="margin">Her weaned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from the world.</note> and set
up her rest in the riches of his love, that she had but
little minde of the worlds riches. She knew, that riches
may be had, and well used of the Religious; and that
poverty alone commends no man unto God, as St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
speaks, yet did she not dote upon them; but
though she was competently careful and frugal, as
Christ prescribeth, <hi>Joh. 6. 12. Gather up the broken
meat that nothing be lost;</hi> and though she was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as the Apostle requires, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 8. If any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
not for his own, and especially for those of his own
hosue, he hath denyed the faith, and is worse than an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel;</hi>
yet withall beleeving that of the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
Psal. 37. 16. <hi>A little that the righteous hath is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the riches of many wicked;</hi> and as conforming
her self to that of St. <hi>John, Love not the world, nor the
things of the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 15. She often besought of
Almighty God rather to make, and keep her poor,
than to suffer her heart in any sort to sink down from
her Maker, to dote upon <hi>Mammon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She was one that could very well finde in her heart
to <hi>honour God with her substance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her bounty to the Ministry.</note> as <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 9. She was
as cheerful in her layings out for him, as any Miser
could be in his layings up for himself; and when she
heard of the irreligious Parsimony of some towards
the maintenanance of the publick Ministry in that City
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:62956:229"/>
of <hi>Chester,</hi> she hath professed that she had rather be
at all the charge of all the common contributions her
self (if her estate would bear it) than that God should
be grumbled at, or his service poorly prized, or the
wages of his work unwillingly paid.</p>
                  <p>Another undoubted testimony of her true love to
God,<note place="margin">Her desire to dye.</note> was in that she so much desired to dye out of
a fervent affection to him, insomuch that she feared a
long life would keep her too long from the enjoyment
of him; being therein like unto <hi>David</hi> in those ardent
aspirations of his, <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water
Brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God, my soul thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for God, for the living God, when shall I come, and
appear before him,</hi> Psal 42. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>That which worldlings are most afraid of, that she
so much wished for, that her friends were fain to plead
with her to be pleased with life, though she, not being
contented with their Arguments, contended against
them by contrary reason, shewing first why she did
desire to dye. Secondly, why she was not afraid of
Death, and hoping that it would not tarry long, she
had in readiness some special matters to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
at her Death, which she left in writing under her
own hand, and are as followeth:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First, Why I desire to dye:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I desire to dye, because I want while I live here,
the glorious presence of God,<note place="margin">Why she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Death.</note> which I love and long
for, and that sweet fellowship of the Angels, and
Saints who would be glad of me as I am of them,
and would entertaine me with unwearied de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
                     <p>I desire to dye, because while I live, I shall want
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:62956:229"/>
the perfection of my nature, and be as an estranged,
and banished person from my Fathers house.</p>
                     <p>I desire to dye, because I would not live to offend
so good a God, nor to grieve his holy Spirit: <hi>For
his loving kindness is better than life it self:</hi> And
he is abundant in mercy to me, and it doth lye as an
heavy load upon my heart many times, to think of
dipleasing him.</p>
                     <p>I desire to dye, because this world is generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the plague of sin, and some have this
Plague-sore running upon them, and I my self <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m
tainted with the same disease, so as whilst I live here,
I can be in no place, nor in any company, but I am
still in danger of being infected, or to infect others,
and if this world doth hate me because I endeavour
to follow goodness, how will it rejoyce if my foot
do but slip? Therefore how woful would my life
be unto me, if I should give occasion to the world
to triumph, or blaspheme in respect of me? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
choose but desire to dye, when I consider that
sin, like a leprosie hath so corrupted me, that there
is no soundness in me, my minde, my memory, my
will, and affections, yea my very conscience is still
impure; in every faculty of my soul there is a miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mixture of vile infection which makes me
aweary of my life; and all this is the worse, because
it is incurable, and inseparable companion of my
life, so that I can go no whither to avoid it; there is
no business that I can dispatch that concerns my
happiness without a muteny in mine heart; though
Gods works be all fair works, yet there are in my
nature many defects, insufficiencies, mistakings
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:62956:230"/>
and transgressions; so that I may say with <hi>David,
Innumerable evils have compassed me about, mine
iniquities have taken hold on me, so that I am not able
to look up,</hi> Psal. 40. 12. I therefore desire Heaven
for holiness rather than for happiness, that I might
sin no more. I desire that condition wherein I may
most glorifie God.</p>
                     <p>I desire to dye, because of the Devils malignant,
and uncessant assaults: I can stand no where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord on earth, but one Devil or other, is at
my right hand, and must of necessity enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
with them, and their temptations, and be buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted,
and gored by them, which is a thousand fold
worse than Death: More easie it is to <hi>wrestle with
Flesh and Blood,</hi> than with those <hi>Principalities and
Powers, and spiritual wickednesses,</hi> and great Rulers
of the world: For they are subtle and cruel, and
and like <hi>roaring Lions they go about seeking whom
they may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 8.</p>
                     <p>I desire to dye, because by Death I shall rest from
the hard labours of this life.</p>
                     <p>I desire to dye, because nothing in this world can
give me solid, and durable contentment: I am less
in liking of life, and have more desire of death when
I consider the misery that may come both on my
body and estate, and fearful alterations may come,
and wars may come, and all the desolations, and
terrours which accompany them, and I may be left
in the hands of the sons of violence: Besides I
daily suffer the loss of my friends who were the
companions of my life, and means of much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto me; and those whom I lose by my life,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:62956:230"/>
I shall finde by my death, and enjoy in another
world unto all eternity: And for my children it
doth not trouble me, for that God which hath given
life and breath, and all they have, while I am living,
can, without me, provide for them when I am dead;
my God will be their God, if they be his, if they be
not, what comfort would it be for me to live? my
life would be exceeding bitter unto me if I should
see them dishonour God, whom I so much
love.</p>
                     <p>When she enjoyed the greatest portion of temporal
or spiritual comfort, yet would she never say, <hi>Master,
it is good to be here,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 4. but making that
but a step for an higher ascent, she rather inferred, It
is good going hence: For if on earth there be so much
good, how pleasant and desirable is Heaven; the joyes
on earth to those that are there, are but as the earth
is to Heaven, little, and low, dark, and heavy.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Why I do not fear Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I fear not Death,<note place="margin">Why she fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not death.</note> because it is but the separation
of the body from th sould, and that it is but a shadow
of the body of death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. whereas the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the soul from God by sin, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 2. and of
soul and body for sin, is death indeed.</p>
                     <p>I fear not Death, because Death is such an enemy
as hath been often vanquished, and because I am
armed for it, and the <hi>weapons of my Warfare are
mighty through God,</hi> and I am assured of victory.</p>
                     <p>I do not fear Death for the pain of it; for I am
perswaded I have endured as great pains in life, as I
shall finde in Death, and Death will cure me of all
sorts of pains; and because Christ dyed a terrible
<pb facs="tcp:62956:231"/>
and cursed Death, that any kinde of Death might
be blessed to me; and that God, who hath greatly
loved me in life, will not neglect me in death; but
his Spirit will succour and strengthen me all the time
of the combate.</p>
                     <p>I do not fear Death for any loss: For I shall but
lose my body by it, and that is but a prison to my
soul, an old rotten house, or ragged garment, nay I
shall not lose that neither, for I shall have it restored
again at my Saviours second coming made much
better than now it is: For this <hi>vile body</hi> shall be like
the Body of Christ, and by death I shall obtain a far
better life.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>And as an incentive of Divine love, she prepared a
breviate of Gods principal benefits to her self for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
on her Death-bed, and for thanksgiving to
God, which was this:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>How shall I praise God,<note place="margin">Her thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</note> 1. For my Conversion.
2. For his Word, both in respect of my affections
to it, and the wonderful comforts I have had by it.
3. For hearing of my prayers. 4. For godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
5. For fellowship with the godly. 6. For joy
in the Holy Ghost. 7. For the desire of death.
8. For contempt of the world. 9. For private
helps and comforts. 10. For giving me some
strength against my sin. 11. For preserving me
from gross evils both before, and after my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>She shewed her holy love to God,<note place="margin">Her universal obedience.</note> by conforming
her practice to his Precepts, according to that <hi>Joh.
14. 15. If you love me, keep my Commandements.</hi> She
thought nothing too much that she should stick at (if
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:62956:231"/>
God commanded, or forbad it) nothing so small, but
his Word was able to give it weight enough to bow
down her neck to the obedience of it. If it was a
greater matter that he required of her, she considered,
that he was a God infinitly, both great and good, and
that unto her, who had and would do for her ten
thousand times more and greater things than she could
do for him: If it were a little thing, she conceived
that the contempt or neglect of it would aggravate her
guilt, as <hi>Naamans</hi> servants said to their Master, <hi>If the
Prophet had bidden thee do some great matter, wouldst
thou not have done it? How much rather when he saith
unto thee, wash, and be clean?</hi> 2 King. 5. 18. the less
the duty is, the more is the disobedience if we do it
not; for thereby we extenuate the Authority of the

of.</p>
                  <p>By this means she still increased in holiness and
sanctification, and kept a greater distance from great
offences; according to that of St. <hi>Jerom, Non cito ad
majora progreditur, qui parva formidet,</hi> who so is afraid
of a small sin, will not easily grow bold on those that
are greater.<note place="margin">Her love to God.</note> Her love to God was <hi>strong as death,</hi>
Cant. 8. 4. yea, and much stronger, so that Death
could not affright her; for she desired da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly to look death
in the face, nor could it hurt her more than she was
content to endure: For though it was not likely that
she should go through the narrow wicket of Death,
and not be pinched in her passage, yet was she well
contented with it, seeing it was the ready way to
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:62956:232"/>
come to God, whom she so much longed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</p>
                  <p>Her Charity was very chary of the credit of the
absent,<note place="margin">Her Charity.</note> towards whom she would not suffer either her
tongue, or her ears be guilty of any wrong or rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
of their reputations. She never imposed false
crimes, or feigned faults upon others: She never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
their secret sins, or aggravated those that
were known: She never denied, dissembled, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished
the vertue or good parts of any. Though
her hatred of sin was such as became a sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
yet knew she how to distinguish betwixt sin, and
the sinner, and setting a severe dislike on the one, she
reserved (as charity required) love, or compassion for
the other.</p>
                  <p>Her Charity was regular according to the Rules of
Scripture, which she set down in a paper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Texts for her direction in four particulars,
1. <hi>I must give readily,</hi> Job 31. 16. <hi>Prov. 3. 28. 1 Tim.
6. 18. 2. I must give secretly,</hi> Matth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. 3. 3. <hi>I must
give liberally,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 12. &amp; 9. 6. 4. <hi>I must give
cheerfully,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 12. It was answerable also accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her own ability, and others necessities: She had
rather give a little to many (since the number of the
needy is very great) then a great deal to a few; and
she so ordered her charity, that she might still be able
to exercise her hand that way, and not as some, who
give so much that after a while they can give no more.
And upon extraordinary occasions, if she were not
magnificent, the let was not in her minde, but in her
means.</p>
                  <p>Her Charity was vigorus, and so cordial that what
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:62956:232"/>
she gave was alwayes without grudging, knowing that
God loves <hi>a cheerful giver,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 7. yea she was so
cheerful herein, that she bestowed nothing upon her
self with more readiness, than she did upon others,
whether it were towards the maintenance of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
or in giving Almes to the poor; and yet herein
did she follow the rule of our Saviour, <hi>Matth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 6.
Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth;</hi> for
she was many times as close in giving her own, as a
Thief would be in taking away from others; so that
none did more good deeds with less shew, or sound of
words than she.</p>
                  <p>For the object of her charity, she took her direction
from the Apostles precept, <hi>Gal. 6. 10. Do good unto all,
but especially to the houshold of faith.</hi> She indeed shut
up her charity from none that had need of it, but
she enlarged it chiefly to such as were of the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>Her love and charity was very intire,<note place="margin">Her love to her neighbours</note> and great to
her friends, yet not so confined to them, but that she
reserved a competent measure for them that dealt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly
with her, or that were enemies to her. If there
was any unkinde difference between her, and any one,
though she enjoyed the freedome of her judgement to
think as there was cause, yet would she not suffer her
affections to be estranged from them, but was ready to
do them good, if power, and opportunity did furnish her
for it. She requited love for hatred, pity for spight,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>riendly offices for offensive usages, She bare ill will
to none. She hated nothing, but that which is worse
than nothing [Sin] and that she hated in all, and most
of all in her own soul.</p>
                  <p>As her Charity was evidenced by doing,<note place="margin">Her Sympathy</note> so also by
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:62956:233"/>
suffering: If any tribulation were upon others, or
imminent over them, she was like minded with her
Lord and Master, according to that of the Prophet,
<hi>Isa. 63. 9. In all their afflictions he was afflisted.</hi> She did
passionately sympatize in the sufferings of her fellow-members:
If it was ill with the Church, or any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Saints; it was no better with her. Charity made
her suffer as much by inward affection, as they did of
their enemies by outward affliction.</p>
                  <p>Her Patience also was very remarkable:<note place="margin">Her Patience.</note> For
though her apprehensions were quick enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any thing tending to the disturbance of peace
and patience; yet she enjoyed such a calmness of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
as could hardly be turned to a storm. If any were
injurious towards her, her tongue could more readily
pray, and her eyes weep for them, than with looks, or
words of indignation, or disdain set upon them. If she
were angry at others, which was very seldome, it was
sin, their sin that was the cause of it. If news came
to her of any losses in her estate, as sometimes there
did of great ones, yet was she never put out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with those ill tidings, having these considerations
ready at hand to quiet her heart: It is that God that
gave all, that now taketh away some, why should I
take it ill? He would not have me to be in love with,
nor to relye upon <hi>uncertain riches,</hi> which were never
true to any that trusted them, but upon himself, and I
willingly renounce them to rest upon him. He can,
if he see it good, recompence the loss, in the like, or
some better kinde. If he take more, there will yet
be many poorer than my self; and if he take away all
my goods, he can give me content without them, for
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:62956:233"/>
he is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> and so though I have nothing, I
may be <hi>as possessing all things,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 10. The world
and I must part, and whether we be unstiched by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
or torn asunder by taking all at once, all is one to
me; that which he chooseth is best for us both, for
his owne glory, and my good, if I grudge not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, but willingly (as I pray) give way to his will.</p>
                  <p>By bodily sufferings her patience was exceedingly
tried both for the truth and strength of it: For of
some of her children she had long, painful, and very
perilous labour; but that which exceeded all, was, a
long, and sore sickness, to which were applied very
rough and irksome remedies, so that she suffered not
onely the anguish of her disease, but many things also
of the <hi>Physitians,</hi> as that woman in the Gospel, <hi>Mark
5.</hi> 28. and had it onely been pain and torment, it had
been more tolerable; but it was accompanied with a
strange infirmity and deformity. Her jaw being faln,
she could not bring it up towards her upper jaw: Her
mouth was drawn awry towards her ears, so that with
much difficulty both to her self and others, her food
was conveyed through so crooked a passage to her
throat; which might have caused the greater discontent
to her minde, because it was the shipwrack of much
beauty and comeliness, which until then was seated in
her countenance, and whereof she kept remarkable
impressions to her dying day; yet shewed she admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
patience under this great affliction, to which her
heart was brought meekly to submit; and concerning
which, she said, that if it pleased the Lord still to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
her a spectacle of deformed misery, she would not
repine at his doing, or her own suffering, but would
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:62956:234"/>
willingly, abide it until he freed her body from the
disease by health, or her soul from her body by
death.</p>
                  <p>Her Modesty also manifested it self by her shame-faced
estrangement from sin and vanity,<note place="margin">Her Modesty.</note> concerning
which vertue in her it may be said, that it was rather
sometimes too much, than any time too little, and it
shewed it self divers wayes.</p>
                  <p>1. In her look, which was habitually composed to a
modest and gracious gravity, so that against any thing
that was unseemly to be said, or done, she carried a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
rebuke in her very countenance; or if any were so
immodest as to speak, or do any thing before her, not
becoming Christianity, her modesty made some supply
to their want of it, she would blush for them.</p>
                  <p>2. In her Speech, whereas some would have
vaunted themselves, or made some vain-glorious shew
of such sufficiency as was in her, she rather shadowed
her own light with a dark Lanthorn, and therefore in
that wherein she was a teacher, she carried her self as
in the person of a learner, rather asking questions,
than making resolutions, or giving rules, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
unto others.</p>
                  <p>3. By her Silence: For as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
silence be a rest to other vertues, yet is it a chief act, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
exercise of Modesty;</hi> yea her pace, her habit, and he
whole behaviour was a lesson of modesty, which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with her other vertues, wrought a kinde of
awfulness in her person, so that those that had not
grace to do well in private, were more afraid and
ashamed of an appearance of evil in her presence, than
in the sight of many a Magistrate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:62956:234"/>
As for Humility,<note place="margin">Her Humility.</note> she made great account of it, she
studied it seriously, and got it so by heart, that there
was no need of Art to make profession or ostentation
of it. <hi>Solomon</hi> makes <hi>contention</hi> the proper effect of
<hi>pride,</hi> Prov. 13. 10. So peaceableness is a sure sign of
Humility; and this she shewed in that she could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
contradiction, reproaches, and other trials of
Humility without a quarrel, or breach of peace with
any, being still ready to deny her self, and to yeeld
to others so far as with a safe conscience she could.
Once a new Gown being brought her to put on, and
presented as a gift from he Husband, wherein his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
had put him to more cost than she wished, to make
her more fine than she desired to be, she humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
with tears that it might not come upon her
back; she said indeed little with her tongue, but her
eyes spoke much, because she was loath to conrradict
him whom she was bound to obey; and at last she sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his will, though against her own, not onely
because that habit was no better than others of her
rank did wear, but because it was a testimony of her
Husbands love, and of her own loyal subjection to his
will; wherein she followed the advice of Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> in
his <hi>Contemplations.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A good Wife.</note> 
                     <hi>It is not</hi> (saith he) <hi>for a good wife to
judge of her Husbands will but to execute it; neither
wit, nor stomack may carry her into a curious inquisition
into the reasons of an enjoyned charge, much less to a
resistance, but in an hoodwinckt simplicity she must follow
whithersoever she is led, as one that holds her chief praise
to consist in subjection, following her Husband, as the</hi>

stood, when it went they followed.</hi> And indeed it was
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:62956:235"/>
no marvel that she was so obsequious to her Husband,
for amongst her papers were found special directions
which she had, drawn out of the Scripture, for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
affection, and behaviour towards her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,

                  <p>When by his death she was loosed from the <hi>Law of
her Husband,</hi> she would have returned to a meaner
habit, but because it was suitable to the place which she
held in the City (as having been wife to him who had
been twice <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Chester,</hi> and divers times a <hi>Burg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Parliament)</hi> and for that God made such good things
neither onely, nor principally for the use, and wearing
of the wicked, but for his children; and that it might
not be imputed either to singularity nor nigardize, she
made no remarkable change in her attire; and indeed,
to keep down pride, she would not eat the <hi>bread of
idleness,</hi> Prov. 31. 27. but willingly wrought with her
hands, as that vertuous woman did, vers. 13. and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
descended to such homely offices as were meet
for the meanest of her servants.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding such excellent gifts,<note place="margin">Her preferring others before her self.</note> and graces
wherewith God had inriched her soul, her mind was not
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:62956:235"/>
lifted up to vaunting or vanity, nor to the undervaluing
or envying Gods gifts in others, but in lowliness of
minde, she <hi>esteemed others better than her self,</hi> Phil. 2. 3.
disavowing her own praise, though those that gave it,
thought it much less than her due, and advancing
others far before her self, though in gifts they were
far below her; and no marvel, for she was not as those
who are far more curious to know the faults of others
than to correct their own, but an exact enquirer into
her own life, a severe censurer of her own imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and failings; and as for others, she observed
them most for that which was best in them, to make
her self more holy by imitating them therein, and
more humble for that wherein she fell short of
them.</p>
                  <p>She often presented, and arraigned her self before
Gods Tribunal to bring her self down in submission as
guilty before him, begging pardon on her knees at his
hands; and she came the lower by comparing her own
faultiness, infirmity, and misery with his infinite
Purity, Power, and Majesty, in comparison of
whom, <hi>All Nations are but as the drop of the Bucket,
or the small dust in the Ballance,</hi> Isa. 40. 15. which made
her to think of him with admiration, and love, and of
her self with detestation and loathing; and when she
took notice of any good thing in her self, she boasted
not of it, even because she had received it, and that of
Gods free gift, making it a <hi>Memento</hi> of thankfulness
to him that gave it her, knowing that he might have
passed by her, and given it to another, and that he might
be provoked to take it away from her, if she should
take any of that glory to her self which was due unto
him alone.</p>

                     <pb n="446" facs="tcp:62956:236"/>
She alwayes held this for a <hi>Maxime,</hi>

good to be esteemed vertuous (and most desire to be
so esteemed) than to be so indeed, is much better; for
the substance of a good thing is alwayes better than
the semblance of it; therefore she was so sincere in her

She <hi>loved not in word, or in tongue onely, but in deed,
and in truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 18. and this appeared in that she
made her deeds of charity and good will alwayes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than her words, whereof she was so chary, that
some blamed her for want of affability, which being
objected to her, she said, <hi>I like not the lavish language
of some, who have their mouthes full of complemental
curtesie to every one, though their hearts be shut and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
when their mouthes are so enlarged; and if they
have love enough within to maintain such liberality of

see her love by her works, than to hear it by her

that by spiritual nourishment, and daily exercise of her
graces, grew up apace towards the <hi>stature of Christ,</hi>
and as its said of the <hi>path of the just,</hi> Prov. 4. 18. She

Ignatius Jurdaine, who dyed
Anno Christi 1640.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IGnatius Jurdaine</hi> was born at <hi>Lime-Regis</hi> in the
County of <hi>Dorset,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Birth and Education.</note> 
                     <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1561. And when
he was yet young, he was sent by his Friends to the
City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> to be brought up in the profession of
a Merchant, and from thence, being about fifteen
years old,<note place="margin">His Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> he was sent into the Isle of <hi>Garnsey;</hi> and
God by his good providence having brought him to
that place, did also there effectually call, and convert
him by his Grace: So that from that time he resolved
to be like that wise Merchant in the Gospel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 46.
to part with all for that <hi>Pearl</hi> of great <hi>price,</hi> whereas
others did make it their great work, and highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to get the pelf of the world, and <hi>to load themselves
with thick clay,</hi> Hab. 2. 6. And in testimony of his
thankfulness to God, he left by <hi>Will</hi> a considerable
Legacy to the poor of <hi>Lime</hi> where he was born, and to
the poor of <hi>Garnsey,</hi> where he was new born.</p>
                  <p>God seasoning his heart with Grace in his younger
years,<note place="margin">His holy life.</note> the general course of his life, did for the future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of it, according to that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 22. 6. <hi>Train
up a childe in the way he should go, and when he is old he
will not depart from it.</hi> For as he was trained up in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
from his youth, so he continued not only in the
form and profession, but in the life and power of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
his old age, and death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="450" facs="tcp:62956:238"/>
In the whole tenour of his life, his piety was most
eminent;<note place="margin">His early ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with God.</note> and indeed, there have been few observed to
hold such const<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt, and close communion with God,
as Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> did. It was his constant practice for
many years together, even to his old age, to arise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two and three of the clock in the morning, and
that even in the coldest seasons of the year and to
spend the time in secret meditation, and prayer, until
six a clock, which was the appointed time for his
<hi>Morning-sacrifice</hi> in the Family; at which time he was
called from his secret devotions to the exercise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Family-duties. And if at any time he had
over-slept himself (as he accounted it) and did not rise
until four a clock, he would much bemoan himself, for
the loss of so much precious time, wherein he might
have enjoyed sweet, and comfortable communion
with God: Surely, had he not experimentally found
much sweetness in this his spiritual converse with God,
as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 34. he could not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
so constantly therein. And having thus awaked
with God in the morning, and renewed his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with him day by day, its no marvel that he did
walk with him all the day long after.</p>
                  <p>In all his affairs and dealings,<note place="margin">He is slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</note> his care was to walk
very exactly, and sincerely, according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 16. But though in all things he studied
to approve himself to God, and to walk as in the sight
of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. yet could he not escape the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
censures of men, who charged him to do all in
Hypocrisie. He well knew that he had the imputations
of dissembling, and hypocrisie cast upon him, by men
void of charity and sincerity; but the testimony of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:62956:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his own conscience did more comfort him, than the
uncharitable censures of men dejected him; and he
used upon that occasion to take up the words of <hi>Job,
Till I dye I will not remove mine integrity from me,</hi>
Job. 27. 5. Many have oft heard him to profess, that
he would not willingly commit a sin to get a world,
though the <hi>evil which he would not do that did he,</hi> as
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 25. (as it is incident to the best of men) yet did
he bewail it with grief of heart.</p>
                  <p>The sincerity indeed both of his intentions and
actions hath been questioned by some, who were not
ashamed to say, that under colour of doing Justice
(when he was a publick Magistrate) and providing for
poor, he robbed the poor, and helpt to keep his own
house<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was due to the poor: But for that fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
that was thus charged upon him, there were
none that could ever better clear him from it than
himself, not onely his conscience witnessing for
him before God, but his books (wherein he kept
an exact Record of all the money which he received
by way of mulct from Swearers, Drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law) and the Officers that distributed
the money testifying his integrity before men; so that
might truly say with <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 30. 33. <hi>My righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
shall answer for me,</hi> and so it did herein both before
God and men.</p>
                  <p>Nay, he was so far from depriving the poor of
their right, that he added much of his own, distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
sixpences and shillings even when he had no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in bank.</p>
                  <p>He had not onely the testimony of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and of good men, for his upright and just
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:62956:239"/>
dealing, but even of such who had little goodness in
them. A prophane Gentleman jee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing at his heavenly
discourses; another of good quality, though of little
piety, replyed, <hi>Well, Gentlemen, you may laugh at
him, but on my conscience, he meaneth well, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
of us goeth to Heaven, shall meet Mr.</hi> Jurdaine
<hi>there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was a man that made conscience of all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and exercises of Religion both in private,<note place="margin">His heavenly Conversation.</note> and in
publick: His frequent discourses of Heaven, and the
way thereunto, and assurance of his interest therein,
did declare that his heart and conversation were much
in Heaven. He used <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> take occasion to confer of
spiritual, and heavenly things with all sorts of men
that he conversed with. One should seldome hear him
speak but of heaven and heavenly things. His heart
was so full of heaven that he could not but utter, and
breath it forth in his discourses with men, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with those whose hearts and faces were towards
Heaven: When he was at Table receiving his dayly
food, he did usually minister occasion of holy discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and diverted vain, and unprofitable talk, to such
edifying speeches, as might <hi>minister grace to the
hearers,</hi> according to that exhortation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 29. He
took occasion from earthly things to speak of heavenly;
as from the sweetness of the creatures, to speak of the
infinite sweetness which is in God; from feasting on
earth, to the sitting down with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and
<hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdome of heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11. and
feasting with God and his blessed Saints there. And
when the Table-cloath was taken away, he would often
say, <hi>In heaven there is no taking away, here we are soon
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:62956:239"/>
satisfied, and cloyed, but there will be such a feast, that
we shall be continually delighting our souls with it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any cloying.</hi> And his manner was to close his meals
with singing some short <hi>Psalm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He delighted much in reading good,<note place="margin">His much reading.</note> and holy
books, and especially that Book of books, the sacred
Scriptures, wherein he most delighted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
shewed that he had the property of a godly man,
set down, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 2. &amp; 119. 97. The word of God
was his meditation all the day long, yea both day and
night. He did not onely read the Bible above twenty
times over, but he read it with special observation (as
appeareth by the <hi>Asterisks,</hi> and marks in the Bible
which he used) making particular application to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The like course he took in reading over that use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Book of Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> his seven <hi>Treatises,</hi> and other
practical books, wherein he was very conversant, and
his collections out of several Authours do abundantly
testifie. And he took so much delight in reading
that voluminous and excellent Book of the <hi>Acts and
Monuments</hi> of the Church, that upon occasion he told
a Friend that he had read it seven times over.</p>
                  <p>His zeal for God and his glory,<note place="margin">His Zeal.</note> and against Idolatry,
prophaneness, and other evils, whereby God was
highly dishonoured, was most eminent, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
He was a man of an <hi>Anti-Laodician</hi> temper; he
had well learned the Apostles direction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. To
be <hi>fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,</hi> and not the time.
He was far unlike <hi>Ignatius Loiola,</hi> the Founder of the
Order of <hi>Jesuits,</hi> who was a man of fire that was set on
fire by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ell to promote the cause of the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but he had an holy fire kindled in his heart from
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:62956:240"/>
heaven, whereby he did burn with zeal for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods glory, and an holy indignation against
sin, and errour. He would (if it had been possible)
have burnt up all the dross, and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th that corrupted the
Truths of God, and that was contrary to the wayes
of holiness; and therein he was very like to <hi>Ignatius</hi>
the Martyr.</p>
                  <p>Neither did his zeal carry him beyond knowledge,<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note>
like that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 10. 2. when in his zeal he
used often to cry out, <hi>Fie upon discretion;</hi> For he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
only that counterfeit pretence of discretion,
which was taken up, and pleaded against true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
zeal: And truly if carnal discretion be set up,
and cried up, like the worldlings Idol, it is the part of
true Christian zeal to cry it down.</p>
                  <p>He was a very strict and conscientious observer and
sanctifier of the Christian <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His strict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Sabbath.</note> or Lords Day. He
did then rise very early as on other dayes (if not earlier)
and called upon those in his Family to rise early on
that day, saying, <hi>This is Gods day, and as we do expect
that our servants should rise early to go about our work on
our dayes, so God expects our early rising on his Day, to
go about his work and service.</hi> And he used carefully to
attend upon Gods holy Ordinances. The <hi>feet of them</hi>
that dispenced the Gospel, <hi>were beautiful in his eyes,</hi>
as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. more beautiful than their faces to many
others. He was one of those Saints, that <hi>sate down at
Gods feet to receive his word,</hi> Deut. 33. 3. as Disciples
used at the feet of their Teacher, implied, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 3.
and he was very desirous, and willing to learn of any
that came with the Lords message unto him. He was a
<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ason,</hi> an old Disciples, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 16. yea a Disciple
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:62956:240"/>
when he was old: It never came into his heart to cast
off Ordinances, no not when he had attained to an
high measure towards perfection. He was a constant
writer of Sermons, even when he was old, and that,
not for his own benefit alone, but for the good of his
Family, to whom he did constantly repeat the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
And if he found himself overtaken with drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
in hearing the word (an infirmity incident to
age) his manner was to stand up, and to rouse up
himself that he might hear the more attentively. He
knew that Religion consisted not in hearing, repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and profession, but in practice; and therefore his
care was to digest his hearing, and knowledge into an
holy conversation.</p>
                  <p>His love was so great to the Ministry of the word,<note place="margin">His love to Ministers.</note>
and the Lords holy Ordinances, that he did intirely
love, and affect all faithfull and painfull Ministers,
though their gifts were but mean; but he could not
away with a lazie Minist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r, though he was never so
learned. Where fidelity, and learning meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one Minister, Oh! how highly would he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
him.</p>
                  <p>And being desirous not to go to Heaven alone,<note place="margin">His desire to have others saved.</note>
but to draw others with him, his usuall course was,
when he went with his Family to Gods house, to make
an exhortation to his children and servants, that they
should consider into whose presence they were going,
and whom they were to hear, even that great God, to
whom they were to give an account of every word,
which they should hear; and therefore he required
them carefully to store it up for their practice, and not
to say, My Father, or my Master would not afford
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:62956:241"/>
me time; for if they did, he would protest against
them in the day of Judgement. And as he was going
to the Congregation on the week-dayes, he would
often finde some of the Country people that were
come early to the Market, and then would ask them
where they did live, and when they answered five or
six, or more miles off, he would thence take occasion to
shew them how vain a thing it was to pursue the world,
and to neglect the care of their precious and immortal
souls; and would ask them, how they could rise so
early to get the world, and not rise as early to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Jesus Christ, and to attain the favour of God,
and assurance of eternal happiness. And then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back upon his Family, he would say to them, You
see here how these people can rise betimes to get a
little part of the world, and you will hardly rise early
to get the assurance of the favour of God, which is
far better than the whole world.</p>
                  <p>As he returned from Sermons, he would be speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them that went with him of what they had
heard, exhorting them to be mindfull of it, and to
put it in practice; and when one of the company was
troubled, hearing him to press such things upon them,
told him, that he had heard many good Sermons at
St. <hi>Peters</hi> [the Cathedral] but never heard one at the
great Conduit before; he presently replied, <hi>Sirs, are
ye troubled to be put in minde of the word of God? I
pray God the time come not, when you are in hell, that
you wish you had not onely practised the Sermons which
you heard at St.</hi> Peters, <hi>but had received good counsel
from the Word, at the great Conduit also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus by his diligent attending upon, and carefull
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:62956:241"/>
applying the means of Grace,<note place="margin">His Assurance</note> and Gods blessing upon
them, he attained a very great measure of assurance,
even to a kinde <hi>Plerophory,</hi> such as the Apostle speaks
of, 1 <hi>Thess. 1. 5. Much assurance,</hi> and <hi>Col. 2. 2. Full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of understanding,</hi> by which he was carried as
with full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ails, to holy duties. And truly, if we conn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the measure, continuance, and constancy of it,
there are few Christians that have attained the like.
Assurance was much in his tongue, and in his heart; it
was that which he earnestly laboured for, and obtained
by fervent prayer, and diligent use of the means. God
gave him the Testimony and Seal of the Spirit, and
so assured him of his eternal love in Christ, as also of
his Adoption, and eternal happiness in Heaven. God
gave it him as part of his reward for his sincere, and
faithfull service.</p>
                  <p>At sometimes he had more than ordinary comforts,<note place="margin">His joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable.</note>
and incomes of the Spirit for the strengthning of his
Assurance: As for instance, At a time he being at a
Sermon, and attending heedfully to those discerning
and differencing marks of uprightness, which were
then laid down, and one mark being more powerfully
pressed, and coming fully home to his condition, he
being in a deep and serious meditation, and reflecting
upon himself, and finding, it to be truly in him, it
seemed to him as if one struck him upon the shoulder,
encouraging, and saying, <hi>Be of good cheer, thou art the
man:</hi> upon which he had presently such inward joyes,
and ravishings of spirit as were unexpressible.</p>
                  <p>And as by diligence he obtained,<note place="margin">How he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance.</note> so he carefully
kept his assurance by frequent trial of himself, and
his spiritual estate towards God, he used to try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:62956:242"/>
by all the marks of sincerity which he found in the
Scriptures, heard by the Ministry of the word, or read
in the books of godly Divines, and thereby he did
clear up his evidences for heaven; and he did not onely
try his estate by some marks, but he kept a narrow
watch over his heart and wayes, and thereby his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was preserved; and he kept it for a long time
together, even for thirty years, and more: and being
asked whether he never met with any temptations
of doubting of his estate towards God, he gave this
answer, That he had been, and often was sorely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
by Satans temptations, which were set against
his Faith and Assurance, and that he had been foiled
in respect of the application of some particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises;
but he was not thereby driven from his hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
of Christ, or from the assurance of his interest in
the Covenant of Grace; yet still he acknowledged that
his assurance, and all his ability in spiritual things, was
<hi>through Christ that strengthened him,</hi> as <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil.
4. 13.</p>
                  <p>As he had this assurance himself, so he was alwayes
forward to stir up others to labour for it;<note place="margin">He stirred up others to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for it.</note> there were
scarce any that he met with, if he supposed that their
faces were heaven-ward, but he would be questioning
with them about their assurance; blaming them if they
did not diligently seek after it, and encouraging them
to labour for it. And when some did ask him how they
should get it, he gave them this answer, that they
should importunately seek it of God, and not give
him any rest till he granted it unto them; <hi>I would</hi>
(said he) <hi>lock, or bolt my Chamber door, and beg it of
God, and never give him rest till I had obtained it;</hi> and
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:62956:242"/>
then he advised them that they should daily try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by some marks, and he often mentioned three
that he used to try himself by, 1. A sincere desire to
fear the name of God, as <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 11. 2. A sincere
endeavour to do the will of God in all things required,
as <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 6. 3. A full purpose of heart <hi>to cleave
to the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 23. and these he did not onely
speak of, but pressed them with much earnestness, as
longing that others should partake of that high privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and heavenly gift with himself.</p>
                  <p>If he met with any Schollar, and such an one especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as applied himself to the study of Divinity, his
usual question to such was, What evidence have you
for heaven? You Schollars have the best opportunities
of all men for the getting of assurance; you are still
looking into Gods book, and into other good books,
and should acquaint your selves with your spiritual
estate towards God, and so have a greater measure of
assurance than others.</p>
                  <p>The like course he took when he met with any
others, as occasion was offered, or if he found none, he
would take it of himself: Once when he was a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
man, being at <hi>London,</hi> and coming acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
into the shop of an intimate acquaintance, a man
of great estate and imployment, and an Alderman of
the City, he expressed his wondring at so great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for the things of the world, and thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
how he could in the midst of such wordly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
attend the weighty affairs of heaven? His
Friend answered, that he hoped he looked after the
good of his soul. Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> replied, <hi>How can you
attend upon the worship of God every morning?</hi> His
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:62956:243"/>
Friend answered, that though he could not attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it every morning, yet he failed not of it in the
evening; <hi>Well</hi> Sir, said Mr. <hi>Jurdaine, I will tell you in
plain tearms what I would have you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o do, I would take
all these goods, and throw them out into the street, and
let them rather be cast away, and perish, than that they
should be a means to ruine my soul unto all eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this Assurance it was that he was so fearless
of Death:<note place="margin">His desire of death.</note> He knew that Death was an enemy, as the
Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 26. But that through Christ,
it was become a Friend to open the Gate of Heaven.
Whereas Death in it self is as <hi>Bildad</hi> saith, <hi>Job 18. 14.
the King of Terrours,</hi> or as the Heathen said, <hi>Of all
Terribles the most terrible;</hi> yet he, being assured of his
interest in Christ, found it not so to him; for he looked
upon it as having lost its sting through Christ. Indeed,
he made it so familiar to him by his continuall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, that he was so far from fearing it, that he
did delight to speak of it, yea earnestly desired it, and
with joy expected it, whereby he discovered his great
proficiency in the School of Christ. It was his usuall
saying, that if Death were offered him on the one
hand, and the Kings Crown on the other, he would
take the Crown, and throw it into the Kennel, and
choose Death far before it: He knew that he should be
a great gainer by Death, and thereby obtain the <hi>Crown
of life and glory,</hi> Jam. 1. 12. 1 Pet. 5. 4. and that he
feared not, but rather hoped for Death. And this
was further manifested, in that when the Plague was
very hot in the City of <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>xeter,</hi> and he being in the
highest place of Authority there at that time, when
the poor flocked about his house for relief, though he
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:62956:243"/>
would not causelesly expose himself to danger, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the discharge of his Duty, he feared not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
but often professed, that if by Gods disposing,
the Plague should seize on him, he would kiss, and
welcome it as the messenger of Death.</p>
                  <p>Nor was the meditation of Death then in his minde
onely in times of danger, but at all times; there was
not a day wherein he did not speak of it, and not onely
when there was occasion offered to talk of it, but he
would take occasion to discourse of that subject: As
when he was invited to a Feast, he would tell the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
that he would come if he did live so long: And
when he went out of his house upon publick or
private businesses, he would (as it were) take a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
leave of his wife, telling her, that he knew not
whether he should return to his house again.</p>
                  <p>Yet did he not so much desire Death as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
the blessing of life,<note place="margin">Yet carefull of life.</note> or to neglect the means for
the preservation of it; for he acknowledged it to be a
great blessing, and he was willing to live as long as the
longest lived man, if it were Gods good pleasure, and
if he might do him service. And when he was sick, or
in any danger, he would carefully make use of the
means, that he might thereby serve Gods good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
for his recovery or deliverance, saying, that
though he must trust in God, yet he must not tempt
him by seeming to trust in him.</p>
                  <p>His minde was not so much upon Earth,<note place="margin">His heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedness.</note> and Death,
as upon Heaven, to which he was assured Death
would be a passage for him: Sure his heart was much
upon Heaven, or Heaven was much in his heart, as
appeared by his frequent discourse of it both day
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:62956:244"/>
and night; and our Saviour Christ tells us, <hi>Mat. 12. 34.
That out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</hi>
All that knew him, and looked upon him without a
prejudiced eye, would say, that he was a most heavenly
minded man; a man that lived in Heaven as much as
most that lived upon earth. When in the night he
looked upon those glistering lights of Heaven, <hi>Ezek.
32.</hi> 8. the Firmament adorned with those Stars of
light, <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. 3. he used to raise up his thoughts and
speech much higher, even to the glory of the highest
Heaven, saying, <hi>If these visible Heavens be so glorious,
how doth the Heaven above them exceed in glory, where
God alone shall be the light, and yet the Righteous shall
shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdome of their Father,</hi>
Mat. 13. 43. There was scarce any occasion administred,
or any special act of Gods providence that did occur, but
it would draw out some speech of Heaven from him;
as when any cross, or loss befell him in his affairs, he
would say no more, but, <hi>Heaven will pay for all.</hi> And
when in a journey he fell from his horse, and lay for a
while in a swoon, as soon as he recovered, his first
words were, <hi>Well, I see that I am now deceived, I thought
that my horse would have cast me into Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are some few heads of the breathings of his
piety, to which much more might be added; and
truly they which knew him will marvell, not that
so much is said of him, but rather that there is so
little.</p>
                  <p>He was as eminent for Justice as for Piety, when he
was advanced to the chiefest place of Government in
that City,<note place="margin">His Justice.</note> to be Mayor of that honourable Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
He was an eminent Magistrate, and that not
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:62956:244"/>
only in the year of his Majora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty; but ever after as long
as he lived. He looked upon it, not as a place of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
onely, but as an office of trust, wherein he might
honour God, and execute justice amongst men, and
reform those evils which abounded in those times in
that place: He did not glory so much in having the
Sword carried before him (though it was a singular
badge of honour to that City, that the Kings swo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
should be taken from his side, and delivered to the
Mayor to be carried before him, as a signall testimony
of his favour, and their loyalty, and courage in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of <hi>Perkin Warbeck)</hi> as he was desirous to
draw forth the sword of Justice against evil doers, and
not to carry it in vain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4.</p>
                  <p>He was observed to be an impartial Administrator
of Justice,<note place="margin">His Impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> and one that without respect of persons
did punish evill doers, of whatquality, or condition so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they were that did transgress the Law, whether
they were Citizens or strangers that came thither, if
complaint were made to him, they should not escape
condign punishment, as the Laws of the Land, or
custome of the place did award. As for instance.</p>
                  <p>There was a Gentleman of quality that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of to him for swearing five Oaths,<note place="margin">Examples of it.</note> and for
some other misdemeanours: Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> thereupon
sent a Constable with a Warrant to fetch him before
him: but the Gentleman gave the Constable threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
language, so that he durst not execute his Office:
Whereupon Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> sent one Constable more
for him, who brought the Gentleman before him:
And he being in his Court when he came, after divers
good admonitions given him, he told him, that
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:62956:245"/>
though he was never so great a Gentleman, he could
no more go to Heaven whilest he took such courses,
than he could eat that stone (pointing to a great stone
in his Court) and then required him to pay five shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
for his Oaths, which he did: Then he told him
that he must put in sureties for the good behaviour:
This the Gentleman refused to do, alleadging that he
was a stranger: Whereupon Mr. <hi>Jurdain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Constables to carry him away to prison till he
would find sureties, which accordingly they did; and
as he was going into the prison door, he desired that
he might return back again, and he would give Bail:
When he came to Mr. <hi>Jurdain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> to do it, he again
gave him many good instructions, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(though he was a man of a very high spirit)
gave him many hearty thanks for his good counsell,
and promised amendment for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>The Master of <hi>Bridewell</hi> could witness how many
disorderly persons were sent thither by Mr. <hi>Jurdains</hi>
Warrants, more than by any other Justices in his
time.</p>
                  <p>The Stocks, and Whipping-post could testifie
what swearers, drunkards, unclean persons, and such
like notorious offendors were punished, principally by
his indifferent execution of justice. And if any of the
offenders that were liable to the censure, and penalty
of the Law, desired to be spared, he would tell them;
<hi>Here be my children whom I dearly love, and yet if any
of them should commit such offences, they should suffer as
you must do: and therefore I cannot remit of the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What excuses, or fair pretences soever they made,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:62956:245"/>
he caused the Law to be executed upon them; yea
and that the more severely, because of the greatness
of the crime, and the greater dishonour that redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Name of the most high God thereby.</p>
                  <p>When some scandalous offenders, for the gross sin
of uncleanness were accused, and questioned before
the Court, and some present (for by-respects)
pleaded for them, desiring to have them spared, he
wished the Watchmen that were at the Gates to keep
out the Plague (it being a time wherein some neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Towns
were infected) should be called home:
For (saith he) <hi>the Plague is in the Guild-Hall of the
City:</hi> Adding further, that if they did not execute
the Law upon them, he would complain of them to
the Council Table: And thereupon, after much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
there was Order taken for their severe, and just
punishment.</p>
                  <p>He was ever very vigilant, especially in the year of
his Mayoralty, when the government of the City lay
upon him, both to prevent, and remove disorders:
Insomuch as he would go himself with the Constables
to search for idle, and disorderly persons on <hi>Sabbath</hi>
dayes at night, and at the end of the Assizes, and Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and in Fair weeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea,<note place="margin">A great refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation wrought by him.</note> he did not only execute justice, but he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself zealous therein, manifesting the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
against those evils whereby God was most
highly dishonoured, as swearing, and Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Indeed swearing was most odious unto him, and
had there been a greater penalty than was at that time
appointed by the Law of the Land, he would most
readily have inflicted it. But by his punishing as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:62956:246"/>
as were brought before him, it struck such an awe
into the generality, as that some that lived at that
time in the City, and near the place of the greatest
concourse of people, the Corn-market, observed
that they did not hear an Oath sworn for many years
together.</p>
                  <p>He did not only maintain his zeal against swearing,
and swearers of the ordinary sort, and rank of men,
but even of the highest that came within the verge of
his authority. As for example;</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman of great quality, and much favoured
at Court,<note place="margin">His Courage.</note> was heard to swear five or six times in the
City. Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> having notice of it, sent some
Constables to demand the penalty for swearing. The
Gentleman was of an high spirit, and at this time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the chiefest of the County of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
and there were divers hot spirits about him.
The Constables pressed towards the room where he
was, saying, that Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> had sent them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the aforementioned penalty: and it was like to
have broken forth into a great, and dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test;
but a prudent Gentleman, of a more moderate
temper, and one that feared an Oath, stepped forth
to them, and told the Constables that this Gentleman
was of an high, and impatient spirit, and had great
company about him: I fear therefore (said he) that
the event may be of sad consequence if you pursue
your intentions at this time; yet the Constables seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unwilling to depart till they had what they came
for; the Gentleman seeing this, said, I will now pay
the six shillings to you for him, and I promise you
faithfully that I will take a convenient time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:62956:246"/>
the Knight when it shall do him more good than
the rigorous exaction of the penalty of the Law can at
this time, and so they departed.</p>
                  <p>It is credibly related that Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> being sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to appear in the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> for an act of
Justice, wherein it was supposed that he went some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
beyond the strict letter of the Law, being there
in the presence of some of his Judges, who were
Noble men, and hearing them to swear divers Oaths,
he told them, that they must pay for every oath that
they had sworn, or otherwise he would make it farther
known.</p>
                  <p>When he was Mayor of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He reforms the prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath.</note> he did much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the open prophanation of the <hi>Sabbaths.</hi> For
whereas the Hullers had wont to set their Mills agoing
on the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> he put a stop upon them for that
whole day, knowing that that whole day was to be
dedicated to God, and his worship, and service; and
whereas it was usuall to sell fruit and herbs, and other
things on the Lords holy day; as also Bowling, Cudgel-playing,
and other prophane pastimes were then much
used, by his zeal and vigilancy, and by the care of
other Officers under him, they were wholly left off,
though not without much reluctancy, opposition, and
some danger at the first; for there were commotions
and tumults, and great resistance made against him;
but by his constant zeal for God, and his day, and
Gods blessing upon the same, they were at last sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
and quelled.</p>
                  <p>And not onely when he was Mayor, but ever after,
being a Justice of Peace, in which Office he continued
for twenty and four years, he was much taken up in
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:62956:247"/>
the execution of Justice, yea sometimes for the whole
day from morning till night: So that he did not onely
<hi>execute Judgement in the morning,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 21. 12. after
he had been with God in the Mount of heavenly
meditation, but all the day long, as <hi>Moses</hi> sate to judge
the people, and the people stood before <hi>Moses</hi> from
the morning untill the evening, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 13.</p>
                  <p>And when he was out of power as a Justice,<note place="margin">His zeal, and courage.</note> he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
his zeal as a Christian, against prophane swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and for the strict observation of the <hi>Sabhath,</hi>
wherein there is a remarkable instance of both at once;
and it was this, Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> returning from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in the company of a person of Honour, he
was invited by him to stay at his house that night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Saturday,</hi> and the <hi>Sabbath</hi> following, he (having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
that Noble personage to swear, as they travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together) told him, that he would not go into his
house, for that he was a Swearer, and he feared that
the house would fall upon his head: Answer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
that he need not fear that, for the house was
newly built, a fair, and strong house: To this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
yea but the flying Rowl of Curses shall enter
into the house of Swearers, and shall consume the
timber, and stones of it. But to obtain his company,
the Lord pressed the inconveniencies of his lodging in
an Inne on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day: Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> replied,
<hi>But I will never go into your house, unless you will engage
your self, that no Oath shall be sworn, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nor cursing uttered
by your<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, your Lady, nor none of your servants or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:</hi>
This was faithfully promised; <hi>Yea but then</hi>
(said Mr. <hi>Jurdaine) how shall the</hi> Sabbath <hi>be kept?</hi>
the answer was, That he should have an honest Sermon
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:62956:247"/>
in the forenoon. <hi>And what in the afternoon,</hi> said he?
<hi>Except we shall have a good Sermon in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
also, I will not go in.</hi> That likewise was
granted, and (as it is said) all was faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.<note place="margin">His mercy to souls.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was not for judgement only, but for mercy also:
and he shewed mercy to the souls of them that were
brought before him, as transgressors of the Law, and
to be punished according to their demerits: For he
would labour to convince them of the hainousness of
their offences, that so he might bring them to a sight
of their sins, and to repentance for the same.</p>
                  <p>He did much encourage the Officers under him to
a diligent, and faithfull discharge of their duty: and
indeed they stood in much need of it, meeting with
many discouragements from some others: and when
he found them somewhat backward through timerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or other by-respects, to execute his Warrants
upon persons of high place, he would exhort them
to be active, and forward in doing their duty, telling
them, In good earnest (for that was his usuall word)
that if he had as good a Warrant from God, as they
had from him to apprehend offenders, if he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to apprehend the Devil himself, he would not
be backward to put it in execution.</p>
                  <p>His zeal was not only in distributive justice as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate:<note place="margin">His justice.</note>
but he was conscienciously carefull as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
in commutative justice, in his commerce, and
dealings with men, wherein he made the Word the
rule of his practice: and if he found at any time that
he had swerved from that rule, he would retract it,
that so neither his own conscience, nor other men
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:62956:248"/>
might reproach him for walking disorderly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the rule: and that appeared, not only by his
avoiding all usurious Contracts, but also in making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of all that had been gotten thereby.</p>
                  <p>He had sometimes taken usury for Money lent to a
person about <hi>Lime,</hi> which he had received for divers
years: for at that time he held it lawfull, by reason of
the practice which he had observed in some forreign
States, and the concurrent judgements of some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of note, who spake in favour thereof: but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his perusall of the Writings of other godly Divines
of our Nation, and by conference with some worthy
Ministers of his acquaintance, he was so convinced of
the unlawfullness of usury, that he did not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
the practice of it for the future,<note place="margin">He restores Use-money.</note> but restored the
interest formerly taken: and took no more for the
loan of Money, than the party borrowing would vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
give him.</p>
                  <p>He did much bewail the common course of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
who sin against God, both in getting, and spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their worldly estates. For (said he) as they get
it unjustly, and by indirect means, so for the most
part, they spend it leudly, and lavishly in satisfying
their sinfull lusts.</p>
                  <p>Neither was he more famous for justice, than he
was for charity,<note place="margin">His Charity.</note> and that both in his life, and at his
death: In his life-time he was a free-hearted man, and
open-handed. He was a great patron of the poor:
Another <hi>Job</hi> in that respect: He could truly say with
him, as <hi>Job 30. 25. Was not my soul grieved for the
poor?</hi> No doubt it was; and the bowels of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
did yearn towards them: He was an Advocate,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:62956:248"/>
and did earnestly plead for them, and especially for
Gods poor, honest poor persons, whose hearts, and
faces were set Godward, and Heavenward, and his
hands were very open to relieve them: He did that
for them, which many of far greater estates had not
hearts to do.</p>
                  <p>He would often say, that he wondered what rich
men meant, that they gave so little to the poor, and
raked so much together for their children. <hi>Do you not
see</hi> (quoth he) <hi>what becomes of it?</hi> and would reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
up divers examples of such as heaped up much for
their children, and they, within a short time had scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and consumed all: and on the other side, he
often spake of such as had small beginnings, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
became rich, or of a competent estate: giving
a particular instance in himself: <hi>I came</hi> (said he) <hi>but
with a groat, or six pence in my purse to this City: had
I had a shilling in my purse, I had never been Mayor of</hi>
Exeter. <hi>And therefore leave children but a little, and
they (by Gods blessing on their labour, and industry)
may become rich: But leave them a great deal, and
they are in danger to be beggars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His care for the poor was most remarkeable in the
time of the great Plague in that City, which was <hi>anno
Christi</hi> 1625. For in the Maiors absence he was
chosen his Lieutenant, or Deputy, and he, seeing the
deplorable condition of the City, accepted of it, and
then he wrote divers Letters to many Towns in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire,</hi>
and to some in <hi>Dorset,</hi> and <hi>Sommersetshire,</hi>
by which meanes he procured severall summes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
for the suppliall of the wants of the many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of poor, that at that time were in a very distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:62956:249"/>
estate: One that was an eye-witness related, that
he had seen morning after morning coming to his door,
sometimes thirty, sometimes forty, yea fifty, or six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or more, wringing their hands; some crying that
their husbands were dead: Others that their wives
were dead: Others that their children were dead,
and that they had not any thing wherewithall to bury
them. Some again cried that their Families were
sick, and they had not wherewithall to relieve them.
Others that they had divers children, but they neither
had bread, nor Money to buy it for them. Some
cried for bread: Some for Physick: Others for
Shroudes for their dead: and he not only heard them
patiently; but his bowels yearned towards them, and
his hands were stretched out for their relief. For,
standing within his own Shop, with his own hands,
he ministred supplies unto them all, and so dismissed
them for the present. And the next morning when
there was a renewall of their sad complaints, his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
care of them was renewed also: and thus he
continued morning by morning, even for the space of
near three moneths, till the return of the Mayor into
the City.</p>
                  <p>Besides his great care of supplying the wants of such
poor as came unto him, he had a speciall respect to
poor House-keepers, and Tradesmen, such as were
ashamed, and unwilling to make their sad, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous
condition known; and a peculiar care of the
godly poor, concerning whom he used to advise with
the Constables, and Churchwardens of every Parish,
and according to their need, would proportion some
relief, and help unto them, and send it by the hands
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:62956:249"/>
of the said Constables, or Churchwardens.</p>
                  <p>And his care for the poor was not only in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
season (as their exigents did require)
but so long as he continued in the land of the living:
And he was so constantly exercised in this great work
of charity, that he did it, as it were, naturally: as
the Apostle speaks of <hi>Timothy,</hi> Phil. 2. 20.</p>
                  <p>But though he did well, yet heard he ill even for
this, and by some it was cast in his teeth, that he made
beggars: and when he was asked by a man of place,
and estate, what he would give to keep the poor from
begging? (supposing that he would not be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
therein, as he was in relieving them) he freely
offered a great part of his estate, upon condition that
the other would do the like: But when he saw his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness,
the other pulled back his shoulder, and
would not joyn with him therein.</p>
                  <p>He was given much to hospitality:<note place="margin">His hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> He would not
eat his morsels alone by himself, as <hi>Job</hi> 31. 17. He
well remembred the Apostles direction, <hi>Heb. 13. 2.
Be not forgetfull to entertain strangers.</hi> He was most
loving, and friendly to them, and especially to such
as did suffer for conscience sake: As those godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
who were silenced for <hi>Non-Conformity</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
his own judgement was well satisfied in that
point.) To him they did continually resort, and by
him they were kindly entertained: Insomuch as by
the profaner sort, he was cried out on as an <hi>Arch-Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan:</hi>
But by those that took Religion to heart, he
was honoured with the title of <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us mine Hoste, and
of the whole Church,</hi> as <hi>Rom. 16</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>If we consider his last <hi>Will,</hi> and Testament, we
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:62956:250"/>
shall find in it very great and unparalleled acts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
As he gave one third part of his temporall
estate to his wife, and another third part to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
according to the custome of the City, so out
of the other third part, he left very large Legacies,
especially to the poor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We will here omit many Legacies given to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and others, and point only at some that were
more remarkeable; and take them in his own words
in his</hi> Will; First I give to all the poor of this City, and
County that receive pay of Parishes, and also to those
that dwell in Almes-houses, I give five shillings to each,
to be paid at my Buriall. I give to one hundred more
poor people ten shillings to each, to be given to such as
my Overseers shall think to have most need, the honest
poor to be chiefly looked unto. Also I give to the poor of
<hi>Lime,</hi> where I was born, and to the poor of <hi>Garnsey,</hi>
where I was new born, five pounds to each place. Also
I forgive all the Moneys owing to me, if it be under
the value of twenty shillings to each. <hi>(These smaller
summes which he had lent to the poor were very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:)</hi>
Also my <hi>Will</hi> is, and I give now more to fifty
poor people of this City, and County, twenty shillings to
each, by my Overseers, or the major part of them.
<hi>Thus out of that estate which God had given him, he
gave again by way of gratitude to God,</hi> viz. <hi>to the
poor, who are Gods receivers. God gave him, and
left him a competent estate (after his many, and
great losses) and which is more, he gave him an
heart to</hi> honour <hi>him</hi> with his substance, <hi>Prov. 3. 9. and
to lay it forth as became a faithfull Steward, in the
service, and for the honour of his Lord, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
him with it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="475" facs="tcp:62956:250"/>
It's true, some did wonder, and others did sharply
censure him for his extraordinary charity, and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and especially for that he left no greater a part of
his estate to his wife: But this may be said in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
That the strait, and close hearts of others, are
no fit pattern to measure his large heart by. And
besides, God had opened his hand in giving very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
unto him blessings, both spirituall, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and especially spirituall, even the graces, and
comforts of his Spirit: and he enjoying such sweet
communion with God even above most other men,
what marvel is it if he did more for God than other
men use to do? And as for his wife, as he left her the
third part of his estate, so likewise he made her Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutrix
of his <hi>Will,</hi> and thereby much more had come
to her than there did, had not some Debts (which he
accounted good) failed and come short both of his,
and her expectation: Besides, he did assure himself,
that her Brother, who was then living, and a man of
great estate, would be ready to supply any of her
wants.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have heard what Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> did for
God:<note place="margin">How God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him.</note> In the next place let us see also what God did
for him. Besides all those graces, which were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
in him, and whereby he was enabled to act so
zealously, and vigorously for God, which all were
Gods free gift: and that comfortable assurance that he
had, which was part of his reward: The Lord also
advanced him from a mean, and low estate, to the
highest place of honour, and dignity in that City. His
beginnings were but small, as appears by his answer
to some that threatened to follow him with Suits, and
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:62956:251"/>
not to give over till they had not left him worth a
groat: To whom he chearfully replied: That he
should be then but two pence poorer than when he
came first to <hi>Exeter:</hi> For (said he) <hi>I brought but six
pence with me hither;</hi> and yet, through Gods blessing
on his labours, he gat a competent, and comfortable
estate, whereby he maintained a large Family of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and servants; kept hospitality: was liberall
to the poor, and open-handed to any pious use, even
far beyond many who yet had larger estates. But
when he had the greatest temporall estate, he set no
great estimate upon these fading, perishing things:
He set them not up in his heart (as worldlings use to
do) but trod them under his feet: And usually also
he set them very low in his ordinary discourse of them,
and especially when he was speaking of Heaven, and
heavenly things. And yet he did not forget to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Gods goodness in bestowing any of these
outward things upon him. He found by experience
that they were but <hi>uncertain riches,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17.
And that they had <hi>wings, and would fly away,</hi> Prov.
23. 5. But he did not run crying after them, as they
use to do who set their hearts upon them: whereas he
saw, and acknowledged Gods hand as well in taking
away, as in giving: as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21. and
therefore was quiet, and content, having experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
learned, in some good measure, that excellent
lesson with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul: I have learned in whatsoever state
I am, therewith to be content,</hi> Phil. 4. 11. By vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
and changes of estates, God did exercise his
faith, patience, and contentation.</p>
                  <p>Having passed through the severall inferior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:62956:251"/>
he at last ascended to the highest place of honour
in the City,<note place="margin">He is chosen Mayor, and Burgess of Parliament.</note> to be Mayor there, wherein (as hath
been shewed) he demeaned himself as became a
Christian Magistrate, and his ambition therein was
highly to honour God, who had thus honoured him.
And afterwards he was twice chosen to be a Burgess of
Parliament, wherein his zeal for God, and against
the corruptions of the times, was abundantly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested.
He was a great stickler to have the Bill passed
for the punishment of Adultery with death: but those
times would not bear it: Surely some of the Lawma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
knew some speciall reason for it.</p>
                  <p>When he made a motion for the passing of that
Bill; one, or more of the Members in the House,
cried out, Commit it Mr. <hi>Jurdain,</hi> commit it; upon
which a great laughter was occasioned; whereupon he
presently said unto them (in a zealous manner like
himself) <hi>Do you laugh when a man speaks for Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His courage.</note>
                     <hi>and glory?</hi> Upon which there was a more than
ordinary silence in the House. The Bill was at that
time laid aside, but in a following Parliament, it was
called upon by the name of Mr. <hi>Jurdains</hi> Bill. He
was also (as it's said) the first man that promoted the
Bills for the more strict sanctification of the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi>
and against Swearing.</p>
                  <p>Yea, God did not only advance him to places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and dignity in the eye of the world: but gave him
an high place also in the hearts of his people; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God made good his promise, 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 30. Such
as honour me, I will honour.</hi> His name was very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in the esteem of those that knew his worth, both
whilest he lived, and since his death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="478" facs="tcp:62956:252"/>
Indeed it is confessed that he was a by-word unto
many,<note place="margin">He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by the wicked.</note> and that his name was taken up by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
but it was by such as were upbraided, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by his holy, and gracious conversation: And
he valued not their reproaches, knowing that his
Lord and Master did suffer much more in this kind,
and that this was but a Chip of that Cross, which, as
he was commanded, he was willing to bear: Yea he
was well content to drink of this bitter Cup after his
Master, and with him, he <hi>despised the shame,</hi> Heb.
12. 2. which the men of the world cast upon him:
Nay, he accounted it his honour to suffer shame for
the Name of Christ, as the Apostles did, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 4.
But some there were that brought shame upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
whilest they thought to cast contempt, and
scorn upon him. Amongst other instances, this one
was remarkeable: That being chosen Burgess for the
Parliament, not without much opposition, and going
up to <hi>London</hi> to clear the Election, at which time
there was an accusation sent up against him by a man of
no mean place, and power, That he was the Host of
the <hi>Schismaticks:</hi> Whereupon some presumed that
he would have been sent back with disgrace: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
there was a Sermon prepared by one to jeer
him at his return; this being his Text, <hi>Psal. 114. 5.
What ailed thee—thou Jordan that thou wast driven
back?</hi> Thus men of prophane spirits will dare to
make the sacred Word of God to serve their own base
lusts and ends. But Mr. <hi>Jurdaine,</hi> instead of being
driven back, was confirmed in the place to which he
was chosen, and so shame was cast into the face of this
wicked scorner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Sermon, or Invective ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
proved abortive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="479" facs="tcp:62956:252"/>
And as Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> stood up boldly for God, so
did God stand by, and for him, and assisted him, and
carried him through many troubles, and dangers that
did threaten, and even compass him about. One
act of Gods providence, amongst many others, was
most notable, in delivering him out of trouble. He
having done an act of justice (as was hinted before)
in punishing an unclean person, whose offence was ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
by some hainous circumstances, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with an holy indignation against the offence, he
went (as it seems) besides the letter of the Law in
some circumstance: Whereupon some friends of the
person punished (being stirred up with fury for the
disgrace that reflected upon them, without weighing
the dishonour that was done to God, and the foul blot
that was cast upon Religion) resolved to prosecute
him to the uttermost for it, wherein they put him to
great charge, and trouble, by prosecuting him in the
<hi>Star-Chamber:</hi> and when the cause was to come to a
finall determination, it was much feared by many of
his friends, and through the boastings of his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that some heavy censure would have passed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, to his crushing, if not to his utter undoing.
But when his friends on earth failed, he flees to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for succour, and defence, and cried unto God in
<hi>Davids</hi> words,<note place="margin">The power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> prayer.</note> 
                     <hi>Psal. 22. 11, 19. Be not far from me,
O Lord, for trouble is near: for there is none to help:
O my strength, hast thou to help me.</hi> And he set apart
the evening, and a great part of the night, by fasting,
and Prayer, to engage God of his side, who hath the
hearts of all men, even of the greatest in his hands,
to turn them as he pleaseth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:62956:253"/>
the next morning he received a reall, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
answer from Heaven, being not only acquitted,
but commended by the Lord Keeper, God stirring
up the hearts of divers in that high, and arbitrary
Court, to speak for him. Thus the Lord was a <hi>very
present help</hi> to him in the time of trouble, <hi>Psalme
46.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>After he was thus (through Gods mercy) freed,
and returned to his house, he piled up the Books, and
Papers of all the proceedings in that troublesome, and
vexatious business, under his Cupboard in his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
which was the place to which he did often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort,
and where he had that daily sweet, and heavenly
communion with God aforementioned; and being
asked the reason why he left so many Books, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
to lie in that manner? His answer was; These
I keep in my sight as memorials,<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> and monuments of
Gods mercy in freeing me from my troubles.</p>
                  <p>Many other particulars might be instanced in: but
by that little which hath been said, you may guess at
the great worth of this holy man. Only give me leave
to adde the observations, and testimony of Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Manton,</hi> who knew him well, who speaks thus
of him:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Ignatius Jurdaine</hi> may in some sense be stiled
the wonder, and <hi>Phoenix</hi> of his age, and place of
abode: concerning whose piety, and frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, his constant heavenliness, his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in giving, lending, and entertaining: his doing
justice with impartiality, and diligence, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
heard: and therefore give me leave only to
suggest a few other passages, and observations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="481" facs="tcp:62956:253"/>
1. That for his temper, he was a man of a raised
zeal, and <hi>heroicall</hi> spirit, one of those rare examples
which the Lord giveth the world now and then,
and therefore his actions are not to be measured by
an ordinary standard.</p>
                     <p>2. Seldome or never did any come into his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
but he would discourse with them about holy
things, asking the younger sort, how they did hope
to be saved? The more grown, if they professed
Religion, whether they had any assurance? which
if they denied, he would tell them, that he was
even ashamed of them. In good earnest (would
he say) I would study the Promises, and go into
my Closet, and lock the door, and there plead
them to God, and say, that I would not go forth
till he gave me some sense of his love.</p>
                     <p>3. His entertainment at his Table was free, and
sufficient, but frugall, and sober: If his Wife at
any time excused the slenderness of it, he would
say, <hi>Brown bread, and Kennel water is good fare
with the Gospel.</hi> I have oft heard him say so:
There is somewhat a like saying of Mr. <hi>Greenhams,</hi>
and possibly Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> might borrow it thence,
it suiting so well with the temper of his spirit.</p>
                     <p>4. A formall man had once preached a Sermon
at the <hi>Cathedrall,</hi> about Heaven: the discourse was
for the most part frothy, and beneath the dignity,
and worth of such an Argument. Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> was
present as well as my self: After Sermon I went to
his house (being to receive a Letter from him to
<hi>Oxford)</hi> and after many good instructions, he asked
me, if I had been at the Sermon that morning? I
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:62956:254"/>
told him, yea. <hi>And did you</hi> (said he) <hi>hear those
wonderfull things which God hath provided for them
that love him?</hi> And so he readily picked out all
those passages which were any way subservient to
use, and profit. It was wonderfull to me to see
how an holy heart could draw comfort out of any
thing. The Sermon as Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> repeated to
me, was another kind of Sermon, and seemed to
be savoury, and spirituall. I remember with what
warmth, and vigour he spake of it, even till this
day, and hope that I shall never forget it.</p>
                     <p>5. This is not to be forgotten, his sending a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the late King, and expostulating with him
about setting forth the <hi>Book</hi> concerning <hi>sports, and
recreations</hi> on the Lords dayes, which was inclosed
in another to the Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> to desire him to
convey it: and notice being given to the Bishop that
Copies of it were divulged (possibly by the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriber)
he thought he could not conceal it with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and therefore carried it to the King, who when
he had read it, in a great anger said, He would hang
him. But the Bishop (a pious man) fell upon his
knees, and besought his Majesties pardon, alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>That God had not a better servant, nor his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
a better Subject in the whole Land.</hi> When the
Bishop returned from his moneths attendance,
Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> went to visit him, and after civilities
past, the Bishop said, <hi>Ah,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jurdaine, would you
put me upon so hot a service? You know there are
many eyes upon me</hi> (meaning the Archbishops
party, who suspected him as a favourer of <hi>Puritans)</hi>
Yea, my Lord (said Mr. <hi>Jurdaine)</hi> there are eyes
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:62956:254"/>
upon you, the eyes of God, and his holy Angels, to
see how you discharge your duty, and office as the
Kings Chaplain, and Bishop of the Church.</p>
                     <p>6. Now and then, when he had leasure, he
would usually go to his neighbours shops, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
them to take heed that the cares of the world
did not deaden their spirits to heavenly things, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them, if they had many thousands it would not
still the cry of conscience, purchase the least favour
from God, nor so much as ease the pain of the teeth,
or keep off one fit of an Ague; yea, if money
were thrown to the Dogs, they would not so much
as smell at it.</p>
                     <p>7. He would often perswade his Fellow-Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
to a liberal provision for the poor; and when
they would ask him, where they should have money?
He would answer, God will provide, rather than the
poor shall want, let us sell our Gowns.</p>
                     <p>8. When he did distribute money to the poor
with his own hands in a time of great infection, and
some asked him if he were not afraid of the
Plague? <hi>What</hi> (said he) <hi>afraid of Gods Visitation?
Let us fear rather the Plague-sore of our owne
hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. In his troubles in the Star-chamber, when
one told him, he was sorry that the Lord Keeper
was against him: He answered, <hi>I have a greater
Lord Keeper than him: The Lord is my Keeper, I
shall not be afraid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. It is not amiss to set down what others
thought of him: I remember a godly man obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him, that in every business (though he adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far)
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:62956:255"/>
the Lord carried him through with reputation,
and so compared him with another of great parts,
who, though godly, was alwayes toiled in every
undertaking. Drunkards, and frequenters of Ale-houses,
were afraid of him: He was their usual
<hi>Bugbear;</hi> their <hi>memento</hi> in the middle of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
was; Its time to be gone, Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> will
come by and by.</p>
                     <p>The ordinary sort of men were convinced of his
integrity, insomuch as carnal and vicious men at a
time of election of <hi>Burgesses</hi> for Parliament would
say one to another, If you choose any, choose <hi>Jur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,</hi>
he will be right for the Commenwealth, and
will do the City service. He was twice chosen <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gess</hi>
for the Parliament, and once <hi>Mayor</hi> of the City,
and once <hi>Deputy Mayor</hi> in a time of great Infection
by the Pestilence.</p>
                     <p>The Reverend Minister that preached his Funeral
Sermon, amongst others, had this expression:
Look upon his <hi>Will,</hi> and you will think him the
richest man in the City. Though many exceeded
him in estate, but few or none in making provision
for the poor. Delinquents seldome went from him
without conviction. A Noble mans servant that
had scorned him, being brought before him, and
convicted for having sworn rashly three times,
Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> demanded his Fine, and shewed him
the hainousness of the sin, with which the man was
calmed, and though he came from his companions
braving, yet he returned with the acknowledgement
that he was a good Justicer; and when they
asked him, what <hi>Jurdaine</hi> did to him, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:62956:255"/>
                        <hi>He gave me good Law, and fair words.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>I have heard above thirty years ago, that some
godly persons in <hi>Exeter</hi> were convented before the
Bishops Court for keeping some private dayes of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation;
whereupon Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> went to the
Bishop (who was a godly man) to intercede for them.
The Bishop told him that such Conventicles were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the Law, the State being jealous lest the
seeds of Sedition or Heresie might be sown in them:
To whom Mr. <hi>Jurdaine</hi> replied, <hi>My Lord, Do you
think that the Lord Jesus Christ, when he comes to
Judgement, will say concerning these, and such like poor
Christians, Take them Devil, take them, because though
they sought me by fasting and prayer, yet they did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
every circumstance with so much prudence as they
might have done.</hi> Whereupon the Bishop dismissed
them.</p>
                  <p>I am now come to the last act of his Life,<note place="margin">His Sickness.</note> his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the period of that, his Death. In his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which was very painfull, he being sorely afflicted
with the Stone, and Cholick, yet did he manifest more
than ordinary patience,<note place="margin">His Patience,</note> not opening his mouth in any
word that might savour of repining, or discontent at
his present condition; but meekly and patiently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to Gods afflicting hand, and waiting for his
long-expected, and much desired dissolution. He did
then much act faith in Jesus Christ, and his gracious
Promises, and his assurance remained unshaken, though
Satan was then busie with him by his temptations:
But being <hi>strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
might,</hi> he did resist him. Some of his nearest Friends
that observed his confident Assurance in the course of
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:62956:256"/>
his life, and of his happy estate in heaven after death,
did suppose that Satan would have set upon him with
so much violence, as to have shaken his Assurance, as
no doubt he had will enough to do; but God who had
him in chains, would not permit him to do it: But he
went out of the world as a Conquerour out of the
Field, being, through Christ, victorious over all his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
enemies. One particular in his sickness may not be
omitted, which was, his taking all occasions of exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and encouraging others to constancy in the faith,
zeal for God, and making sure of Heaven; and when
his spirits began to fail him, he would say, <hi>I cannot
speak much more to you now; R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

heard from me in my health.</hi> He was willing also to
incite others that were absent to the discharge of their
Duties. The <hi>Mayor</hi> of the City that then was, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to see how he did, he called the messenger unto
him, and said, <hi>Remember me to Mr.</hi> Mayor, <hi>and tell him
from me, that he have a special care of these three things:
To do Justice: To provide carefully for the poor; and
to make sure of Heaven.</hi> His gracious speeches in the
time of his sickness, were many, and more than can
be here expressed.</p>
                  <p>Having fought the good fight of Faith,<note place="margin">His death.</note> and finished
his course, he sweetly, and quietly resigned up his soul
into the hands of his blessed Saviour and Redeemer.
He departed this Life, <hi>July</hi> the 15. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1640.
being the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sabbath</hi> was his delight on earth, and on that
day God gave him to enjoy an eternal <hi>Sabbath</hi> with
him in Heaven. As he had sweet communion with
God in the use of Ordinances for many years on that
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:62956:256"/>
day, so he went to enjoy an immediate communion
with God on that holy day; and after all his labours he
entred into rest, even that glorious <hi>Rest</hi> in Heaven,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 11. His departure hence was in the Seventy
ninth year of his age, and, according to his account for
the New-birth,<note place="margin">His Funeral.</note> in the Sixty fifth year. For so long he
reckoned since the time of his effectual Calling. At
the celebration of his Funerals, there hath not been
known any man to be more lamented than was he, the
loss being so great, not to the City alone, but to all
those <hi>Western</hi> parts, the influence of his example,
as a zealous Magistrate and Christian, reaching far and

                  <head>The Life, and Death of Mrs.
Margaret Ducke, who dyed
Anno Christi 1646.</head>
                  <p>THe Father of Mrs. <hi>Margaret Ducke</hi> was Mr.
<hi>Henry Southworth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her Parentage</note> a Gentleman of a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
Her Mother was a vertuous and Religious
Matron. He was a Merchant and Customer of
<hi>London,</hi> by which means having acquired a plentiful
estate, he contented himself with it, and withdrew
from thence to a more quiet, and retired (that is a
more happy) life at <hi>Wells,</hi> where he lived plentifully,
and having onely two Daughters, his Co-heirs, he
gave them liberal, and pious education in all those
wayes which commend, and accomplish well-bred
Gentlewomen.</p>
                  <p>This Gentlewoman, who was the younger of his
Daughters, was deservedly dear to both her Parents,
and lived with them till their deaths, which fell out to
be shortly one after another: For as they were lovely
and pleasant in their lives (if I may so use the words
of <hi>Davids</hi> lamentation over <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi>
2 Sam. 1.) so <hi>in their Deaths they were not divided.</hi>
She was then about the one and twentieth year of her
age, at which time she was desired in marriage by
many younger in years, and higher in means and lands
than the Gentleman was,<note place="margin">Her Marriage.</note> unto whom (with her great
contentment even to her dying day) she yeelded her
self, and her affections, resolving (as the vertuous
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:62956:257"/>
                     <hi>Marcella</hi> in St. <hi>Jerom</hi> answered her young Woer, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>realis,</hi>
who was of a Noble, and <hi>Consular</hi> race; <hi>Si nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere
vellem, utique maritum quaererem, non haeredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem)</hi>
that when she married, she would marry an
Husband, not an estate, though yet God had blessed
her Husband with a competency of these outward
things.</p>
                  <p>Their Marriage was celebrated by that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and (even in this age) famous Prelate, Bishop
<hi>Lake,</hi> in the City of <hi>Wells</hi> (who never married any
persons besides themselves) where, for some years they
lived together, and the Town to this day gives an
ample testimony to their piety and charity. For her
part, they say, as <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> said of <hi>Placilla,</hi> that
if she prevented him not in any work of charity, yet
she was sure to concur with him therein; and when
she departed from thence, they soon complained, and
lamented the want of her charity. The blinde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
that they wanted an eye, the lame a staffe, the
mourners one to comfort them, the languishing one
to visit them, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> said of <hi>Nepotian.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
she was eyes to the blinde, feet to the lame;
she was a mother to the poor and distressed, and to
those who had nothing to help them; <hi>The blessing of
those</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> saith of himself) <hi>that were ready to perish
came upon her, and she caused the widows heart to sing
for joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>Wells</hi> they removed to <hi>Blackfriers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her removed to <hi>Blackfriers.</hi>
                     </note>
where she lived long under the powerful Ministry of
the thrice worthy and learned Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> a man, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for his pains in the Church of Christ. What
her Life, Faith, Charity, Patience was, during her
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:62956:258"/>
abode there, was well known to all in general, and
particularly observed by that Reverend Doctor, and
abundantly testified at her Funerals by him, so that
nothing needs to be added to his full, and faithful te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.
One thing was well observed by him, and is
very remarkable, that notwithstanding the many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
she had to see Playes, to which the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
and vicinity of the Play-house there, and
the frequent throngs of Gentlewomen which prest
thither, might have been forcible and prevailing invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
yet she could never whilst she lived there, nor
indeed all the time of her being in <hi>London,</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to see any of them; and being sometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
by her dearest Friend, to go thither, as other
Gentlewomen did, to avoid too much retiredness, she
answered, it is hard to say whether with more discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Religion, that she liked it not, and that, next
to Gods house, she could best spend her time in her
own. In Gods House (if I may with reverence use
<hi>Tertullians</hi> expression) she saw enough of the <hi>Scene,
Scenicae Doctrinae delectant?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her love to Gods House.</note> 
                     <hi>Sat nobis sententiarum,
sat versuum, sat etiam Canticorum, &amp;c.</hi> Sentences,
Verses, and Songs enough to delight her soul. Would
she see a <hi>Tragedy?</hi> There she could see before her
eyes Jesus Christ, <hi>evidently set forth, crucified amongst
them,</hi> Gal. 3. 1. What a sight is Christs coming to
Judgement? Kings throwing down their Crowns
and Scepters, and themselves before him? In her
own house she could (as <hi>Solomon</hi> describes the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Huswife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 27, 28.) imploy her self in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well <hi>to the wayes of her Houshold, and not eating the
bread of idleness,</hi> that so her children might <hi>rise up,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:62956:258"/>
and call her blessed; her Husband also, and he might
praise her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She was so far from the gadding disposition of other
talking,<note place="margin">Her retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> walking women, that she was for the most
part as a Snail, <hi>Domi porta,</hi> within her own shell and
family. And as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> pourtaits his never enough
admired, and applauded <hi>Marcella, Raro procedebat in
publicum, &amp; maximè Nobilium Matronarum domos vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabat,
ne cogeretur videre quod contempserat:</hi> She
went seldome abroad, and especially chose to decline
the houses of Noble and Honourable Ladies, lest she
should be tempted to see those vanities which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to contemn, and so be unwillingly wrought and
brought to desire what she so willingly despised.</p>
                  <p>This retiredness (as usually it doth) drew on her a
decrease of health,<note place="margin">Her weakness.</note> which occasioned, for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a better air, and recovery of health, her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
to <hi>Cheswick,</hi> where she lived to her dying day,
exceedingly beloved, and dyed extreamly lamented,
and desired of all.</p>
                  <p>While she enjoyed her health,<note place="margin">Her holy life.</note> which yet was much
interrupted, her constant, and unfailing practice was,
besides daily prayers in the Family, to betake her self
in the morning, and at other convenient times to her
constant private devotions in her Closet, and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotting
some time (for being a wise and prudent wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
she made a little time reach far) in the education,
and oversight of her children, and disposing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing
the affairs of the Family, the residue of
the day she spent in reading books of Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
and most willingly those of Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> by
which means she made her heart, <hi>Bibliothecam Christi,</hi>
                     <pb n="492" facs="tcp:62956:259"/>
a Library of Christ, and furnished her self with such a
stock of Christian knowledge, and devotion, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
her on with much comfort and cheerfulness
through all her afflictions, till she arrived at her long,
and much longed for home.</p>
                  <p>Both in her health,<note place="margin">Her Meekness.</note> and sickness, she was of so meek
and milde a comportment, and behaviour towards all,
that she conquered by it, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> advised <hi>Polycarp</hi>
to do, those that had (if at least any had) any venemous
sting, or spleen against her. For her meekness she
seemed indeed like that Dove in the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi>
chap. 7. 11. that had <hi>no heart,</hi> none certainly to do any
harm or injury to any. And as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prov.
15. 1. A loft answer turns away wrath;</hi> so without doubt
her soft and milde disposition in these rough and
blustering times, kept off many an impetuous storm
and shower from her. This mildness was eminently
conspicuous in her sickness. One night her Husband
perswaded her to use an <hi>Electuary</hi> that was sent her,
she refused it twice, but in milde tearms; yet the next
morning she told him, that she had been too blame
(it might be) in her words the night before. Often
she desired all the world to forgive her if she had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
any, as she heartily forgave them all that had
offended her. Her Husband told her, that he thought
she had no enemies; <hi>Yea</hi> (said she) <hi>some have wronged
me, but I forgive them from my heart, and desire God to
forgive them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all the time of her sickness she was never heard
to use any impatient word to any,<note place="margin">Her Sickness.</note> or of any <hi>Quis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
ab hac muliere quod displiceret audivit?</hi> That I
may use St. <hi>Jeroms</hi> Question concerning another
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:62956:259"/>
on her behalf, Who ever heard any thing from this
good woman that might displease him? or believed
any thing against her, and condemned not himself of
too much credulity or malignity in believing it?
Cheerful she was, yet she tempered it with such a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
severity; severe she was, yet she allayed it
with such a decent cheerfulness, that it may be truly
said of her, what was said by St. <hi>Jerom</hi> of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
woman, <hi>Nothing was more severe than her cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
nor cheerfull than her severity.</hi> Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
and constellation of vertues and sweetness,
such a Mirror of Charity, such a Treasury and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine
of Chastity and Sobriety was in her. In short,
she had such an eminency in single vertues, as if she
had had no more, and yet such a worthiness in all, as
if she had been singular in none.</p>
                  <p>Since the troubles of these bleeding times she suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
many afflictions with a <hi>Masculine</hi> patience,<note place="margin">Her patience.</note> though
much imbittered to her by a long, and tedious sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the necessary, and indispensable absence of
her dearest Consort, which yet she professed, that it
never bred in her the least ill thought of him, saying
often, that she did but desire to see him again, and to
speak with him, and then she was ready, if God so
pleased, the next day to sing old <hi>Simeons, Nunc dimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
Luke 2. 29. <hi>Lord now lettest thy servant depart in
peace.</hi> And God heard her prayer, and his also (for in
this they were joynt and mutual Orators) and to her
great comfort, she saw him, and spake with, and for
three weeks space they mutually enjoyed each other
abroad in the house. But then the <hi>first-born of Death</hi>
began to <hi>devour her strength</hi> (as <hi>Bildad</hi> speaks,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:62956:260"/>
                     <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 13, 14.) and threatned to bring her to the <hi>King
of Terrours;</hi> for so indeed Death is to them that have
not made their peace with God: But to her, however
in regard of the dissolution, and parting of those dear
friends, body and soul (which had been now for two and
forty years sweet, and loving inmates) a valley of <hi>Achor,</hi>
Hos. 2. 15. (that is, bitterness, as the word imports)
yet was it to her a door of hope to open her a passage
into that better world, which she so much longed after,
often professing, that there was nothing that could
tempt her to wish for life, but the breeding up of her
little ones; which yet now she was the less solicitous
about, because she could leave them in the hands of
their tender, and careful Father, not doubting (as old
dying <hi>Jacob</hi> said when he was blessing the two Sons
of <hi>Joseph,</hi> Gen. 48. 15. 16.) <hi>That that God which had
fed her all her life long untill that day, and the Angel
which had redeemed her from all evil, would bless them.</hi>
And now finding her self arrested by the messenger
of Death, and her body (like the house of <hi>Saul)</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weaker, and weaker, but her soul (like the house
of <hi>David)</hi> waxed stronger and stronger, took higher
flights, and made nearer approaches to God that
gave it.</p>
                  <p>When her Husband came to her (as he did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently)
he continually admonished, and minded her
of the gracious Promises of mercy in Christ, and of
faith in him, and desired her to be strengthened, and
comforted in them: Her answer was, she was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
in them,<note place="margin">Her Comforts.</note> she found the comfort of Gods Spirit
in her, and verily believed she should see the goodness
of the Lord in the Land of the living, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 13.
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:62956:260"/>
Ever and anon saying, <hi>I am comforted: Gods Spirit
is in me which makes me endure my sickness, and
more pains than you can think of, so comfortably as
I do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When she knew of none by, her usual prayer was,
<hi>Lord look down upon me in thy mercy, Lord forgive me
my sins, Lord assist me with thy holy Spirit; Lord thou
hast assured me of the forgiveness of my sins; Lord assist
me still with thy holy Spirit.</hi> And many times passing
the whole night without sleep, she spent that time in
these, and the like heavenly prayers, and ejaculations,
in which her Husband, and those which attend her
continually, still found her when they came to
her.</p>
                  <p>Never man had a more faithfull,<note place="margin">A loving Wife.</note> dear, and loving
Wife, or more carefull of what concerned him, than
himself, and more tender of any thing said, or done
against him, than if it had been said, or done against
her self. And when he seemed to lament the loss he
should have if God took her from him: She meekly
answered, <hi>We came not into the world together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may not look to go out together.</hi> When he replied,
that it would be much better for their children if he
went first, as by the course of nature was most likely,
she said, that he could do much better for the children
than she could, and thanked God for that she could now
leave them with him.</p>
                  <p>For the space of three weeks she kept her bed, and
about a fortnight before her death, being surprized
with a fainting fit in which she was like to depart, and
thereby perceiving that earth would suddenly return
to the earth whence it came, that her soul might be
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:62956:261"/>
the better winged, and prepared for a return to God
that gave it, she de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ired that all the Family might be
called up, and joyn in prayers with, and for her. At
which time, observing the grief and passion of her
Husband, and those that were present, expressed plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
by tears from their eyes, she besought him, and
them not to grieve, and lament for her happiness.</p>
                  <p>About that time a Reverend person coming to visit
her Husband, he solicited him to enlarge that great
act of favour unto him, by a greater act of charity to
his wife, by visiting her also whom God now visited
with sickness, as also to pray with, and administer some
comfort unto her, which he most willingly condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto; and having taken a strict account of her faith
in Christ, and hopes of a better life, he left her with his
Fatherly benediction, top full of comfort; and when
she was afterwards told that he came out of respect
and kindness to visit her Husband, she said, No,
but God had sent him for her comfort, often acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the consolations which she had found by
him.</p>
                  <p>When any came to visit her in the time of her
sickness, at the parting, she desired them to pray
for her, and often sent Messengers, and caused Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be directed to her friends in <hi>London</hi> to pray
for her, for that she was now preparing for another
world.</p>
                  <p>When she was sometimes desired for her childrens
sake to chear up her self,<note place="margin">Her Faith.</note> her answer was, that to leave
them did not trouble her, because she was assured that
God would provide for them, adding that she would
willingly leave Husband, Children, and all, to go to
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:62956:261"/>
Christ, which was just the minde of that blessed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
<hi>Ignatius, Befall me</hi> (said he) <hi>what will, or can, so I
may enjoy Jesus Christ, my Love, my Life that was
crucified for me;</hi> or rather St. <hi>Pauls</hi> case, expressed in
that most elegant <hi>Barbarisme,</hi> Phil. 1. 23. Desiring <hi>to
be with Christ, which is</hi> multo magis melius, <hi>much
more better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now finding the day of her life wasted to the
evening,<note place="margin">She begs Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> and ready to dye into night, on the Lords
day before her death, she desired the prayers of the
Congregation in the Parish where she lived, being well
assured (as she said) that many good people would pray
heartily for her. After which, some coming to visit
her, and exhorting her to patience, and to remember
the afflictions of <hi>Job,</hi> she answered, that she had had
her part in his afflictions, God having given her <hi>Luctuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam
foecunditatem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> said of <hi>Laeta,</hi> a sad,
and sorrowfull fruitfulness, taking away seven of her
children in their minority, so that she (as <hi>Hanna</hi> spake
in her song, 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 5.)</hi> that had <hi>born seven, waxed
feeble,</hi> yet she comforted her self with this hope, that
they were in Heaven before her, and hoped that they
would be Lamps to lead her to heaven; for she assured
her self, that they <hi>followed the Lamb whithersoever he
goeth;</hi> and for those two which were yet alive, she
thanked God, for that she saw no ill qualities in them.
Besides (she said) that God had taken away her goods
from her, but had given her patience, which to
her was of more value; and she esteemed it above
them all, knowing that God was able to restore all
when he pleased.</p>
                  <p>She often acknowledged Gods goodness to her in
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:62956:262"/>
sending her a milde sickness, and not taking her away
with some sudden stroke (as he did the wife of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi>
Chap. 24. 16.) or by some tormenting disease,
as he is pleased to visit some of his dear ones, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the wonderful mercy of God to her
therein.</p>
                  <p>A week before her death,<note place="margin">She blesseth her Children.</note> she called her eldest
Daughter to her, being to go from her to School at
<hi>Putney,</hi> and putting her hand on her shoulder, she said
to her, <hi>I give you that blessing which my Mother gave
me at her death, The God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Isaac,
<hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>bless you</hi> (and then added the
blessing which <hi>Aaron</hi> by Gods own appointment was
to give the children of <hi>Israel) The Lord bless thee, and
keep thee, the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be
gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up his countenance upon
thee, and give thee peace.</hi> And bid her serve God, and
pray duly to him both morning and evening, and fear
his Name, and then (said she) <hi>I doubt not but God will
bless you, as he hath blessed me.</hi> In the evening of the
same day, she commanded her younger Daughter to
be brought her, and to be put upon the bed in a kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
posture, and then putting her hand on her shoulder,
she gave her also the same blessing as she had given to
her sister.</p>
                  <p>Four dayes before her death she grew a little better,
which put her Friends in some hope of her recovery;
but the day following her sickness seized on her again,
and so continued upon her that she slept no more till
she slept the sleep of death, and together with her
sickness, her Piety, Devotions, and comforts encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="499" facs="tcp:62956:262"/>
In the last night of her life, presently after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
feeling death now approaching, she sent for her
Husband,<note place="margin">Her Devotion</note> and Family out of their beds, and told him
when he came to her, that she was now leaving the
world and him, and expressed in many words her great
devotion, faith and assurance of that everlasting life
which she now was shortly to enjoy, and desired that
they might now all pray together, which they did,
she still expressing much devotion and comfort; and
after an hour spent in those passages, she desired that
the Bell might be tolled for her, and some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women
of her neighbours, coming to her, before them
she expressed her comforts, and assurances of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life as before, and with increase, and therein,
and in prayers they continued till near the rising of
the Sun.</p>
                  <p>After this she seemed for a wh'le willing to slumber,
and closed her eyes, and so lay for a little while, but
then turned her head to the other side of the Pillow,
and after a few restless turnings, she said (what the
Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> had said before her, <hi>Mich. 2. 10.)</hi> There
is no rest in this world, and then opening her eyes,
after some expressions of the comfort which she felt,
distinctly knowing all that were present, and speaking
to them all, she seemed to slumber again, and after a
little time, spake these words, <hi>Come, let us go, let us
go;</hi> repeating those words several times, which she
spake not in a slumber, but being awake, and as perfect
in her understanding, and memory, as at any time in
her life. And it is a comforttable opinion that <hi>Divines</hi>
teach from <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 22. that the Angels do attend
on Gods children, especially at the time of their
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:62956:263"/>
dissolution, to conduct their souls from earth, to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
which opinion she sometimes in her sickness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to her Husband, and added, that she had heard
it from the Pulpit, and had read it in some Books,
and she believed it to be true, and comforted her self
with it.</p>
                  <p>After a little time she called for some drink, and
having taken it, it began to alter her, as it seems she
felt in her self, for she presently laid her self back on
her Pillow, and lifting up her eyes towards Heaven, she
said, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me; Lord Jesus receive my
soul;</hi> and so continued moving her lips, and her tongue,
but her words were not heard, and then held up one
hand, and then joyned both her hands together, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up with her eyes still heaven-ward, till her
strength failing her, she laid down her hands by her,
and stretched her self in the bed without any help, and
sweetly fell asleep about seven a clock in the morning,<note place="margin">Her Death.</note>

                  <p>IF we enquire into the Relations of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,<note place="margin">Her Parentage</note>
either by Affinity or Consanguinity, or
both sides, the Families are ancient, of renown, and
good reputation. Concerning the Family from
whence she was descended, her Father was Sir <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
Brent,</hi> late Warden of <hi>Merton</hi> College, a learned
Knight, whose great pains, and dangerous adventures
to procure the <hi>History of the Councel of Trent</hi> (which
he translated into <hi>English)</hi> are to be remembred with
an honourable mention, and for his faithful discovery
of <hi>Jesuitical</hi> juglings, his name will be had in honour,
when the names of the <hi>Popish</hi> party will rot.</p>
                  <p>Her Mother, the Lady <hi>Martha Brent,</hi> was a Lady
of a Gracious spirit, abounding in love, meekness, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
love to Gods Ordinances, and Gods Children.
Her delight (with <hi>David)</hi> was in the society of Saints.
She imitated her worthy Father in the sweetness of
disposition, who was Dr. <hi>Robert Abbot,</hi> that learned
and godly Bishop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> who was <hi>Malleus Baptismi,
&amp; Armianismi,</hi> the Hammer of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme:</hi>
His excellent Works or Monuments of his
Honourable memory.</p>
                  <p>To be born of a godly Family, and to be well des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
is a mercy not to be neglected. Mr. <hi>Philpot,</hi>
a zealous Martyr, being a Kings Son, and an <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon,</hi>

to be abhorred, and looked upon as a ready way
to confusion, rapine, and violence. So then we see
that she was a Gentlewoman every way well descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Her Ancestors were persons of Honour, and from
them she had the benefit of an ingenuous and liberal
Education. This is much, but its more, when I say
that she came of a godly stock, and of praying Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and indeed, this is that which ennobles Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
it self.</p>
                  <p>God in mercy began with this Gentlewoman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,<note place="margin">Her timely Conversion.</note>
even about the fourteenth year of her age. Then
God gave her a willing minde, and purpose of heart
to serve him in the dayes of her youth: Insomuch as
she was <hi>swift to hear</hi> the word of God, <hi>she waited dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
at the posts of Wisdomes Gate.</hi> She wrote the
Sermons which she heard (a practice used by King
<hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, that rare <hi>English Josiah)</hi> and she
left many volumes of Sermons of her own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,
taken with great dexterity, and these
are as so many choise Monuments of her Industry.
She was much conversant in reading of the holy
Scriptures (which can <hi>make us wise unto salvation)</hi> and
she joyned with her reading, prayer,<note place="margin">Her Piety.</note> and meditation.
Her delight was in the word of God: It was (as with
<hi>Jeremy)</hi> the <hi>joy and rejoycing</hi> of her soul; and with
the reading of Scriptures she searched Expositors, and
<hi>Practical Divines,</hi> and attained thereby to such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Divine knowledge, as enabled her to state some
Questions of controversie for her better use, and help
of her memory, and to discourse very soundly upon
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:62956:264"/>
the most material points of Religion, and even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
her age and sexe, to maintain the truth, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was offered, with strength of Argument against
gain-sayers.</p>
                  <p>She was eminent for the grace of <hi>Humility;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her Humility.</note> and
when I have said that she was of an humble spirit, what
can be said more? This the Apostle would have us
<hi>to be cloathed withall,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. Humility is the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all Graces: Its that Salt that seasons the best
parts and graces. So humble was the spirit of this
excellent Gentlewoman, that the poorest might have
free access unto her, and receive curteous language
from her mouth, and liberal almes from her heart and
hand, both being opened wide for their relief. The
observation of this humble deportment from her
child-hood, gained the heart of her dear Husband un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her, long before she was ripe for her Marriage:
Her humble spirit evidently appeared by her condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<hi>to them of low estate:</hi> the servants in her Family,
the poorest, and meanest in the Parish where she
lived, will bear witness to the truth of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                  <p>She was of a <hi>meek and quiet spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her Meekness.</note> which (as the
Apostle saith, 1. <hi>Pet. 3. 3.) is in the sight of God of great
price.</hi> All her Relations will attest her meek deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and how much she hated brawls and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Her very enemies (if they would speak their
consicences) can testifie her readiness to pass by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.
So far she was from <hi>rendring reviling for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings,</hi>
that she endeavoured to <hi>rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was modest, and grave; though she was of a cheerfull
spirit, yet it was without levity: She was no tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
busie-body, no medler in the affairs of others:
She was no gadder up and down from house to house,
hearing, and telling of news (as too many do to the
wounding of the reputations of others.) The vain
and frivolous discourse of some who came to visit her,
was an heavy burden, and affliction to her spirit. The
dicourses of such as tended to the defaming and blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others reputation, were a great grief and trouble
unto her; and when she heard such discourses, she
would endeavour to turn the stream another way, and
move such discourse as might be profitable for the

                  <p>Her Love was very eminent towards all those that

a lover of their acquaintance, who were the Saints, the
<hi>excellent ones,</hi> Psal. 16. 3. Insomuch as when she appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
any thing of God, though in persons inclining

was so compassionate, as to labour with much sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

Her holy Courage deserves special notice;<note place="margin">Her Courage.</note> for
though she was humble, meek, and loving, yet she
was stout and couragious in declaring her judgement
upon just occasions, before those whom she knew to
be contrary minded, hating compliance against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and doubting alwayes the soundness and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity

was much of her worthy Fathers temper in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
who hath been often heard to say, that a
Coward can hardly be an honest man; and much of
<hi>Esters</hi> resolution, desiring rather to suffer her self
than sluggishly, and silently to see the truths of God
to suffer.</p>
                  <p>She was a praying Christian:<note place="margin">Her frequent prayers.</note> She was much in
prayers and tears; much in a sacred acquaintance, and

comply with all companies in their opinions. She kept
close to the publick Ministry where she lived, there she
heard the word faithfully dispensed. She neither was
of their opinion, nor practice, who out of I know not
what kinde of singularity, separate from the Ministry
of a godly Pastor and Husband. Her delight was very
great in Gods Ordinances, and she was glad when
they said, <hi>Let us go to the house of the Lord in company.</hi>
She had such an high esteem of, and longing desire
unto the house of God, that when her strength failed
her, she would be carried thither; by reason of lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the feet of her body were weak, but the feet
of her soul, her affections, were strong, nimble, and
vigorous.</p>
                  <p>Look upon her in her Relations,<note place="margin">Her Family government.</note> as a Wife, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Mistress, and you shall see she was mindefull
of her duty to God in them all: Her great care and
endeavour was to set up God in her Family; in order
whereunto she bestowed great pains in <hi>Catechising</hi> of
her children, and other near Relations committed unto
her charge. Her great design was to bring them all
up in the fear and admonition of the Lord, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate
again and again, that main and needfull lesson
of <hi>Remembring their Creator in the dayes of their youth.</hi>
Much pains she took in <hi>Catechising,</hi> and instructing her
servants, especially before they were to receive the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper. She used to examine
them of the Sermons they heard, and she customarily
read over those Sermon Notes to them which she had
taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

prepared to give an account thereof to her Husband.
God was pleased to give her several <hi>Olive branches
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:62956:266"/>
round about her Table,</hi> well bred, well <hi>Catechised,</hi> and
well governed, and of very great hopes. As <hi>Eunice</hi>
and <hi>Lois</hi> instructed young <hi>Timothy,</hi> so she instructed
those hopefull little ones in the holy Scriptures, and
acquainted them with the knowledge of God in their
tender years. Thus according to <hi>Solomons</hi> counsel,
they were trained up in the way wherein they should
walk, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 6. and that even from their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
insomuch as one of them (though very young)
hearing a neighbour using the name of the Lord upon
a sleight occasion, reproved him for it, alleadging the
Commandement of God against it, <hi>Thou shalt not take
the Name of God in vain.</hi> And another of them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
with his fellows about God and the Devil, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that he had rather be in hell with God, than in
heaven with the Devil. And a third, who by reason
of her age could not speak distinctly, said in some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with her Father, that God Almighty would not
bless them who tell Fibbs (meaning Lies) and that
she had rather dye than tell a Fibb; so far had their
Mothers instructions prevailed with them.</p>
                  <p>She was eminent for a charitable and bountifull
spirit;<note place="margin">Her Charity.</note> she was another <hi>Dorcas,</hi> full of <hi>good works,</hi> and

a vertuous woman, may properly be applied unto her,
<hi>Many Daughters have done vertuously, but she excelled
them all,</hi> Prov. 31. 29. Many there are that come far
short of her, but very few that went beyond her in
the acts of Charity. God gave her a liberal and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
estate, and that was a great mercy; but it was a
far greater mercy that he gave her a liberal heart <hi>to do
good, and to distribute: To cast her bread on the waters,</hi>
                     <pb n="508" facs="tcp:62956:267"/>
and to <hi>honour God with her substance.</hi> That protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which <hi>Job</hi> makes for his own vindication, may
fitly be applied unto her, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 16, 19. He would
not <hi>with-hold the poor from their desire, nor cause the
eyes of the widow to fail.</hi> He would not <hi>see any to perish
for want of cloathing, nor any poor without covering.</hi>
The whole Country round about where she dwelt,
will bear her witness, that she visited and relieved the
sick, and cloathed the naked, fed the hungry, and
healed the wounded. Her purse, her hand, her heart,
were all open for their relief. She bought many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Drugs, and cordial waters: She made several
precious salves, and gave them all away to such as
were in need of them. She spared not her best pains,
being never aweary of well doing; insomuch that in
the extremity of her greatest sickness (such bowels of
compassion yearned in her) she compounded several
Medicines with her own hands, and applied them.
Thus will her works praise her in the Gate, and <hi>being
dead, she yet speaketh,</hi> Prov. 31. 31. Heb. 11. 4. For her
precious name liveth. The Lord will have the name
of the Righteous to be in <hi>everlasting remembrance,</hi>
Psal. 112. 6. and the <hi>memory of the just is blessed,</hi>
Prov. 10. 7. And <hi>precious in the sight of the Lord is the
death of his Saints,</hi> Psal. 116. 15. Now this rare
Gentlewoman reaps the fruit of her serving of God,
and the whole harvest, whereof she received onely the
first fruits in this present world.</p>
                  <p>The usual saying is,<note place="margin">Her Sickness.</note> 
                     <hi>All is well that ends well:</hi> Come
we therefore to speak of her end. Her life was holy,
and therefore her death must needs be happy. It
pleased the Lord to exercise her with a long and
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:62956:267"/>
lingring sickness; and amidst the weakness of the
outward man, God gave her great strength in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man; though her limbs and outward strength
failed her, yet God was her <hi>strength and portion,</hi> and
he never failed her. A few dayes before her distemper
waxed high (her Husband being from home) she sent
for all her Family both young and old, to come in unto
her chamber, with whom she prayed near two hours,
with such pathetical, heavenly, Scripture-language,
as drew admiration and tears from those that were
present. She blessed her children, counselled her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
heartily and affectionately commended her
Husband unto God; she wept and prayed, and prayed
and wept, and could not easily part with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
nor yet leave off praying, and weeping.</p>
                  <p>Upon the encrease of her distemper,<note place="margin">Her holy speeches.</note> her spirit was
much disturbed, and some impertinent speeches did
fall from her, yet in the middest of all her imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences,
Grace, and the Spirit of God, did eminently
declare their Power and Sovereignty in her, by many
savoury and choice speeches, and sweet breathings of
her soul; some of which are these that follow, <hi>I was in
the Devils claws, but Jesus Christ, the sweet Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
of my soul, the sweet Bridegroom of my soul</hi>
(these words she often reiterated) <hi>the sweet Bridegroom
of my soul hath delivered me.</hi> At another time, <hi>I am
safe, for Jesus Christ is at my heart, and I would not
part with him for ten thousand worlds.</hi> Again, <hi>Come
Lord Jesus the Captain of my salvation, ride on gloriously
conquering, and to conquer for me Satan, Sin, Hell, Death,
and all mine enemies.</hi> Afterwards again, <hi>I was in Hell,
but now I am in Heaven; I am in Heaven indeed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:62956:268"/>
I am in Heaven; I am in Heaven eternally; I am
in Heaven the habitation of Gods glory unto all eternity.</hi>
Much of this nature she did speak, even when her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
was so disturbed, that she scarce did know
her near Relations, and those who did attend upon her
in her Chamber.</p>
                  <p>And now all these things are worthy to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto posterity, and to be had in perpetual
remembrance. She was an eminently godly Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,<note place="margin">Her Character</note>
being but little above Eight and twenty years
of age when she dyed, which was in the beginning of
<hi>March, Anno Christi</hi> 1656. But though she was young
in years, yet was she old in Grace: She had lived long in
a little time:<note place="margin">Her Death.</note> She was a mirror of her age, and a renown
of her sexe, a pattern worthy of imitation. She was
the beloved faithfull wife of as an intirely loving and
faithfull Husband. She was a tender affectionate
Mother to her own, and no less carefull of those
pledges committed to his charge. She was a most
dear Sister, an affectionate Mistress, carefull both of the
bodies and souls of her servants, that they should
neither want corporal, nor spiritual food. Her profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was with <hi>Joshua,</hi> Chap. 24. 15. <hi>Choose you this day
whom you will serve; But as for me, I and my house, we will
serve the Lord.</hi> She was not onely a friend to her
friends, but a friend to her enemies, even unto such
as despitefully used her All the Country round about
could not but look upon her, whilst living as a publick
gain, and when dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a publick loss: She was very
usefull whilst she lived, and will be much missed now
she is dead. Two things were very eminent in her:
Setledness in Religion, and holiness of conversation.

that sovereign Cordial which abundantly revived, and

                  <head>The Life, and Death of Mrs.
Elizabeth Wilkinson, who dyed
Anno Christi 1654.</head>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Wilkinson</hi> was born of godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,<note place="margin">Her parentage, and education.</note>
of an ancient, and well reputed Family
of the Gentry in <hi>Devonshire.</hi> Her Father was
Mr. <hi>Anthony Gifford,</hi> her Mother, Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth
Cottle,</hi> and by them she was religiously educated du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her minority: After which she lived with an Aunt
(an old Disciple) above twenty yeares together,
where she had many prizes put into her hands to get
wisdome, even many spirituall advantages for her
eternall good. But considering that no helps of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
nor any means could prove effectuall without
divine influences; it pleased the Lord out of the riches
of his mercy, in a signall manner to vouchsafe a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to all those helps, for the good of her soul, and
to crown all endeavours in order thereunto with good
success.</p>
                  <p>She was observed from her childhood to be very
docile, very willing to learn, industrious in reading
of,<note place="margin">Her timely conversion.</note> and swift to hear the Word of God preached. She
was very carefull to remember what she heard, and
took much pains in writing Sermons, and collecting
speciall Notes out of practicall <hi>Divines.</hi> She had the
ornament of a meek, and quiet spirit; with that she
was eminently adorned: She looked not (as too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
do) upon gaudy, and vain dresses as any orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:62956:269"/>
She neither liked them, nor conformed to
them, but went in a grave, decent, and sober attire:
She was humble, gentle, tender-hearted, and full of
bowels of compassion, remembring <hi>such as were in
bonds, as if she had been bound with them,</hi> Heb. 13. 3.
She was of so affable, sweet, and courteous a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that she gained abundance of love, and respect
from all those that conversed with her: and by this
means she was the greater gainer by all good conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
It was her usuall custome to move good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and ofttimes she turned the stream of other
impertinent talk into something which was solid, and
tended unto edification, and that ministred <hi>grace to
the hearers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>She kept a</hi> Diary <hi>of Gods dealings with her soul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her piety.</note>
                     <hi>and of other various dispensations that she met withall.
She was much busied in prayer, meditation, and self-examination.
She would often desire her Husband,
and others of her acquaintance to deal plainly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
with her. For (said she)</hi> I would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with a formall profession, nor with a temporary
faith. Perhaps through affection you may judge far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of me than I deserve; wherefore I desire you to sift,
and search me throughly: for I like such plain dealing
best of all, and those are my best friends which deal most
plainly with me.</p>
                  <p>In process of time after a carefull watching over her
heart,<note place="margin">Her growth in grace.</note> and frequent addresses made unto the Throne
of grace, she found returns answerable to her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and desires: God gave her a large measure both
of parts, and graces: She was able not only to assert
the truths of God, but to convince gainsayers. She
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:62956:270"/>
abounded in love, faith meekness, humility, and
the rest of the graces of the Spirit, insomuch as she
became a Christian of the higher Form, a tall Cedar
of <hi>Libanus,</hi> a grown, solid, and excellent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
                  <p>It pleased God for the triall of her graces,<note place="margin">Her afflictions sanctified.</note> to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
her very much in the School of affliction. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as ten years before her death, she was (one
time reckoned with another) at least half the time
sick. But God ordered this sickness of her body to
be a medicine for her soul. For the spirit of prayer
was much set on work hereby; and her faith, love,
and patience did appear, and shine the more eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Out of the Furnace she came forth as gold purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
seven times: so that the rod, and staff, correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and instruction went together, and by these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
chastisements her soul did thrive more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.
When she was able, she neglected not the
frequenting of the publick Assemblies: they were her
delight: and she was a professed adversary to the
withdrawing from the publick Congregations of the
Saints. Both them, and the godly, and Reverend
Ministers of the Gospel she had in high esteem, and
reverenced them all her dayes. And when she was
not able to go to the publick Congregations, she used
to spend her time in reading, prayer, and meditating
at home, and imployed her friends to read to her, and
pray with her. Such as were stable, and sincere
Christians were her delight: Those she accounted
more excellent than their neighbours. She would
often say, that <hi>She valued no friends like to those who
were friends to her soul.</hi>

Concerning her deportment,<note place="margin">Her Relative duties.</note> and carriage to her
Relations (for such as are reall Saints shew it in their
severall capacities) never was a Wife more full of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
love, and respect to an Husband, whom she lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
entirely, and was as entirely beloved by him. Her
affection to her children was very tender: She was
carefull to <hi>Catechize,</hi> instruct, and to train them up
in the fear of God; and upon her Deathbed, amongst
many other excellent counsels, and instructions, she
added this charge as from a dying Mother, that they
should remember that they had a Mother, who would
not allow them in any sin. She was carefull also to
instruct her servants, and to teach them the fear of the
Lord. Indeed she was ready, and willing (as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
was offered) <hi>to do good unto all:</hi> and as
need required, gave unto them, both corporall, and
spirituall food. She had a large heart, and improved
it to do a great deal of good in a little time: Insomuch
as the poor, the sick, the afflicted, and the unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
to whom she was very mercifull, and usefull
whilest she lived, had a very great miss of her when
she was dead. In brief, she was one of those Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
<hi>of whom the world was not worthy:</hi> And yet to
give a further Character of her, I will here set down
a Narrative, copied exactly out of her own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,
of Gods gracious dealing with her soul, as it
follows word for word.</p>

to remove me from an ignorant place where I was
born, and to bring me very young, into a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Family: And when I was about twelve years of
age, upon the reading in the <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:62956:271"/>
the happy estate of the godly, and the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
condition of the wicked in their death, and so
for ever unto all eternity; it pleased the Lord so much
to affect my heart with it, as from that time my
heart was wrought over to a desire to walk in the
wayes of God. But at that time, I fear, I did not
go upon a right principle; for I then did not eye
the glory of God in it, but only my own safety,
that it might be well with me for ever. But quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after that I had but begun to set my face towards
<hi>Sion,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Satans malice.</note> I was set upon with many temptations, and
perplexities in my thoughts, which were very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
to me at all times, but especially when I
was alone: the consideration whereof brought such
an horrour upon my conscience, insomuch as I did
not know what to do. That little I had, whether
from education, or from the light of Nature, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a striving in me continually against those
thoughts of <hi>Atheisme,</hi> which were most terrible
unto me. I was sensible that it was a fearfull sin to
have any such thoughts to lodge within my brest:
but I desired from my soul to be freed from them,
and had continuall reasonings within me against
them, and yet still for a long time I was troubled,
but could not acquaint any with my condition. I
did not think that it was so with any other as it was
with me.</p>
                     <p>In this strait,<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> when I knew not which way to
turn me, even there did the Lord extend his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
towards me in my greatest extremity, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
me to read <hi>Calvins Institutions,</hi> and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that part that treats of the Creation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:62956:271"/>
the Lord was pleased to give in such satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to my soul, concerning those things about which
I was troubled, as that from that time forwards I
was not violently assaulted in that kind.</p>
                     <p>But no sooner was I freed from that trouble,
but new ones sprang up: For the very remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of that horrid sin of <hi>Atheisme,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Satans subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> left such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
upon my spirit, as made me fear that I had
committed that <hi>sin against the Holy Ghost:</hi> and so
my condition seemed to be, not only for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but, in my apprehension, then for ever most
miserable. All other sins, though never so great,
I knew upon true repentance were pardonable: but
this sin, that I lay under the fear of, I knew out of
the Word of God should never be pardoned: which
caused many sad fears upon my spirit known to God
alone.</p>
                     <p>For the removall of these fears,<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> the Lord in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
directed me to the reading of Mr. <hi>Scudders</hi>
Works; where are laid down the marks of that sin.
Upon perusall whereof the Lord was pleased to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
my misgiving heart, by a clear manifestation
to my soul, that I had not committed that sin; and
so assured me that though my sins were great, yet
were they pardonable, which put me more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
upon the use of such means as the Lord had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
me unto. And having satisfaction given in
concerning this particular, there was a great burden
taken off from my spirit. Although I found no
grace in my heart, nor discovery of the love of God
unto my soul, yet, in that there was but a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
there was a ground of comfort administred to
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:62956:272"/>
my heart; which I formerly feared that I should be
shut out from. But still my fears remained, that I
was not one of those in particular for whom Christ
died: The more I looked into mine own heart, the
more I saw, of sin, and Satan, discouraging me
from having any hope, that the Lord should accept
of such a vile sinfull wretch as I was, who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
such sinfull thoughts.</p>
                     <p>I likewise thought how small the number was of
those that should be saved, in comparison of others,
and my repentance, I feared, came short of that
which was required in the Gospel. As for faith, I
could not find the least measure of it in my soul;
with many other sad discouraging thoughts. But
when I was most perplexed with fears, and doubts,
even then did the Lord graciously dart in some
beams of his reconciled countenance, as I was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
something in Mr. <hi>Scudders Christian daily
Walk,</hi> &amp;c. which the Lord set home upon my
soul,<note place="margin">Her comfort, and joy.</note> and brought into my soul so much joy, and
comfort at the present, as neither my tongue, nor
Pen can express: But this joy remained not long,
for I quickly lost the sense of it: yet the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of it was sweet unto me at all times.</p>
                     <p>But after this, all my former fears returned afresh
again upon my heart, only I had a door of hope
opened, that when God saw it best for me, he
would return, and renew his reconciled counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
unto my soul in the clear light, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
thereof: and this was when I was about
sixteen years of age. After which time the Lord
did exercise me with various dispensations: For, for
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:62956:272"/>
two years space, I was by providence cast upon a
place, where I heard very little powerfull preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
small helps for the good of my soul, but what
the Lord was pleased to give in by the use of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
means. But his power, and abundant mercy
was much seen in that time, that, though I had not
much comfort,<note place="margin">Gods mercy in want of mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> yet the Lord was pleased to keep up
my spirit in a way of depending upon him, and my
fears were less at that time, than formerly when I
had more helps: So gracious was t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Lord unto
me, in keeping me alive in a time of famine.</p>
                     <p>After this, through Gods goodness, I was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
under the preaching of a powerfull Minister,
[Mr. <hi>Bateman</hi> of <hi>Ockingam]</hi> who was Crowned
with the conversion,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> strengthening, and building
up of many souls: unto whose preaching the Lord
gave me such a blessing, as I seldome, if ever, went
away from hearing him without comfort. Though
I came to hear him with many doubts upon my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
yet the Lord so ruled, and directed him, as if
his Sermons had been only concerning my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and he fully acquainted with the whole conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my soul. Sometimes the Lord directed me
to some supporting Promises, upon which I relied:
But those Promises which were made to Believers,
though I highly prized them, yet I durst not apply
them to my self, fearing that I had no interest in
them. But that Promise <hi>Prov. 28. 13. He that
confesseth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Her faith in Promises.</note> 
                        <hi>and forsaketh his sins, shall find mercy.</hi>
And that 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 9. If we confess our sins, he is
faithfull, and just to forgive us our sins, and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</hi> And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:62956:273"/>
is 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 1, 2. If any man sin, we have an
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours onely, but for the sins of the whole world;</hi> and the
Invitation, <hi>Isa. 55. 1. Ho, every one that thirsteth come
ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye,
buy, and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without
money, and without price,</hi> together with the rest of the
Chapter; all those places the Lord often made a
stay unto my soul: And afterwards the Lord so
blessed one means or other unto me, insomuch as I
was kept from sinking, and falling into such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
as many of the people of God sometimes fell
into.</p>
                     <p>But yet my fears and doubts were so many, as
that my comfort never lasted long:<note place="margin">Her fears and doubts.</note> If the Lord did
but <hi>hide his face, I was troubled.</hi> No longer could
I beleeve (then I found new strength given in) that
the Lord would ever have mercy upon my soul.
The sense of <hi>Original sin,</hi> and <hi>Actual</hi> transgressions in
their filthiness, and guiltiness, caused my fears yet
to remain upon my spirit, my faith then seemed
very small, if I had any, which I much questioned:
I durst not then say, <hi>Lord encrease my faith,</hi> but I
could cry earnestly, <hi>Lord work faith in me.</hi> I found
much dulness and deadness, manifold distractions in
duties, so that God might justly have withdrawn
himself from me for ever; yet notwithstanding all
my uneven walking with God, he was graciously
pleased to manifest his mercy unto my soul.</p>
                     <p>When I was stricken with such weaknesses, as
I apprehended might quickly have ended my life,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:62956:273"/>
I fell into a great fear: At the first finding my heart
to sink, the Lord was pleased to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ive me so much
respite, as to pour out my soul before him, desiring
strength and support from him to keep up my spirit,
and to make me willing to submit to his dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the Lord graciously answered my prayers,
in that he removed all my former doubtings,<note place="margin">Her prayers answered.</note> and
fears all the time of that sickness, which was long,
and so dangerous, that neither I, nor others expected
my life. The Lord then cleared up my evidences
for Heaven, and gave me in so much comfort against
the apprehension of death, as I never had in all my
life before.</p>
                     <p>Other like trials of the Lords love I found still,
when I was in the greatest extremity, and stood
most in need of help from him, insomuch as at such
times, I have hoped that I should never again have
questioned the love of God to my soul: But I have
found it otherwise by sad experience: For when
these impressions were worn of, I have been ready
to call all in question again concerning my poor
soul. It made me oft to think of that which was
laid to <hi>Solomons</hi> charge, that he <hi>forgat the Lord that
had appeared to him twice.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A hard thiug to beleeve.</note> I found it the hardest
thing to believe, that ever I went about. But this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
condition could not satisfie my soul; for the
Lord giving me sometimes a glimpse of his love,
made me long after fuller enjoyments of it, so that I
was carried out with a restless impatience, to beg
that the Lord would take away the heart of unbelief
from me, which did both dishonour him, and
hinder me from that peace which the Lord was
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:62956:274"/>
willing that his people should enjoy.</p>
                     <p>My heart then being brought unto that frame,
I was more willing than ever I was before, to impart
my condition unto some spiritual Friends,<note place="margin">She imparts her condition to Christian friends,</note> whom I
desired to deal impartially with me, acquainting
them with the whole condition of my soul, how far
the Lord had carried me on, and at what I stuck, and
still as new objections did arise, I laboured to get
satisfaction: Being convinced that I had too much
prejudiced my self in that I had not sooner made
my condition known to some who were able to give
me advice.</p>
                     <p>This way of communicating my condition,<note place="margin">And findes comfort.</note> I
found the Lord blessed unto my soul, insomuch that
my hopes were more confirmed, my fears more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
my faith more strengthned, and by the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such Sermons and reading such Books as
came closest unto the conscience, and were most for
trial of ones spiritual condition, I found the greatest
benefit by, and received the most comfort from
them. Formerly I had many fears that I was not
one of them who had an interest in the Election of
Grace: But the Lord afterwards put into my heart
to enquire whether I had those Graces of his Spirit
wrought in me which none but his own elect people
could have.</p>
                     <p>Upon the strictest searching into mine own heart,
the Lord was pleased after many years of fear, at last
to evidence unto my soul that there was a change
wrought in my heart,<note place="margin">Her self-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</note> will, and affections, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the remainders of sin and corruption, which
still encompassed me about; being confident that
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:62956:274"/>
he that had begun this good work, would not leave it
unfinished unto the day of Jesus Christ; and the
Lord was pleased to set home divers Promises for
the strengthning of my faith;<note place="margin">Her faith.</note> to wit, those which
set down the <hi>Everlasting Covenant,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 5. The
<hi>Everlasting love of God,</hi> Jer. 31. 3. Joh. 11. 13. The
certainty of the <hi>Foundation,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the <hi>Promises,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. They <hi>are all in
Christ Yea and Amen;</hi> and that the children of God
have eternal life promised unto them, and that
none shall be ever <hi>able to pluck them out of Christs
hands,</hi> Joh. 10. 28. Then for divers years the Lord
was pleased to stay me, to lead, and guide me till
he had <hi>set my feet upon that Rock which is higher
than I,</hi> from whence I trust, that I shall never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.
And now my hearts desire is, to ascribe
that measure of hope and comfort which the Lord
hath given me at any time, onely unto the praise of
the glory of his Grace, who hath made me <hi>accepted in
his Beloved,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Her thankful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness.</note> which is so great a mercy as I can never
be thankfull enough for, nor walk answerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
I know, when I look into my heart, there is
matter of fear that the Lord will withdraw the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of his comforts from me: But that which I
rest upon is, the free mercy of God in Christ, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
performance of his Promises made, <hi>Rom.
6. 16. Sin shall not have dominion over you, because
you are not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> And
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25. that he will <hi>sprinkle clean water upon
me, and that he will give me a new heart, and put a
new spirit within me, that he will take away my stony
heart, and give me an heart of flesh;</hi> being perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:62956:275"/>
that the Lord will keep me by his own <hi>Power
through faith unto salvation.</hi> And now that I may
have all the Graces of the Spirit strengthened, and
encreased in me, which I finde that I stand in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
need of: It is the desire of my soul to be a
partaker of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which, through the
blood of Christ onely, I have right unto.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This is the particular account of Gods gracious
dealing with this godly Gentlewoman: considering
there was no administration of the Sacrament in that
<hi>Parochial</hi> Congregation where she lived, and used
formerly to receive it, nor any Pastor at all to officiate
there, she being desirous to enjoy that great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and that after a pure way of administration,
sent this aforementioned <hi>Narrative</hi> to the Reverend
Dr. <hi>Harris,</hi> living then in the University, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
her to the participation of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>
in that publick Assembly where he administred it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now let us see also a Letter written by Dr.</hi>
Harris <hi>concerning this godly Gentlewoman, whom
he highly honoured, upon the occasion of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
the aforesaid Letter of hers to a friend:</hi>
Do not <hi>(saith he)</hi> think it lost time to read over this
Narrative: It was penned by this gracious woman upon
a serious occasion, what time she was to give an account of
her self at her admission to the Lords Supper. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is plain, but pregnant of instruction. I alter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the thing, I onely take notice of the persons
therein mentioned: As 1. God, 2. Satan, 3. The
parties self: All which offer matter worthy thy
thoughts.</p>
                  <p>First in Satan, thou seest his most ordinary way and
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:62956:275"/>
method in tempting. His first attempt is to blow out all
light left in the soul,<note place="margin">Satans me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> and to quell all thoughts of a Deity if
possibly he can, that so no room at all may be left for God:
If that cannot be, but the conscience will be sometimes
talking; then his next work is to question and argue the
case, whether indeed there be such a person as God, such
a thing as the soul, such a book as the Bible, such a place
as an Heaven or Hell; and if he cannot gain such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
from the soul, then in the third place the Question
is, What manner a one this supposed God is? And first,
whilst thou art in thy natural state he represents God
made all of mercy, and when thou art under mercy, all
of vengeance and fury; there was no place for fear,
and here none for hope: There sin was an inconsiderable
thing, and beneath Gods cognisance; here sin is unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and beyond Gods mercy: In both estates he labours
the destruction of Faith; now in the threats, then in
the Promises. In the first estate you must never yeeld to
self-despair; no, spit in his face that shall once question
thy belief in God, without the least doubting. What?
not believe my Maker with all my soul? What? once
doubt or suspect him? I defie him, and the foul fiend
that shall say so. On the other side, when once converted,
what hast thou to do with the Covenant of Grace
and Peace? That is bread for Children, not for Dogs,
Hypocrites, for such as have sinned against the Holy
Ghost, as thou hast done; and at this bay he holds the
soul for some space; and eftsoon recruits his forces, and
renews his Interrogatories, thus, Thou within the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise?
Thou a believer? Canst thou say, darest thou say
that thou hast faith? It may be thou darest not deny it,
but what is that to the point? Thou darest not affirm it,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:62956:276"/>
though partial enough to thy self: Be advised by me,
who loves plain dealing, and let not thy false heart, and
these fawning Preachers befool thee unto destruction.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Devil up, and down, first and last, thus he
proceeded with man at the first, and though sometimes
he shifts hands, and findes out new wayes, yet here lyes
his road for the most part, and this is the first party
here named.</p>
                  <p>Now in the second place,<note place="margin">Gods mercy to his own.</note> what doth God? It must be
granted that he permitteth these Hellish Scullions to scour
his Plate, and to fit the vessels of honour for their Masters
use, and they (as glad of the office) bestir themselves, they
dawb their vessels, and render them as foul and ugly as
they can; but when they have done their work, God takes
his Plate out of their hand to their no small grief; and in
the mean while God goes along with the temptations, and
in them all supports his poor servants now more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by his own hand, prompting their Petitions, dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into their souls some glimpses of comfort, minding
them of some Promise, to be sure, yeelding them some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
hope, something or other which draws them along
still more or less. 2. Now more immediately by men,
and other means; sometimes he directs them to some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Book or Treatise which fits their case, and holds soul
and life together at present; sometimes he sends an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
one of a thousand, that shall rip up their misery,
and shew them their misery, and shew them their remedy,
and at last fetches off his Captives, even then when Satan
began to crow, and cry victory, that extremity being
Gods opportunity, and this is usually, though not ever,
Gods way.</p>
                  <p>Now look upon the third concerned, the party tempted,
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:62956:276"/>
what doth he? He sticks (often) in the birth, fool as he is,
his first work is to keep the Devils counsel, confess and be
shamed for ever;<note place="margin">Mans folly.</note> the Devil is true to him, and he will be
as true, and never peach: he travels with a wofull bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of sin, guilt, horrour; but if thou lovest thy self
<hi>(saith the Devil)</hi> keep thy own counsel, trust not God,
nor man. But if the Preacher doth force him to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and he can hold no longer, then he makes forth
but fair and softly. First, he makes many offers, goes,
and comes, and something he would say, but is loath, he
begins afar off, and then stops, begins again, and then
stops again, takes another day, and then comes again with
a purpose of uttering all; and when he comes to his friend,
either all is quiet for the present, and the pang over, or
else if he hangs still on the rack, then he drops out some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
but reserves the worst, and so is little the better,
because he comes not to the bottome quickly; or if he
speaks out all, yet there is another rub in the way; how
can I tell whether this parties testimony be true or no, his
judgement and affection being right? He shews me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
but knows he or I whether those promises do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to me? He speaks of a Christ, but what is that to
me, if he be none of mine? He talks of believing, seeing
is believing: It is a senseless thing to trust to anothers
goodness when I have nothing of mine own; to believe
mercy wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n I feel wrath, shall I not believe mine own
eyes? And thus after a world of Sermons, Sacraments,
Conferences, the poor soul hovers, and findes no rest or
satisfaction till God be pleased to work him to these things,</p>
                  <p>1. To a resolution of imparting himself to some
godly friend, and of speaking his whole heart to some one
or other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="528" facs="tcp:62956:277"/>
2. Of resting in Gods bare word, without the assurance
of sense.</p>
                  <p>3. Of accepting of Jesus Christ without any Ifs, and
Ands, notwithstanding his own unworthiness.</p>
                  <p>4. Of waiting upon God, and hearkning when he will
speak peace; and when he is brought thus far that he will
be beholden to a Commuinon of Saints, and will take
Gods word without any farther surety, and owe all to
Christ, though he can contribute nothing, and in despight
of all suggestions and discouragements will stick to the
peace of Christ, and look for all his peace in that way,
saying, <hi>Though he kill me yet will I trust in him,</hi> I
will wait, and hearken to him; when <hi>(I say)</hi> he is thus far
proceeded, Satan may now go shake his ears, and receive
his answer, Its <hi>God that justifies, who shall condemn?</hi>
Oh! Hell, where is thy power? Oh! Death, Oh! Devil,
what is thy Commission? Its not my meaning to prescribe
to God any one way of working; but this is the way he
often takes with his children, and this we may finde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified
in this foregoing <hi>Narrative</hi> touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and procedure of this Saint, so far as she hath
commented upon her own life. Now for her death, I will
tell thee wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t my observations were thereabout.</p>
                  <p>1. I finde that God began with her quickly, and called
her hence before she was aged, and that is mostly his method
where an early harvest is intended, a timely seeds-time
is promised; they live quickly, and live apace who ripen
betimes; so was it with her who was seldome out of action
after her entrance, but gained as much time in so little a
time as any I knew.</p>
                  <p>2. I observe that death came not all at once upon her,<note place="margin">She dyed daily.</note>
she was yearly dying some years before she dyed her last,
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:62956:277"/>
and thus death was made familiar to her: I have sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
known any of her age that was less amazed at the
speech and thoughts of death; so good a thing it is to know
experimentally what it is to dye beforehand.</p>
                  <p>3. Observe how Gods power triumphs in weakest
vessels: It is a thing I have often thought on, that godly
women for the most part dye more confidently and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
than do good men, the Lord trampling upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
in them, and in her very eminently.</p>
                  <p>4. Her patience was remarkable in the midst of sore
pains which frequented her in the beeding and bearing of
children,<note place="margin">He Patience</note> yet then her speech was, <hi>I fear not pains, I fear
my self, lest through impatiency I should let fall any
unfitting word:</hi> It is a blessed frame when pain seems
light, and sin heavy.</p>
                  <p>5. I plainly saw in her the power of Grace beyond
nature; 1. When life and death were both laid before
her, her speech was this, <hi>I am at my Fathers disposal,
howbeit of my self I rather incline to death, than life.</hi>
2. Whereas her affections were very strong both to her
loving Husband and children, insomuch as it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that the last farewell would go very near her
when she should part with so precious and dear Friends,
she was so much taken up with the thoughts of Christ, that
she seemed not to stick at any such relations. Nay thirdly,
she seemed wholly to forget her natural self, for being
intreated to favour her body and speech in regard of the
lowness of her spirits, after some pause she brake forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these words: <hi>Shall I for this poor carkass be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my souls comfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, and my Saviours praises?
Let me have your prayers still, and God his praises;
yea, pray not onely for, but with me.</hi> Which being
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:62956:278"/>
done, she overflowed with comfort, and in that condition
I left her, and that stream of comfort led her, not long
after, to the Fountain where are Rivers <hi>of joy for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus lived she a most profitable life: Thus dyed she a
most fruitfull death. God so turned this his servant,
that living, dying, and after death she should be fruitfull.
Thus will God honour those that honour him. To him be
all honour to Eternity. Amen.</p>
                  <p>Now it may be usefull to make mention of her last
sickness, especially eight weeks before her death.</p>
                  <p>All her discourses were savoury,<note place="margin">Her holy speeches.</note> tending to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Many good Christians came to visit her, who
all (if it were not their own fault) might reap some
spiritual benefit from those many excellent speeches
which proceeded out of her mouth. And the counsels
she gave to her Relations, and other friends, were
tempered with gravity, and affection. She accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
not her self to affectation of high-flown <hi>phrases,</hi>
but <hi>held fast the form of sound words.</hi> She was an old
Disciple, and her grave and sober language accordingly
discovered her so to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the very first of her last sickness, her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
was that she should dye shortly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her sickness.</note> 
                     <hi>and her long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desire was to be dissolved, and to be with Christ.
She often repeated those words of</hi> Job, There the
weary go to rest; <hi>and those words in the close of the</hi>
Revelations, Come Lord Jesus, come quickly; <hi>upon the
approach of her death (whereof she was very sensible)
she asked her Husband, what Promises of assurance
were a firm ground for her to bottome upon? He na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
Joh. 10. 28. And I give unto them eternal life,
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:62956:278"/>
and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
them out of my hand. <hi>Likewise he added</hi> Rom. 8. 33. 34.
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?
It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth? It
is Christ that dyed, yea rather, that is risen again, who is
ever at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession
for us. <hi>He added vers.</hi> 38, 39. For I am perswaded that
neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels nor Principalities,
nor Powers, nor things present, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ings to come; nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to
separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord. <hi>These (said she) are sweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That morning she dyed,<note place="margin">Her joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable.</note> she desired her Husband
to read the 17 Chapter of <hi>John</hi> (which Chapter that
eminent holy Scotchman, Mr. <hi>Rollock,</hi> caused to be
read to him when he was dying) after that was read,
she was ravished with great joy, and expressed her
self accordingly. Her Husband, and two other Friends
prayed with her. After the last Prayer was ended,
she said, <hi>My flesh, and my heart faileth:</hi> Her Husband
answered her, <hi>That God was the strength of her heart,
and her portion for ever:</hi> He would never fail her.
She returned an answer (which were the last words
which ever she spoke to him) <hi>He will never fail me.</hi>
About an hour after she resigned up her spirit unto
God who gave it;<note place="margin">Her Death.</note> and her last words were, <hi>I have
finished my course.</hi> She slept in Jesus <hi>December</hi> the 8,
<hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1654. To her <hi>to live was Christ, and to
dye was gain.</hi> She lived much desired, and dyed much
lamented. Her name is like precious Oyntment powr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth. She lived holily, and dyed comfortably, and
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:62956:279"/>
now partakes of those joyes which <hi>eye hath not seen,
nor ear heard, neither can enter into the heart of man to
conceive,</hi> even those things which God hath <hi>prepared
for them that love him.</hi>

                     <head>On the truly Vertuous and Religious Mrs. Elizabeth
Wilkinson. To her Husband.</head>
                     <l>Say, shall I speak or hold my peace?</l>
                     <l>That seems more due; but this more ease,</l>
                     <l>Where, what to speak, is hard to say;</l>
                     <l>For should I utter all I may,</l>
                     <l>'Twere endless: And to praise a Friend</l>
                     <l>By halves, is but to discommend.</l>
                     <l>And would I speak, To whom? and what?</l>
                     <l>To those that knew? or knew her not?</l>
                     <l>Who knew her need it not: for they</l>
                     <l>Know more than I am like to say:</l>
                     <l>Who knew her not, may think that she</l>
                     <l>Deserv'd but what they hear from me:</l>
                     <l>And so instead of setting forth</l>
                     <l>Her praise, I should but wrong her worth.</l>
                     <l>He that adores with silent view,</l>
                     <l>Doth not detract from what is due:</l>
                     <l>But all that while his silence sayes,</l>
                     <l>He knows not how enough to praise.</l>
                     <l>So, might I choose, I would adore</l>
                     <l>Her speaking worth, and say no more.</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="534" facs="tcp:62956:280"/>
But since I must (for so you say)</l>
                     <l>Not hold my peace, I must obey:</l>
                     <l>Yet 'tis, I say, too hard a task,</l>
                     <l>To answer fully what you ask:</l>
                     <l>To know, what first I should commend,</l>
                     <l>And harder, where to make an end.</l>
                     <l>Should I begin, where first appear</l>
                     <l>Her worths, I must begin with Her.</l>
                     <l>(Higher than so, I need not go,</l>
                     <l>Tho, whence she came, be worthy too.)</l>
                     <l>From first, her own deserving merit</l>
                     <l>Claims more than others do inherit:</l>
                     <l>Nor is it easie to express,</l>
                     <l>What age of hers was spent amiss.</l>
                     <l>Her temper meek; Her carriage such:</l>
                     <l>Her language good, and not too much:</l>
                     <l>Her habit comely, more than brave,</l>
                     <l>Her conversation humbly grave.</l>
                     <l>What vertues deck't a single life,</l>
                     <l>Were doubled, when she was a wife.</l>
                     <l>How good a wife, I need not tell</l>
                     <l>To him who knew her worth so well;</l>
                     <l>Nor, what was her Maternal care,</l>
                     <l>To whom her children were so dear.</l>
                     <l>Nor was her good confin'd to home,</l>
                     <l>But challenged a larger room;</l>
                     <l>To heal the sick, the hungry feed,</l>
                     <l>And succour those that stood in need;</l>
                     <l>Good both to soul and body too,</l>
                     <l>Of those with whom she had to do;</l>
                     <l>To rich, to poor, to great, and small,</l>
                     <l>But in her Closet best of all</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="535" facs="tcp:62956:280"/>
(Which was her Christian daily walk)</l>
                     <l>In doing that which others talk:</l>
                     <l>Forward to good without constraint,</l>
                     <l>And as she liv'd, she dy'd a Saint.</l>
                     <l>But this to speak at large would crave</l>
                     <l>A Volume, not an <hi>Epitaph.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>And were it done, I might offend</l>
                     <l>By shaming many left behinde,</l>
                     <l>(Tho more there may be found, I fear,</l>
                     <l>That will commend, than follow her.)</l>
                     <l>Some minde good words, more than good lives,</l>
                     <l>Some are good women, not good wives;</l>
                     <l>Some, neither this, nor that; and some</l>
                     <l>Abroad are better than at home;</l>
                     <l>Some hope to dye like Saints, although,</l>
                     <l>'Tis too too plain, they live not so.</l>
                     <l>'Tis rare in all respects to see</l>
                     <l>A Wife, a Woman like to thee;</l>
                     <l>At home, abroad, in life, in death,</l>
                     <l>Like unto our <hi>ELIZABETH.</hi>
