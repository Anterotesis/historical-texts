            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LOving Brother I have ſent you what I now recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from <hi>Tredath</hi> from a worthy Miniſter, Deane
<hi>Barnard,</hi> and need to doubt of the truth of it, and
indeed you need truth to be ſent to you, for ſuch a
multitude of lying Pamphlets you have daily Printed
of our proceedings in <hi>Ireland</hi> as it is a ſhame to ſee,
and much ſpoken againſt ſuch vile untruths; which is
to be wondred at that are untrue, in neither place nor
time, nor men. Our <hi>Dublin</hi> Army is ſtill abroad, but
we heare well of them.</p>

               <head>An Abſtract of ſuch Newes as hath falen out from Feb. 26
to March the 5, being the day the ſiege ended.</head>
               <p>NO ſooner were the veſſels that came from <hi>Dublin</hi>
to relieve us unlanded, but a faire North-weſt
wind ſerved them for their returne, where Feb. 26 as
they paſſed over our Barre in the ſight, but beyond the
reach of our envious enemie, our Governour the ſame
after-noone iſſued out with 220 foot and a 120 horſe,
and having pilaged a certaine village of the Rebels cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Beauly,</hi> about a mile of us, and burnt up their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings,
he proceeded farther to <hi>Smithſtowne,</hi> where being
informed by his Scouts, of 5 Companies there ready
to receive him, he had the more mind to them and his
men by their former good ſucceſſe, needing little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,
hee drew up to them, who no ſooner felt the
ſmart of our ſhot, but they inſtantly broke, and by the
proſecution of our horſe every man caſt away their
Armes to ſave their lives, nay, their very cloaths for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48586:2"/>
their greater ſpeed of flight, ſo there were ſlaine about
300 of them, 2 Colours taken, &amp; about a 100 Cowes
brought in, ſo many were ſlaine in the river of <hi>Iellingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towne</hi>
that the water was dyed with their blood, wherin
a part of Divine juſtice was obſerved, that this ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhould be in the ſame place they had formerly ſo
fraudulently defeated ſome of ours, in which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and even repaired, and wherein ſome of the ſame
Captaines of ours that were formerly rooted had their
hands in this revenge in <hi>Epſhall,</hi> Sir <hi>Patrick Weiſmes.</hi>
Here Colonell <hi>Preſton</hi> was hard put to it, who for haſt
loſt his rich military Belt and a Portmantle of his beſt
cloaths left behind, which fell out to be the booty of
<hi>Horsbey,</hi> in the pocket of whoſe breaches were found
3 Letters of more worth then his head, wherby 2 Lords
with others not farre from us, were by theſe found as
deep in his rebellion as himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The next morning it was thought good to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
this unexpected victory as probability of raiſing
the ſiege on that ſide, before theſe could gather any head
againe, and ſo very early by the breake of day 600 foot
and a Troope of horſe, after we had by prayers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them to Gods protection, which in the greateſt
expedition was ſildome omited, marched out under
my Lord <hi>Moores</hi> command, but the firſt Caſtle viz.
<hi>Stranine,</hi> which beyond their former reſolution, they
thought to viſit, but in the way within halfe a mile of
us, was ſo entrenched and fortified, that it proved
more difficult then was expected, yet our men drew up
and beſtowed about 1000 ſhots on them, to the death
of many of them, but by the fall of a mighty raine
whereby their matches were neare waſted out, they
were compel'd to returne; yet ſome were ſent to the
next village called <hi>Colpe,</hi> pilaged the Corne remaining,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48586:3"/>
&amp; burnt their Cabbins, and ſo came well in by Church
time, to give God thanks for his great preſervation,
that in all that eminent dangers, we had not a man loſt,
and indeed, all this our ſiege not above 12 men have
we loſt by the enemy, the reſt that dyed were by famin
and other diſeaſes, beſides ſome unarmed men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and children, that going out to pilage were killed
by the enemy baſely; but this foren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>med Caſtle, was
for prevention of our taking of it, maned by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
with 400 men more then what was yet, hearing
of our reſolution and preparation againſt it, they
abandoned it of themſelves, and left it to our poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>After one days reſt, March the firſt, my Lord <hi>Moore</hi>
and the Governour went out againe the ſame way, a
convenient number of horſe and foot; when after
ſecuring of at leaſt 200 worth of Corne, and the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of what had remained of the former dayes worke
at <hi>Colpe,</hi> theſe advanced further, their firſt reſiſtants
was 2 Companies of the Rebels, who abode ſomething
without ſhot, but came in and ſhot, and then betooke
themſelves to flight, and one Captaine and 60 others
were ſlaine, and another Captaine <hi>Neal O Neale</hi> taken
priſoner, and the Caſtle of <hi>Colpei</hi> after much hazard
of ſuch as firſt entred it by the pikes and ſtones by
them within, whereby our men were 3 or 4 times bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
backe downe the narrow ſtaires, yet at laſt were all
ſlaine, and all that day without the loſſe of one of
ours, there was a Captain taken priſoner, with whom
were found many Letters, and a Petition ſubſcribed to
Sir <hi>Phil. O Neal,</hi> with the Title of Earle of <hi>Tirons,</hi> and
Generall of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but yet the foundation upon
which all theſe ayrie honours were built, was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of taking this our City, but that day his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48586:3"/>
was much humbled, who unknowne to us was
ſtolne over the river, and by our unexpected approach
being in feare of taking, crept into a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur-buſh, and ſo
lay like a trembling Hare in his forme till the evening
not farre from us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> the 3. ſome other ſorces marched out in the
morning, as far as <hi>Marlingſtowne,</hi> about three miles
from us, whereby the former fights, they found the
Towne abandoned, ſo that their whole worke that day
was to reape what was left, for which all Soldiers were
that day permitted to goe out for Pilage; by which
meanes the Spring ſeemed to be Harveſt, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Aequinoctiall to have beene miſtaken for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Autumnall, ſuch a world of Corne like mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Haggards came into our City, the greateſt ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we had was of Mault, for which we had for ſeaven
dayes before drunke water, but now ſuch was Gods
goodneſſe, that on a ſudden, from the extremity of
want was turned to as plenty; ſuch a plenty, not to be
thought, which cauſed our Enemies to begin to be ſo
ſicke, that they for envie left their houſes in the midſt
of this our joy, but we had like to have had a rule by a
Gabard of Powder, that run a ground on the river, but
by our mens watching till ten a clocke at night, that
was prevented in the evening tyde.</p>
               <p>But <hi>March</hi> the 5. was a Memorable day with us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
when 400. Foot and 80. Horſe marched out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the command of the Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> on the the north
ſide among his owne tenants to <hi>Talloglland,</hi> where Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
<hi>Mac Byan,</hi> with his companies have beene billet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and were unknowne to us, the night before upon
ſome miſchiefvous counſell, the whole fraturnity of
the Rebels had cropt Sir <hi>Phi. O Neale</hi> being Preſident,
there appeared 80. Coullers, and in view 3. for one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48586:4"/>
of ours they had entrenched and fortyfied in a place of
the Towne, but our men declined them not, but with
as much alacrity as there commands could wiſh, drew
up boldly and gave fire ſo thicke and ſure, that after
the Rebels had replyed to three or foure files of ſhot,
and finding ſo many droopping among them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
themſelves to their faſt refuge their heeles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
300. of the common ſouldiers, and not leſſe then
30. Officers ſlaine in the place, and a great man made
by themſelves, Baron of <hi>Monghun, Art Rore Mac
Maughan</hi> by name, whoſe head is voted in the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
Printed in <hi>Dublin</hi> and is taken priſoner; who
being wounded to ſhew his invitable end, politickly
ſtripped himſelfe ſtarkenaked, and lay as dead among
the ſlaine; but by the viewing of the body by Captain
<hi>Berone,</hi> and tumbling the body about was diſcovered,
and promiſed upon his faith given, that he would
cauſe the redemption of my Lady <hi>Blainy</hi> and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and we thinke is accordingly done. Which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
exchange, we daily ſeeke for a 115. Muſkquets
were taken by us, and all the ground was covered with
their Pikes, chaſte away in their flight, in the meane
time our Governour Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> iſſued out towards
<hi>Beauly,</hi> to provoake Sir <hi>Phi. O Neale,</hi> whom we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
had kept that lodging ſtill, burnt <hi>New-Towne</hi>
under his noſe, drew two companies to fight in the
Caſtle, and returning, intending the aſſiſtance to the
Lord <hi>Moore</hi> if there were need, but by firing all the
Townes thereabouts, they ſoone perceived a victorie
on the Lord <hi>Moores</hi> ſide, in this the Lord <hi>Moore</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
himſelfe moſt valiently, beyond all expreſſion,
and to ſo great a hazard of his perſon, more then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Friends: had his Boot cut through his ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a Sword, and another hurt his Horſe with a

Pike, in the midſt of all the danger of ſhot on every
ſide, it came off without other harme; and which hath
beene Gods wonderful preſervation, nay all this hoſts
flight and proſecution for two miles about, not one
man of ours ſo much as hurt, Sir <hi>Phi. O Neale,</hi> with
the reſt of there great commanders, having thus payed
their way, fled very meanly attended, leaving ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gentlemen behind to their miſerable condition,
which they did deſervedly approve, and all their army
hopes ſpoyled which they by him perſwaded to, in this
houre lighted my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> who was the firſt that
gave us aſſiſtance at firſt, ſo he was the laſt that chaſed
them away in their troopes, diſperſing the firſt of
which he gave to appeare that evening, when ſome of
the Engliſh eſcaping from them, brought newes, that
the two Caſtles <hi>Beauly</hi> and <hi>Strainus,</hi> being wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
by them, into which our Governour preſently
ſent ſome Companies who entred peaceably, and with
ſome horſe, roved the Country toward <hi>Termonſecking,</hi>
but found not a man of them, onely a world of Corne,
which the Enemy could not fire for feare, ſo that now
our gates are now opening, and City ſilling with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
and other boote, all the Country a far off deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to be admitted to our Market, all hearts rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
every ſtreet ringing with praiſes to God, the
Donor to whom onely it doth belong, and that not
onely patiently, but publickly and ſolemnely, we faile
not thankefully to acknowledge.</p>
               <p>LOving Brother, my laſt to you was by a Friend
Doctor <hi>Iones,</hi> in which I declared to you what
befell us ſince my laſt Letter by the Poſt; which was,
that out of <hi>Munſter</hi> we had newes, that the Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
joyning with ſome 150. Engliſh for us, arrived
there lately, and that they had battell with the Enemy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48586:5"/>

kild 1000. &amp; put the reſt to flight, the Lord <hi>Mongarret</hi> hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſcaping. We had newes that <hi>Galway</hi> is out, but there is a
fort by us commanded, which ſtands greatly to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Town; ſome hot blowes have beene betweene the
Towne and Fort, but with much damage to the Towne, on
the 7 of this moneth went out ſome of our Army, about

the enemy was reported to have beene, but the enemy ſtill
run away before them, what their intent is for it is not
knowne, but our Army is ſtill out, and yeſterday they ſent
in one Lieut. Colonell <hi>Read</hi> that they tooke of the enemy,
and Captaine <hi>Burfoot</hi> we had yeſterday captives, ſome three
come from <hi>Tredath</hi> who confirme the newes which we heard
before, that they had given the enemy a great defeat, kill'd
about 300 and 40 Officers of the enemy, the reſt fled being
a great number, curs but 700, they no leſſe then 3000,

comfort of the diſtreſſed Souldiers: the enemy is very dog-hearted,
every day more then other, or appeare ſo to be,
and many are reported to deſire to come in, now they have
done what miſchiefe they can already: we have newes here,
that many under write to give ſo much money with you to
the warre, and to receive it in land, at a rate ſet down, which
if it be true, as it is in Print, none can lay out money at bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
rate, it wil be to great and ſhortly, and the land is as good
as in <hi>England,</hi> and the ſeats as excellent, if you have a 100
or 200 of pounds, to under writ in this cauſe, and that you
can be ſure of land, as it is here declared, it would be much
profit; the Iriſh are mad to ſee their lands ſo proffered.
There is newes come in this morning to us from our Army,
that the Lords of the Pale ſome of them offer themſelves to
come in now.</p>
