            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

protest, that in writing of these twoo imperfect
Poemes, I have ouergonne my selfe, in respect of what I wish to be
perfourmed: but for that diuers of my friendes haue slak't that

the view of your Heroicke censures.</p>
            <p>Base necessitie, which schollers hate as ignorance, hath beene
Englanddes shame, and made many liue in bastardy a long time:
Now is the sap of sweete science budding, and the true honor of
<hi>Cynthia</hi> vnder our climate girt in a robe of bright tralucent
lawne: Deckt gloriously with bayes, and vnder her faire raigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
honoured with euerlasting renowne, fame and Maiesty.</p>
            <p>O what is Honor without the complementes of Fame? or the
liuing sparkes in any heroicke gentleman? not sowzed by the ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine
Goate-bleeding impression of some Artist.</p>
            <p>Well could <hi>Homer</hi> paint on <hi>Vlysses</hi> shield, for that <hi>Vlysses</hi>
fauour made <hi>Homer</hi> paint.</p>
            <p>Thrise happy <hi>Amintas</hi> that bode his penne to steepe in the
muses golden type of all bounty: whose golden penne bode all
knightes stoope, to thy O thrice honoured and honorable vertues.</p>
            <p>The teares of the muses haue bene teared from <hi>Helicon.</hi> Most
haue endeuoured to appease <hi>Iupiter,</hi> some to applause <hi>Mercury,</hi>

plausiue, all plyant; but few knowne to distill <hi>Ambrosia</hi>
from heauen to feast men that are mortall on earth.</p>
            <p>How many when they tosse their pens to eternize some of their
fauourites, that although it be neuer so exquisite for the Poeme, or
excellent for memoriall: that either begin or end not with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of blacke and ougly night, as who would say, my thoughts
are obscur'd and my soule darkened with the terrour of obliuion.</p>
            <p>For me this restes, to wish that such were eyther dum &amp; could
not speake, or deafe and could not heare, so not to tune their stately
verse to enchant others, or ope their eares to the hurt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.</p>
            <p>But why temporize I thus, on the intemperature of this our
clymate? wherein liue to themselues, Schollers and Emperours;
esteeming bountie as an ornament to dazell the eie, and telling to
themselues wonders of themselues, wherein they quench honor
with fames winges, and burne maiestie with the title of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and some there are (I know) that hold fortune at hazard, &amp;
trip it of in buskin, till I feare me they will haue nothe but skin.</p>
            <p>Silly one, how thou tatlest of others want? is it not an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

themselues? beleue me courteous gentlemen, I walke not in clouds,
nor can I shro'dly morralize on any, as to describe a banquet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am hungry, or to shew how coldly schollers are recompenst,
because I am poore, onely I am vrg'd as it were to paraphrase on
