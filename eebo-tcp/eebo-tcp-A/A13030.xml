            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BECAVSE, bothe by the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall reporte of all men, I heare, and also by myne owne experience I perfectly know (right honourable and my very good lorde) how hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and cherefully diuers workes presented to your lordship, haue ben accepted: I (though of al others most simple) was thereby encouraged, to offer to your honour this my simple worke, in token of my bounden duty. The exaumple also of that famous
<pb facs="tcp:18436:10"/>
Monarche Artaxerxes, who so wel accepted the simple handfull of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the poore Persian Sinetas brought him from the riuer Cyrus, putteth me in good hope, that youre honour who geue place to no man in humanitie and curtesie wil not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like this simple signifieng of my good wylle. For, like as the mite of that poore widowe that is mencioned in the Gospell, whiche she gaue in all her penurie, is accompted a greater gifte, then those huge sommes that great men layde out of their greate stoare: so ought this my simple pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet be adiudged to procede, though not from greater, yet from as great good will, as the best and learnedst writers beare to your honour. For, they, of their abundant stoare, haue laied oute somewhat: But I, of my

meane knowledge, haue presented these few first frutes to your honor: knowing that your wisedome can in this small present right well see my good wyll. My gifte is a short briefe or summarie of the chiefest chances and accidentes, that haue happened in this Realme, frome the tyme of Brutus, to this our age. VVhiche I haue done by the conference of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny authors, both old and new, those Imeane, that commonly are called Chroniclers, out of whom I haue ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thered many notable thinges, moste worthy of remembrance, whiche no man heretofore hath noted. whiche worke also I was the bolder to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to your honour, because I know your lordships good inclination to al sortes of good knowledges: and espe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially the great loue that you beare
<pb facs="tcp:18436:11"/>
to the olde Recordes of dedes doone by famous and noble worthies whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che my boldnes, like as I truste your honour wil not only pardon, but also accept in good part: so I besech al the readers hereof, that folowyng your honourable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, they will iudge the best of this my trauaile, whiche I toke in hand, onely for the respect that I had to their profite. VVherby they shall both shew the goodnes of their owne natures, and also encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me willingly to go forwarde in this my enterprise. VVhich doubting not, but that I shall the rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of them, because of your lorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships fauourable acceptance hereof, I wil now cesse any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to trouble your honor, beseching almightie god long to preserue you to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this our natiue countreie.</p>

            <p>DIuers wryters of Hystories write dyuersly. Some penne their hystories plentifully at large. Some contrary wyse, briefly and shortly doo but (as it were) touche by the way, the remembraunce and accidents of those tymes, of which they write. Some do with a large com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>passe discouer as wel the affaires done in foreyn partes, as those that hapned in that countrey, of whiche especially they wryte. And some content to let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone other matters, put in memory on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such thyngs, as they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues haue had experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of, in their own cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis. Amongs whom, good Reader, I craue to haue place, and desyre roome in the lower part of this table. For I vse thee in this my booke as some symple fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that beynge not able of his owne coste to feast his guestes sufficientely, is fayne to bee frended of his neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures,
<pb facs="tcp:18436:12"/>
and to sette before them suche dishes as he hath gotten of others. For I acknowledge, that many of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, that thou shalte reade here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged, are taken, partely out of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Fabian, sometyme Alderman of London, Edwarde Halle gentylman of Greyes Inne, Iohn Hardynge, a great trauailer bothe in foreyne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis, and also in all writynges of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherfore, if thou fynde that in it, I beseche thee, wynke at small faultes, or at the least, let the consyderation of my well meanynge, drowne them.

The Ocean sea doothe bounde Englande, the fyrst part of Britain east and South, Wales, and Cornewall west. The ryuer of Twede deuideth England and Scotland north. The length of the Island begynneth at Portsmouth in the South part, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth at Twede in the north, conteinyng 320. myles. This Realme aboue other is moste fruitfull on this syde Humbre: for beyonde, it is fuller of mountaynes. And althoughe to the beholders of that countrey a far of, it may seme playn, yet it is full of many hylles, and those for

the moste part voyde of trees: the valeys wherof be very delectable, inhabited for the most part by noble men, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to auncient and olde ordre, desyre not to dwell in Cities, but neere vnto valleys and ryuers in seueral vyllages: for aduoidyng of vehement wyndes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Ilande naturally is stormye.

England is fruitefull of beastes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth with cattell: wherby thinha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes be rather for the most Grasiers, then ploughme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> because they geue them selues more to fedyng, then to tyllage.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18436:16"/>
So that almoste the thyrde parte of the countrey is imployed to cattell, dere red and fallow, gores (wherof there be store in the northe partes, &amp; conyes, for euery where there is ioly maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of those kyndes of beastes: because it is fulle of greate woddes, wherof there ryseth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styme of huntyng greatly exercised, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the nobilitie and gentlemen.</p>
            <p>Of Scotland, an other parte of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn, I purpose to say nothyng because I haue promised onely and briefly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre thaffaires of myne owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as beste trauailed and acquainted with the knowledge of the same.</p>
            <p>Wales, the .iiii. part of Britayne lyeth vpon the lefte hand: whiche like a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montarie or forelande, or an Isle (as it were) on euery syde it is compassed with the mayne sea: excepte it be on the easte parte with the Ryuer of Sabrine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Seuerne, whiche deuideth Wales from England. Although some late writers affirme Hereforde to bee a bound betwene Wales and England, &amp; say, that Wales begynneth at Chep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolle, where the Ryuer Ueye augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wyth an other ryuer called Lugge, passyng by Hereforde dooth runne into
<pb facs="tcp:18436:17"/>
the sea: which riuer riseth in the myddle of Wales out of that hill (but vncertain whether oute of that sprynge) that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brine dothe,<note place="margin">Cornelius Tacitus.</note> whiche Corn. Tacitus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Antona.</hi> For euen to that place there goth a great arme of the sea,<note place="margin">This arme of the sea, as I Iudge, is nowe called Anste, where is a passage betwene the village of Anste and Chepstoll.</note> which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng through the land westward: on the right hande leaueth Cornewall, and on the left, Wales. Whiche Topography or description, although it be newe, yet I thoughte good to folowe. Therefore Wales is extended frome the towne of Chepstol, where it beginneth almost by a straight line a lytle aboue Shrowsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Westchester northward. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that part, so many of the Britains as remayned alyue after the slaughter and losse of their countrey, at the length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng dryuen to theyr shyftes, dyd repaire as ancient writings report: where part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through refuge of the mountaines, &amp; partly of the woddes and marshes, they remained in safetie: which part they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy euen to this daye. That lande after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the englyshe men dyd call Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: and the Britaius the inhabitauntes of the same, Walshmen: for amonges the Germaynes, <hi>Walsman,</hi> signifieth a stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, an alien, an outborn or strange

man: that is, suche a one, as hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye language from theirs, for <hi>Wall,</hi> in their tongue is called a stranger born as an Italian or Frencheman: whyche differ in speeche from the Germane.</p>
            <p>Man, signifieth <hi>Homo,</hi> which is a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in english. Therfore englishmen, a people of Germany, after they had wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain called the Britains, which escaped after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their cuntrey, after their countrey maner. <hi>walshmen,</hi> because they had an other tong or spech, besides theirs, &amp; the land which they inhabited, <hi>Wales,</hi> which name afterwardes both to the people and contrey dyd remayn. By this meanes the Britaynes with theyr kyngedome loste their name. But they whiche affirme that name to be deriued of their kyng or queene without doubte be deceiued. The countrey soyle towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the sea coaste, and in other places in the valleys and playnes, is most fertile, which yeldeth bothe to man and beaste, great plentie of fruite and grasse: but in other places for the moste parte it is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyne and lesse fruitfull, because it lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth tyllage: for whiche cause husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do lyue hardly, eating Oten cakes and drinkyng milke myxte with water,
<pb facs="tcp:18436:18"/>
and sowre whay. There be many tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and strong castels, and .iiii. Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rikes, if the byshoprike of Hereforde be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in England, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> late writers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. The fyrst byshoprike is <hi>Meneue,</hi> so called of <hi>Meneua,</hi> whiche at this day they call <hi>Sainct Dauids,</hi> a Citie very auncient, situated vpon the sea coast, and bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth westward toward Ireland. An other is <hi>Landaeffe,</hi> the thirde <hi>Bangor,</hi> and the fourthe All <hi>Saint Asaph.</hi> whiche, be vnder Tharchbyshoppe of Canterburye. The walshmen haue a language from then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen, which as they say, that fetche their Petigree frome the Troianes, do the partly sounde of the Troian anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and partly of the Greeke. But how soever it is, the walshemen do not pronounce their speache so pleasantely and gentilly as thenglyshmen dooe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they speake more in the throte: &amp; contrary wise thenglishemen rightly fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowynge the Latines, do expresse theyr voyce somewhat within the lyps, which to the hearers semeth pleasant &amp; swete: And thus much of wales, the third part of Britaine.</p>
            <p>Nowe foloweth the fourthe and laste parte of Britayne, named Cornewall.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18436:18"/>
This part beginneth on that syde whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che standeth toward Spayn westward: Toward theast, it is of bredth .iiii. score and tenne myles, extendyng a lyttle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde saynt Germains, which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry famous village situated on the right hand vpon the sea coast, where the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test breadth of that countrey is but .xx. myles: for thys parcell of lande on the right hand is compassed with the coaste of the mayne sea: and on the left hande with that arme of the sea, whiche (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is declared) parteth the lande, and runneth vp to Chepstoll: where the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is in fourme of a Horne: For at the fyrst, it is narowe, and then growethe broader, a little beyonde the said towne of saint Germaine. Eastwarde it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth vpon England, West, south, and Northe, the mayne sea is rounde about it: It is a very barreyn soyle, yeldynge fruite more through trauaile of the tyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and husband men, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the goodnes of the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. but there is great plentie of leade and tyn: in the myning and dyggyng wherof doth specially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the liuynge &amp; sustentation of thinha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. In this only parte of Britayn,
<pb facs="tcp:18436:19"/>
euen to this daye continueth the nation of the Britaines, whiche in the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge brought out of Gallia occupied &amp; inhabited that Ilande, (yf credite maye be geuen to them, whyche reporte the firste inhabitantes of Britaine to come out of the Cities of Armerica.) The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; profe wherof, is because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nishmen do speake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> langage, which the Britains vse now in France, whom the Britons do cal Britona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. This thing to be more true, an old ancient chronicle dothe declare, wherin I found written, not <hi>Cornubia,</hi> but <hi>Cornugallia,</hi> compounded of <hi>Cornu,</hi> a horne, the forme wherof that countrey hath, and of <hi>Gallia,</hi> out of which contrey thinhabitantes came fyrst, the maner of which name is not to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyked. Their tongue is farre dissonant from englishe, but is muche like to the Walshe tongue, because they haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune to both tonges: yet thys difference there is betwene them, when a walsheman speaketh the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshe man rather vnderstandeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny woordes spoken by the Walshman, then the hole tale he telleth. whereby it is manyfest, that those thre people dooe vnderstande one an other in like maner
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18436:19"/>
as the Southerne Scottes doo perceiue and vnderstand the Northern. But it is a thyng very rare and meruailous, that in one Iland there should be such varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of speches. Cornewall or Cornugall is in the Diocesse of Excetour, whyche was ones woorthye to bee counted the fourth part of the Iland, as well for the contrarietie of language as for the fyrst inhabitantes thereof, as is beforesayde. Afterwardes, the Normans which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted a kyngdom of all those thre par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes reckned Cornewall to bee one of the counties or shires of the contrey. Thus muche of the particular descryption of Britayne, that the whole bodye of the realm (by the membres) may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowen to some peraduenture that neuer heard the same before.</p>
            <p>The forme of the Iland is <hi>triquetra.</hi> or thre cornered, hauyng three corners, or three sydes: Two wherof, that is to say: The corner toward theast, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther toward the weast: (bothe exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding northwardes) are the longest.</p>
            <p>The third syde whiche is the south syde is farre shorter then thother: for the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is greater of length then of bredth. And as in the other two partes is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
<pb facs="tcp:18436:20"/>
the lengthe, euen so in the laste, the breadth. In whyche place, the breadthe begynneth: and so continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng from the South parte to the north, it is but narowe. The fyrste and ryght corner of whyche Ilande eastwarde, is in Kente, at Douer and Sandwyche.</p>
            <p>From whence to Caleys or Boloygne in France, is the dystance of .xxx. my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. From this Angle which is agaynst Fraunce to the thyrde Angle, whyche is in the Northe, in Scotlande, the mayne whereof, boundeth vpon Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, but no land seene, and there the Iland is lyke vnto a wedge euen at the very angle of the land in Scotland. The length wherof is .vii. hundreth myles. Agayne, the lengthe from this Corner at Douer in Kent, to the vttermost part of Cornewall, beynge saynt Myghels mount (whych is the west part or weste angle) is supposed to bee .300. myles.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18436:20"/>
doth end, the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth is .viii. hundred mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, in whiche parte there be very good hauens, and saufe harboroughes for shyppes, and apt passage into Ireland, beyng not past one day saylyng, but the shorter passage is from Wales, to Wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terforde, a towne in Ireland vppon the sea coast, muche lyke to that passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Douer and Calaice, or som what more: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shortest passage of all, is out of Scotlande. From this last Angle to Hampton: (whiche is a towne vpon the sea coast, with a hauen so called toward the southe, and therefore called South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton) betwene the Angles of Kent and Cornewall, they doo measure by a strayght lyne the whole lengthe of the Ilande, and doo say, that it conteyneth 800. myles, as the breadth from <hi>Meneua,</hi> or Saint Dauids to Yarmouth, whiche is in the vttermost part of the Iland to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the East doth conteyn .200. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les for the breadth of the Iland is in the southe part, which part is the front and begynnyng of the Land, and endeth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or as it were in a straighte.
