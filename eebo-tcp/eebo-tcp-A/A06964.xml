            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>For the Formes or manner of Trayning; That forme is onely to be followed, which shall be soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and easiest learned, and of most vse for all kind of service whatsoever, and which I take to be this Forme following.</p>
                  <p>First you shall draw your Company into two Battalions, or square Bodies (the Pikes by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and the Shot by themselues) which Bodies shall consist of Ranks and Files, and you shall draw them forth by Files or tens, man after man, or if they be much disorderly and vncapable, then draw them forth by halfe Files or fiues, and when they are so placed, by doubling those halfe Files, you may bring them to whole Files; which done, then placing the Pikes in the midst, wing them on either hand with your Shot, wherein if you haue Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebushes (which are now out of vse with vs) you shall then giue to your Musquetiers the prioritie of place, that is, they shall make the outmost Files both of the right and the left hand.</p>
                  <p>Now for a Ranke, you shall vnderstand it is a Row of men placed Pouldron to Pouldron, or Shoulder to Shoulder, their faces being directed all one way; And a File is a Sequence of men stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one behind another, Backe to Belly, extending
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2790:10"/>
from the first to the last man; And it is taken from the French word <hi>la Fila</hi> signifying a Thridd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men stand long wise and straight like a thrid, and the Files consist of single men downeward, as the Ranks consist of single men ouerthwart.</p>
                  <p>Now these Files in some discipline are called Flankes, because they doe flanker, or wall in the <hi>Battalia,</hi> and the Rankes are called Fronts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they stand formost and doe as it were affront the Battailes, and looke vpon the Enemie, but in truth none can properly be called the Front but the Ranke which standeth formost, nor any File be called a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lanke, but those which stand outmost, yet all are Ranks, and all are Files, and therefore those two names are without contradiction. Now lastly you shall vnderstand, that a Ranke may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of as many men as you please (according to the number of your Company) But a File (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> vse it in vncertaine depth) ought neuer to be aboue ten persons deepe (except it be in marching or in most especiall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, where advantage of ground requireth the contrary) The reason thereof, being that the first man hauing done his dutie in discharging his piece, may in the space that nine other men shall do their duties, and discharge their pieces distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one after another, be againe in readines &amp; make his first place good, there to discharge his piece a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againe. Besides it is the readiest and best way for the drawing of Grosses and great numbers, into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forme that you please, because according to this discipline, euery hundred men make a full
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2790:10"/>
Square, that is to say, iustren euery way.</p>
                  <p>This done you shall deuide one hundred men into foure Corporall shipps or Squadrons, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Squadron, into as many Files as the number wil beare, and euery File into Fellowships or Camera-does, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now for the especiall duties of these two Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers (which is the <hi>Corporall,</hi> and the <hi>Lanspresadoe</hi>) you shall vnderstand that the <hi>Corporalls</hi> chiefest du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is vpon guards at night, after the Watch is set, and the Sentinells placed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Some motions there are which change place; But yet no more then a remouing from one Ranke to another, or from one File to another, when as (commonly) though some doe remoue, yet others stand still; and these kinde of Motions are dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of Rankes or Fyles, whereby the Battalia is made broader or longer, as the Enemy or the ground you haue, causeth you to make your <hi>Flankes, Fronts, Rankes,</hi> or <hi>Files</hi> greater or lesser.

And here is to be noted in this doubling of <hi>Rankes</hi> or <hi>Fyles,</hi> that <hi>Rankes</hi> when they double to the right hand, must ever turne to the left hand to come to their former places againe, and if they be doubled to the left hand, they must turne on the right hand to come to their first places againe; And <hi>Fyles</hi> when they are doubled to any hand, by the doubling of <hi>Rankes</hi> to the contrary hand, they are brought to their first places againe. And so having doubled your <hi>Rankes</hi> to any hand, by the doubling of <hi>Fyles</hi> to the contrary hand, you also bring them to their first places againe.</p>
                  <p>There is also to be taught another Motion, in which all doe moue, and yet none doe march, which is the Opening and Closing either of <hi>Rankes</hi> or <hi>Fyles,</hi> and is of vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In teaching the Souldier how to know the sounds or Beatings of the Drumme,<note n="4" place="margin">Of the sounds of the Drum.</note> you must make them obserue not onely what the Drum doth beat, as whether it be a <hi>Call,</hi> a <hi>March,</hi> a <hi>Troope,</hi> a <hi>Battalia,</hi> a <hi>Charge,</hi> a <hi>Retrait,</hi> a <hi>Batterie,</hi> a <hi>Reliefe,</hi> and so forth, but also what time he keepes, for euer according to the measure of time, the Souldier is to march slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or faster, to charge with greater violence, or to come off with greater speede, also he shall know when by the Drum to attend his Captaines direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when to repayre to his Colour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The figure 2. which leadeth the left hand Fyle is the second man. And the figure 3.

                  <p>Now to these I will adde a little touch or Essay,<note place="margin">Carriage, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and composition of Colours.</note> touching the Carriage, Election, and Composition of Captaines colours, or Ensignes, which is the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>norable Badge or Marke of every Captaine, and in which both of late here at home, and also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in forraine Nations. I haue seene as grosse absurdities, as any malice would wish to see in the folly of his Enemy, which doubtlesse must proceed from ignorance, since no Master of Reason would be guiltie of his owne iniurie.</p>
                  <p>You shall therefore vnderstand,<note place="margin">Mixture of Colours.</note> that all Colours belonging vnto private Captaines, ought to be mixt equally of two severall Colours, that is to say, (according to the rule in Herauldry) of Colour and Mettall, and not Colour on Colour, as <hi>Greene</hi> and <hi>Red,</hi> or <hi>Blew</hi> and <hi>Blacke,</hi> or such like, nor yet Mettall on Mettall, as <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Yellow,</hi> or <hi>Orreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawnie</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> for Colours so borne shew Bastar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, Pesantrie, or dishonor.

But if they belong to the <hi>Generall</hi> of the Field, then they shall be of one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Colour or Mettall, without any red Crosse at all, as was before sayd.</p>
                  <p>Thus much touching the generall Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Carriage of Colours.</p>

For mine owne part, since they apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not vnto honor, I will here omit them, and to those free spirits that haue gaind these noble pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; from these considerations leaue them to their owne Elections, and Compositions, with these few advertisements following.</p>
                  <p>First, He that in his Colours shall carry full Coate-Armour, doth indiscreetly; for he puts that honor to hazzard, which he may with more honor keepe in safetie, and inticeth his enemie by such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation to darre beyond his owne nature.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2790:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
owner, and that his life is not voyde of some noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious scandall.</p>
                  <p>If the spot be of vnequall proportion, that is, longer or broader one way then another, it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Funerall, or deadly Revenge; for such a spot is called an <hi>Hearse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that carryeth a Word in his Colours without a devise, carrieth a Soule without a Bodie.</p>
                  <p>He that carrieth a devise without a Word, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Bodie without a Soule.</p>
                  <p>He that carrieth both Word and devise, carrieth both Soule and Bodie, yet if the devise carrie any humane shape, it is a grosse Bodie, and if the Word containe aboue three or foure words at the most (except it be the latter end, or beginning of some Verse) it is an imperfect Soule: But if both Word and devise be compleate; That is, <hi>Empresa</hi> and not <hi>Embleme,</hi> yea they are much fitter for Maskes, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes, or Pageants, then the Field, or reall Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for the true mixture of Colours is devise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for every Foote Souldier.</p>
                  <p>He that carrieth more Colours then two, except it be some small dash for an especiall note, or the Ensigne of severall Kingdomes, carrieth a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and it is esteemed the Ensigne of Folly.</p>
                  <p>Now to conclude and knit vp this sleight Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, with the true Cement which bindeth all the former duties faithfully together, every Souldier must especially regard <hi>obedience,</hi> a worke which is contained in three Circumstances, and every Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance adorned with an especiall vertue. The first is Reverence from the Inferior to the Superior,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2790:24"/>
in which is expressed Loue. The second, a Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to take directions, and a willingnesse to be commanded, which is a performance of dutie: and the last, in the allowing of his Captaines Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and approving his Iudgement; which is a certaine Character of modestie, wisedome, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. For that Captaine cannot be sayd to be perfect, that wants vertue worthie of Reverence; Authoritie fit for commandment, or Experience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to direct and censure his Actions. And he that hath these, hath that Sufficiencie, that to disobay, is to die, as witnesseth all the best of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who never spared any in that capitall and grosse trespasse of absurd disobedience. And to this I must also adde, that the tyrannie of Captaines in commanding with too great rigor, is as offensiue as the former disobedience: For as <hi>Montaigne</hi> saith; <hi>The Authoritie of them which teach, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hinders those that would learne.</hi> And therefore nothing like manly Courtesie doth become a Commander.</p>

                  <p>The first is done Standing or Marching; The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in the Charge, and the last, in the face of the Enemie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:2790:34"/>Now for as much as time is precious,<note place="margin">The best way to Teach.</note> this labour tedious, and men vnwilling to take long paines, it shall not be amisse (for the speedier perfecting of the men) first to labour the Leaders of the Fyles (which should be the most sufficient men of the Troope) in all these Lessons before shewed, and then to make every Leader to instruct the Fyle he leadeth, which will not onely make the Teachers striue to be excellent for their owne glory sake, but also stirre in the other (which are taught) a braue ambition to equall or exceede those that informe them.</p>
                  <p>After they can thus Manage their Horses, and handle their Armes in a decent manner;<note n="3" place="margin">Distance of place.</note> you shall then come to the third Lesson, which is, <hi>Distance of place,</hi> and orderly proportion. A matter necessary and dependant vpon every Forme of Battayle, and may not be absent eyther from Ranke or Fyle.</p>
                  <p>It is then to be vnderstood, that in Horse-troopes there are but two sorts of <hi>Distances</hi> or <hi>Orders,</hi> eyther in Rankes or Fyles; That is, <hi>Close Order,</hi> and <hi>Open Order,</hi> Close order in Fyles, is Cuish to Cuish, or knee to knee, and Open order in Fyles, is six foote (which is accounted an Horse length): So Close order in Rankes, is to the Horses Crooper, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Streete, and Open order is sixe foote, aboue which the Rankes must never open. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Troop may March orderly and keepe their Distance truly,<note place="margin">Of Motion.</note> let the whole Troope in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, mooue all at one instant, that is, when the head begins, then the Reare to be ready, so shall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2790:35"/>
they seldome be found to erre disorderly. Also you must know, that when the Troope cometh to March in <hi>Battalia,</hi> that then they must March at their Close Order in Fyles, and at Open Order in Rankes. But when they come to doe the Evoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or motions in warre, then they must be at their Open-order, both in Fyles and Rankes. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance betwixt Troope and Troope ought to be twentie-fiue paces; and betweene Regiment and Regiment fiftie paces. And thus much for distance or proportion of place.</p>
