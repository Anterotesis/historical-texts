            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ithin the Principality of <hi>Viennois,</hi> whilome there lived and ruled; as <hi>Daulphin,</hi> a moſt renowned Prince, no leſſe eſteemed for his admired wiſedome, then highly honoured for his reſpected greatneſſe; But ſo abſolute was hee in opinion, ſo perverſe in diſpoſition, and ſo ſevere in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that he made his will his God, and rigour his law. This <hi>Daulphin</hi> had but one onely Daughter, whoſe exquiſite beauty was ſo beautified with rareſt vertues, that men honoured Nature as a God in her perfections and held her more then a woman in her vertues. Amongſt many Knights that then followed her Fathers Court, there was a moſt well deſerving aged Knight (who was knowne to be as ſufficient, as he was ſufficiently knowne) named Sir <hi>Ioques,</hi> who had but one onely ſonne called <hi>Paris,</hi> whoſe but budding yeares, deckt with Natures pride, and honoured with timely Knighthood, well cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged renowne for his right, <hi>Venus</hi> for his friend, and <hi>Fortune</hi> for his ſervant. But it fortuned (ſo <hi>Fortune</hi> would) that this young Knight caſting caſually his careleſſe eye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in Court, eſpyed the young Princeſſe, the faire <hi>Vienna,</hi> (for ſo after the City was ſhee called) talking with her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and endeered friend the Lady <hi>Izabella,</hi> whoſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous demeanour he ſo devoutly noted, and whoſe unparalel'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12144:6"/>
beauty hee ſo feelingly admired, that openly commending the one, he ſecretly affected the other. Many were the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted thoughts that now troubled his troubled minde, and more then many were the unquiet and univerſuall cares that now attended his new entertained deſires. Still hee gazed, and gazing ſigh't, and ſighing grieved that ſo he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, yet could hee not ceaſe to feed his hungry eye, nor durſt he once be ſeene to looke on her, one whom he could not but looke. For as commanding love did flatter his aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hope; ſo the remembrance of <hi>Phaetons</hi> fall, did diſmay him with a deadly feare. And feare hee did, leaſt that juſt diſdaine ſhould beget in her bitter revenge, and blacke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſhould bring forth untimely death.</p>
            <p>Thus in ſeeking to paſſe the meane, poore <hi>Paris</hi> dyed for being ſo meane, and in this diſconſolation, glad he was to ſmother his ſorrow to his greater griefe, not daring to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint any but <hi>La-nova</hi> his ſecond ſelfe, his companion in Armes, and the ſole ſecreter of all his ſecrets. To him, and none but him, did hee in ſorrow bewray his love, and in love bewayle his ſorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La-nova</hi> pittying his caſe, diſſwaded him from the danger of <hi>Jxions</hi> love, leaſt with more repentance hee vainely with <hi>Apollo</hi> purſued <hi>Daphne.</hi> Heavens forbid (ſaid he) my <hi>Paris</hi> eye ſhould with the Eagle ſoare againſt ſo bright a Sunne; or that your deſire ſhould with the Bee delight in ſuch flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, which being ſuckt, will yeeld more poyſon then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Ah <hi>Paris, Paris,</hi> ſeeke not to obtaine that with care, which you cannot keepe without danger. To deſire to be a King, is no Juſt title of a Kingdome; and to ſay you love her, no ſufficient deſert to winne her. Deſire not then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thy reach, leaſt thou fall in thy hope. Nay, admit that her chaſt conceites would entertaine <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> deceites, yet followes it not, that <hi>Ioves</hi> royall bird would prey on ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flies. <hi>Alexander</hi> would deale with none but Kings, nor <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> with any but Princes; lowe ſhrubs wither ever at the Cedars roote. Beware <hi>Paris,</hi> leaſt coveting with <hi>Icarus</hi> to ſoare above the Sunne, thou be puniſhed in his pride under the Sunne. Thy deſerts are I confeſſe many, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12144:6"/>
but the ſtate of her eſtate ſtands not with thy indignities; men are wey'd by the aboundance of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, not by the worthineſſe of theyr vertues. Then wade no further in this fourd, but let Armours, not Amours, be the ſubject of thy thoughts, ſince the Campe affoords ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and the Court ſuch dangers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paris</hi> thus dehorted, reſembled the Palme-tree, that the more it is preſt downe, the more it ſtriveth upwards, ſo the more his friend miſliked of that hee deſired; the more he deſired what ſo his friend miſliked. Such was the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable force of his inlimitable affection, that in ſpite of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was enforc'd to doe homage unto paſſion. For where Love is predominant, there all other affections attend on it. And therefore he concluded ſtill, and ever to love her; but ſtill, and never to let it bee knowne to her. To approve which, he requeſted <hi>La-novas</hi> company that night ſecretly to give <hi>Vienna</hi> muſicke, who ſeeing his unremoveable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, vowed himſelfe to his fortunes. The ſame night when quiet ſleepe poſſeſt each weary eye, hee and <hi>La-nova</hi> taking eyther of them a well tuned Lute, went directly under <hi>Vienna's</hi> window, where ſweetly ſtriking theyr pleaſant ſtrings, Sir <hi>Paris</hi> thus chearefully warbled out his Ladies praiſe.</p>

            <p>This ſorrowfull Song ended, the Muſicke ceaſed, and <hi>Paris</hi> returned to his Chamber. But <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively had liſtned to this carefull Ditty, knew not well by his over-paſſionate conceite, and alluding and inſinuating Song, that Love had made her a Miſtris, and Fortune had ſent her a ſervant. Yet could ſhee not imagine who hee ſhould be, but much ſhe was diſcontented that ſo it ſhould be, her Princely towring thoughts were not ſubject to Subjects fancies, nor would ſhe admit of ſervill ſervants. And therfore becauſe ſhe would puniſh their pride in their preſumption, ſhe went the next morning ſecretly to her Father, and told him how that the two paſſed nights, there had beene ſome (not knowne to her) that had beſtowed Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick on her, under her Chamber window, and how that one of them the firſt night revealed his love in her praiſe; and the ſecond night bewailed his affection in his owne griefe. And therefore ſhe humbly requeſted him, that hee would command a privie Watch to be made that following night,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12144:8"/>
that they might be diſcovered in theyr follyes, and ſhe live acquitted of ſuch vaine fancies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Daulphin</hi> diſcontent that any in his Province ſhould ſo proudly preſume to build his neſt in the Sunne, gave in ſecret charge, that ſixe of his Guard ſhould watch as that night, to apprehend and bring them before him the next day. All which was done accordingly: And Sir <hi>Paris</hi> not miſdeeming any croſſe adventure, came as hee was wont with <hi>La-nova,</hi> to offer the ſacrifice of his conſecrated Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke to his devoted Saint. But they no ſooner tuned, but they were neere over-turned. For the Watchmen fearing their eſcape, thought to make them ſure by laying them on the ground. But Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> provided alwayes for all perils, ſeeing ſuch rude entertainment, and holding them but for ſtraglers, armed his whole endeavors to returne them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne thanks for their ſo unſeaſonable curteſies, in ſomuch that with <hi>La-novas</hi> furthering ayde hee wounded moſt of them, made them all to relye more on their legges then their hands. So that being left alone, they eaſily recovered their Chamber, without being diſcovered of any, which ſo much incenſt the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> that leaving the reynes of his unlimited anger to his then enraged will, hee commanded that ſecretly twenty men well appointed, ſhould the next night lye in ambuſh to apprehend them.</p>
            <p>Now Sir <hi>Paris</hi> holding that their late diſturbance was rather caſuall, then occaſioned, went, in his unſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the next night againe. But no ſooner had they taken ſtand, but that they found themſelves entrapped in the ſnare; which they finding unreſiſtable, yeelded without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The Watch glad of their apprehenſion, held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo ſecure of them, that not regarding (the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darke) what they were, they careleſly went along to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Caſtle, untill they came by a narrow Lane, that turned into the heart of the City, whereunto Sir <hi>Paris</hi> all ſuddenly thruſting <hi>La-nova</hi> forceably, tooke by force a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd out of the next Watchmans hands, and ſtepping into the Lane, kept the entrance from them all. The Watchmen now grew more furiouſly wrathfull, then adviſedly bold,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12144:8"/>
and ſo confuſedly aſſaulted them, that Sir <hi>Paris</hi> laying the firſt three on the ground, the reſt (over-haſtily ſtill preſſing forwards) ſtumbled, and fell upon their Companions, ſo many, and ſo thicke, that themſelves bard themſelves from the entrance, which advantaged Sir <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>La-nova</hi> ſo much, that having time to turne them to the next turning, they got to their Chamber before they were deſcryed, or could be well purſued. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> underſtanding the next morning of the uprore, and of their eſcape, was much malecontented in himſelfe, the Court wondred at the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but <hi>Vienna</hi> now recounting their undaunted coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with their noble qualities, conceived them to be men of high eſteeme, and now more favourably, and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately did labour the knowledge of them, but never after durſt they preſume to venture the like adventure againe, which much grieved <hi>Vienna,</hi> and more incenſed the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> who being fruſtrated of his expectation politickly, yet plotted this deviſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he cauſed a Chriſtall Shield, and a Chaplet of gold to bee made, both, paſſing faire, and rich, then delivering them to Herald, he commanded him to take them, and to carie them throughout all the Citie, and by ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet proclaime a ſolemne Iuſts (free for all commers) to be kept 40. dayes after: And that he that ſhould winne the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the day, ſhould by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennas</hi> hand be crowned with the ſayd Chaplet as Victor, and receive the ſayd Shield as the beſt deſerving Knight. By this meane meanes, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> thought to find out the unknowne Lover. For it was an Article of his beliefe, that in honour of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he would (as a Knight) make tryall of his fortune; and as a Lover diſcloſe himſelfe, in his deviſe; where by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance (the inſtrument of knowledge) might well diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. Great preparation there was made on all ſides, and divers Knights and Barons of ſundry Provinces, came as well to ſee the admired beauty of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> as to winne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne for renowned Chivalry. Amongſt whom at laſt, though not leaſt in worth, came Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>La-nova,</hi> well mounted on white fiery Steedes, ſuteable to theyr white
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12144:9"/>
plaine Armour, without either marke, or deviſe: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither durſt vſe for feare of being diſcovered by them. But the day, and the <hi>Daulphin</hi> being come. <hi>Vienna</hi> was ſet (richly roabed in <hi>Arabian Biſſe)</hi> on a faire tapiſtred ſcaffold, the Chaplet on her head; and the Chriſtall Shield ſtanding before her at her feete; ſo that ſhe ſeemed another <hi>Pallas</hi> in a ſecond <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> ſhape. Many Knights amazedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her, moſt deſired her, all admired her Thus when each hungry eye had fed, but not fill'd his covetous ſight, the Herald ſtanding up (after the ſummoning ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet) bad every Knight doe his beſt devoyre. Then deſire of honour, armed each martiall heart with double courage and every Knights courage was redoubled with hope of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna's</hi> favour: So that the Iuſts grew great, and both nobly did each Knight, eſpecially <hi>La-nova</hi> bare him ſelfe. But Sir <hi>Paris</hi> whoſe unknowne prowis was not yet fully proved, ſeeing a <hi>Burgonian</hi> proudly brandiſhing his Launce before <hi>Vienna,</hi> for the honour which yet hee bare away from all, was ſo enraged with choller and jealouſie, that fiercely ſpurring his hote ready Horſe, he ſo forceably charged, and over-charged him in the encounter, that hee layd the <hi>Burgonians</hi> pride in the duſt; which <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> noting, noted him for the moſt redoubted, and beſt merriting Knight of them all. Still her eye followed his fortune, and ſtill his fortune was remarkable, and pleaſing to her eye. For never ceaſed he Iuſting, nor never Iuſted, but he over-turned ſome one, in which performance he was applauded of every one. Such was his heroicall fortitude, and ſuch his quicke delivery, and manly cariage of himſelfe, that in the end there was left none, whom he had not overthrown, nor any overthrowne, that would re-aſſay to overthrow the overthrower. Thus ſtood unvanquiſhed Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> like invincible <hi>Hercules</hi> expecting a charge; but in finding none he found his owne diſcharge. So that the Heralds (with Trumpets ſounding his praiſe) brought him to the ſcaffold, where the fayreſt fayre, and gracious <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> graced his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, with ſetting the Chaplet on his head, and giving him the Chriſtall Shield, ſhe bluſhing ſaid: Receive noble
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12144:9"/>
Knight thy moſt well-deſerving honour, and heavens make thee happy both in thy deſignes, and thy deſires. Sir <hi>Paris</hi> more proud of her words, then of his reward, received them at her hands, with more pleaſing content then <hi>Paphos</hi> Queene did the golden fruit, and humbling himſelfe on his knee, hee obſequiouſly reverently, yet fearefully, kiſt her hand, and layd his other on his heart, in token that he was hers in all ſervice; and ſo riſing up he made a lowe obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, and both parting, both of them looked backe at one inſtant upon each other; a true record, that their liking hearts reioyced in the ſight of either other. But Sir <hi>Paris</hi> being come to the reſt of the Knights, departed with them, and as they rid each one towards his ſeverall home, he and <hi>La-nova</hi> tooke an occaſion to light to mend their Saddles, the reſt paſſing careleſly on, which they ſeeing, tooke the next turning, and ſo were gotten away before they were miſt, and miſt before they were knowne. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> thus deceived by him he meant to deceive, was much agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; ſo were the Knights that they could not tell by whom they were vanquiſhed; &amp; ſo was <hi>Vienna,</hi> that ſhe knew not by whom ſhe was honoured. She thought and ever looked that he ſhould haue diſcovered himſelfe, that he might the better bee reſpected of her, and the world take further knowledge of him and his merit. But the clouding of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, aſſuredly aſſured her, that he, and none but he, was the man, that ſo ſweetly (under her window) ſang her praiſe; that ſo dolefully recorded the paſſion of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting love; and that ſo valiantly forc'd to flight her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Guard; His ſecret departure, argued (ſhe thought) ſo much; and his invaluable valour ſhewed no leſſe. Deſire now, of ſhe knew not what, made her love ſhe knew not whom: oft ſhe wiſht ſhe knew him; ſtill ſhe talkt of him, and ever ſhee highly commended him; but her wiſhes were but vaine thoughts, and her words but as alluring windes.</p>
            <p>During this their diſcontentments, The Duke of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doume</hi> (now called <hi>Vendoſome)</hi> being brother to the iſſuleſſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12144:10"/>
King of <hi>France,</hi> a man ſo powerfull in meanes, and ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular in State, that nothing could make him unhappy, but the exceſſe of his happineſſe: This Duke, I ſay, beeing the firſt Prince of the blood, was ſo tranſported with ſuch an aſpiring pride, and unlimitted deſire of Rule, that he could not diſgeſt a ſmall expectation. His deſire of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty caried him ſo beyond the bounds of all reſpects, that neyther Wiſedome could informe his minde, nor Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſway his actions. Nature nor Duty could preſcribe him any law, though he were a Subject, ſubject to the law. How to gaine the Crowne was all his care: His glorious conſideration thereof, made a continuall examination of all his thoughts, how he ſhould be poſſeſt thereof, Ambition (the Nurſe of diſloyall plots and practiſes) ſayd, The King muſt dye; and Reſolution (the performer of all deeds) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Hee ſhall dye. But how, or by whom, hee knew not. Young men (he ſayd) are not ripe enough for ſuch an action, and Old men are too timorous for ſo great an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. The raſhneſſe of the one, and the feare of the other, are the ruine of ſuch buſineſſe. To truſt others then, is to deceive my ſelfe; For hope of reward (for the preſervation of a King) will, I feare, betray my truſt; And then I muſt conclude, that though a deſire to ſteale, make not a Thiefe; yet my intent for treaſon, will make me a Traytor; and in the puniſhment thereof, I ſhall finde no diſtinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. What reſteth then but force and Armes? my ſword muſt plead for poſſeſſion, <hi>Rome</hi> could not reſiſt <hi>Ceſar,</hi> when he came to the gates, in the ſtrength of his forces. I will therefore firſt fortifie my ſelfe with potent friends, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the time, my intent, and take counſell of three ſorts of men: of the Lawyer, that ſpeakes not as he thinkes; of the Phyſitian, that doth not as he ſayes; and of the Divine, which oftentimes teacheth better then himſelfe leades, and alwayes better then the people follow. I know the leaſt winde of the peoples favour will fill my ſayles full; Their eyes are fixt upon my greatneſſe, and they obſerve mee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for my intereſt; The King hath no iſſue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12144:10"/>
of leſſe regard; his time is but ſhort, and Reſpect one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waytes on poſterity, that promiſeth continuance of raigne. No ſooner (ſayes ſome) is a Collaterall heire known, but the Kings Teſtament is made; why then ſhould he live to command me, that am borne to rule? He may live to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie me, where then is my Crowne? I muſt and will raigne. Vpon theſe moveable ſands (like a fooliſh Merchant, that adventures all his ſubſtance in a broken veſſell) did this fond Duke build both his reſolve, and his hope; And to give ſucceſſe to his truſt, he ſent preſently to the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>Viennois</hi> (whoſe principality was in manner equall with a Kingly Royalty) to require his daughter, the faire <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> in marriage for his ſonne. The haughty <hi>Daulphins</hi> minde, did well ſimpathize the Dukes nature; both their prides, and deſires, were reciprocall: onely the <hi>Daulphin</hi> was more reſerved, and ever better adviſed; but this motion did ſo attatch him with ioy, to thinke that his daughter ſhould in time be a Queene, that he covetouſly embrac'd the Dukes requeſt, and wiſhed that Commiſſioners on either ſide, might be nominated, and appoynted, to conferre and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thereof.</p>
            <p>This conſent of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> did ſo elevate and animate the Duke, that hee thought himſelfe already an inveſted King. The incorporating of <hi>Daulpheny</hi> to his Dukedome, would (he knew) make him undoubtedly, redoubted great; and the uniting of both their powers with their adheres, would well enable him to affront the King, who now was fitter for a Cloyſter (as hee thought) then for a Crowne. Thus we ſee, that where men hath leaſt reaſon, there they are apteſt to beleeve anything, that but flatters their deſires. Men that fall into Treachery or miſery, not knowne nor fore-ſeene, are worthy of ſome compaſſion; but they that wilfully runne into rebellion, or calamity, deſerve no pitty, but ſhame and death. In all our attempts, juſtice, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, ſhould be the plotters; and Honour, and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Actors. A violent humour overthrowes the Maſter. Kings we know are made onely by God, either in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12144:11"/>
Iuſtice to execute his wrath upon a ſinfull Nation; or in mercy, as well to preſerve and ſet foorth his worſhip and glory, as to maintaine his people in righteouſnes and peace. For neither Royall birth, ſucceſſion, election, uſurpation, conqueſt, nor right, can ſo eſtabliſh, or perpetuate a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; but that God when he pleaſeth, can, and will tranſlate it to others. But now the diſloyall and deceitfull Duke (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as farre from procraſtination, as the <hi>Daulphin</hi> was gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of diſpatch) ſent his Commiſſioners for the recapitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perfecting of ſuch Articles, as ſhould be propoſed on either ſide. In briefe, they agreed on all points, and aſſigned a day for the young Prince of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>andoume</hi> to come to the <hi>Daulphins</hi> Court. This being divulged &amp; made knowne to Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> did ſo excutiate all his thoughts, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame his perplexed heart, that hee was ready to expoſe himſelfe to all dangers and hazards. In this diſtraction, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova</hi> found him, and knowing the cauſe of his diſtemper (for Rumour had poſſeſt all men with it) hee grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, thus ſadly ſaid unto him. Let patience my <hi>Paris</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct thee out of this ſtormy Sea, into a more quiet Port, Fortune ſhould have no power over fortitude and courage. What thou never hadſt, that thou doſt not looſe. Thy ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and imparity, could never promiſe thee any hope; and thy long nouriſhed diſpaire ſhall now finde a period, that in the end, would have brought thee to thy end. Let neceſſity then make the now ſuffer conſtantly; and cuſtome will make thy ſufferance eaſie. Sir <hi>Paris</hi> who did heare, but not hearken to what his friend had ſo diſcreetly delivered, regarded him no more then a greedy Lawyer doth his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed Clyent, but ſtill deepely excogitating how hee might intercept, or pervert the intended match, at length he all ſighing ſaid: This Gordian knot muſt be cut aſunder, though I want an <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſword. Induſtry, and Policie, oft effects unlikely things; and we ſhould not judge that which is poſſible, nor that which ſeemes unpoſſible: as it is credible, or incredible to our capacities. The eternall wiſedome hath (I know) a reſerved power, and a ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12144:11"/>
to bring things to paſſe, which the wiſedome of man cannot conceive, nor ſee, till it happen, and be done. What though <hi>Vandoume</hi> be mighty? A ſmall Rocke may ruinate a great Ship. I will not ſo looſe <hi>Vienna,</hi> but where I want force to play the Lyon, there will I aſſay to gaine by fraud. <hi>La-nova</hi> he ſaid welcome, thou comeſt in a uſefull time, thou muſt ſecretly fit me with a gray beard, a payre of Beades, a Fryers Gowne, and Hood. I muſt turne Fryer, and Prophet all at once. It muſt be ſo, the plot is layd, and we muſt be Actors both in the play.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La-nova,</hi> knowing that his undaunted courage could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brooke a Corrivall, though he were never ſo great, did much feare that he intended ſome ſtratagem, and therefore he told him, that unleſſe he might know his purpoſe, he would make no ſuch proviſion. Why ſaid Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> my thoughts dwell in thy breaſt, and in thy heart, doth my love (next to <hi>Vienna)</hi> live. How then canſt thou be a ſtranger to my purpoſes, that art the Treaſurer of my ſecrets? Thou knoweſt <hi>La-nova</hi> how jealous the <hi>Daulphin</hi> is of his ſafety; His rigorous (I might ſay cruell) Nature hath taught him to feare many, whom many doth ſtill feare. Thou knoweſt alſo that Kings are ever ſuſpitious of their Succeſſours: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience makes them to feare, leaſt they ſhould looſe that, which they, and many others ſeeke, with greateſt dangers to obtaine. My project is, to make the King and the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> my inſtruments to breake the marriage; give me Pen, Inke, and Paper, and thou ſhalt ſee what a fearefull fire, I will kindle, to burne up all their matrimoniall hopes and agreements. But to give more life hereunto, thou muſt play thy part. Thy Vnkle is Steward to the Duke of <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doume,</hi> and thou thy ſelfe art gracious in his preſence. To him muſt thou poaſt, in ſhew of love to ſee him, and in all duty to tender thy ſervice; And when oportunity ſhall fit thy purpoſe, thou muſt take occaſion to wonder, that ſo great a Prince hath his Armoury ſo ill ſtored, and by way of perſwaſion, thou muſt tell him, that no mans title is ſo right and juſt, but that it may finde worke upon their beſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12144:12"/>
advantages, and therefore it is a provident policie for his Highneſſe to be preſently furniſhed for all contingents. This <hi>La-nova,</hi> will ſo feede, and ſway his ambition, that he will make over-haſty and unadviſed proviſion. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof, will ſo prepare and fortifie the Kings jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, that it will crowne my device with beliefe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. <hi>La-nona</hi> glad to ſee him ſo well reſolved, promiſed his beſt endeavours, and in the performance thereof had his wiſhed ſucceſſe. But before he went, he brought Pen, Inke, and Paper, whereupon <hi>Paris</hi> (more Prophetically then he thought) writ as followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <l>When <hi>Vandoumes</hi> firſt borne, ſhall <hi>Vienna</hi> wed,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Daulphins</hi> Land, ſhall doome the <hi>Daulphin</hi> dead:</l>
               <l>Pride ſcornes that time ſhould check <hi>Vandoumes</hi> French Fate,</l>
               <l>Thy death muſt helpe to Crowne his Royall pate.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>La-noua</hi> divining that this procreated conceit, would bring forth ſome good iſſue, could not but laugh thereat; and in that joy, he went immediatly to make proviſion both for himſelfe, and his friend.</p>
            <p>Now each Wedneſday, in every weeke, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> (more for applauſe, then to doe good) received himſelfe (as he went to heare Maſſe) all the Sutors Petitions; and in the afternoone viewed, and conſidered of them. Vpon this day, <hi>Paris</hi> having lapt vp his fraudulent Libell, like a plaine Petition, went to the Court well furniſhed for the purpoſe, where he did ſo well perſonate a holy Fryer, that <hi>Linxes</hi> eyes could not diſcover him. There did he vnſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected deliver it, and returned without perſeverance. Afterwards the <hi>Daulphin</hi> upon the peruſing of them, found and read (amongſt the reſt) <hi>Paris</hi> his threatning and ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Propheſie, which did ſo poyſon and ſwell him with ſuſpitious thoughts, and moſt fearefull ſurmiſes, that in his irefull indignation, he cryed out with the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> How ſhall we avoid the deepe diſſembling of <hi>Ehud?</hi> Plaine dealing I ſee is dead without iſſue; and all Honour, and due
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12144:12"/>
reſpects are buried, in the inſatiable deſire of Rule. Surely this is no enigmaticall, nor promiſcuous Oracle; but a plaine prediction ſent by God, or ſome good man in zeale and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Princes, and in tenderneſſe of our ſafeties. O moſt treacherous and perfideous Duke, that in the bonds of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, wouldſt cut off the ſmall remainder of our dayes; to worke thy further bloody ends.</p>
            <p>My daughter ſhall not ſo be Queene by our death; Nor ſhall our Subjects be ſo ſlaine in his unnaturall and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Warre. I will not ſuffer the true Vine to be ſo diſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor ſhall my connivence traduce me for his impunity. For though wiſedome permits not, that I detect him open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for feare of making him my implacable enemy; yet will we ſend a private, and an unknowne Meſſenger ſecretly to his King, who ſhall (upon his Royall word for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealement of our intelligence) diſcover, and lay open, <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doumes</hi> moſt impious and pernitious intended Treaſon; and after ſhall he caſt (by our inſtructions) ſuch ſtore of oyle up. on that jealous flame, that it ſhall (at leaſt) burne up all <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doumes</hi> hopes of further proceeding with us. Thus, did ſuch hate proceed from feare, that after a ſmall reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee ſent accordingly to the King, who was no ſooner poſſeſt thereof, but that his divided thoughts made ſuch inteſtiue warre within his breaſt, that he knew not what to ſay, or doe. His fraternall love made him weepe, to ſee Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo monſtrous and unkinde; and fearefull jealouſies (a diſeaſe incident to Kings) called upon juſtice, and ſayd, that corrected Treaſon was the life of a Prince.</p>
            <p>Diſtruſt now ſtill dreamed upon Murther, and unquiet feare could not be ſecured, but with execution: Then Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection tolde him, that then wee come neareſt unto God, when we judge with pitty, and pardon in mercy.</p>
            <p>In this doubtfull Combate of the minde, he ſent for the Duke, who no ſooner came, but that taking him alone into his private Chamber, he with a mild ſeverity, thus breathed out his griefe, and his juſt and loving rebuke.</p>
            <p>It is our pleaſure <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>andoume</hi> (for ſo thy Soveraigne calls
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12144:13"/>
thee) that thou neither interrupt us while we ſpeake, nor at our concluſion, make any anſwere or excuſe; Then know, that if we were as ready to puniſh, as thou art ready to rebell; Thou ſhouldſt now finde a ſharpe cenſure in ſteede of a kinde brother; and we ſhould be freed from an incompatible Traytor, in lieu of a loyall Subject. God that protecteth Kings, hath now made thy implicite Treaſon tranſparent. Thy proclivity to rule; thy thirſting after po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity; thy ſubtill taxing of our Government: thy need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe proviſion ſor Armes in a well ſetled Peace: and thy diſguiſed deſire to match with the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to us; And thou that in pride, couldſt not brooke a Superiour, art now by divine Iuſtice, brought beneath the fortune of thy equals. It is now in our power to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee, but not to make thee humble; Such is thy aſpiring Ambition, that nothing but a Crowne can limit thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded deſires. For neither the terrour of Law, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of Nature, my binding dutie, nor the awe of thy due duty, could keepe, or confine thee, within the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and compaſſe of thy Alleageance. Knoweſt thou not that the jealouſie of a King is death? and that a Prince is neither a kinne, nor allyed to a Traytor. Admit that thou hadſt prevailed in thy moſt nefarious rebellion. What had beene thy Conqueſt? but terrour of conſcience, daily doubt of Treaſon, nightly feare of murther, the ſhame of thy ſelfe, the hate of men, and the vengeance of God. O what bitter fruites ſhouldeſt thou ſo untimely have purchaſt. The uſurpation of my Crowne (which a few dayes would peaceably give thee) could not Patronize thy fratricide, nor diſpence with the murther of thy Soveraigne. How fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, inhumane, maligne, and degenerate haſt thou then ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed thy ſelfe? Many are the probabilities that thou ſoughts my life, and more then many are the inducements why I ſhould ſecure my ſelfe by thy death. And what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie canſt thou expect there, when thou didſt intend no pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. I grieve and bluſh to ſee ſuch an Antipathy betwixt us.

the now pledge of the vertue of my love, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hereafter the better love me for my vertue: For here I doe not onely fteely pardon thee, but doe entertaine the a new to dwell ever in my deareſt affection.

O with what wonder, did he now obſerve her matchleſſe beauty, her gracefull Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, her pleaſing words, and her ſweet delivery. And what a
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:12144:14"/>
conflict was now growne betwixt his deſire and diſpaire: All his thoughts were extravagant, and at warre with each other. For as deſire did finde content, with joy, to be in her preſence; ſo Diſpaire denyed him all hope, with diſtruſt of any comfort. His heart now began to rebuke his eyes for ſoaring ſo neere the Sunne, and for gazing after impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. But his eyes told his heart, that no diſdaine could dwell in ſo rare a perfection. In this perturbation of mind did hee ſtand, untill <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> being dry, called to him for a cup of wine, which he in the pride of that imployment ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily brought, but delivered it with great aſtoniſhment and ſtupidity (as being over-ſurprized both with joy, and feare) he all-ſhaking, flaſht ſome of the wine over the cup, and ſo wet both theyr hands; which one of the Ladies perceiving, ſcornefully ſaid; Sir Knight, you are over-bountifull, I am ſure, my Ladies hand called for no wine. There is no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (anſwered <hi>Vienna)</hi> at all; He knew my hand was dry. So Madame, ſaid <hi>Izabella,</hi> is your foote. My foote, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, is further off from the burning Sunne, and receives moyſture enough from the humide earth. But neither, ſaid <hi>Izabella,</hi> did neede any wine. We called, ſaid <hi>Vienna,</hi> for it, being dry; And how could our body receive it, unleſſe our hand had firſt taken it? A dry cup and a cleane hand, ſaid another Lady, had beene more ſerviceable. Why ſaid <hi>Vienna,</hi> cleane hands are often waſht, and dry cups quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no thirſt; Then muſt dryneſſe have moyſture, and hee hath freely given it us: but no more, we have loſt our game in his defence. <hi>Paris,</hi> whoſe extaſie had given way to theſe paſſages, recollecting himſelfe, humbly ſaid, What (moſt gracious Princes) you have loſt in the game, that have you wonne by patience in your meekeneſſe; but how ſhall I worthily magnifie your great worth, that (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe tart Ladies bitter provocations (hath ſhewed the fulneſſe of all vertue in your goodneſſe.

Thankes good knight, ſaid <hi>Vienna,</hi> wee deſire no ſuch ſatisfaction; your taken paines ſhall be all your pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. <hi>Paris</hi> being proud of this conceited favour, (though <hi>Vienna</hi> in her milde nature pleaded in his defence, onely to croſſe the other Ladies deriſion, and to approve her owne accuteneſſe) withdrew himſelfe to the next win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, where with his Diamond he thus writ.</p>

            <p>But now <hi>Fortune</hi> that wayted (though yet a farre off) on <hi>Paris</hi> unknowne merit, gave him a befitting occaſion to doe <hi>Vienna</hi> (though ſtill covertly) more pleaſing and more glorious ſervice. For there had lately falne out in the French Court a great contention, betwixt the native Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and ſome ſeverall noble Forraigners, that then for their pleaſures, followed that Court in honour of the King. The controverſy was, whether was moſt fairer or the more vertuous of theſe three Ladies; <hi>Valentia</hi> the great Duke of <hi>Burbons</hi> daughter; <hi>Vienna,</hi> the <hi>Daulphins</hi> ſole heyre of <hi>Viennoys;</hi> or the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> ſiſter to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Great was their debate, and many there were that maintained each ſeverall Ladies beauty. In ſo much, as they fell from arguing to anger, from anger to blowes, and from blowes to wounds. The French King offended with their offending uproare, and great neglect of their due reſpect to place and perſon, commanded peace upon their Alleage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances: And after being pacified, and fully poſſeſt with the cauſe; he held the occaſion well worthy diſpute, but their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:12144:15"/>
faulty courages, and our furious proceedings, puniſhable in the place: Yet fearing the further ill that might in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars well enſue thereof; out of his deepe inſight, he pardoned their great over-ſights, and calling them all before him (after ſome few reprehending words) hee thus with a milde majeſty, briefely and wiſely appeaſed them all.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he commanded that a ſolemne and royall Iuſts (in honour of the three Ladies) ſhould be proclaimed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Kingdome to be holden in <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, free for all commers, and that ſhe whoſe Knight ſhould honour her, with the honour of the day, ſhould bee ever had, and held, for the faireſt of the three; and that his Queene ſhould crowne her with a Crowne of white Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, beſet with precious ſtones, as Soveraigne Queene of moſt perfect beauty: This milde and pleaſing ſhower, ſo kindly diſtilling from the King, ſo well allayed their ſtormy furies, that calming theyr over-enraged wills, in the ſhame of their amiſſe; they humbly on bowed knees, craved par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for their offences, and thanked the King for the grace and honour that he did them. Then ſent the King his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour to acquaint the <hi>Engliſh</hi> King, and ſpecially Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and Duke; entreating the King, and willing both the other to honour him, and his Court, with their perſons, his ſiſter, and theyr two daughters at the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned day, and that each of them would be pleaſed, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, and bring ſome beſeeming prize of value, befitting both themſelves, the cauſe, and the worth of the Victor. All which they promiſed in the word of a Prince, holding themſelves no little honoured in ſo honorable a contention.

Mounts, which he had cauſed to be erected, and made for the three Ladies to ſit on; who no ſooner were come and placed, but that the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> came marching in with a rich Garland, made all of orient Pearle, hanging on a Blew Banner, with his coate of Armes on the other ſide, and placed it on the Mount belonging to <hi>Valentia,</hi> on her left aſide.</p>
            <p>Then followed the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>Viennois</hi> with a rich Coller of Eſſes, beſet all over with Rubies, hanging on a white Banner, with his armes diſplayed on the other ſide, and plac'd it on <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennas</hi> Mount, on the right hand of his Daughter. Then came Englands royall King, with an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Crowne of burniſht gold, ſet with Indian Diamonds and blew Saphirs, ſupported betwixt two regall Lyons, hanging on a red Banner, and plac'd it on the middle mount before his Siſter the Lady <hi>Margaret:</hi> In the face of each ſeverall Mount (ſome foure degrees under the Ladies) ſate each ſeverall Ladies Father, in a ſtrange deviſed Seate, ſo curiouſly made, and ſo gloriouſly deckt, that each one ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be <hi>Apollo</hi> ſitting in the Chariot of the Sunne. The Knights (whoſe rare Deviſes diſcovered theyr ſecret and ſeverall fancies) as they were affected; ſo they betooke themſelves to the Mount, whoſe honor they were to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. The French King ſitting in his rich Pavillion pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Flower-deluces, oppoſite to the Mounts, cauſed Proclamation to be made on paine of death, that none but the Knights Encounterers ſhould ſtay, or enter into the Liſtes, and that no Knight unhorſed ſhould Iuſt againe, nor any make offer of Combate: This being done, the King of Armes ſtood up, and after a third ſound, bade them goe too, and doe theyr beſt devoyres like valiant Knights: And no ſooner had he ended his words, but that there came from <hi>Valentias</hi> Mount a Knight well mounted on a ſpeedy Bay, his Armour, Baſes, and all other his Furniture Azure, full of fiery flames, and on his ſhield he bare a Phoenix, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within a bright ſhining Sunne, and under it, a hand reaching towards it, with this underwritten Motto, <hi>O vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam:</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:12144:16"/>
Towards him came from the Lady <hi>Margarets</hi> Mount, a greene Knight, full of eyes and bleeding Hearts, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a fierce Blacke, bearing on his Shield an Armed Knight proſtrated undera Ladies mercy, his Launce lying unbroken by him, with his Motto, <hi>All-ready conquered:</hi> Theſe two Knights encountred each other ſo furiouſly and forceably, that their Staues ſhivered in the ayre, and witneſſed theyr courages in their fall, but in the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buffe, the knight of the Phoenix was borne to the ground, ſo that the greene Knight rode on, overthrowing twenty other Knights that came from both the other Mounts; the laſt of whom, bare in his Shield the Picture of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> moſt richly pourtracted with a vaile of lawne all over her, and from the dexter part of the Shield there was a Hand and an Arme comming forth of a Cloud; holding a fayre Labell, whereon was written, <hi>Such an one, as ſuch is none.</hi> Great was now the glory of the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> and all malecontented ſate the other two Ladies, eſpecially <hi>Vienna,</hi> who now ſeeing her ſhadowed ſelfe lying in the duſt, miſt, and wiſht for her White and vnknowne Knight; And as her wandring eye romed up and downe, ſtill looking whether ſhe could eſpie him, ſhe ſuddainely both heard and ſaw a well proportioned Blacke Knight, rudely ruſhing from her Mount, who ſo fiercely ſaluted the Greene Knight, that he made him pay tribute for his former ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in the overthrow of his fortune: Threeſcore other aſſayling Knights he diſmounted before <hi>Vienna,</hi> who now joying, wondred, and wondering, prayed that he might be her deſired knight, that wonne her Chriſtall Shield and Chaplet at her Fathers Court; and well ſhee prayed, that had ſo well her prayer, for it was Sir <hi>Paris</hi> indeed, who knowing that Emulation hath many eyes, and that Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation might eaſily diſcover him, fearing to be knowne by his white Armour, had thus ſadly arm'd himſelfe ſutable to his ſable fortune; and therefore he bare nothing in his Shield but Blackneſſe, for his Deviſe was ſtill to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Deviſe; only his ſad Armour was covered all over with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12144:16"/>
mourning Clouds. Many Knights there were overthrowne by <hi>La-nova,</hi> but more then many did Sir <hi>Paris</hi> foyle. For then, if ever; and if ever, then: did he ſhew the vertue of his valour, in the ſtrength of his courage. Now grew the hurly-burly great, and many, and great were the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters made on each ſide, In ſo much, that there reſted but unoverthrowne, one <hi>Valentia</hi> on the Lady <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets</hi> part, on either ſide three; and all onely on <hi>Viennas,</hi> but one; which was the blacke clouded Knight, who now was deem'd hardly beſtead, both in regard of his former tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes, and the preſent advantage of the ſixe freſh aſſailants, who bent all theyr forces firſt againſt him. <hi>Valentias</hi> hope was now a little revived, and the Lady <hi>Margarets</hi> proud ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation fully anſwered <hi>Valentias</hi> hope. Onely doubtfull <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> neere dyed for feare, leaſt that her beauty ſhould now be eclipſed in the loſſe of her gotten fame, and that her fame ſhould be buried in the dying renowne of her beſt eſteemed beauty. For as ſhe wondred hee had ſo long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, ſo ſhee held it unpoſſible hee ſhould longer reſiſt. But Sir <hi>Paris</hi> (onely weary, in that there were no more to be wearied by him) caſting his eye (the meſſenger of his heart) on <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> and ſeeing the ſhining lights of her tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent beauty, over-ſhadowed with ſorrow and diſmay. Deſire ſo blew the fire of his new conceived rage, that like an unmercifull, and hunger-ſtarved Lyon, (that runnes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for his prey) ſo he violently runne amongſt them, that with one ſtaffe he overthrew the firſt three he met, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Houſe, before <hi>Vienna</hi> could turne her diſpaire, he charg'd the fourth ſo forceably, that hee ſent both Horſe and Man to the ground: At the ſight whereof, the people gave ſuch applauding ſhoutes, that <hi>Vienna</hi> lifting up her ſad eye (as waking from a carefull ſlumber) ſhe ſaw her Knight returning in the glory of theyr overthrowes. So that hoping now for better hap, a better hap did befall her then ſhe did, or could expect. For no ſooner made hee his laſt returne, but hee returned againe from overturning of the other two. Who triumphed then but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna?</hi> Who

now more ſad then <hi>Valentia,</hi> or who more grieved then the Lady <hi>Margaret?</hi> the Iuſt thus ended, the French Queene came with a troupe of attending Ladyes, carying before her the Crowne of Artificiall Lillies, richly ſtoned, and ſetting it on <hi>Viennas</hi> head, ſhee Crowned her for ſole, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Queene, of abſolute, and matchleſſe beauty.</p>
            <p>Then came the King, and tooke Sir <hi>Paris</hi> by the hand, and lead him (all the other Knights and Barrons follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them) with tryumphing honour, and ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, to the three Mounts, where with his owne hand hee gave him the three Banners, with the three prizes on them, which Sir <hi>Paris</hi> reverently taking, re-delivered over to his friend <hi>La-nova,</hi> ſecretly to convay them away, while hee ſtayed the ending of all other the ceremonies. All which being accompliſhed: The <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and <hi>Vienna</hi> (rendring Sir <hi>Paris</hi> thankes for his worthy and affectionate endeavours, and moſt renowned and fortunate atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) requeſted him, in the name of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> to diſcover himſelfe, and tell unto whom they were all ſo much boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But Sir <hi>Paris</hi> humbling himſelefe in all duty, made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent ſhew of his unwillingneſſe therein; which the King noting, would not further importune him, nor could the <hi>Daulphin</hi> in any wiſe over-treat him, nor durſt <hi>Vienna</hi> over-much preſſe him: So that he kiſſing her hand, held it long and after drawing his ſword, layd it at her feete, and taking it vp againe kiſt it likewiſe; and then holding it up, ſeemed to threaten the world in her behalfe, which added this Article to <hi>Viennas</hi> beleife, that he undoubtedly was her white Knight, and the ſame, and non but the ſame, that firſt ſo melodiouſly ſang under her Chamber window; and theeefore her deſires having now no end, ſhee ever after though each houre an age, till ſhe knew him. But Sir <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> withdrawing himſelfe to the reſt of the Knights, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with them, ſtill giving backe, till he was the laſt of the troupe, and then taking a croſſe-way, ſeparated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayed himſelfe from them, and ſuddenly diſarming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hee ſpeedied to finde out the Biſhop of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:12144:17"/>
with whom (of purpoſe to prevent all ſurmiſes) hee had a little before familiarized himſelfe, and no ſooner had hee eſpyed him, but that he haſted to greete him, and ſtill kept in his company, as if St. <hi>Marke</hi> had robb'd god <hi>Mars</hi> of a Martialiſt. Such was his holy ſhew of devout Religion, as that he made all men admire him, and his father to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly grieved at him.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Vienna,</hi> who now had greater cauſe to love him, then meanes to know him, wondring at his valour, not to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued; and valuing his vertues, by clowding the glory and value of his prowis, held now his love an honour to her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and vowed her affection a guerdon for his love. But when ſhe heard of his ſecret departure, and that no one knew what he was, from whence he came; nor to what place he had retired himſelfe; Then impatient deſire made her the child of paſſion, &amp; feare to looſe that ſhe never had, made her feele what before, ſhe neither knew, nor feared. And ſo much the more ſhe held her ſelfe miſerable, in that ſhe knew not for whom ſhe was ſo miſerable, nor how to ſeeke an end, to end her miſery.</p>
            <p>As <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennas,</hi> ſad conceite, thus overſhaded the glory of her beautifull Conqueſt, ſo was Sir <hi>Jaques</hi> flattering hope made blacke with foule diſpaire; For miſſing his ſonne Sir <hi>Paris</hi> out of two ſo Royall &amp; honorable Aſſemblies, where renowne eternized each deſerving Knight, with never dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fame; and ſeeing him ſtill aſſociating the Biſhop; hee feared leaſt his buſineſſe of over ſuperſtitious Zeale, had abandoned all deſire and regard of Knightly Chivalry.

            <p>He determined to goe (onely with <hi>La-nova)</hi> to the warrs of <hi>Florence.</hi> And craving, he obtained, willing leave of his glad Father; but before his departure, he called his Mother aſide, and delivering her the key of his Chamber, and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, wherein were placed all his purchaſt Prizes, well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with Hangings of sky-coloured ſilke, en broy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with ſtarres of gold, and ſhaded all over with blacke Cipris, that the dimmeſt eye might perceive the glory of the heavens, through the blackneſſe of the cloud.

But the more ſhe ſought to quench deſire, the more ſhee burnt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe within her owne fire. Many Princes became Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Priſoners to her beauty, and greateſt Barons did
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12144:19"/>
homage to her vertues; But neyther Prince nor Baron could finde favour in Beauty, nor love in vertue. So ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was her ſtrange affection, eſtranged to all but to him that was ſo meere a ſtranger to her ſo ſtrange a paſſion. To him, and for him, had ſhe conſecrated, and reſerved her devoted heart; and to him and none but him, would ſhee yeeld the conqueſt of her Maydens minde. And although diſturbed reaſon affoorded her no hope, nor poſſibility of finding or enjoying him; Yet did the gracious aſpect of her favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtarres, yeeld her this meanes to know him. For Sir <hi>Iaques</hi> being greatly viſited with ſickneſſe, was ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bewayled of all, and ſo particularly bemoaned of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> (in regard of his thrice noble ſervice in the wars, and his wiſe directions in Counſell) that he ſent the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinis</hi> his Lady to viſite him; who taking <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> and <hi>Jza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> with her went attended with foure other Ladies, to ſee, and comfort his enfeebled eſtate. But finding him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily amended (after ſome faſhionable, and cheerefull chat:) The <hi>Daulphinis</hi> (led thereto, I know not by what deſteny) was deſirous to ſee how well the houſe was contrived, how beautified, and how furniſhed; which the good old Lady in all humbleneſſe yeelded unto, conducting them into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, untill they returning, came againe by Sir <hi>Paris</hi> his Chamber doore, which his Mother both going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming backe, purpoſely paſt by. But being demanded of the <hi>Daulphinis</hi> what Chamber, or Place that was; ſhe durſt not but tell, and telling, would have paſt away, which the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinis</hi> noting, merrily ſayd; Nay Madame, I will not leave the Chamber of ſo worthy a Knight unſeene. The good old Lady not knowing how to avoyd this counterbuffe, fearefully with a trembling hand, opened the doore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were no ſooner entred, but that they ſaw all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Armours, and befitting furnitures for approoved good Knights, which made them commend the owner no little; and to hold him farre worthier of a better Armoury. As thus they viewed his ſeverall Armours; <hi>Vienna</hi> happily fixt her eye on a white Armour not farre unlike unto that,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:12144:20"/>
which Sir <hi>Paris</hi> had on him, when firſt he won her Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and Chriſtall Shield. Tha ſight whereof, made Hope (the Harbinger of happineſſe) to breath in her this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing comfort; that as that Armour was none but the ſame: So Sir <hi>Paris</hi> (that renowned owner) muſt of neceſſity bee that ſecret Knight, that not daring to be knowne to loue her, was (by her ſacred vowes) to bee beloved of her. Thus Hope preſumed the beſt, and inuited joy to gratulate her good ſucceſſe. But doubt (curbing raſhneſſe with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration) perſwaded her to further tryall. For as her hope was ready to embrace the firſt ſhew of comfort, ſo was her deſire moſt greedy of more perfect aſſurance. And the better to effect, what ſhe affected, ſhe fayned (and fayne ſhe was to fayne) her ſelfe ſuddenly ſicke, and after ſome ſhew of ſome extremity, ſhe deſired her Mother (the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make better ſearch) to leaue her alone, all only with <hi>Izabella,</hi> to reſt her for a time on the bed, which they hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuenient, conſented to it. And no ſooner were they gone, but that <hi>Vienna</hi> bolting the doore, began to make a wary ſearch. At laſt, at the end of the Chamber ſhe found a privie pertition, ſo well ſhadowed with the Hangings of the Chamber, that hardly could any perceive the ſame; within, and behind this, was the place wherein Sir <hi>Paris</hi> daily ſacrificed his prayers vnto his God, wherein they were no ſooner entred, but that withdrawing a glorious clouding Curtaine, they diſcovered the three famous rich Prizes of Sir <hi>Paris</hi> victorious prowis, ſtately erected vpon the wall, and below them hanged the Chriſtall Shield, and golden Chaplet, he firſt wonne at her Fathers Court. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to which, on the other ſide, ſtood his white and blacke clouded Armours, ſo fully, and liuely ſet vp, as they ſeemed as ready to defend the place, as their Maſter was willing to maintaine her beauty. Long looked <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> on euery ſeverall Prize, but longer looked ſhee on both the Armours; now bluſhing and ſighing; then ſmiling and wondring at the ſtately and pleaſing proportion of them. In this contentment, and admiration of her thoughts, ſhee
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12144:20"/>
would have dwelled ſtill, but that caſting her nimble eye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to ſee what <hi>Izabella</hi> did, ſhe perceived theſe following verſes to lye written on the Table.</p>

               <l>My Woe, Loſſe, Care, and Death, doth all conſpire.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But if that Time, in time, fell Fortune daunt,</l>
               <l>If Love, in love, but move my Love, to love:</l>
               <l>If Fortune ſmile, in Loves ſweet yeelding graunt,</l>
               <l>And my deſires enioy, what Lovers prove.</l>
               <l>Then ſhall my Woe, Loſſe, Care, and Death retire.</l>
               <l>And I laud Time, Love, Fortune, and Deſire.</l>

Theſe Verſes well pleaſed <hi>Vienna,</hi> and all contentment now waited on her firſt liking conceit: But after ſhee had more conſideratively weyed, how poore Sir <hi>Paris</hi> was that meane Man whom ſhe wiſht ſo much to ſee, and to whom ſhe had devoted the honour of her love; her bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baſhfulneſſe then rebuk't her miſliked kindneſſe, and his muddy clouded affection, ecclipſed the ſunſhine of her far more glorious worth. In this diſlike, ſhe ſilent ſate her downe, and riſing ſtreight againe, ſayd; That promiſe is nefarious, that is to be accompliſhed by an ignoble deed; and it is more tollerable to violate an vnworthy vow foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly made; then by keeping the ſame, to draw on my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and give juſt cauſe of offence to others: My fayth falls out a treaſon to my ſelfe, and the love I beare him, is the field wherein I ſeeke to overthrow my renowne: But why ſhould my raſh judgement ſet a ranckling tooth in his vertuous ſide? Or why ſhould I care for more honors then to content my ſelfe; Or for more riches, then to enioy my ſelfe? wee are all borne to love; and wee onely live, and love to be beloved: Then not to love, and thinke to be beloved, is like that fooliſh Virgin, that ſought to light her Lampe at anothers Torch that was quite extinct. With that ſhe began to recount the ſhining Glory of his ſpreading renowne, the full perfection of his many approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and admired vertues; the commendable regard of his ſecret and impriſoned love, with the dangerous and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable approbation of the ſame; and how ſhe was bound in honor to honor and love him, that had above the pride of all honor, ſo honoured her. Then, then began ſhee to be more ſorry ſhe could love him no better, then before ſhe was aſhamed ſhe loved him ſo well: And therefore taking <hi>Jzabella</hi> by the hand, ſhe vowed and ſwore, that ſhe would live to love none but Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> nor love to live longer then ſhe might be beloved of her <hi>Paris;</hi> For <hi>Fortune</hi> ſayd ſhee hath decreed it ſo; <hi>Love</hi> will have it ſo, and <hi>Vienna</hi> ſweares it ſhall be ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jzabella</hi> firſt vttering her miſlike, in her complaining
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12144:21"/>
teares, and then drowning her teares in the griefe of her complaint, thus all ſighing, ſhee ſadly ſaid: Ah <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> no more now <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> ſince <hi>Vienna</hi> hath loſt her ſelfe; what is become of your Princely regard, befitting your ſtate? where is your wonted wiſedome, ſo admired of all? Your vertue giving light to others, and your modeſty eternizing your beauty: Shall baſe conceit (ever attended on with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting follies) eclipſe now the honour and wonder of your Name? Are fervile thoughts beſeeming companions for your noble minde? or ignoble ſubiects fit obiects for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces eyes? If <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> be ſo predominate over you, that <hi>Diana</hi> is quite forgotten of you; yet let me call you before the iudgement of your owne vertue, and then tell me whether the unworthy worthineſſe of his Degree, equalize the great greatneſſe of your Dignity? Admit his deſerts be many, and promiſe much, yet are his poſſibilities of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, no poſſeſſions of enrichment; nor are his noble deeds the deeds of a Noble man. Will you then loſe an honor for an humor? Nay, rather performe a Regall office in a Princelike nature; that being a Princeſſe in your ſelfe, become alſo Princelike in your deedes. What will your Father ſay, nay all <hi>France,</hi> nay all the World? when they ſhall here that <hi>Vienna,</hi> late ſcorning the Royall love of greateſt Princes, is now ſubiected to the will of a meane Knight: Farre be it from my Lady ſo to doe, far from any to thinke ſo, and farre from <hi>Izabella</hi> ever to ſee it ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vienna,</hi> (whoſe ſetled affection) held her perſwaſive inuertions odious, and whoſe reſolved determination, thought her reprehenſion loathſome, with unuſuall eyes, arguing her diſcontent, ſhe all angry, thus ſharpely replyed; Were I (unkind, ungratefull, and uniuſt <hi>Jzabella)</hi> as farre from affection, as thou art from reaſon and pitty; Yet would not the common care that Ladyes of eſteeme ought to haue toward Knights of good regard, ſuffer me to heare due deſerts ſo diſgrac'd by iniurious tongues, nor true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne ſo reproacht by malignant mouthes. Then know (and knowing grieve, that ſo thou knoweſt) that thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12144:22"/>
words hath wounded my deſire, and my deſire abandons thee in thy words: Thinkeſt thou that deſire dreames once on Dignities? or that <hi>Cupid</hi> cares for Crownes, that never ſaw Gold: Seeſt not thou theſe Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies erected in his honor, and his honor ſhining in theſe Trophies? If I be great, his great deedes anſwers my great eſtate, and my eſtate ſhall be made greater by his great deeds: For if ever any Knight merited renown for renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chivalry, it is my <hi>Paris;</hi> or if ever Knight followed his Lady with true love, loved her with honor, or honored her with regard and remarkeable ſervices, it is my <hi>Paris:</hi> Then if ever well-deſerving Knight triumphed in the faithfull love of his Lady, it ſhall be my <hi>Paris:</hi> For here I ſweare by the eternall juſtice of the Higheſt, that none ſhall have <hi>Vienna</hi> but <hi>Paris,</hi> nor none love <hi>Paris</hi> ſo well as <hi>Vienna,</hi> Then leave to grieve me, and loade not my griefe with further diſpleaſure, in gain-ſaying what I ſay againe, I will never gaineſay: For in vaine it is to water the plant, the roote being periſhed, or to ſeeke to perſwade me, that am ſo reſolvedly perſwaded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Izabella</hi> ſeeing her ſo reſolute in her paſſion, and ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in her reſolution, thought it was in vaine to urge her further; and fearing her threatning diſpleaſure, ſhe thought it good thus to balme the wound ſhe before had given. Let not my honourable Lady (ſhe ſayd) returne an imagined wrong, with an effectuall injury, but pardon the well wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fault of your faultleſſe friend, who (if offending) offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in tender care of deſiring your good, and not of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to contract you, or with will to diſcontent you, whom before all others I wiſh to content; for proofe whereof, I here vow repay to the debt of my error, with the intereſt of all my furthering indeavours, to advantage you in your Love. No ſooner had ſhe ſpoken the laſt word Love, but that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> in love, for love, kiſt, and embraſt her, joying in her promiſe and availing aide; and proteſting, that moſt gratefull guerdons ſhould make full ſatisfaction for her offered kindneſſe. In the meane time, ſhe required
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12144:22"/>
ſecrecy, and fearing leaſt their long ſtay might procure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome feare, or ſuſpition, in her Mother, ſhee thought good to depart as one well recovered of a ſuddaine hatch; but before they went, ſhee cauſed <hi>Izabella</hi> to take, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to conuay away: the Chriſtall Shield, and Chaplet; the firſt and rich records, both of her beauty, and his prowis; and this ſhe did of purpoſe, not ſo much for any deſire ſhee had to have them, as to give him occaſion to come to enquire after them.</p>
            <p>In this proceſſe of time, the Warres of <hi>Florence,</hi> were ended, and Sir <hi>Paris</hi> being intelligenced of his Fathers ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (whoſe infeebled age he much feared) and beeing deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſee <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> though diſpaire of ſucceſſe, the hearce of his ſuppoſed idle hopes; yet Deſire (the nurſe of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance) gave him wings to make the more ſpeed; ſo that <hi>La-nova,</hi> and hee, poſting homewards, happily came, and found Sir <hi>Jaques</hi> well amended, whoſe good recovery was no leſſe joyfull to Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> then his returne was comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Father. After they had long diſcourſed of the occurrants of theſe Warres, and of his many adventures and fortunes. Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> longing to give his eye content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by gazing on his Idolatrous Prizes, he tooke his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the hand, and walking towards his Chamber (like the Lapwing that flyeth farre from her neſt) he enquired of Court affaires, but ſhe being not able to ſatisfie the drift of his reach, he preſt her no further; but being entred into his Chamber, he made a ſtep into his Oratory, were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly miſſing the firſt pride of his happy atchievements, the chiefe glory of his ſtudy, and the true teſtimony of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennas</hi> beauty, and bounty; being therewith much appaled, and mooved at their remove, he all angerly came forth, and asked who had beene there, and there had taken away ſuch things as hee moſt eſteemed. His Mother abaſhed at the queſtion, but more grieved that there was any thing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not knowing how, or by whom they ſhould bee taken away; anſwered, that ſince his departure no one had beene there, but the <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> and her daughter the Lady <hi>Vienna,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:12144:23"/>
accompanied with other Ladies that came to viſite his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his ſickneſſe, and that ſhee deſired amongſt other Chambers to ſee that, which ſhee (after ſome denying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes) durſt not longer gaine-ſay, and how that ſhee her ſelfe was with them ſo long as they ſtayed. Saving that the Lady <hi>Vienna</hi> being ſuddenly ſurpriſed with ſickneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted for her better eaſe, to ſtay onely alone with <hi>Jza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> to reſt her a while on your bed. <hi>Paris</hi> flattering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with his owne favourable conſtruction, deemed (and truely deemed) that the cauſe of her alteration, grew by the unexpected ſight of the Prizes, and the view of his verſes, that he had left on his Table; and that ſhe had taken them away either in her angry diſdaine, or to ſee what account he made of them, or whether hee would re-demand them. And therefore pleaſed, to adventure his fortune vpon the rocke of this hazard, hee ſhewed no further miſlike that he miſt them. But afterwards, ſhadowing his deſire to ſee <hi>Vienna,</hi> under the borrowed vayle of duty, to ſee, and to attend the <hi>Daulphin:</hi> he went to the Court, where the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> glorying in the luſtre of his Subjects renowne, becauſe it gave a ſplendour to his Greatneſſe; he kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, with more familiar embracements, and loving reſpects, then his auſtere nature, did vſually afford: by this his unwonted curteſie &amp; grace, he made Sir <hi>Paris</hi> thoughts (more obligatory) to his favours; and faſhioned his favours (more complementory) to Sir <hi>Paris</hi> fortunes. for curteſie, they ſay, in Majeſty, bindes ever affection in duty. As Sir <hi>Paris</hi> ſtood before the <hi>Daulphin</hi> (relating the honour, and iſſue of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Warres) hee glaunc'd, and fearefully glaunc'd many times on <hi>Vienna,</hi> but checking his eyes, that ſtill rebuk'd him; he left to looke, on whom not daring to looke, he could not but looke. But <hi>Vienna,</hi> whoſe late kindled love, was now growne into a flame, having tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly before expected him, could not now ſeeing him, feaſt her raviſht eyes at full, but gazing ſtill on his ample per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections (for now hee ſeemed more then exquiſite) and taking pleaſure in the ſweet harmony of his well-tuned
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12144:23"/>
words; ſhee no ſooner rejoyced, joying in her owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; but that ſtraight ſhe deſired the enjoying. And tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards <hi>Izabella,</hi> ſhe all-bluſhing ſmiled, and ſmiling bluſht againe, becauſe ſhe ſmiled, and then asked her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe ſaw not baſhfull feare, and doubtfull diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſit on the face of his troubled countenance, for the loſſe of his Prizes, and the diſcouery of his affection; and whether ſhe were not happy in her Choyſe, and more then happy in his loue. All which, Gnathonizing <hi>Jzabella</hi> prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally confirmed, and demanded, how ſhee would doe, to enfeoffe him with her affection, that durſt not be knowne of his owne loue. Which <hi>Vienna</hi> well ruminating in her mind, at length (woman-like) found out this deuice.</p>
            <p>She faigned her ſelfe, for ſome three dayes, very ſicke; and in the diſtemper of her wounding offences, fearefull of her ſinnes; but after when ſhee was better enabled both in body, and minde; ſhee deſired leaue of her Mother, to goe the next day (for the more quieting and confirming of her conſcience, and to giue God praiſe for her recouery) to the Biſhop of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> to confeſſe herſelfe, and to receiue the Sacrament within the ſacred Temple of God; which her Mother liking, yeelded vnto, rejoycing no little to ſee her ſo well amended, and ſo deuoutly and piouſly deuoted. In the interim, <hi>Vienna</hi> cauſed <hi>Jzabella</hi> to ſend to Sir <hi>Paris</hi> in the Biſhops name, to come and ſpeake with him in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Church, at nine of the clocke the next morning; which Sir <hi>Paris</hi> promiſing, performed accordingly. For at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed houre he came, and being come, ſaw (and wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that ſo he ſaw) the Princeſſe <hi>Vienna</hi> conferring with the Biſhop, whoſe leyſure, he willingly attended, and walked a little aſide, wearying his fancie with wiſhes; and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his conceit with fearefull imaginations. Long hee had not walked, but that <hi>Vienna</hi> eſpying him, applauded her fortune; and armed with her owne deſires, ſhee gaue her ſelfe countenance, vnder the pretext of employment; and called to Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> telling the Biſhop that ſhee had matters of imployment in forraigne affaires, to impart vnto him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12144:24"/>
from her Mother; And therefore ſhee requeſted the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop (if he had any occaſion with him) to walke a while a fide, till ſhee had performed her Mothers command, and then ſhee would leaue them both to their pleaſures. The Biſhop being glad to ſee the Princeſſe ſo ſanctified, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her zeale, and left her to the diſcharge of her duty, blindly ſuppoſing that the <hi>Daulphinis</hi> would ſend Sir <hi>Paris</hi> in meſſage to ſome of her forraigne friends. But <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſelfe alone with him, in whom ſhe joyed alone; ſhe pleaſantly demanded what hee made there, or whether he had any ſuit to her, or to any other, wherein ſhee might accommodate him; If it be ſo (ſo it be conuenient) Sir <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> ſhall finde a friend, if Sir <hi>Paris</hi> be found a friend. This pleaſing and preludious demand, and Enigmaticall concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> ſomewhat fearefull how to anſwer. But Hope the comfortable Counſailour of Loue ſhap'd in him this bold and ſhort reply. My buſineſſe (thrice worthy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) is the Biſhops will; my ſuit, your ſervice; your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice my chiefe deſire, and my deſire your fauorable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; And longer may not <hi>Paris</hi> liue, then he reſts hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thankefull to <hi>Vienna;</hi> and if not offenſſiue, a faithfull ſeruant to my Lady. Thankes (ſaid <hi>Vienna)</hi> good Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> your ſuit ſhall not be non-ſuit, if you ſhoote at Honours ayme. But tell me, and truly tell me, whether your ſuit (and your diſcontentment, which I ſee harbours in your eyes) be not for your Prizes which I tooke away, when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending my Mother, I was at your Fathers houſe: If ſo it be, (be it ſo, or not ſo) you ſhall have them againe, if againe you will returne with me. <hi>Paris</hi> proud of her preſence, held himſelfe more deified, then dignified, by her fauours, and humbling himſelfe; he vowed, that they, himſelfe, and all in all, were at her Honours command. Then muſt I <hi>(Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> ſaid) command, and conjure you to tell me, whether it were your ſelfe, that ſo ſweetly ſung vnder my Chamber window; and ſo friendly gaue me Muſicke; that did wound, and beate my Fathers Guard; that wonne, and bare away my Chriſtall Shield, and Chaplet, in the Tournament

               <hi>Paris</hi> aſtoniſhed at her demand, durſt neither confeſſe, for feare of diſdaine; nor yet diſſemble, for offending her, whom in no wiſe he would offend; which perceived by <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> ſhee familiarly preſt him to acknowledge the trueth, which manifeſted; ſhee with a pleaſing and pleaſant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance merrily ſaid, why then doth Sir <hi>Paris</hi> affectionately love us? Sir <hi>Paris</hi> whoſe entiſing fault had earſt control'd but now condemned, his over-clyming thoughts, was ſo amated in himſelfe, and ſo tranſported from himſelfe, that ſilence, in baſhfull ſignes, bluſht out a dumbe reply. But <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> (ballancing his cold conceit, by the alteration of his countenance) allowed the weight, and animated in her owne affection, ſhee commanded him boldly to averre, what ſhee her ſelfe inferr'd, by ſuch his troubled ſilence. <hi>Paris</hi> ſeeing the cloud of his care diſpierced, gloried the more in the brightneſſe of his Sunne; the beames where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee found ſo comfortable, that hee proudly confeſt his love, and that hee had long done ſecret, and humble ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> under her ſo rare a beauty. <hi>Vienna</hi> ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the pride of her full content, kindly entertained his ſo affectionate a conceite, with as friendly a receite, and briefly, aſſuredly aſſured him; that none but <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould enjoy <hi>Vienna;</hi> if none but <hi>

            <p>This cordiall concluſion, being Sealed with proteſtation of perſeverance, and by confirmation of oathes; they knit two hearts in one, and parted one will in two, and ſo depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. During theſe Haltion dayes, commanding <hi>Love,</hi> wrought enſuing cares: For <hi>Vienna</hi> ſitting but in the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of love, thought the fruites of affection over-long in ripening; and therefore preſuming (in her erring ayme) that her Father in her favour, would tie his conſent to her choyſe, and her love to his liking; She importuned Sir <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> to requeſt his Father to acquaint the <hi>Daulphin</hi> with her affection, and humbly pray his conſent in favour of his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12144:25"/>
Daughter: Which Sir <hi>Jaques</hi> adviſedly at the firſt denyed, as unwilling to waken a ſleeping Lyon, or to ſeeke for Fiſh in a dry Poole. But Paternall love (the allination of reaſon) and flattering hope (the nurſe of deceit) ſo tranſported himſelfe, from himſelfe, that moſt vnlike himſelfe, he (vainely dreaming after poſſibilitie) yeelded to ſaile in a Ship without a Stearne, and to gather honey out of Stones. But the <hi>Daulphin</hi> (whoſe repugnant humour ſcorn'd ſo ſeruile a motion, and whoſe abuſed kindneſſe, now begat in him moſt ſpitefull rage) ſo irefully boyled in his diſdainefull ſurquedry, that bitterly checking Sir <hi>Iaques,</hi> he fearefully thundred out his threatning indignation, in exiling poore Sir <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paris</hi> though checkt, yet not mated; ſhewed now the vertue of his courage in the eclipſe of his fortune. For being perſwaded by <hi>La-noua,</hi> to make preſently away; He notwithſtanding the danger of tyranicall authoritie, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſee his Lady before he loſt his Countrey: And therefore as one deſperate in diſpaire, he haſtily (yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly) went to participate his engrieued ſtate with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Vienna;</hi> who hearing thereof, was ſo confounded in herſelfe, as ſhe was full of ſorrow for being vnable to relieue him, as ſhe was voyd of all meanes to helpe herſelfe. Their lamentations paide now large tribute to their griefes; and their deſires that before had no end, did now, by diſpaire, end endleſſe things in their firſt motion: But after that the flood of their teares was growne to an ebbe, (admitting the neceſſitie of time) they concluded, euer to liue to none, but to each other; though they neuer ſaw againe one an other. And ſo Sir <hi>Paris</hi> fainting in his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, was depriued of his welfare: Which (all louing and impatient) <hi>Vienna</hi> not brooking, ſo to be depoſed from him, in whom ſhe wholly repoſed her ſelfe, recall'd him againe, and enfolding him within her fainting armes, ſhe vowed to pertake with him in all his fortunes; euer remembring him, that the chaſt roote of her true affection was Vertue, clad in conſtant loues deſire: Shee therefore aduiſed him
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12144:25"/>
ſecretly to conceale himſelfe, and to provide for ſhipping, and at the hower of twelue, the third night following, ſhe would diſguiſed (with ſtored Gold and Iewels) meet him in the portch of Saint <hi>Anthonies</hi> Church, and ſo depart with him whitherſoever: Sir <hi>Paris</hi> kiſſing her oft, (for in vaine kiſſing is ſome pleaſure) found now his purgatory, to bee his paradice; Ioy triumpht in his eyes, and comfort lodg'd in his heart; and in this haven of happineſſe hee would have ſwimmed ſtill, but that danger of delay told him, that growing Trees have their falles, aſwell as their ſprings, and that apprehenſion would diſſolue all their harmony: Hee therefore (being borne away with the haſty tide of ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt leaſure) roade preſently into <hi>Provence,</hi> where happily meeting with <hi>Monſieur de la Mott,</hi> a Shippe Maſter of his acquaintance, he privately told him, that he had ſlaine a Man of account, and that he muſt for a time leave his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and therefore pray'd him (for his gold) ſpeedily and ſecretly to Ship him and his two Friends away into ſome other Coaſt; which <hi>Monſieur la Mott</hi> promiſing, ſent one away incontinent to Saint <hi>Victor,</hi> where his ſhippe lay, to make all things in readines and returned himſelfe with Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> to aſſiſt and direct him in all his needfull diſpatches.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Jzabella,</hi> at the time and place appointed met with Sir <hi>Paris</hi> (according to their agreement) in mens apparell, diſpencing with needleſſe ſalutations, addreſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſpeedy journeyes: And ſo long they poaſting, ridde out of all High-wayes, that being benighted, they were glad to crave harbour of a Prelate, who lodging them, placed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> and <hi>Jzabella</hi> in one Chamber, and Sir <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Monſieur de la Mott</hi> in another. In the morning, their earely deſires ſo haſtened theyr ſpeedy departures, that being timely up, and quickly horſed, Sir <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>La Mott,</hi> rode apaſe before, to view the River, whoſe overflowed bankes were ſo over runne, by the pride of a late ſwelling flood, that the Foard was not paſtable: which made Sir <hi>Paris</hi> ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, ſo to be fruſtrated of his attending Ship (the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his ſafety) that <hi>Monſieur de la Mott</hi> over venturous
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12144:26"/>
to venter over the paſſage, was in ſearching the Foard, moſt unfortunately drowned in the mercileſſe Flood. Sir <hi>Paris</hi> daunted at that ſo fatall a ſight, ſighed, and ſighing, grew to a prodigious prognoſticator of his owne enſuing harmes. But fearing leaſt the knowlege thereof might appale his faire Friend, he ſuddainely returned to theyr religious Hoſt, where he had left the two Ladies, when he went to find the Foard, and to try the paſſage; and ſhadowing now his tormenting griefe with a forced ſmile, he demaunded of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> how ſhe fared, who anſwered, as my Love fares, ſo fares thy Love; happy in my ſelfe, becauſe happy in thee. And long may (ſaid <hi>Paris)</hi> my Love live to love, that loves to live onely for my love. Scarce had Sir <hi>Paris</hi> pronounced his laſt word, when one came running to tell the Prieſt, that there were many Knights in the next Towne; that came in queſt, and ſearched for <hi>Vienna</hi> and Sir <hi>Paris:</hi> Which <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> vnderſtanding, was ſo ſurprized with griefe and feare, that being altogether diſheartned in her hope, ſhe held her ſelfe more then undone in her diſturbed expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But after ſhe had bathed the beauty of her eyes, in the ſorrow of her teares, fearing moſt in this preſent perill, leaſt death ſhould arreſt her beloved Friend: She with a much more reſolued minde, and an aſſured countenance, then befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eyther the time, or was incident to her ſex, thus exhille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated her aſtoniſhed Friend.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Paris,</hi> (ſhe ſaid) Time admittes not there many wordes, where danger ſtill knockes at the doore: In extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, the winning of time, is the purchaſe both of life and love: Let not violent paſſions (that neuer remooves any ill, but betrayes our ſecret imperfections) now ſway the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of thy thoughts, nor the fortitude of thy heart; but carry thou in thy Lyons looke, a Lyons minde; and like the Sunne ſhew thy fayreſt face, in thy loweſt fall. Loade not my ſorrowes with thy griefe, nor kill thou thy ſelfe, for feare of death; But in the wonted courage of thy never-daunted Spirit, get thee to ſome other more ſafer ſhore; where let Vertue be thy Governour; my remembrance
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:12144:26"/>
thy Loue; thy loue my comfort, and my comfort thy ſole contentment. Thou haſt conquered men in loue, and Loue in me, and both in worth and wiſedome; and neuer ſhall I deeme my ſelfe happy, but when I ſhall ſee thee happy, for whom I now am ſo vnhappy: As thou leaueſt me, ſo ſhalt thou finde me; be but thou as conſtant a Friend to my Minde, as thou ſhalt be a true Poſſeſſor of my Heart; and I ſhall haue as much cauſe of joy, as thou no cauſe of doubt. If thou continue loyall, ſucceſſe (thou ſhalt ſee) will bleſſe thee well, and all good fortune will waite on thy juſt merits. This Diamond which here I giue thee, ſhall be a true remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning record of my ſincere loue to thee: Onely, let me heare of thy aboad; and ſo I leaue thee to the guide of Vertue, and ſeruice of Fortune. Sir <hi>Paris</hi> thus diſcomforted, comforted; weighing the danger of delay, by his immient perill, and forced to ſet vp his ſayles in this ſo inſupportable &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tempeſt; and there ſealing vp the vow of his faith, in the ſilent griefe of a departing kiſſe, he poſted to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſide againe; where Diſpaire made Feare ſo valiant, that ere he found cauſe of feare, hee was paſt all feare: For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing paſt he knew not how the Riuer, he was got before he wiſt into the Ship: wherein being Cabined, hee told of <hi>La Mot</hi> his fatall accident, and forced them to put to ſea, ſayling himſelfe with as many contrary thoughts, as <hi>Eolus</hi> ſent out windes vpon the Trojan Fleete. At length he arriued at <hi>Genua,</hi> where he reſted his reſtleſſe ſelfe, and where he liued, wanting but little, becauſe not deſiring much. But ſuch was his diſconſolate ſolitary life, that the Citizens (though ſtrangers) affecting the man in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, pittied much his diſtreſſe, in the ſhew of his diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. In the meane while, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> waſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in his owne implacable, and vnlimited wrath, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and ſuddainly ſeazed, and conſiſcated, all Sir <hi>Jaques</hi> Lands and Goods into his hands; impriſoning both him, and his Lady, as Fauters, Abetters, Confederates, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juters thereunto. Thus ets Outrage, euer the ſharpeſt edge vpon the firſt aduantage; And in this diſtemper of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12144:27"/>
his ill diſpoſed minde, he commanded that naught but bread and water ſhould be giuen them. For, ſaid he, where the offence is greater then the ſeruice, there Iuſtice chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the bond of recompence into due puniſhment. During this their faultleſſe impriſonment, the queſting Knights re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the Hoſpitalious Parſon, her Hoſt; who being brought before the angry <hi>Daulphin</hi> (her enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Father) ſhee ſaw the cloud a farre off, before the ſtorme fell, and therefore proſtrating her ſelfe at his Feete, ſhee required pardon for her offence, and prayed that he would not make her ſinne deadly, which was but veniall; pleading ignorance for the Prelate, and vnreſiſtable loue for her ſelfe; ſwearing and aſſuring him, by ſacrament of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oath, and the teſtimonie of her Hoſt, that ſhee was as honeſt in her flight, as ſhe was in her birth, and that her vn potted thoughts were neuer ſtayned, with any vnchaſt deede or deſire. The noble followers of the obdurate <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> ſeeing the Princeſſe waſhing her repentance in her owne teares, humbly beſought him to forget, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue her amiſſe, ſince the frailty of her offence, was rather a ſore, then a ſinne; and wounds were to be healed and not hurt. This ſubmiſſion, ſtrengthened by ſuch generall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, ſomewhat quencht the burning heate of his enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ire: And though his ſeuere Iuſtice told him, that not to puniſh an euill, was to allow of an euill; yet mercy hee knew pardons them oft, that deſerues it not, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in nature, ſhould be next a kin to fauour. Vpon this calme conſtruction (after many ſharpe rebukes, and proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed threates, he vowed that determinate, and ineuitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> puniſh her next offence) and ſo he pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her vpon promiſe of more regardfull duty.</p>
            <p>Now Sir <hi>Paris</hi> had not long ſojourned in <hi>Genua,</hi> but that mindfull of his charge, he writ to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and encloſed it in another writ to <hi>La-noua,</hi> wherein he excuſed his vnkinde departure without his priuity, and conjured him by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred lawes of true amity; to attend and follow his Lady, in all ſeruice and faſt friendſhip. <hi>La-noua</hi> glad of ſuch glad
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12144:27"/>
tydings, went in the height of his ioy to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and (after ſome complementall ſalutes) asked her, what ſhee would give to heare of her <hi>Paris. Vienna</hi> great with child with the expectation of her friends welfare, longed to be delivered with the notice of his health; and ſaid, that the whole world afforded not ſufficient worth to anſwer her liberall heart therein. <hi>La-nova</hi> ioying in the conſtancy of her love, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her the letter, which ſhee haſtily ſnatching, as haſtily read, re-read, and many times, more then many times over-read, the pleaſing contents as followeth.</p>

Such was his couetous deſire, in lieu of the <hi>Burbons</hi> poſſeſſions, not to be valued; and ſueh his conceit of his ſonnes valour, not then (as hee thought) to be equalled; ſo as his pride, could, nor would, admit of any other ſonne in law, but this great and matchleſſe Prince. The Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> glad that occaſion offered it ſelfe, that he might both gratifie the <hi>Daulphin</hi> his friend, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt himſelf in the loue &amp; greatneſſe of the <hi>Burbon</hi> Duke, which he had loue deſired; was now as willing as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, that is euer ready to pleaſure another, to profit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And knowing, that he that ſleepeth, catcheth no Fiſh; he went inſtantly to the Duke, who no ſooner herd of the motion, but glorying in the hope of ſuch vnexpected aduancement, he entertained the Earle with all the ſtate, that either greatneſſe could performe, or deſire require. In concluſion, the <hi>Burbon</hi> Duke ſent his ſonne, in the greateſt pride of proudeſt ſtate, to the <hi>Daulphins</hi> Court, where he did proportion his carriage anſwerable to the eminencie of his place; his merits being ſuch, and ſo many, that (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely aſide his pride of heart) <hi>Enuie</hi> her ſelfe, could not detract from his worth. But before he came to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> hearing of his neere approach, went to his daughter, and told her what tender care he had of her good, how hee had laboured to make the <hi>Burbon</hi> Prince, her glorious Groome. and how happy ſhe might thinke her ſelfe, to bee beſtowed on ſo great and famous a Lord. One, whom the world admires for his heroicall fortitude; feares for his greatneſſe; and loues for his deſerts. A Prince incomparable by title and birth: A perſon beautified by Nature; And a man inricht with wiſedome, wealth, and worthineſſe. Then let my Choyſe be thy content, and in thy full conſent ſee that thou entertaine him with all vertuous fauours. This ſaid, he commanded to horſe, not ſtaying her anſwer, and ſo rid forth royally attended, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12144:29"/>
appointed, to receiue the young Prince. And farre he had not rid, but that he met, and encountred with his long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and now expected gueſt. The young Prince firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting from his Horſe, gaue the <hi>Daulphin</hi> occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount himſelfe, who being on foote, ſtayed till the Prince came unto him; where they greeted, re-greeted, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced each other, and then remounting themſelves, they rid Marſhalled in right good equipage to the Pallace, where all the Ladies (ſaving <hi>

But the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> miſſing <hi>Vienna,</hi> miſliked much her abſence, yet ſeemed to take no notice of it, but ſmoothing the angry furrowes of his diſcontentment, he (with an inforced cheerefulnes) brought the Prince to his lodging, and there leaving him to his private repoſe; hee haſtily went to <hi>Viennas</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where all ſad, and ſolitary, he found her ſitting in the ſeate of ſorrow, or rather in the ſhade of death, for feare of her fathers provoked ire; whoſe violent, and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diſpoſition, would (ſhe knew) tranſport him beyond all the bounds of Natures tenderneſſe.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſta.</hi> And therefore had ſhe ſo ſeparated her ſelfe a ſide, becauſe ſhe would not give fire to his fancie, nor wrong his better deſerts with forlorne deſires. In conſideration whereof, ſhe humbly prayed, that none but her ſelfe might enioy her ſelfe, ſince none but her ſelfe could, or ſhould content her ſelfe. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> perceiving light through a ſmall crevis, began in milde pollicy, by gentle entreaties, and rich perſwaſions, to weane her from her will; telling her, that vnlawfull vowes were to be violated; ſince the firſt cauſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12144:29"/>
ceaſing and a new ſucceeding, both might be altered; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſhe any ſuch power in her ſelfe, that was not to be diſpoſed of by a Father; And to honour, and obey Parents, is the firſt Commandement that hath any reward promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on earth. Beſides, it is an enuious wrong to Nature, to ſuffer her faireſt worke (like a ſweet fragrant odoriferous Roſe) to dye vpon the ſtocke; that being pluckt in the bloome, might yeeld both pleaſure, and profit to others: therefore renounce this beliefe, if thou meaneſt to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or to haue any fauour. For by courſe of kinde all thinges were made to increaſe; and by increaſe to benefit another; and ſhe is a Diuell amongſt men, that profiteth no man. This did the <hi>Daulphin</hi> thinke by his ſmooth words, to build a Caſtle in the ayre, that had no hope of foundation on the earth. For <hi>Viennas</hi> vnremoueable reſolution, being bent to ſhoote at her firſt marke, could not be wonne to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell at another ayme; which made the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> (failing (like a Foxe) to deceiue with kindneſſe) to play now the Lyon by compulſion; And therefore gnaſhing his teeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for anger (like the Sea that waxeth mad, when the windes doe rage) he commanded both her and <hi>Jzabella</hi> to cloſe priſon.</p>
            <p>The young Prince meruailing beyond all meaſure, that he could not ſee amiable <hi>Vienna,</hi> the eye of <hi>France,</hi> the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of her ſex, the wonder of time, and the pride of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; demanded of her Father, what ominous cloud ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed the brightneſſe of <hi>France</hi> his ſecond Sunne, that ſhe appeared not in her all-admired glory. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt he ſhould diſtaſt the Prince, by vnderſtanding the matter; framed, and faigned this excuſe. That ſickneſſe had attached her, and made her a priſoner to her bed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayed his patience awhile, till bee hoped recouery might better pleaſe his fancy. The young Prince holding his words for Oracles, held himſelfe contented, and thought to weare and weary out the wearineſſe of time, with otehr Courtly, and more Knightly ſports; wherein hee was ſo fortunate, that <hi>Fame</hi> was the Herauid of his Heroicall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12144:30"/>
deedes. This did ſo enflame the loue of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, that no eye-water could euer after quench the ſame; Deſert did now double his deſire; and his deſire had no end, in gayning his daughters conſent, which he againe now vainely laboured: Sometimes laying before her the Riches, Glory, and Dignities of <hi>Iuno:</hi> ſometimes painting forth the Honour, Reſpect, and Happineſſe, ſhee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by ſuch another <hi>Hector;</hi> and then pleading the ſweet content, that growes by enjoying ſo pleaſing and compleat a Prince. But when he found his waſted wordes dye in their owne ſound, and all his hopes vtterly ſhipwrackt: his better conſideration was then forfeited further to hate, and rancour; then either nature, or pitty, could redeeme it. Then began he to thunder out fearefull threats, cruell chaſtments, and moſt inſupportable miſeries. Commanding the Keeper (in his ouer-awfull juſtice) that ſad ſolitarineſſe ſhould onely attend her impriſonment, and that eager hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould daily waite on her Table, and ſo he departed, hopeleſſe of reclayming her, and therefore reſolued to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten her obſtinacie, with all ſeuerity. But</p>

            </q>
            <p>The young Prince hauing now ſpent many dayes, and not ſeene her, whom onely he came to viſite; importuned the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> that he might but viſite her both to comfort her in her malady, and ſomewhat to ſatisfie his ſtarued eyes, in their more then greedy deſires. But the doubling <hi>Daulphin</hi> pleaded her miſlike ſo to be ſeene; aſſuring him, that ſhee daily requeſted, that he (whom ſhe onely vpon ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port entirely affected (ſhould not in any caſe ſee her ſo ſore impaired. So great (ſaid bee) is her care to ſeeme pleaſing vnto you, ſuch her ſhamefaſtneſſe at firſt ſo to bee ſeene of you. And therefore let me entreat your further patience, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

In the meane time ſalute in my name, your thrice noble royall Father, and tell him, that I hold my ſelfe ſo much honoured, in his deſired affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that my ſelfe, and what is the <hi>Daulphins,</hi> reſts wholly at his pleaſure: and further, pray him that the lawfull cauſe of this unwilling ſtay, may ſtand for ſatisfaction till better payment. The young Prince thus ſmoothed up with words of faireſt dye, held himſelfe well appeaſed, though not throughly pleaſed; and holding the <hi>Daulphins</hi> words for written verity, hee implored the firme continuance of his found favours, and proteſted kindneſſes; and ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe to the good grace of his adored Lady; he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and friendly tooke his leave, and returned to <hi>Burbon.</hi> The Prince departed: The <hi>Daulphin,</hi> who had no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morce then the cruell Iudge hath mercy; gave in charge, that no one ſhould viſite, or repaire to his Daughter, but onely <hi>Monſieur Maux,</hi> a right Saturniſt by nature, and an unrelenting Tyrant in life, him hee commanded (under paine of death) to give her nothing but bread, and the worſt wine, twiſe a day; which this enemy of vertue, and ſtaine of all mankinde, ſo barbarouſly performed, that his cruell uſage too ſoone impared poore <hi>Vienna,</hi> and diſtreſſed <hi>Izabella</hi> who had unkindly, and untimely pined, and periſhed in that loathſome ſolitary priſon, had not <hi>La-nova</hi> found out a meanes (as hereafter ſhall be ſhowne) to ſuccour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them.</p>
            <p>But now the <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> who had many times waſhed her aged face, in the teares of her conſuming griefe for her afflicted Childe, having neither knowledge of any meanes to relieve her, nor hope of her delivery; knowing the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> to be as reſolute in his rigour, as he was abſolute in opinion: Adviſed with her neareſt friends, and obliged dependants, what was to be done in ſo deſperate and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous a caſe. Whereby the concurrance of adviſes, it was concluded, that ſhe ſhould ſend unto the <hi>Delphian</hi> Oracle, there to learne, what ſhould be done, and become of her enthralled daughter. This Counſell being embraced, and

            <p>The <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> whoſe over ſad ſurcharged heart was unable to diſgeſt ſuch heavie and bitter Cates; found this ſawce too ſharpe for her dyet. For it was no ſooner read, but that finding (as ſhee thought) all the gates of comfort ſhut up with intricate threates and impoſſibilities, (being too weake a veſſell, to beare ſo ſharpe a liquor) ſhe ſhrunke under the waight of her ſad burthen, and fell ſuddenly dead; and ſo left the <hi>Daulphin</hi> a cruell Father, and a careleſſe Widdower.</p>
            <p>This mournfull accident rather exaſperated his irefull diſpleaſure towards his daughter (in making her diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the originall cauſe of her death) then in any wiſe exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated his execrable reſolution, againſt her determined en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance. But hee had not lived many dayes in dolour, but that burying the remembrance of his deareſt ſpouſe, in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12144:31"/>
hope of future happineſſe; his obdurate heart became as unſenceable of her loſſe, as of his Daughters miſery. Love found love, and the madneſſe of age made him ſuch a ſlave unto his ſlave, that before one yeares period, he married one of his Wives meaneſt Attendants; One (who knowing her owne unworthineſſe,) having neither Vertue to ſtrengthen her fortune, nor good nature to incite her to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or goodneſſe, nor any merit to winne applauſe, was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo potent over him, that ſhe guided the ſtearne of his flinty and unpennitrable heart: And though ſhe feared the ſcorne of abiect baſeneſſe, yet to maintaine the ſtolne pride of her enhanſed heart, ſhee cunningly gave fewell to her Husbands enraged will, and covertly blew ſtill the coales of his diſpleaſure. For feare ſhee did, leaſt that her Daughters liberty ſhould (in the aſpect of true honour) cloud both her ſwelling conceited glory, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from her proud inſulting greatneſſe: To fruſtrate which, ſhe cautely one day, leaning on his breſt, and ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his froſted beard, thus ſadly ſayd.</p>
            <p>When (my deereſt Lord) I looke upon the breach of the Princeſſe, your Daughters obligation; I finde the penaltie you take, to be moſt iuſt (though ſevere;) Since the iuſt Iudger of all, did for the ſole diſobedience of onely one, caſt both him, and all his Poſteritie out of Paradice: How like unto him you ſhew your ſelfe herein, your unpartiall Iuſtice well demonſtrates, who rightfully puniſheth the ſinne of diſobedience in your owne members, as God did in his owne creatures. Iuſtice is the badge of vertue, the ſtate of peace, and maintenance of honour; and the will of a Father ſhould be a religious law unto the Child: And they that preferre theyr owne Iuſtes before theyr Parents pleaſures, looſeth the benefit both of natures right, and a Fathers regard: For reaſon would not we ſhould reſpect thoſe that forſake us: The Husbandman cuttes and loppes off all unkindly Branches from the good Vine; <hi>Jove</hi> held his Children part of his ſubſtance, of whom he did and might diſpoſe; and the noble <hi>Romans</hi> deprived their Sonnes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:12144:32"/>
of life, that infringed but theyr commaunds. I alleadge not this (moſt worthy Lord) to aggravate your Daughters foule offence, whoſe other deſerts I honour, whoſe well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare I affect, and whoſe merited puniſhment I condole; Nor yet to detract from the worth of your thriſe worthy chaſticement, which all men commend, and iuſtice allowes. But feare (of I know what) and the love of your ſafety enforceth me in love and duty, to manifeſt what I feare, and to prevent what I doubt. <hi>Vienna</hi> (you know) my endeered Lady, is the immediate apparent Heyre to this Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the uniuſt deſires that waite upon a Crowne, begets oft moſt inhumane, unnaturall, and unlawfull Acts: Nature in that expectation, looſeth her ſight. Vertue her ſtrength, Dutie her obedience, and Love her reſpect: Nothing can outballance ambitious deſire, either in the reach of dignity, or revenge; Nor is there any limitation in the adventurers. Her reſtraint is (I feare) like fire raked up in embers, that covertly will kindle, and openly burſt foorth into a flame; For the harder ſhe deemes her ſelfe handled, the more will ſhe ſeeke after her releaſe, if not after revenge; Nor can ſhe want inſtigators thereunto: Since all men like and preferre the ryſing of the Moone before the ſetting of the Sunne: And to win advancement in that hope, they will contrive, practiſe, and execute whatſoever, and howſoever: Such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions gives fire to corrupt Humoriſts; and ſuch grounds ſets repugnant Malecontents a worke. I would my death might free you from ſuch dangerous intendments, or that my life could acquit you from ſuch heavie accidents. And therewithall (her heart having taught her eyes to weepe) ſhe threw her ſelfe into his boſome, the more to endeere her ſelfe unto him, and without any ſorrow, ſhe ſighing, ſaid, Ah what ſhall become of me, when I ſhall looſe my loving Lord?</p>

Thus to nouriſh debate, after ſhe had fedde on ſlander, and inſtil'd in his eares a fearefull iealouſie, which over-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous mindes eaſily apprehends, and covetouſly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. The better to acquit her ſelfe from all ſuppoſe of malice or detraction: She weeping, told him, That the night before, her Mothers Ghoſt appeared unto her, all in white, her unſmoothed haire diſplayed about her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, her ruefull falne face pale, her eyes hollow, and in eyther hand a Taper burning dimme; which ſo affrighted her, that had ſhe not comfortably ſpoken to me, when I had no power to call to you; I had awaked you, and cryed for helpe: But ſodainely, with a feeble voyce, ſhe mildly ſaid; Feare not my Daughter, to looke upon thy Mothers harmeleſſe Ghoſt, who in tender care of thee, and thy eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord, have left my bed of reſt, to come to premoniſh thee of your enſuing ill.

With that ſhe gave a wimpe, darkeneſſe poſſeſt the place, and I lay wounded and affrighted with remembrance, both of her ſight and of her words. This Appariſion, the happy Angell of our God, (for viſions are cleere revelations, where dreames are but deluſions) hath moved me, out of an affectionate feare of you, to deliver what I ſaw, heard, and have ſaid; which otherwiſe in my love to your Princely Daughter, I would willingly have concealed. And therewithall ſhe wept againe, and kiſſing him ſaide, O hardeſt of happes, but moſt unhappy onely I, that ſhe, to whom I owe all love, and from whom I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not withdraw my devoted affections ſhould by my meanes be the more afflicted. But in my Lords love and welfare, doe I onely live, and will bury all other affects and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

And therefore imbracing her, he kiſt her oft, and oft did wipe her forced bedewed eyes, and then did kiſſe againe, and thanked her for her provident care; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving love; aſſuring her that thus warned, hee would be ever armed, and that in his daughters wedded miſeries, they would build vp both their ſecurities. And thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that a ſtrickt Watch ſhould ever guard the priſon doore, that no one (but <hi>Monſieur Maux)</hi> ſhould come, or ſend unto her.</p>

And ſo he told her how, and ſhewed her the way, the top where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he adviſed her to cover well, leaſt it ſhould be diſcryed, he undone and ſhe unſuccoured. <hi>Vienna</hi> re-embracing him for his kinde and tender regard to her, and for his true, and faſt love to them both; gave him many thankes, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreated him, to make privie enquiry of the <hi>Genua</hi> Merchants, whether they knew, or had heard of Sir <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and how he ſpent his dayes, and ſo fearing the deteſted Keepers comming. <hi>La-noua</hi> left her, to make proviſion for her.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> whoſe diſeaſed minde could not bee cured, but by the match of the <hi>Burbon</hi> Prince; thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſtill endangered, ſo long as ſhe lived unmarried, and impriſoned: His wicked wily wife, had caſt ſuch an erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous miſt over his bewitched eyes, and ſo drowned his heart in fearefull doubts, that he durſt not truſt his owne ſafety; unleſſe his harmeleſſe daughter were either made away at home, or married away farre from home. To give peace vnto theſe his diſturbed thoughts, he went unto the Caſtle to ſee whether that weakening dyet, and tedious thraldome, had well reduced her ſeduced minde; and made her of a diſobedient childe, the daughter of his will. In tryall whereof, he demanded, whether in the high, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred preheminence of a Father, he ſhould finde yet the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged duty of a childe; the which if ſhe would in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance acknowledge, and in performance willingly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his will. She ſhould be reſtored to her former eſtate,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12144:34"/>
his wonted favour, and her preeminent dignities. <hi>Vienna</hi> on humble knees, falling at his feete, required his bleſſing, and ſaide, that continued ſorrowes had ſo mortified all thoughts of affection, that onely griefe was growne to bee pleaſing to miſerable creatures; and that cuſtome had made her content to lye in her bed of woe, and to water her couch with teares: onely ſhe prayed, that the juſt God might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his ire againſt uniuſt men. But how (ſayd ſhee) ſhall my ſelfe, perſwade my ſelfe, that you meane me any good, that not onely have ſo hardly intreated mee, and ſo vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impriſoned your ſole childe; but moſt vniuſtly and cruelly have put in priſon poore Sir <hi>Iaques,</hi> that hath ſpent all his happieſt dayes in your unrewarded ſervice. It is the true property of a Prince, to reſemble Cod, in vertue, bounty, and mercy: and not the Lyon in force, rigour, and cruelty. Mercy pardoneth thoſe that deſerve it not; and the interpretation of the ſtricteſt law, ſhould rather tend to mercy, then cruelty; ſince rigorous lawes were firſt made, more to terrifie all, then to torment any. The doubtfull <hi>Daulphin</hi> finding his amiſſe, but not his remedie; ſomewhat to perſwade his daughter of his repenting rigour, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded good; commanded that Sir <hi>Jaques</hi> ſhould be ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and reſtored to his Priſten eſtate; which greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <hi>Vienna</hi> for her <hi>Paris</hi> ſake, and no little joyed good <hi>La-nova,</hi> that ſecretly had ſuccoured him. But theſe ſhewes of favour, and promiſes of preferment, nothing advantaged the <hi>Daulphin:</hi> For <hi>Vienna</hi> (ſtrengthned in the expectation of ſorrow) not obſtinately, but conſtantly tolde her father, that the <hi>Barbons</hi> love, was like a Spiders webbe, fit to bee ſwept away; and that her Virgins vowe, ſhould eternize her chaſtity after death. This reſolve, raiſed againe the ſtorme of his allayed fury; in the rage whereof, he left her, diſcovering by his threats and malitious words, the ill of his heart, as <hi>Viennas</hi> ſorrowfull ſighes ſhewed the hurt of her heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La-nova</hi> wigehing the Tyranny of the time, &amp; finding no hope of better hap, preſently writ to Sir <hi>Paris</hi> the truth of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12144:35"/>
all ſuch accidents as had befalne, his Father, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> and himſelfe; ſince the receipt of his Letter, which gave ſo freſh and ſo ſharpe an aſſault, to his already over-ſurcharged heart, that vertue was no Armour of proofe againſt ſuch affliction, but raging in the tempeſt of diſcontentment, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like an unkennelled <hi>Cerberus,</hi> then any diſtracted <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jax,</hi> hee blaſphemouſly belched and breathed out cruell oathes, vengeance, daring threates, and moſt fearefull words againſt Time, Love, Gods, and Men.</p>
            <p>O Time, ſaid hee, Traytor unto Love: O Love abuſed by Time: O Gods unjuſt to men: O Men too ſubject to the Gods. O that your Deities were eſſentiall, viſible, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, that I might hew vengeance out of your wrongs, and write Tragedies on your lives. O heavens I challenge your Throanes, and deny your powers. Your ſwift motions I will ſtay with my hand, and your revolutions I will drowne in the Sea: I will unlooſe the bonds of <hi>Orion,</hi> and ſtop the courſe of each conſtellation. The ſtraying Starres I will plucke from theyr Spheares, and with their influences will I kill all the Tyrants on the earth. Time I will conſume with my breath, and burne up Love with the Sunne. The world I will cut a ſunder with my Sword, and make a new Land in the ayre. The Waters I will ſwallow up, and bury the windes in the Moone. <hi>Jxion</hi> I will remove from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and tormenting ſeate, and ſet the <hi>Daulphin</hi> on his tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wheele, where hunger-ſtarved Vipours ſhall gnaw on his hatefull heart, and pyning <hi>Tantalus</hi> give him all his food. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> ſhall be ſole Queene of heaven, and onely rule the glorious Globe; And I will raigne in <hi>Iupiters</hi> ſtead, and throw downe fire and lightning on the curſed Caſtle that enthralls my love: I will beate that cruell <hi>Daulphin</hi> to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with thunder, that I may be revenged on Time, Love, Gods, Men, the World, the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and all for the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin.</hi> Thus diſtract in his madding moode hee all enraged, raged he knew not how, and ſaid he knew not what, pulling the Letter in pieces with his teeth, renting his Hangings, tearing his Cloathes, and breaking his Bed, Board, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12144:35"/>
Stooles, with ſuch violence, that his amazed ſervants durſt not come neere him.</p>
            <p>At this vnwonted paſſion, theyr hearts were poſſeſt with wonder, and their eyes floodded with teares; his bounty cauſing the one, and his wiſedome the other. But igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the mother of admiration: They knew not where his ſhooe did pinch him, nor could they tell how to helpe him. At laſt (as one breathleſſe in his waſted fury) hee fell upon his bed; which they ſeeing, haſtily ſtept to him, and uniting their ſtrengthes, kept him downe, making ſilence theyr preparative, to quit his tempeſtious thoughts; Then darkning the Chamber, one of them tooke a deepe baſe ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtringed Bandora, whereupon he played ſo ſweetely, and ſo dolefully, that Sir <hi>Paris</hi> hearing of it, lent a liſtning to it, which brought him into ſuch a ſad melancholly Muſe, that he began to ſlumber, &amp; after fell into a heavy ſleepe, which ſo well appeaſed the ſtorme of his diſturbed ſences, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three houres enjoying repoſed reſt; he waked, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, perfected in his minde, and aſhamed that he had ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd the Image of vertue, and abuſed his owne knowledge. Conſideration made him now hold himſelfe the ſole ſpight of Fortune, and the very ſcorne of time, and men. Detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on threatned his diſgrace, Deriſion proclaimed his folly, and the guilt of his owne ill, made him privately, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, to leave <hi>Genua,</hi> and to wander whether his ſhame ſhould not follow him, nor any heare of his being. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he departed, he both rewarded, and diſcharged all his ſervants, and paying all duties whatſoever; hee laſtly writ to <hi>La-nova</hi> and to his Father as followeth.</p>

            <p>Sir <hi>Inques</hi> having read the ſadde contents of his Sonnes reſolved laſt farewell, fainted under the burden of his ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable griefe, but revived and comforted by <hi>La-nova,</hi> that was himſelfe to be comforted, he betooke himſelfe unto his carefull bedde; where though his attached tongue could pay no tribute to his dumbe ſorrow, yet did his ſilent woes, ſhewe his ſpeaking griefe. Such was his woe, that it was a woe, to ſee his woe: In ſomuch, that <hi>La-nova,</hi> ſwolne with his owne griefe, was ready to burſt; to ſee his ſorrow; And therefore, having neither temperance to cover the one, nor a heart to looke upon the other; he returned to his erected Chappell, where he pierſt the very Heavens, for the preſervation of his Friend, and powred forth his Prayers for his returne. This done, he held himſelfe undone, in ſo ineſtimable a loſſe: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and ſadde meditating with himſelfe, he fearefully went to acquaint <hi>Vienna,</hi> that all their ſorrowes might be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12144:37"/>
compleate at once: Her he found all penſive and heavie, as one preſaging her further miſhap; and no ſooner ſhe ſaw him, but that drawing forth the true portracture of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, out of his carefull countenance, ſhe haſtily, yet feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, demaunded, what newes? The Heavens Madam (ſayd <hi>La-nova)</hi> grant you patience, and more comfortable newes. <hi>Vienna</hi> agaſt, gaſtly asked, if <hi>Paris</hi> then were dead? Not dead he ſaid, and yet departed. Departed, ah ſaid <hi>Vienna,</hi> how, whether, or to whom? from life to death, or from me to a cauſeleſſe change? If dead, why live I then? If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, why then dead to me? Say, ſay <hi>La-nova,</hi> where lives, or lyes my <hi>Paris?

But after her full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, her remembrance then recording, how all her nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed woes had begot many croſſes, that miſerably fell upon her like haile-ſtones, that ſtrives to overtake one another; ſhe could not refraine, but thus bewailed her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>What fault of mine, cruell and unkind, hath cauſed thus thy cauſeleſſe flight? Is this, ah this, and woe is me in this, the hoped harveſt of devoted Love?

O that I had never ſeene thee, whom yet I wiſh to ſee; or ſeeing thee, had never affected thee, whom ever I moſt affect: My hap is hard, that can neither have, nor hope; and the fault I finde in my ſelfe, followes me ſtill, whiles death doth follow me.

the onely Daughter of ſorrow, and the caſhiered Childe of diſgrace?

Why then doe I live longer in dolour, ſince my preordinate life is predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to a dolent death?

            <p>Theſe laſt wordes, ſo ſore appaled <hi>La-nova,</hi> that iealous of her weakneſſe (her enfeebled eſtate, being unable to ſupport her oppreſſing and confounding ſorrowes) hee much feared (leaſt overcome with griefe and paſſion) ſhee ſhould yeeld to miſchiefe her miſery: To prevent which, he buried, for the time, all his owne griefe, in the heedfull care of her ſafety; and cloſely wiping his bedewed eyes, he began, Paſtor-like, to Preach patience, Faith, Hope, and Comfort, to her ſad diſmayed Soule. Let not (ſaid he, I beſeech your Excellence) any ſiniſter croſſe, chance, or mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine affaires, overthrow, or oppreſſe, the lively force of your requiſite Faith: Nor let any puſalimity weaken the wonted courage of your prudent minde; but build your Faith and hope on him, who as <hi>Roy,</hi> royall, rules and over-rules all chances and accidents, that befalles humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Then embrace not a miſchiefe, to prevent an ill; ſince God ſends good for evill, as he made light out of darkeneſſe, <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in priſon, before he could be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and the <hi>Jſraelites</hi> were in bondage, before they could come into <hi>Canaan,:</hi> You ſee your ſoare, but not your ſalue: Though with <hi>Job</hi> you lye now in aſhes, yet when with <hi>Iob,</hi> you be tryed, there ſhall be no more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes left to afflict you, then there were ſores left to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him: For as the power of God is above our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; So doth his ſuccours and comforts, come quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

to our hopes: To him therefore referre all things, and in him onely repoſe your ſelfe; and be you aſſured, that in the aſſurance of your better truſt, you ſhall finde comfort unexpected, and hope well rewarded. Croſſes (your Grace knowes) are but-touch ſtones, to try our patience; and patience is both a vertue and the true Phyſitian of diſtreſſe: And in managing of affection and affliction, is the true proofe of diſcretion: To overcome an other, is the guift of Fortune; but to vanquiſh our owne willes, is the true proofe of wife courage, and a glory proper to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe (ſaid <hi>

Yet time (ſayd <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova)</hi> heales griefes, by killing of cares. Nay, Time (ſhee replyed) is rather a devourer of our expectations, then a Chyrurgion to heale or ſoares: For all men takes pleaſure to come to theyr journyes end before they be wearie; and our teeming hopes, would ever be delivered of a gratious Birth. Yet be you Madame (he reanſwered) as you ſhould be, if not as you would be, ſince it will be as it is; and with ſome ſweete deceit, exile theſe ſower conceits. Alaſſe, (ſayd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna)</hi> how can ſowre conceites, entertaine ſweet deceites? ſince preſent deceites, are ſtill my ſowreſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites: Your Phyſicke <hi>La-nova,</hi> is good, but my diſeaſe is deſperate: For patience without comfort, brings perill of conſumption; and they are alwayes unpatient Martyrs, that are puniſhed uniuſtly: my griefe was at the higheſt before, and now like ſwelling <hi>Nilus,</hi> it diſdaineth bounds. Deceive not your ſelfe, ſaid <hi>La-nova,</hi> his endeered Love, not broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your miſery; and not his fraud, never knowne to any, with his killing diſpayre (the bloody butcher of all hopes contentments) hath forced thus his further flight: And for probation thereof, reade heere his Letter, which he ſent me; and doubt you not Madame, but when after-times ſhall make him finde the error of his amiſſe, and that his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12144:38"/>
wounded hope ſhall be healed with better thoughts; that then (finding with the ſicke man, that the ſhifting of his Bedde, alters not his diſeaſe,) he will then, I ſay, returne in his repentance, and make inquiſition after your welfare. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> taking and peruſing the Letter, and ſwallowing up the contents, with contentment, was overcome aſmuch, with kinde, and affectionate griefe, as before ſhe was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with cold care and diſtaſt, of his ſuppoſed flying fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: Inſomuch, that waſhing a new her face, in the balmy droppes of her love-diſtilling teares, ſhe laide her hands on his ſhoulder, and ſighing ſayd; O pardon, <hi>La-nova,</hi> my offenſive offence, Sweet <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſo ere thou art, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my amiſſe: I was, I am, and will be, ſtill the ſame, and ever thine. Thus having ſurfeited in her owne ſorrow, ſhe purged heriealous conceite, and in the comfort of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant love, ſhe layd her downe on her weeping bed, where <hi>La-nova</hi> left her, to reſt her reſtleſſe thoughts.</p>
            <p>By this time, the Moone ſeven times had ſhowne her ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt face, and as many times loſt the ſplendor of he light. When the Prince of <hi>Burbon,</hi> deſirous to ſee the Emperious Miſtreſſe of his enthralled heart, taking humble leave of his Father, ſecretly poaſted to <hi>

whoſe drift, and deſire was, to beſtowe his Daughter on none but him; and that he had baniſhed ambitious and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datious Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> for his over-proud and preſumptious love. But ſuch (ſaid he) hath beene, and is ſtill, her perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent frowardneſſe, and moſt obſtinate diſobedience therein, that in injuſtice, I have iuſtly impriſoned her, not ſo much for her degenerate breach of duty, (though not to reſtraine an ill, is to maintaine an ill) as to bring her to yeeld to your fancy: But overhardened in her willfull conceit, ſhee reſts no leſſe careleſſe of her endurance. then reſolved in her wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe; for which, I alſo have deprived her of her glory, and comfort; ſworne her continuall thraldome, and pray the continuance of your good opinion, and amitie.</p>
            <p>The young Prince aſtoniſhed at the ſtrangeneſſe of the caſe, wondred greatly at the cauſe: Yet flattering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, with ſelfe-conceite of his more worthy worthineſſe; He earneſtly intreated the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> that he might make ſome tryall, what himſelfe could doe for himſelfe.

               <hi>Vienna</hi> foretold of his comming, had before, gotten by <hi>La-nova's</hi> meanes, a Capon, whoſe diſmembred Legges, ſhe cloſely had tyed under the holes of her naked Armes, that there, with heate putrifying, they might the ſooner cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and unſavery, ſmell the ſtronger. The young Prince comming to the doore, knockt, and demaunded for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna:</hi> Who comming, and ſeeing him ſo richly cladde, and in ſo glorious an eſtate, bluſht out ſuch beauty, that her very Eyes ſeem'd a fayre Temple, wherein Love and Beauty ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves: Yet diſſembling her knowledge of him, ſhe asked what he was, and would. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennas</hi> Friend, (hee ſayd) and <hi>Viennas</hi> Love I would. My Friend, (ſayd ſhe) oh Friendleſſe, name I Friend? that live exempt from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12144:39"/>
Friends: My Love, why name I Love? that onely love to live here unbeloved.</p>
            <p>The young Prince (whoſe liſtening eares, were well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſweete harmony of her well tuned words; and whoſe liking Eyes, were raviſhed with the ſight of her perfections,) was ſo perplexed betwixt new conceived deſires, and diſdaine to be diſdained; that not knowing what to ſay, he ſtood like one that had loſt himſelfe; not reall in ſence, but as a faire Flower, nipt with the morning froſt, hanging downe his head, as moſt ſorry, for his decly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning glory: In this diſpaire, the remembrance of his owne greatneſſe, and the conceite of his owne merits, gave ſuch quickning life to his mortified thoughts, and ſuch free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to his impriſoned tongue, that boldly, and plainely, he told her, who he was, why, and for what he came. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> pleading ignorance for the error of her careleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, humbled her ſelfe, with thankefull acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his more worthy worthineſſe: But ſuch (ſaid ſhe) is the obligation of my decreed chaſtity, that nought but death ſhall breake the bond. Why Madame (replyed the Prince) in ſo doing, you wrong Nature, in clouding the brightneſſe of her Sunne, deprive the world of more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious light, neglect your duty, in diſaſſenting from your Fathers will, wound my deſires with forlorne hopes, and rob your ſelfe, both of propagating pleaſure, ſweeteſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and greateſt glory: Then leave theſe iniurious walles, and change your Priſon (unfitting your Perſon) for a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace prepared for a Princeſſe; In aſſurance whereof, accept moſt renowned Ladie, this Pledge of my Faith, wherein is charactered, the Life of my Love, and the Love of my Soule; and therewith,</p>

               <l>That pirec'd by Dart, did bleed; and mercy crave.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This was ſo Artificially made, and cut; that the falling drops did ſeeme to mourne, and pleade for pittie, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12144:40"/>
them, was engraven; <hi>Viennas helpe.</hi> This he gaue, and this ſhe gave againe; ſaying, that by gifts, wee make our ſelves Lords; but by taking, ſlaves: I will not make a Prince ſervile, nor can you make a priſoner proud: Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is a meere ſtranger to affection; and Iewels of price doe not befit a miſerable thrall. Then let your owne gift (replyed the Prince) make you a Queene, and me your ſlave. My fortunes (ſaid <hi>Vienna)</hi> admits of no ſuch Soveraignety; and your Greatneſſe is too potent for a Vaſſall. I am too poore to give; and it ſtands not with a Lord to begge; then be you ſtill a King in your owne thoughts, and I will reſt content with my Fate. Why, Kings (anſwered the Prince) have no priviledge in Love: and the Gods themſelves were ſubject to beauty. <hi>Vienna</hi> conſtant in her chaſte pretence, ſeeing his earneſt proſecution, and being wearied with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, becauſe loathing ſuch conference, held it good pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to prevent his further importunity, And therefore ſhe briefely and plainely told him, that ſhe was not for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor his honour for her humour. For know (ſhe wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſaid) that the long cold and grievous impriſonment, which indurable, I have yet endured, hath ſo corrupted and putrified my impared body; that the very ſtench thereof offendeth, and endangereth the ſmall (yet tedious) remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my loathed life. For proofe whereof, ſhee bearing her breaſts, bad him feele, what infectious ſent her ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and dying fleſh yeelded; which he no ſooner did, but that hee was neere ſtifled with the ſmell. The enflamed Prince, thus cooled in his hot purſuites, found his thoughts now freer from affection, then hee deemed his body ſound from infection. Such was the choaking ſavour, that ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his queaſie ſtomacke, that comforting her for faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſake, hee made a briefe concluſion, and there left both her, and his love, that earſt would have dyed for love. <hi>Vienna</hi> well appayed in acquitting her ſelfe of ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and hurtfull a ſuitor, returned to <hi>Jzabella;</hi> and ſighing out a ſmile, tolde her, how ſhee had deceived the Prince; whereat ſhee ioyed no little, and concluded thereby, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12144:40"/>
womens pregnant wits, in all caſes of ſodaine extremities, pre-excelled mens moſt ſapient heads. The Prince thus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, acquainted the <hi>Daulphin</hi> with the circumſtance of the matter; which nothing mooved his Tygars heart; which the Prince condemning, held it no ſecurity to ſtay with a Tyrant: and therefore ſtriking ſayle, in ſo threatning a tempeſt, he tooke his thankefull farewell of him, and all his Knights, and ſo returned to <hi>Burbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Sir <hi>Paris</hi> had by this time, recovered the bounds of Turky, where fearing the innate, and inveterated malice of thoſe barbarous Infidels againſt Chriſtians. To diſpierce that threatning cloud, that might ſhower downe miſchiefe on his harmeleſſe head; Hee made pollicy his guyde, and craft his Councellour; And being a great Artiſt, and well learned in the ſecrets of Nature; He caſt an Artificiall black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe all over him, and tranſnominated his name by turning his name backeward, he Chriſtned himſelfe <hi>Sirap,</hi> an <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi> borne.</p>
            <q>
               <l>For who in forraigne place, will ſafely live, and credit winne,</l>

            </q>
            <p>Thus with indefatigable paines he travailed, unregarded of all, and not ſuſpected of any, unto <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> where having knowledge of the Greeke tongue, hee coverſed with the meaneſt of eſtate, the better to preſerve his owne eſtate. And it happened, (and happily happened) that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, Fortune-like of his foe, became his friend. For walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day into the fields, accompanied with none, but with his owne troubled thoughts, hee encountred by adventure with the <hi>Sultans</hi> chiefe Faulkner, who returning from Hawking, bare on his hand a goodly fayre Faulcon, ſo dangerouſly hurt, that there reſted no hope of helpe. <hi>Sirap</hi> (for ſo now muſt we call him) ſeeing the Hawke hang her bruiſed wings, and all blooded on her fluttered breaſt, being Artificially cunning, and naturally affecting the game; pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied the chance, and boldly ſtepping to him, ask'd in Greeke,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12144:41"/>
how it happened. The Faulkner neere dead, to ſee his Hawke almoſt dead; ſadly tolde him, that flying at the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, his Hawke lying at height of higheſt pitch, made ſo forceable a ſtouping on the riſing Fowle, that in her ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fall, ſhe nere gorg'd her ſelfe on a broken bough, that grewe amongſt other branches, upon the Grovie banke. Such ſaid <hi>Sirap,</hi> is the fortune of the field; but what will you give, if I recover your Hawke; any thing (ſaid the Faulkner) for that <hi>Solimon,</hi> the great <hi>Sultan,</hi> doth prize her for her high flying, before any City in <hi>Greece:</hi> Then <hi>Sirap</hi> undertaking it, gathered certaine powerfull hearbs, of inward, and unknowne vertue, and bought other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarie materials; and ſo carefully applyed his expert skill, that in ſhort time he healed, and perfected the ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered Hawke. The Faulkner admiring at his skill (for ignorance is the mother of admiration) in the ioy of his thoughts, went, and brought his recovered Hawke unto <hi>Solimon,</hi> and recounted unto him, how that a ſtranger, an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> borne, that called himſelfe <hi>Sirap,</hi> had effected that cunning Cure; and that he was a man ſo exquiſite in all proportion, and of ſo goodly, and majeſticall a preſence, that hee ſeemed not onely to bee of an Heroicall heart, but alſo promiſed more then was uſually in a man. The <hi>Sultan</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his Hawke, and well pleaſed with his deſcription, held his requiſite cunning in great regard; and his ſervice more neceſſary then others: And therefore hee inſtantly ſent for him; who no ſooner came, but that liking his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he graced him with his good countenance, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what he was, and what occaſion brought him into that Region. <hi>Sirap,</hi> whoſe Courtly demeanour, might well warrant his behaviour, and in whoſe face, was ſtampt the true Character of honour, with humble boldneſſe told him, that he was of no great lineage, nor lively-hood, yet gentle borne; but ſo ſubject to the deſtinies diſpleaſure, that not brooking his fatall infelicity, hee ſecretly had left the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt South of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> adioyning to the Deſerts of <hi>Libia,</hi> his Native ſoyle, to ſeeke content elſe-where in forraigne
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12144:41"/>
Nations, And after, ſaid <hi>Sirap,</hi> I had long with tedious tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile paſt the hote, and whole Clymate of <hi>Affricke,</hi> having no other companinion then my minde, nor no other ſervant then my tongue: I was at length by the guide of Fortune, conducted into this part of <hi>Greece,</hi> where my thoughts wing'd with deſire, to ſee the moſt great, and mightieſt Monarch on the earth, brought me to this your imperiall ſeate. The <hi>Sultan</hi> pleaſed, with his pleaſing, and well cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched words (grew deſirous of his ſervice) and therefore according to the nature of his pride (appropriating to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe authority over all) he Imperiouſly commanded him to attend his perſon: To which, though <hi>Sirap</hi> knew, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials to ſuch abſolute Potentates, were held for capitall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: yet he thus reverently and boldly anſwered. If, ſaid he, any poore endeavours of mine (moſt high and mighty Emperour) may be but pleaſing to your Greatneſſe, I ſhall then thinke my ſelfe moſt happy, when I ſhall find my ſelfe able to doe you any agreeable ſervice. But if in any wiſe your unmatchable Maieſty, ſeeke ſo to tye me to your will, that of neceſſity I muſt follow your fancy: Then muſt I (not offending your magnificence) deeme both your higheſt Highneſſe, uniuſt; and hold your Law, no Law, becauſe grounded on neceſſity. The <hi>Saltan</hi> wondring at his bolde and diſcreet anſwere, and liking his noble and generous ſpirit, highly eſtimated him, according to the vertue of his courage; that could; and durſt, with ſuch prudent bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and circumſpect feare, except againſt his never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troled pleaſure: And therefore allowing his reaſons for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; hee freely graunted him more then the full prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of a free priviledged Travailer; and ſetting greatneſſe and the law of his will aſide; he gently entreated him, but to make ſome ſtay in his Court, and hee would mount his fortunes, by his extended favours.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thus workes our Starres; by meanes, moſt ſmall.</l>
               <l>That things fore-doom'd, by Fate, may fall.</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:12144:42"/>
For <hi>Sirap,</hi> being thus rarely, and royally entreated, and entertained with the <hi>Sultans</hi> unknowne, and unuſuall favors and requeſts; wholly humbled himſelfe at his command; and ſaid, that albeit, hee had vowed continuall Pilgrimage to ſundry Regions; yet would he in ſome ſort, yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his will, and diſpence for a time with his conſcience, becauſe hee would not oppoſe, nor reſiſt the pleaſure of his will, nor the command of his potent power. The <hi>Sultan</hi> glad of his graunt, gave one of his <hi>Basſhas</hi> in charge, that he ſhould be prouided for at his diſpences; who preſently placed him next to the houſe, where the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, but newly arrived, was lodged.</p>
            <p>Now amongſt the Ambaſſadors followers, there was one that farre exceeded all the reſt, in huge height, incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtrength, and great proportion, inſomuch that the Turkes did with wonder admire his ſtature, and deemed his <hi>Sampſon-like</hi> force, beyond the power of men. This grim and inſatiating Tartar (who ſerv'd no other God, but his will; nor obſerv'd no other law, but his luſt) being one day left behinde, to mannage ſome affaires in the houſe, when the reſt were gone to the Court; ſuddainly, and moſt rudely ſeazed upon a young Damoſell, that as unfortunately as unadviſedly, was come to ſee the proviſion, and manner of theſe Strangers. Her (without any ſhew of good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, or kinde uſage) with a facile force he carried into a Chamber, and diſverginated her; notwithſtanding her ſhrill cryes, that call'd in many (but too late) to her ayde. This vnt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>med beaſt, or rather infernall devill, finding himſelfe oppreſt with multitudes, grewe ſo enraged, that his wrath had no meane, neither did his interrupted fury, admit of any conſideration, but dreadleſſe both of Law and danger, place, and people: hee threw all to the earth, that came neere to him, endeavouring ſtill to retaine his prey, which made the out-cryes of all ſo great; That <hi>Sirap</hi> being in his Chamber, at the noyſe thereof, ruſhed in with his peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſword, and finding him carrying the bemoaning Mayde, in an unmannerly manner from them, towards another
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12144:42"/>
Chamber, he ſo powerfully ſmote him on the face with his diſpleaſed hand, that force, perforce, he was forc'd to leave his hold, and betake him to his angry Semitar, with which hee furiouſly aſſaulted him. But <hi>Sirap</hi> (who held it a great fault, not to doe a good thing well) readily returned him vnwelcome intereſt, for his ſo willing leave. Long did they worke on each other, like tempeſts on a Shippe, and the bloud of both, did well ſhew, that neither of them were well pleaſed: None durſt come neere them, till that <hi>Killer Aaga,</hi> Captaine of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> hearing of this tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and debatefull ſtrife, came in, and ſtayed the fight.</p>
            <p>The Damoſels Father, and friends, (ſtanding upon theyr ſtrength of teſtimony) purſued the outrage, by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt the Tartar, and required of <hi>Solimon</hi> the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Law. The Tarter (countenancing himſelfe under the protection of Potency and Ambaſſagie) pleaded the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his place, and ſaid, That he was lyable to theyr or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; nor ſubiect to any but to his owne Lord, the Emperour: who in Maieſty, might, and merit, farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted all other Potentates of the world, and therupon offered in open Court Combat, thundering out defiance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all, that but durſt averre the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solimon</hi> much diſtaſting his ungoverned pride, and worſe diſieſting his barbarous outrage, and offenſive contempt: did inwardly fret that no one durſt attempt to quench, nor allay the prodigall heate of his fooliſh fire; and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how otherwiſe to correct his inſolence, ſince Kings ſhould ever ſhew themſelves rather juſt, then great: and the law of Nations (which is the ſtate of peace, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of honour) did warrant his tryall by Combat; hee at laſt thus deliberately concluded: That the 20. day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſhould be ready Armed at all aſſayes, and mounted like a Knight, to make that good with his ſword, which he ſo arrogantly, and over-audatiouſly had delivered with his tongue. And if there came not any one then to chaſtiſe his folly, and correct him for his brutiſh, and iniurious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, that then he ſhould be free from touch, both of law
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:12144:43"/>
and life. This being rumoured abroad, came to <hi>Siraps</hi> eares, who grieving to looſe opportunity, as one that thirſted after occaſion, both to ſhew his courage in honourable revenge, and to doe <hi>Solimon</hi> ſome commendable ſervice; though his reſolution was a ſufficient Armour for the encounter, yet knowing that naked valour, could promiſe no ſucceſſe where Armed force did aſſaile: his greateſt feare was, leaſt for want of Armour, and furniture, others would cut the graſſe from under his feete, and ſo deprive him both of favour and fortune. But this couragious feare, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by the timorous feare of all others, that feelingly feared ſuch deſperate and deadly attempts, as promiſed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hap, nor hope of good ſucceſſe. At length the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, and all things in order, came <hi>Solimon</hi> with his <hi>Sultanneſſe,</hi> attended with his <hi>Vice-royes, Beglerbegs,</hi> and <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaes</hi> in great Royalty, and 2000. Armed men for his Guard, and in the place of tryall aſſigned, he ſeated himſelfe and his <hi>Sultaneſſe</hi> upon a glorious Throane within his Imperiall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villion; great was the preſſe, and many the people, that wayted on the iſſue hereof: when ſuddainly the ſound of Trumpet ſhewed the neere approach of the Tartar: who (in honour of his earthly God, the ſonne of the light, the terrour of men, and for the repute of his Country) came with his ſword drawne, accompanied with the Ambaſſador and all his followers, moſt richly furniſhed. The Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant himſelfe being mounted on a couragious Horſe, his Capariſons, and other his furniture, all of purple Sattin, embroydered with gold all over, with diſmembred heads, armes, and ſevered legges of ſlaughtered men, be prinkled all with blood. And in his Shield hee over-gloriouſly bare his owne picture, naked; holding a Combating Lyon, ſtifled by the throat with his hand, and vnderneath was written, WHAT NOT: In this terrifying equipage, he ſtayed at the Barriers of the Lyſts, untill the Officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for that ſervice, demanded what he was, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came; who anſwered, that hee was <hi>Turbulent the fierce,</hi> the invincible Tartar, that came to proove by his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12144:43"/>
ſword, that he being onely ſubject to the greateſt Monarch on earth (who had no equall) ought not to vndergoe the cenſure of any other inferiour power, and thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded entrance; which being permitted, hee put vp his ſword, and was conducted to the vpper end of the Lyſts, where lighting, he was ſeated in a rich Chaire, ſuitable to his Baſſes, to repoſe himſelfe in: Neere vnto which, was pitch'd a moſt ſtately Tent for the Ambaſſador, and his Trayne. Then the Herauld was commanded to ſummon the Defendant by ſound of Trumpet, but no one appeared, which made <hi>Solimon</hi> fearefull of diſgrace. Then he ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſecond time, but no one preſented himſelfe: which made the proud Tartar (in arrogancie of his redoubted pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſance) to ſtand vp, and drawing his terrified ſword, hee brandiſhed it ouer his head, in ſuch tryumphing and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring manner, that the great <hi>Sultan</hi> ſeeing his inſulting pride, could ſcarce containe himſelfe within himſelfe. Then as the Herauld founded his laſt ſummons, a lowly Hermit, clad all in gray, leaning on a ſtaffe of Ebony, ſtayed him with his other hand, and required, that hee might ſpeake with <hi>Solimon</hi> the Emperour; who being brought before him, bowed himſelfe thrice before him, and then prayed in zeale of juſtice, and for the honour of the Turkiſh Empire, he might haue Horſe, and Armour, to tame that vnciuill and vntutored Tartar, whoſe pride, hee ſaid, was not ſo high, but that <hi>Vengeance</hi> did ſit aboue it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> glad that any one durſt, and would in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vndertake, ſo great and fearefull a hazard; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that preſently he ſhould be withdrawne, and brought to his Armoury, and there at his choyſe be Arm'd, &amp; moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as his proper Champion; which was no ſooner ſaid, but that the Hermit being attended on thither, tooke (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the view of all) one of the largeſt, and one that fitted his owne conceit beſt: wherewith being Armed, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he ſhewed himſelfe at the Barriers end of the Lyſt, in a bright Azure Armour, like vnto the skie, with a halfe Moone in the midſt, both before, and behinde: His Baſſes,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12144:44"/>
Caparizons, and other furniture waved like a Sea, full of ſilver Fiſhes, that ſeemed as he rid, to ſtirre; and play under ſo bright a Planet. On his Shield hee had a Ship, ſtayed (in the midſt of a Sea) by a little Fiſh, called <hi>Remora;</hi> and his impreſſe was, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertue, not force.</hi> As thus hee ſtood looking for entrance, The appointed Officers, demaunded what he was, and wherefore hee came, who anſwered, that he was a Man of peace, a devout Hermite, and one of the leaſt of the moſt humbleſt Servants of Great <hi>Soliman;</hi> Who for the love of Honour, and to honour his Lord, came to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove that the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Turkie,</hi> was a greater and a more Emperiall, and a more magnificent Monarch, then the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Emperour, and much more renowned in his perſon; And that <hi>Turbulents</hi> ſhamefull, and criminall offence, was puniſhable (by all Nationall lawes) where the fault was committed; and this he would make good on his body, and deſired to enter the Lyſts. Vpon this, all the Turkes gave a great ſhowt, and cryed God, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> for the <hi>Hermit:</hi> And ſo putting up his Sword, hee was conducted by one of the <hi>Basſhaes</hi> to the other end of the Lyſts, where diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe, hee was ſeated in a rich Chayre of State, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought with halfe Moones in ſilver, and ſet with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Stones. During theyr ſmall repoſe, the elected Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers viewed theyr Armes, and theyr Armours, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were of equall length, and that there were no wrong done to Chivalry: and then the chiefe Herauld pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that no one vnder paine of death ſhould enter the Lyſts, but the Officers appoynted to the ſervice, and that no one ſhould caſt any thing into the Lyſts, nor vſe any words, nor ſigne to diſcourage, or encourage either party.</p>
            <p>This done, he bade the Combatants to riſe, and mount themſelves, and at the ſound of Trumpet to begin the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault. At the ſetting foorth it could not be diſcerned who was firſt. The <hi>Tartar,</hi> bearing his Maſt-like Staffe over high, carried away part of the <hi>Hermites</hi> Plume; But the <hi>Hermite</hi> (unto whom Iudgement and cuſtome, gave an advantage) bare himſelfe ſo evenly in his winged Courſe, that he hit the <hi>Tartar</hi> ſo forceable on the breſt, that though the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12144:44"/>
of his Armour denyed entrance, yet did it make him doe homage to the ſtrength of the blow: For <hi>Turbulent</hi> keeping his ſeate, was notwithſtanding, by the breaking of all his Girthes, ſet on the ground, with his Saddle betwixt his legges. This not onely moved great laughter, but ſtroke all men with ſuch a wonder, that where before they could not harbour the leaſt hope, now they began to looke after good hap. The <hi>Tartar</hi> ſwelling with irefull diſdaine (like unto the diſturbed Ocean) breathed out direfull revenge; and furiouſly drawing foorth his dreadfull Sword, called for him, (who needed no ſummons at all) threatning death and deſtruction, not onely to him, but to all others. But the <hi>Hermit,</hi> whoſe undiſmayed courage, could not be ſhaken with any boyſterous windes; upon his ſtopage, turned his Horſe, and ſeeing him on foote, (ſcorning the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage) alighted, and unſheathing his correcting Semitar, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly came towards the <hi>Tartar,</hi> who rudely ſaluted him, with ſo mightie a blow, that notwithſtanding his full ward, with his Shield) hee was forced to ſtagger a little; whereby hee knew the unreſiſtable ſtrength of his Foe, and more warily ſtood after, rather upon motion, then war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: Yet did his ſuperlative valour, equall the others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable ſtrength: But the <hi>Hermit,</hi> in guerdon of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulents</hi> cold curteſie, returned him ſuch powerfull thankes, as made his dazeled eyes ready to ſtart out of his diſturbed head. This interchange of puiſſant ſtroakes (ecchoing like the <hi>Ciclopes</hi> blowes upon theyr fiery Anviles) begot ſuch ſpightfull diſdaine, and malitious rage in both, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous furie of theyr ſtormy blowes came like thunder, to the amazement of the beholders: The great ſtature, and unreſiſtable ſtrength of the one, ſhewing both might and courage; and the unmatchable valour, and practive skill of the other, ſhewing great prowis and judgement. <hi>Turbulent,</hi> madde with hatefull and angry contempt, that any one ſhould, or could, ſo ſtand againſt him (truſting to his never fayling ſtrength) layd on ſuch loade on the magnanimious <hi>Hermite,</hi> as all men wondered how he could keepe his ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12144:45"/>
or ſtanding, durſt once ſtand to withſtand him: But the bold haughtie <hi>Hermite,</hi> whoſe watchfull care, and vſed skill, had made him expert in ſuch threatning tempeſts, gaue ſome way vnto that ſtormie ſhower, auoyding the danger, ſometimes by motion of his Bodie, and ſometimes by ſtrong and warie wardes; neuer looſing any aduantage to offend, nor giuing ground in his defence.</p>
            <p>In the end, finding the <hi>Tartars</hi> waſting fury to conſume it ſelfe; In the abatement thereof, he ſo redoubled his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed blowes, which like hayle-ſtones, ſtroue to ouertake each other before they fell, that <hi>Turbulent</hi> knew not how to auoide the greatneſſe of the ſtorme. Now was there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Armours broken, bruiſed, and mangled in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the blood that iſſued from them both, made the dyed Earth a witneſſe of their implacable rage. But the <hi>Tartar,</hi> that had loſt moſt blood, finding his ſtrength to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, vnited all his forces together, and ſmote the Hermite ſo forceablie on his Burgonet, that notwithſtanding his Shield, which then he cloue aſunder, he brought him on his knees maugre both his warde and his might; but ſuch was his quicke deliuerie, and inuincible courage, that he was no ſooner downe, then he was vp againe; and ſeeing himſelfe depriued of the beſt part of his defence, he was ſo ouercome with ſcornefull anger, that he had beene brought ſo lowe; that he began to renew the Fight, more furiouſly, and with much more puiſſant and inſupportable blowes, then before; and finding (by his euerwatching eye) that the Vambraſſe was broken, and falne from the <hi>Tartars</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratt, and that he was within his aduantage; taking his threatning and wrathfull Sword in both his hands, hee hit him ſo full and ſo ſtrongly on his diſarmed Arme, that hee ſeuered it from his curſed Bodie, ſo that Arme, and harmefull ſword, fell both to the ground. The <hi>Sultan,</hi> and all the reſt, beyond all wonder, wondering at the greatneſſe of the blow, and the continuance of ſo terrible cumbate, admired who that valiant Hermite ſhould be, that with ſuch vnwearied force, and ſuch approued skill, had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12144:45"/>
ſuch proweſſe, as the like was never ſeene.</p>
            <p>The loſſe of the <hi>Tartars</hi> arme made him curſe heaven, and earth, and frothing at his mouth, like a wilde chaffed Bull, he bellowing out wrath, and vengeance, in ſuch a madding manner, that (being as ignorant of his Fate, as he was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently mad in the maintenance of his ignominious wrong) he deſperately runne headlong on the Hermit, thinking ſo to beare him over. But adviſed experience, and wary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, which had ever arm'd the <hi>Hermit</hi> for all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and aſſaults, made him unwilling of ſuch unkind embracement: And therefore made ſtopage by a moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate thruſt, which finding entrance under his bruiſed Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, runne upwards, and made quicke inquiſition after his death. Thus was the pride of <hi>Goliah</hi> turn'd to confuſion, and thus fell the redoubted <hi>Tartar,</hi> like a great Towne upon the earth, to the amazed griefe of the Ambaſſadour, and all his Traine; and to the admiring ioyes of the <hi>Sultan</hi> and his Turkes. But the <hi>Hermit,</hi> who ever held, that to deſtroy mercifully, was to ſave; ſtept to him, and pulling off his head-piece, with his ſword he ſmit off his fearefull head, and holding it up on high, Cryed, God ſave <hi>Solimon,</hi> the invincible <hi>Sultan,</hi> the mightieſt Emperour, and greateſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate on earth.</p>
            <p>This being done, the Trumpets tryumphantly ſounded foorth the ioy of moſt pleaſing Victory, and all the people made ſuch rejoycing Cryes, that theyr applauding ſhouts pierſt the lower region, to witneſſe theyr glory on the earth. But ſilence being made, the heroicall victorious <hi>Hermit</hi> (arm'd with glorious conqueſt) was betwixt two <hi>Beglerbegges</hi> (the chiefeſt of the Turkiſh Nobility) brought with ſounding Trumpets unto the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his great ſtrength, his ſurmounting proweſſe, and moſt invincible courage, commanded him to put off his Helmet, that he might know who had ſo much honoured him, that according to his great merrit, hee might deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly advance him. To which the humble <hi>Hermit</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all his Actions did ayme at Honour, not at advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12144:46"/>
and that the favours he had already found and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of ſo great a Prince, was all-ſufficient in it ſelfe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a weaker arme to performe a greater worke; beſides, his deſire (he ſayd) did carry him beyond all meanes, and ability, to doe him a more pleaſing ſervice; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall taking of his Helmet, in all humility he bowed his body (according to the Turkiſh manner) thrice unto him. But when <hi>Solimon</hi> ſaw that he was <hi>Sirap,</hi> his new affected and entertained friend, laying aſide all ſtate and regard of greatneſſe, he ranne to him, and embracing him, ſaid: How ſhall the Turkiſh <hi>Sultan</hi> requite the honourable love of ſo praiſe-worthy a friend, that in therenowned hazzard of his inualuable life, hath both preſerved, and dignified my name, and the fame of my Empire. But more befitting times, ſhall ſhew us reſpectively gratefull, and affectionately mindfull, of ſo vertuous a friend, ſo famous a Champion, and ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an act. In the interim, hee commanded that three of his chiefe <hi>Baſhaes</hi> ſhould ride before <hi>Sirap,</hi> and that the firſt ſhould carry the <hi>Tartars</hi> louped arme and ſword: the ſecond his unweldy ſpeare, and maſſie ſhield; and the third, his grim and terrible ſevered head; and that after ſhould follow the monſtrous and headleſſe trunke of that huge boaſting <hi>Goliah;</hi> after whom ſhould march the diſgraced Ambaſſadour, and all his diſcontented traine: And that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rap</hi> mounted on his Courſer, all alone, with his naked blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died ſword in his hand, like a Conquerour ſhould follow; and after him, he himſelfe, his <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> and all his royall Attendants would ride, and ſo paſſe through the Citie, to his Pallace. This he did to honour his friend; And out of this honour, did <hi>Eugenia</hi> the <hi>Sultaneſſe</hi> more affectionately looke upon the Merrit of <hi>Sirap.</hi> His carriage ſeemed now more maieſticall; his colour though blacke, ſhee deemed lovely; and the nobleneſſe of his ſpirit, deſerved (ſhee thought) the favour of the greateſt Empreſſe. This liking begot longing, and ſhe deſired now to enioy, what ſhe was enjoyned not to affect. The remembrance of her place, and the terrour of their law, qualified, but not quench'd her
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12144:46"/>
fired fancie; which ſhe ſeeking to ſmother in the embers, burſt out after into a greater, and more ſhamefull flame.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Sirap,</hi> during his repoſe, for the healing of his wounds, entering into conſideration of his croſſe fortunes, ſeeing his admired victories applauded with open joyes, honour, and tryumphes; and his dejected and enthralled heart, ſtill clad in blacke woe, and accompanyed onely with ſecret griefe, and tormenting paſſions. To feed his diſtaſte of reioycing, with ſome ſad conceites. He ſuitably compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe few following reverſt, and returning verſes; which being read either forward or backward, are ſtill the ſame in ſence both wayes; and either way, end in meeter.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Ioy, Mirth, Tryumphes; I doe defie,</l>
               <l>Deſtroy me Death; fayne would I die:</l>
               <l>Forlorne am I; Love is exilde,</l>
               <l>Scorne ſmiles thereat; Hope is beguilde:</l>
               <l>Men baniſh'd bliſſe, in Woe muſt dwell,</l>
               <l>Then Ioy, Mirth, Tryumphes, all farewell.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus did he ſhewe himſelfe to be ever one, as conſtant in his woes as he was unremoveable in his love; And thus ever in his houres of leaſure, did either his tongue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, or his penne manifeſt his ſorrow. But when loathed time had healed his honoured wounds. The grand <hi>Sultan</hi> to give his ſolitarineſſe ſome ſollace, ſent unto him, that the next day hee ſhould be in befitting readineſſe to attend him to the chaſe of the wilde Boare, in the neere adioyning for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; And commanded one of his <hi>Basſhaes</hi> to ſee that <hi>Sirap</hi> ſhould be well mounted, and furniſhed accordingly. For ſtill it bare him in minde (ſeeing the map of Maieſty in his eyes, &amp; finding the vertue of true nobility in his thoughts) that he was extract from Royall bloud; And by this meanes, he thought he ſhould (by his obſervance) make a further tryall thereof. The next morning <hi>Phoebus</hi> had no ſooner rent the ſable Cloudes, and waſh'd his face with the dew of the earth, but that the winding of baſe and bugle hornes,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12144:47"/>
ſummoned the <hi>Sultan</hi> to his Silvan ſports, and <hi>Sirap</hi> to his attendance.</p>
            <p>And long it was not, but that each one was in full readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and being horſed, rid to the Forreſt, where ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves, they tooke divers wayes, the ſooner to finde theyr game, but ſtill <hi>Sirap</hi> attended the <hi>Sultan,</hi> whoſe fortune was to eſpie the Boare, whetting of his angry Tuſhes in the mouth of his denne, as though hee had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene his pretended purſuit, and meant to wound his purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foes. The <hi>Sultan</hi> proud of ſuch ſucceſſe, gave ſpurres to his flying Horſe, and with careleſſe eagerneſſe unlodging the beaſt, purſued his ſo ſwiftly, that none but <hi>Sirap</hi> could come neere vnto him. The Boare ſeeing himſelfe purſued, fled by decreed deſteny towards the middeſt of the Deſart; where the Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke faſt following, was ſodainly ſeazed on by a great, fell, and hideous Dragon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirap</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſo embraced within the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring armes of death, (knowing no feare to make a pawſe) ſet ſpurres to his Horſe, and ſo furiouſly runne at him with his Boare ſpeare, that he happily wounded him under the left wing. The fierce Dragon feeling the ſmart of his hurt, left his vnkind hold, and ſmote with his wings ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Sirap,</hi> that he brake his ſpeare all to pieces. Then drew <hi>Sirap</hi> his Semitar, which the <hi>Sultan</hi> had that morning given him, and freſhly aſſaulted that dreadfull Beaſt with ſuch adviſed heedfulneſſe, that hardly could that enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Monſter faſten on him; ſo quicke in agility, ſo ready in dexterity, and ſo watchfull hee was at all times. But in the end he ſmote <hi>Sirap</hi> ſo forceable with his Serpentine tayle, that maugre all his might and ſtrength, he was conſtrained to fall on the ground: when the wrathfull Dragon advancing his threatning wings, and opening his infernall mouth, made offer as ſhe would devoure him at once. But <hi>Sirap</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger, carried ſo vigilant an eye, and ſo ready a hand, that the Dragon no ſooner ſtooped to ſeaze on him, but that, as hee lay vpright on the ground, hee ſo ſtrongly thruſt his well ſteeled Semitar into his almoſt unpenitrable
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:12144:47"/>
breaſt, that piercing his heart, he ſodainly preuented death by death. Now the frighted <hi>Sultan,</hi> who onely was but pinched a little with his clawes; was no ſooner free from that murthering Beaſt, but that creeping amazedly into a thicke buſhy Groue, he fearefully hid himſelfe there, ſcarce daring to lend his eyes, to behold that vncouth and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Combat. But when he ſaw <hi>Sirap</hi> on his feete, ſtriking off that gaſtly and monſtrous head; and eliuating it on the point of his Semitar, and turning himſelfe, called for his Lord. Then, then, came he forth in the admiration of his thoughts; and kneeling downe, firſt gaue thankes to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> and then to him, for his ſo redeemed and preſerued life. But <hi>Sirap</hi> yeelding the heauens onely thankes, bad him aſcribe the onely glory thereof to God, and not to him a ſinfull man, or to any other ſurmized power; ſince none but God had armed his humble heart with vndaunted courage; and none but God could haue giuen his weake hand ſuch a happy Conqueſt. As this they ſacrificed their thankes. One of the <hi>Basſhaes,</hi> that had loſt himſelfe in the perſuit, came ſtraying in by chance, vnto whom the <hi>Sultan</hi> recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the accident: with ſuch admiring wonder of <hi>Siraps</hi> worthy valour, that both the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and his <hi>Basſha,</hi> eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him as another <hi>Mahomet.</hi> In this height of <hi>Solimons</hi> ioy for his ſecured life; he commanded the <hi>Basſha</hi> himſelfe to carrie the Dragons head before <hi>Sirap</hi> into the Citie, and that his man ſhould poaſt before to publiſh that thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned deed, that the Citizens might tryumph in their Lords eſcape, and honour <hi>Sirap</hi> for his purchaſed life. And no ſooner it was reuealed, but that the Citizens firſt amazed with wonder, and after rauiſhed with ioy, wholly went to meete their earthly God; whom once reuerenced, they guarded to the Citie gate; where the <hi>Caliphe</hi> (the Primate of their ſuperſtition) to celebrate the happineſſe of <hi>Solimons</hi> preſeruation, accompanied with all the order of their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Prieſts, receiued him, and brought him after their Hereticall, or rather Heatheniſh manner to his Pallace. The next day hee cauſed the Dragons head to be ſet on his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12144:48"/>
Pallace gate, that all men beholding it, might know their Lords danger, and <hi>Siraps</hi> valour. Then he aſſembled all his <hi>Basſhaes,</hi> and in theyr preſence would have created him one of his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſiers;</hi> which with all thankefull humility hee reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently refuſed, as not capable yet of that dignity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly requeſted his greatneſſe, that hee would for a time pardon his denyall, untill the infancy of his weake merrit, were growne ſtronger in better deſerts, which well pleaſed <hi>Solimon,</hi> becauſe <hi>Solimon</hi> would not diſpleaſe <hi>Sirap.</hi> Then began fie to feaſt, &amp; to make tryumphes in his Court. Where <hi>Sirap</hi> honoured knighthood in thoſe Iuſts, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thoſe Iuſts in honour of the <hi>Sultan.</hi> Such was his Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cariage, ſuch his unreſiſtable courage; ſo well could hee manage his furious Steed, and ſo redoubted was hee in all his encounters, that all men rather deemed him the God of Armes, then a man in Armes. For there was neither Turke, nor Sarazen, that could withſtand his puiſſant force: nor was there any diſmounted, that held himſelfe diſhonoured. So highly did they eſtimate his unequalled va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that they held his power rather divine then humane. As for the vulgar ſort they flock'd about to ſee him, with ſuch applauding ſhowtes, as though <hi>Mars</hi> had left his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sphere, and diſcended amongſt them, to ſport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on earth.</p>
            <p>Theſe Heroicall deedes of famous Chivalry, begot admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in all, but brought forth ſuch unreſiſtable affectio nin the faultfull <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> that what before ſhee held deadly, now ſhe deemed it not to be veniall: Laſcivious love diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the bonds of all reſpects, and her minde being ſet on deſire, nothing could limit her aduentures. For though Iuſt carie ruine behinde her, yet muſt the Queene of love enioy the God of Warre: yea, though <hi>Vulcan</hi> frame and lay his ſubtill nets for theyr diſcovery. How to make <hi>Argoes</hi> ſleepe was all her unquiet care; the eyes of the Eunuches muſt bee made blinde, either with gold or guile; which ſhee put in practiſe, by calling theſe watching Attendants, or rather jealous ſaylers unto her; unto whom ſhee tolde, that the

day following, <hi>Hirena</hi> an other of the <hi>Sultans</hi> Wives, had ſecretly appoynted a <hi>Gretian Hero</hi> to come to ſolace with her; for as that day, the <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf, his <hi>

            <p>The <hi>Sultaneſſe</hi> proudly glad, that ſhe ſhould by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull meanes, be freed from theſe preventing and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting Spirits, made now no queſtion of opportunity, and therefore no doubt of the fruition of her deſire; To haſten which, ſhe called unto her <hi>Mentiga,</hi> one of her attendants, whom ſhe before had faſhioned to her purpoſe, and gave her in ſecret charge, that ſhe ſhould that evening following, diſguiſe her ſelfe in Mans apparell, and goe to the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> and warily deliver him that Letter, and crave his anſwere. Glad was <hi>Mentiga</hi> of this imployment, it fitted her nature well, and hope of reward gave ſpeed to her deſires, to doe her Miſtreſſe ſome pleaſing ſervice.

Now moſt meritorious Lady (ſayd <hi>Mentiga)</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt of Princes, what miſlike can you gather from ſo full a conſent of Love? Or what could you expect more from him, then to bee wholly yours? with adventure of life hee offers love, and not regarding danger, hee devotes himſelfe to your pleaſure. O happie Lady, Soveraigne Queene of Fortune, and ſole commander of contentment; that out of your owne fancy can tryumph over others affections, and at your owne pleaſure enjoy your deſires with wiſhed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. <hi>Eugenia</hi> amazed, and confounded with wonder, knew not what to ſay, or thinke of herſelfe: Sure ſhe was that ſhee read it directly otherwiſe, and as aſſuredly ſhee found it now to bee otherwiſe. In this ſilent confuſed ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſhee puniſhed all her thoughts with variety of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and ſtood like a faire liueleſſe Picture, made to life; but wanting life; untill fatall <hi>Mentiga</hi> awaked her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ſpirits, and thus merrily cheered her. Nay, moſt mighty Empreſſe (ſhee ſayd) confeſſe your errour, and your pardon ſhall bee granted: heere is nothing metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; onely you may ſee, that there is nothing well done, that is ill conſtrued. Your feare to looſe what you wiſhed to have, made you to thinke as you doubted; beleeve what you feared; and reade as you deemed. But that Cloud being diſpierced, looke now with comfort upon the glory of the Sunne, and with joy receive the benefit of his ſweet influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and therewithall ſhee read, and re-reade it, with ſuch plaine and direct pointing of it, that the <hi>Sultaneſſe</hi> (being eaſily made apt to embrace what ſhe deſired) acknowledged her over-ſight, and never after ſought to reade it, in any other manner, or to any other ſenſe. To ratifie which, <hi>Mentiga</hi> tolde her, that hee ſorrowfully craved pardon for his next dayes attendance. For that, it being his Birth day, hee was tyed both by his Countries cuſtome, and by his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged obſervance, religiouſly to celebrate it, in a ſacred ſort, according to theyr wonted and hallowed manner. This was ſomewhat cordiall unto her wounded heart, though not ſo comfortable as ſhe deſired. And yet it did (becauſe it muſt)

ſatisfie for the time: which time, was all, ſurprized <hi>Sirap</hi> ſought to gaine: For in the delay of dayes, hee hoped to prevent that threatning evill, which ſo dangerouſly (like a prodigious, though bright Commet) proclaymed, and prognoſticated his deſtruction. In the meane time, he left the pleaſing and entiſing ſports of the Court (for pleaſures are no paſtimes for malecontented and diſconſolated men) and purpoſely walked all alone into the fields (the freer to enjoy his owne thoughts;) where ſudenly making a ſtand, in his melancholy pauſe, he writ in the ſand with the point of his ſword, as followes.</p>

               <l>My foes J foyle; my woes doe conquer me,</l>

Then, then, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the late flowing ſtreame of his gotten glory, in the full Sea of his preter hard haps; hee began thus to eaſe his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing griefe, by pleading, and publiſhing to the winds his caſe, and cauſe of grievous care.</p>
            <p>O falſe Fortune (ſaid he) conſtant onely in inconſtancy, how haſt thou made me a mirror of thy many mutabilities.</p>
            <p>Firſt, thou flatteredſt my clyming thoughts with impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall conceits, and promiſed ſucceſſe to my aſpiring hopes;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12144:51"/>
and then, even then, thou puniſheſt my deſires with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting favours. After thou didſt erect rich and glorious Trophies, for my renowned victories; and in thy greateſt grace, diſgraced my fortunes, and ecclipſed my honour, with moſt obſcure and clouded Conqueſts. Then in thy fraudulent ſmiles, thou winged my hope with beauties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and madeſt me flye in the heaven of my blisfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. But after (like a cruell Tyrant) thou thruſt my heart out of Paradiſe, and like a Thiefe, robbed my deſires of his purchaſed prey. And now rather to ſhew thy ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſtate, then to ſalve any wound thou gave; thou guir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt me with pleaſing glory, &amp; unaffected favours in <hi>Greece,</hi> and feedeſt my mated minde with unſeaſonable joyes; when alas my excruciated thoughts cannot but live, as ſtrangers in forraigne delights. O ſweet <hi>Vienna,</hi> in thee onely have I loſt the beauty of the World, the pride of all ioyes, the ſweeteſt fruit of beſt content, and the higheſt marke of true loves ambition: And for thee onely, all theſe remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of love, ioy, mirth, ſolace, and tryumphes; ſeeme unto me, but as the rich ſpoyles of a vanquiſhed Kingdome, in the eye of a Captive Prince; which as they are, but as vnbrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of his loſſe; ſo are theſe, but as ſharpe whetſtones to my continuated ſorrowes.</p>
            <p>O how theſe Barbarian, and Turkiſh tunes of comfort, ſound in my eares, like che Iſraelites bemoaning Muſicke, upon the Babylonian bankes: And how the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and his Empreſſes affording graces, ſeeme unto me, but as the gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering ſparkes of a broken Diamond, and the pictures of dead and decayed beauties; faire ſignes, not ſalves, of my loſt felicity; and true memorials, not medicines, of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt calamity. O <hi>Vienna, Vienna,</hi> as thou art the foode of my thoughts, the reliefe of my wiſhes, and the onely life, and repaſſe of all my deſires, ſo is thy love to me a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hunger; and thy abſence an extreame famine. Then par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my enforced flight in my ſtormy fury, driuen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by my angry Fates; and let my faith live ſtill in thy fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which is not to be controlled by any fortune. But alas,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12144:52"/>
thou liveſt thy ſelfe, a Captive Princeſſe to thy will; and a moſt deſolate priſoner to thy abuſed conſtancie. O cruell <hi>Daulphin,</hi> Tigar-hearted Father, and moſt vnnaturall, and vnrelenting Parent; the ſmalleſt drops will ſoften the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſtones, but Natures greateſt teares, cannot ſupple thy ſtonie heart: Thy Iuſtice without pitty, is as cruell; as Pitie without Iuſtice is fooliſh. If wrath were not by mercy to be appeaſed, no fleſh ſhould be ſaved. O would, and thus as he would have floated further in the Sea of his ſorrow, hee was interrupted, and driven out of his <hi>Saturnall</hi> humour, by a certaine Meſſenger of worth, that the Turke had ſent to ſeeke him, with whom he returned ſhadowing his griefe, with the borrowed vale of ſeeming pleaſant; and arming his patience, with noble reſolution, to give way to all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents, and to withſtand all ſiniſter accidents. No ſooner was he come into the <hi>Sultans</hi> ſight, but that he cheerefully called him, and briefly told him, that hee meant to invade Chriſtendome: And that for his approoved prowis, and for the love he bare him, he meant to grace him with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting of his Army, and make him Generall over all his forces. This ſaid hee, is our will, and this your charge: Then ſee that your performance anſwere our expectation, and that our love be guerdoned with your victories. <hi>Sirap</hi> wounded with theſe words, knew not how to lay a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter on this ſore, yet reſolved in his Countries good, hee humbly proſtrating himſelfe, yeelded all reverend thankes, for ſuch his great eſteeme and gracefull reſpect. But ſuch (ſaid he, pardon me, moſt victorious and moſt mightieſt, of moſt mightieſt Princes) is my unpractived knowledge, in Marſhalling of Troupes, and ranging of Battels, that I ſhould rather ecclipſe the feared honour of your name, by my overthrow; then eternize your gotten fame by my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. Beſides know moſt great Commander, that though I be a mortall enemie to the Croſſe of Chriſt, and an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent foe to all Chriſtians; yet for ſome private cauſes (beſt knowne to my ſelfe) I vowed long ſince never to tread on Chriſtian ground, nor come where any worſhip that <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:12144:52"/>
for their God. Then let (I humbly intreat your Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Maieſty) ſome other in worth, more worthier; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my defects in their better deſerts, and bury not your living renowne, in my ſo probable ignorance, and unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced diſcipline.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> weying the danger of an unpractiſed Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, allowed the rather his devout obiections; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the religiouſneſſe of his vowes, (though he held it ſuperſtitious in it ſelfe) yet would he not violate his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated promiſe; but yeelding to his requeſt, hee made <hi>Muſtapha, Basſha,</hi> his Generall; and the preparation for him was ſo great, that the bruit thereof piercing the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne Clyme, came to the knowledge of the French King: who as the greateſt Chriſtian Prince, aſſembled his wiſeſt Councellours, and noble Peeres, praying alſo in ayde of all his Allyes, and Princely Confederates about him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, and conclude ſomewhat, for the honour and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Chriſtendome: Amongſt whom, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennois</hi> was there, as the ſole <hi>Solon,</hi> and onely wiſeſt (though too ſevere a <hi>Cato)</hi> of his Country. But ſuch was his over-wayning conceite, ſuch the elevation of his high ſtirring ſpirit, and ſuch his proud eſtimation of his allowed wiſedome; that halled on (I know not by what deſtinie) he voluntary offered, ſecretly, and Pilgrime-like to goe to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there to eſpye, and learne, the ſtrength, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, courſe and preparation then intended, meant, and made for Chriſtendome. This being applauded by the whole aſſembly, ſo tickled the flattering humour of his vaine glory (the ecclipſe of his mature wiſdome) that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with theyr praiſes; hee fayled to looke into the true conſideration of ſo doubtfull, and threatning an enterpriſe. <hi>Pride</hi> made him forget both his place, and his yeares; and <hi>Glory</hi> would not permit him, neither to take counſaile of Time; nor make a provident delay; which well ſhewes, that they that are tranſported with their owne deſires, have no true ſcope of judgement left them, to looke with perfect eyes into their deſignes; otherwiſe actions ſo uncertaine,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12144:53"/>
had beene better not undertaken, then unfortunately hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: But he ever haſteth to repent, that raſhly enterpriſeth: Hee was moſt reſolute in his determination, nothing could diſmay him, nor no Man could diſſwade him; doubt hee held to be the bane of all hopefull endeavours, and if his fate were certaine, he ſaid, it would profite him little to take heed; and if uncertaine, it would be more then meere foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe, to feare what he was ignorant of would happen.</p>
            <p>In this reſolute reſolve, he called for the Lord <hi>Vran Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> (a Man, whoſe care and providence, was the life of that State,) unto his wiſedome and truſt, did he leave the whole governement of his Principality, till his returne; commanding him upon his allegiance, to marſhall, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the whole State, as beſt ſhould ſtand with Iuſtice, Law, and equitie; and that he would neither in pitty, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor favour (ſuch was his perſeverant rigour) releaſe, comfort, nor give countenance to the Princeſſe <hi>Vienna,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then was by him already cenſured, allowed, and accuſtomed: That her obſtinate and degenerate diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (ſhe being a Traytor to true Generation) might eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize his unpartiall Iuſtice, make her miſerable, in being an example to others, and that his Title and right, might in his abſence be the better ſecured by her impriſonment. And ſo taking his leave, he privately departed, accompanied with none but with <hi>Mal Fiance,</hi> his affected and learned Servant.</p>
            <p>After their Land travell, they Shipt themſelves, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into the Ocean; where after ſome dayes ſayling, they were by force of wrathfull and ſiniſter windes (by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Neptune)</hi> driven into the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sea, and ſo caſt on the Bay of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he had not reſted full three dayes, but that a ſubtile <hi>Mercurian,</hi> a Merchant of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi> that then lay in Traffique there, obſerving more heedfully, the eminent Maieſty, and uncontrolled counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> ſuppoſed thereby, that he was of no meane Eſtate. His Complexion and attire made him a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;</hi> and his commanding Eyes (the true image of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12144:53"/>
minde) ſhewed him to be of an high Spirit.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Linx,</hi> this Blood-hound to miſchiefe, hunted after opportunity, to reſolue this doubt, and by fortune, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> in the Market-place, whither the <hi>Daulphin</hi> his Lord had ſent him to buy ſome Neceſſaries; Vnto whom in Latine (as the moſt generall Tongue, beſt knowne to all) the politique Merchant gave many kinde ſalutes, offering him ſecretly, for the love he bare to Chriſt, and Chriſtians, all the beſt offices he might performe, wiſhing withall, (to gaine the more credit) not to make himſelfe knowne in ſo dangerous and impious a Place. <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> (being better Learned then Travelled) finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo kindely intreated by a Stranger, returned thankes, and ioyfully embraſt his courteſie. The Merchant glad that he vnderſtood him, requeſted his acceptance of a cuppe of theyr Countrey Wine, which <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> (as one proud of ſuch vnexpected friendſhip in ſo ſtrange a place, and that he had met with one of knowledge to conferre withall,) willingly aſſented unto.</p>
            <p>The Merchant, having waded thus farre into the depth of his awaked intention, thought good to ſound the Foord at full by undermining theyr proiects: And therefore in the curteſie of theyr Bachonizing Cuppes, he gave him ſome fewe peeces of Gold, wiſhing him to make his wants knowne, with the diſtreſſe of his Companion, that he might privately relieve them, and ſecretly give them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and directions for theyr more ſecurity. This falſe fire (the ſeeming ſhew of good regard) burnt vp all <hi>Mal Fian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> feare of diſtruſt; the ſtrength of hot Wines, conſumed all due conſideration, and the ioy he tooke in finding ſo good a Chriſtian amongſt unbeleeving <hi>Infidels,</hi> made him unadviſedly tell the Merchant who he was, whom he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and where his Lord the Prince was This Machivelian Merchant, being now fully enformed of what he deſired, the better to mature his ill deſigne, ſpake to the Maſter of the Houſe in the <hi>Slavonian</hi> Tongue, (a Language much uſed amongſt the <hi>Turkes)</hi> that he ſhould ſtay that Stranger, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

his returne from the <hi>Sanzake,</hi> the <hi>Turkes</hi> Governour of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which hee did, to no leſſe admiration, then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may of confounded <hi>Mal Fiance:</hi> For now too late hee found, that Chriſtall is like a pretious-ſtone, till it come to hamering; that his betraying tongue was guilty of his owne evill, and that in the leaſt danger, is ever ſome eminent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill. But this ſeducing Merchant (the Sonne of Deceit, borne of Hate, fedde with miſchiefe, and maintayned with others loſſes) being now armed with all the apparances of Truth, that might fit and further his purpoſe, went inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the dreadleſſe <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and in his corrupt Latine (ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his ulcerated heart) hee thus greeted him.</p>
            <p>THE Saviour of the Faithfull, the comfortable Sonne of the moſt Righteous, all-Seeing, and Everliving GOD, make your Excellencie moſt happie in all your intendments, and guard your Perſon from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and malice of cruell Miſcreants. To teſtifie my Faith by my Workes, and to preſerve the living Plants of Chriſts Vineyard, from the bloody handes of the Deſtroyer. I am come, moſt noble Prince, to ſave thy thrice worthy Chriſtian life, from the tyrannie of murdering Infidels: In aſſurance whereof, let this ſuffice, that your Attendant <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> is apprehended, and that for feare, hee hath confeſt that you are a <hi>French</hi> Prince, and <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>Viennois;</hi> and that as a wily <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> you are ſelected, and come to pry into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> State, and to diſcover theyr Projects; which being made knowne to the <hi>Sanzake,</hi> your Highneſſe ſhall bee ſent a Priſoner to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where that curſed ſinfull <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> will make you dye a moſt cruell death. To prevent which, I have poſted unto you, and will for our Saviour ſake, convey you from his ſlaviſh and barbarous cruelty. For know, moſt gracious Prince, that in heart I am a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Chriſtian, though in ſhew a <hi>Mahometitian,</hi> and have given addition of life to many, by private intelligence, ſecret reliefe, ſpeedy prevention, and by cloſe protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12144:54"/>
and unknowne tranſporting them to theyr native homes: And this, and all this, I doe in ſome ſatisfaction for my Sinnes, and to ſave my Soule, for which the Lord of Life loſt his deareſt Life. This loathed Habite of mine, gives me ſafety, and warrants my vowed endeavours for Chriſtian ſupports: Vnto which ſaving ſervice, I have dedicated both the length of my dayes, and the fulneſſe of my meanes. Nor doe I leave <hi>Goſhen</hi> to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Kedar;</hi> Nor deſire I with <hi>Lot</hi> to ſtay in <hi>Sodom,</hi> nor would I for my Poſſeſſions heere, eſtabliſh my inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (with the Children of <hi>Ruben)</hi> in the Land of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liad;</hi> But I live in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for performance of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Vowes, and to preſerve the Flocke of Chriſt, from theſe Band-dogges of Satan, that otherwiſe would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by them. And therefore if you love this your life, goe with me, and paſſe over the Foord now the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are low, leaſt by your dangerous delay, you be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in the Flood: And to prevent the inſtant ſearch, I will bring you out of the Lyons denne, and free you from the ſnare of the Hunter. Fraud you know, goes beyond Force, and prevention helpes, what repentance can not redreſſe. I will not uſe many words, (Proteſtation is the Mother of Iealouſie,) but when time ſhall promiſe better ſecurity, I will at my owne charge convey you to <hi>France.</hi> In the meane time, you ſhall want nothing, that my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney can procure, or my Labours obtayne.</p>
            <p>Thus did this ſubtile <hi>Sinon</hi> (who had the voyce of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but the hands of <hi>Eſau)</hi> guild over his poyſoned Pilles, and weave the Webbe of the <hi>Daulphins</hi> woe; who finding cauſe of feare, in that hee was ſo apparantly knowne, did willingly feed on Poyſon, and raſhly commend his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, to his betraying truſt; prayſing God, that hee had ſent him ſuch a Shield of defence, and had ſo preſerved him from the terrour of ſhamefull death: But this comfort in danger, was but like the Honey that <hi>Sampſon</hi> found in the Lyons Iawes, or like Lightning in a foggie night: Time would
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:12144:55"/>
not permit neyther of better conſideration, nor of further complement. The perfideous Merchants feare (for ſtill hee ſeemed fearefully to feare) haled him away to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where he cloſely kept him with reſpect, untill the next day; againſt which time hee had provided two ſwift Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midaries well furniſhed, to carry them to <hi>Babylon,</hi> there to make preſent of ſo Great and ſtrange a Prince, unto the <hi>Soldan</hi> his King, promiſing himſelfe, eyther a great Share in his Ranſome, or no ſmall Reward for his ſo worthy a Prize. The long trauaile of the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> made him give way to all ſuſpitious thoughts: His journies were greater then ſtood with eaſe or liking; Yet what hee could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd, hee learned to beare; neceſſity enforced him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant patience. But being come to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and like a Captive (in tryumph) he was ledde through the Citie to Priſon. The dejected <hi>Daulphin</hi> (whoſe French Fortunes, was but earſt the Miniſters of his will) was now ſo controled, and deprived of all Dignity, that hopeleſſe of his life, hee had no other comfort, then to be voyd of all comfort: Sometimes hee would envey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the deteſtable treachery of his deceitfull Servant, and condemne his owne credulity, in beleeving an Vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever. Then would hee curſe his over-glorious deſire of Popularity, (the ground of his griefe) in ſeeking applauſe with danger, and hazarding his Perſon, to give liking to others. But after, when humble miſery had appeaſed his diſcontented thoughts, hee then caſt off his Adders-skinne; and ſoft Pitty did enter in at an Iron gate; and finding then his owne cruell tyrannie, in anothers long digeſted miſery, hee let fall ſome relenting teares, and paſſionately he thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayled his Daughters endurance, in his owne thraldome.</p>
            <p>Ah poore <hi>Vienna,</hi> too poore for <hi>Vienna:</hi> Rich art thou in Feature, but more then poore by thy Father. Nature hath honoured thee in thy Birth, Beauty hath eterniz'd thee in thy Perſon, and Vertue hath renowned thee in thy Life. Onely I, yea I onely, thy hapleſſe Sire, haue made thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, to bee the more infortunate my ſelfe: The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12144:55"/>
of my Iniuſtice, is in true Iuſtice, now puniſhed in my ſelfe with rigour; and the remembrance of thy long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious endured miſeries, is as a living hell to my dying ſoule. O that thy ſorrowes (my thoughts tormentors) might end with my life: or that thy life (my lives honour) might be preſerved by my death; ſo ſhould I dye more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and thou live better regarded and comforted. But alas thou untimely dyes, to live in thy renowne; and I ſhamefully live, to dye in my reproach. O cruell Father, unhappy <hi>Daulphin:</hi> O forlorne <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> but moſt diſtreſſed Daughter. The Heathens makes my death their Heaven, and my neereſt friends accounts my life their hell. The earth now diſdaines to beare me, and yet the heavens deny to receive me. Men ſcornes me in my fall, and the Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe me in my ſinne: So ſhall I dye, diſdayned of moſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayled of none, and vnregarded of all. Thus did miſerie, and ſorrow (the kinde ſiſters of mercie, and true wakers of compaſſion) extract teares, and ſighes from ſtonie cruelty; as ſtrokes doe force fire out of hardeſt flints.</p>
            <p>But leaving him to his more deſerved dolours; Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the great <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Turkie,</hi> who hearing of the <hi>Daulphins</hi> apprehenſion, and that he was a priſoner in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> wrote inſtantly to the <hi>Soldan,</hi> that in no wiſe hee ſhould releaſe him: In the interim, he ioying wondred, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring enioyned, that Boonfires, Feaſts, and Tryumphes, ſhould bee made throughout the Citie. In ſuch high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and fearefull regard, did they hold him for his judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſcipline, practive pollicies, turbulent ſpirit, Martiall provocation, approoved directions, and rare ſtratagems, that now taken, they held (in this preſage) the Conqueſt certaine. But <hi>Sirap</hi> underſtanding the cauſe of theſe rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, was aſtoniſhed at the newes. Report could not make him beleeve, what reaſon ſhewed was falſe. His greatneſſe he thought denied all private exploytes, and his yeares gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſuch tedious travaile. The places were too farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; and there was no combination of Chriſtian Princes, to undertake a generall Warre. Traffique ſtoode not with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:12144:56"/>
his dignity, and pleaſure could not draw his age to perill. His command at home, would not ſuffer him to goe from home: Nor durſt hee truſt the faith of a Subject, nor the ſtrength of his foes: He had no ſonne, and therefore more ſubiect to his neighbour invaſions. He was wiſe, and more feared then beloved; And therefore he had cauſe to feare many, whom many did feare. Theſe, and other reaſons perſwaded him to the falſity thereof.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Sultan</hi> diſcourſing of the truth, and the manner thereof, wounded him with wonder, and made beliefe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to his relation. Now griefe arreſted his loyall heart, and made his dutifull regard, a priſoner to his penſive thoughts. His forſaken Country, was now forſaken, and made a prey for the avaritious forraigner. His diſtreſſed Lady deſtitute of his helpe, when ſhe had moſt neede of his ayde. This was his greateſt griefe, and this commanded his returne: But iudgement tolde him, that her right fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, while the <hi>Daulphin</hi> lived, that the Nature of Iuſtice was to render to every one his owne, and that he was bound for <hi>Viennas</hi> ſake, and as a ſubiect, to induſtriate himſelfe, for his delivery: And though his exile awaked Revenge, yet Charity, he knew, required forgetfulneſſe of evill deedes. His Countries hazard, he deemed leſſe then his Lords loſſe. The miſcarying of the one, might be holpen by the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the other: but the deſtruction of the Prince would beget both forraigne and inteſtive broyles. In this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hee ſecretly vowed his beſt endeavours for his infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement; and ſecretly ſmothered his ſorrow, never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of the accident, nor making enquiry after fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occurrants. In the expiration of fewe dayes, being in the Court he found the <hi>Sultan</hi> alone, in the mildneſſe of his vnuſuall moode, both pleaſing and pleaſant: In that happy houre, he tooke opportunity by the fore-part, and (impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning his worthy reſolution within the Cloſet of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts) hee in all ſubiected humbleneſſe, requeſted his favourable conſent, for the accompliſhment of his obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vowe, that tyed his engaged ſoule, amongſt other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:12144:56"/>
of famous name, to ſee <hi>Babylon,</hi> both for the antiquity and worthineſſe of the ſame: And that he would be pleaſed to graunt him his Imperiall warrant under his Silver Seale, for his better ſecurity in travaile; and further grace him, with his commendatory Letter to the <hi>Soldan;</hi> that he might finde favour in his ſight, and reſpect with his Highneſſe. The <hi>Sultan</hi> unwilling to leave him; in that he both loved him affectionately, and intended to make a profitable uſe of his great, and unequalled valour, perſwaded him to ſtay ſtill with him, and he ſhould command in <hi>Turkie,</hi> dwell in his grace, and live in height of honour. But <hi>Sirap</hi> pleading ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to goe promiſed ſpeedy returne; and that in lieu of his favours, he would beſtow all his remayning dayes in his ſervice. This pleaſed the Turke ſo well, that he yeelded to his requeſt, and to his encouragement for his backe repaire: He gave him Princely Robes (as ornaments of honour) to countenance him; rich Iewels to ſhew his dignity; and great treaſure to defray his anſwerable diſpence. Hee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with Attendants, eſpecially with one of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> tongue, to bee his Interpreter. Hee alſo writ vnto the <hi>Soldan,</hi> to receive him, as one moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in all worth, worthy all honour, honoured by <hi>Solimon</hi> the great, his eſpeciall favourite, and the God of Warres chiefeſt Champion; and therefore hee entreated him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him with all Royall regard, and to give him what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment he might; and the rather, in that hee purpoſely came to ſee his magnificency, and the ſtate both of his Court, and Citie. This no little availed <hi>Sirap,</hi> in his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and theſe Princely favours, and furthering meanes, made him no leſſe ioyfull for his proud hopes; then moſt humbly thankfull for the <hi>Sultans</hi> ſo gracious a reſpect. And ſo taking a ſubmiſſive leave for that time; He would needs for his pleaſure goe to <hi>Pera,</hi> a Citie diſtant but a mile from <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> And as he croſſed <hi>Thracius Boſphorus,</hi> (a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that only devideth the two Cities:) he fortunately eſpied amongſt the Gally-ſlaves that rowed him a Frenchman, no otherwiſe knowne to him, then the cloath to the Lyſt:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12144:57"/>
For though ſeven yeares ſlaviſh Captivity had made him a <hi>Grecian</hi> in his tongue; and dyed his ſunne-burnt skinne more blacker, then his Native hue; yet did his making, and manner of his ſpeech, proclaime him a French man. Of him in Greeke he demanded, what was his name, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: who anſwered; <hi>France</hi> is my Country; <hi>Bonfoy</hi> my name, which pleaſed him well. Then (without diſcovering himſelfe, or taking further knowledge of him) hee asked, Whether hee would for his liberty, truely, and faithfully ſerve, and follow him, and his fortunes: and hee would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſometime, ſend him into his owne Country, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was. <hi>Bonfoy</hi> to gaine that happy freedome, and to be freed from that miſerable and baſe ſlavery; ſwore by the ſonne of God, who was made man, that men might be made the ſonnes of God; that he would truly, and faithfully (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his pleaſure) tye himſelfe, and all his endevours, to his command. Whereupon <hi>Sirap</hi> begg'd him on the Captaine, that durſt not deny him any thing, and ever after moſt kindly vſed him, and loved him, becauſe hee would be, not onely ſerved, but beloved of him: That foorth of that love, he might the better truſt him, and be the better inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him. For where love hath ſupremacy, there all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions attend on it, and all other paſſions are overſwayed by it.</p>
            <p>But now the ſenſuall <hi>Sultaneſſe</hi> hearing of <hi>Siraps</hi> haſtie proviſion for his ſodaine departure to <hi>Babylon,</hi> grew more then impatient in her diſcontented feares; and beyond all conſideration of her ſtate, deplored the hardneſſe of her hap. Her luſtfull hopes were now wounded in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her laſcivious deſires, and unbounded love ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt her unchaſte thoughts, that finding her infected affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction fruſtrated of conceived ioyes, ſhe fainted under the burthen of her unexpected woes. In this ſad alteration ſhe threw her ſelfe on the humble floare, where her dumbe ſorrowes vttered nought but bemoaning teares, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning ſighes: Which <hi>Mentiga</hi> ruefully beholding, and well waying that this unwelcome event would deprive her
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12144:57"/>
of enriching favours, and of promiſed preferments, ſhee ſummoned her wits together, and ſet them all on the racke of Invention, to finde out meanes of ſome redreſſe. At laſt, after a ſad and ſerious pauſe, ſhee ſayd; Take comfort moſt mighty Empreſſe, and my moſt gracious Soveraigne, let this ſodaine lightning dye in his abortive birth, and liſten to your moſt ſubmiſſive Handmayd, who deſires no longer life, then ſhee may doe your Highneſſe acceptable ſervice. Your Knight is no doubt, enforc'd (by the <hi>Sultans</hi> employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to this unliked journey, and your remembrance will not onely be a plea for his diſpatch; but his controling affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will alſo give ſpeed to his returne. In the meane time, I will undertake to bring him this night to your bed, where you may make your deſired delights, doe homage to your wils, pay tribute to your ſufferance, and binde him over to accompliſh your further pleaſure. Then raiſe your better thoughts, this baſe floare (but your footeſtoole) is no bed for Majeſty: Nor ſtands it with the reſplendant Queene of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to proſtrate her ſelfe ſo lowe, as to lye in the duſt of the earth. <hi>Eugenia</hi> thus rowzed, roſe (with an erected heart) from her ſeate of ſorrow, and carefully loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on her, ſaid; Ah <hi>Mentiga, Mentiga,</hi> can it be that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke hath any Cordiall receipt for ſo deſperate a diſeaſe: Is there any mollifying ſalve can cure my tormenting ſore; or canſt thou give a healing plaiſter, to my wounded mind. Speake thou hapleſſe, or moſt happy woman: When, where, or how, canſt thou effect ſo great, and ſweete a worke; and pleaſe thy Lady without perceivance? The glorious Sunne (thou know'ſt) is ever remarkable, when meane Starres are ſeldome gazed on. Pale <hi>Jealouſie</hi> is a ſubtile ſpie; and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <hi>Envie</hi> hath murthering eyes. <hi>Danger</hi> waytes on digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and <hi>Beauty</hi> is ever guarded with obſervance, The light (I feare) is a blab, and darkneſſe but a Traytor: Theſe wals have eares, then be ſilent <hi>Mentiga,</hi> leaſt the ayre whiſper, and betray thy intention, and enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>Thus had <hi>Eugenia</hi> (when it came to it) many eyes, to ſee into many evils, but they were all blinde to prevent any.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12144:58"/>
Misfortune ſo blindeth thoſe, ſhee will overthrow, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can cleere theyr underſtandings, nor limit theyr ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures; which made <hi>Mentiga</hi> anſwere, that ſhee had a Charme to cloſe up <hi>Argoes</hi> eyes, and that Deceit ſhould lull Danger aſleepe, when Beauty ſhould feaſt with Love. And this, ſhee ſayd it is, and muſt be. The <hi>Sultan,</hi> you know, (ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to refreſh himſelfe with eaſe, or to make his pleaſures more compleat by change) doth the two laſt nights of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Weeke, abſtaine both from your bed and Chamber: And this enſuing night, being the firſt of the two, when your <hi>Eunuches</hi> bee at ſupper, wee will in my Chamber ſecretly change our attyres, and to give life to our device, you muſt as <hi>Mentiga,</hi> bring mee as Empereſſe to your bed, where leaving mee, you ſhall depart into my Chamber next adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, where faſtening the doore, you muſt attend the houre of midnight, and then putting on my Night-gowne, you muſt as ſilently as may be, goe downe the ſtayres into the Garden, and there opening the poſterne gate, (The key whereof ſhall be pre-provided for you) you ſhall receive your diſguiſed Knight, and bringing him up the ſtayres to my Chamber, you both may ſafely entertayne your ſtolne delights, and give both your deſires, all fulneſſe of content. But how (ſaid <hi>Eugenia)</hi> ſhall hee returne vndiſcovered. Earely in the morning replyed <hi>Mentiga,</hi> before the day ſhall diſcry your dalliances, will I riſe and come unattired unto you to my Chamber, when you ſhall leave my bleſt and beautyfied bed, and returne to your owne Chamber, in ſuch manner as I came. And then will I cloathe your Knight in the Religious habite of the <hi>Hozes,</hi> the ſame I uſed, when I went to him. And ſo hee may depart, when the Sunne (the eyeof the world) ſhall not diſcover him. For clouded Rocks deceive Marriners: A iuſtifiable cloake ever hides a treacherous fraude; and they ever may doe the moſt wrong, of whom leaſt is looked for. And becauſe we will not procraſtinate our deſignes, leſt our proiects be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. I will preſently put on my <hi>Protean</hi> ſhape, and like a holy Father, goeto <hi>Sirap,</hi> unto whom I will unfolde
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12144:58"/>
all that wee have determined, and both enjoyne and entreat him in your name, and for your love, that hee will not fayle his houre, at that place, but come to take Loves farewell, and leave a ſetled poſſeſſion of his purchaſed favours. This enticing plot, promiſed more to <hi>Eugenia</hi> then a poſſibility. Her lawleſſe love ſaw no exception, nor could her wanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing thoughts dreame of any interception: Her tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted deſires were ſo drowned in her over-amorous paſſion, that ſhee entertayned the leaſt conceit, that might but helpe her fooliſh fancie. Her flattering hopes held good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencie with all likelihoods; and in the confidence of her ſuppoſed aſſurance, ſhee bad her goe, and after called her backe againe. Her preſaging heart did fayle her, and ſhee began to feare ſhee knew not what. A ſuddaine trembling poſſeſſed her in every part, and what before ſhee but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly dread, now ſhee did more then fearing doubt. In this diſtraction, and feare of miſadventure, ſhe ſayd; It is better to be in love moſt miſerable, then through love to be guilty of our owne mainfeſt confuſion. Why ſhould wee then <hi>Mentiga</hi> for loving follies, weave the web of our owne woes? Violent ſtreames being once runne out, the mudde will appeare in the bottome. The indignation of a Prince is death; and the love of a Stranger as inconſtant, as a Travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers minde is wandring. Hee is but meane, and puddles are not for Princes to drinke at: Let him be as he is, that I may be as I am. O <hi>Eugenia!</hi> hadſt thou beene as provident to ſhunne the cauſe of thy fall; as thou was fooliſhly wiſe to apprehend thy fall:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thou might have longer liv'd in thy renowne,</l>
               <l>But now thy ſinnes are ripe; Fate throwes thee downe.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For ſhee being drawne by a wilfull folly, unto that whereunto ſhee was deſtinate, no ſooner had uttered what ſhee miſliked, but ſtraight ſhee miſliked what ſhee had uttered. Shall idle doubt (ſhee ſayd) the hearce of our deſires, deprive mee of my wiſhed delights? Is baſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12144:59"/>
feare (the badge and terrour of Peſants) a befitting Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour for a commanding Empreſſe? or is Loue tyed to equality, honour, or maieſtie, that knowes no difference of perſons. Muſt greateſt Queenes want their wills, and the droſſe of Damoſels enjoy their pleaſures? Where then is our dignities, our pretogatives, and our priviledges? To command others and be ſlaves to our ſelves, is worſe then ſubjection. I will be my ſelfe, my affections ſhall bowe to my will, and my fancy ſhall command my pleaſures. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity hath no law, and where there is no law, there is no breach. Here <hi>Mentiga</hi> take this purſe, and happily get thee gone, and fortunately returne. This concluding command gave her ſpeed, and being come before him, ſhe thus in his private Chamber all alone ſalutes him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenia,</hi> the great Emperiall <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> Soveraigne Queene of Queenes, and onely Mirror of Beauty and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by me her truſty Hand-mayd, greetes thee well, and wiſheth thee (O thou happieſt of Men, and bleſt Sonne of Fortune) all the Ioyes that thy heart can wiſh, or her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection can afford. She grieves that thou art bound for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> and ſhe entreates thee, that diguiſed this night, at the hower of twelue, when darkeneſſe hath put on her blackeſt roabe, thou wilt come to the Poſterne-gate of the Gardon wall, where ſhe will in perſon receive thee, and ſafely bring thee, where thou mayſt bath thy ſelfe in Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties moſt delightfull Fountaine, and feaſt thy beſt Fortunes, with all the pleaſures that true Love, or proud State can yeeld. Nor mayſt thou doubt of hazard herein, ſince thy ſecurity is thus carefully and certainely aſſured. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, ſhe related to him the whole plot of theyr deviſe; which ſhe ſaid was onely intended, that by your incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated farewels, you both might ſeale ſuch an infringeable Deed of your covenanted Loves, that nought but Death ſhould breake the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirap</hi> being thus ſurpriſed, when leaſt he looked for ſuch an aſſault, wiſhed himſelfe in <hi>Babylon.</hi> His vertuous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, did contemne ſuch ſhamefull treacherie: Nor would
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:12144:59"/>
hee violated his plighted Faith to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> for all the proud Fortunes and Favours of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Affricke:</hi> Yet fearing, leaſt his refuſall ſhould croſſe his departure, hee ſmoothly ſet a ſcarlet dye, on his rough and courſe conceyt, and like <hi>Jove</hi> himſelfe, when hee entered <hi>Danaes</hi> Towre, he ſeemed both pleaſant and pleaſing to <hi>Mentiga;</hi> which made her more apt to beleeve what he never meant.</p>
            <p>Returne (ſayd hee) unto the brighteſt Starre, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Glory of <hi>Turkie,</hi> and preſent in all humble humbleneſſe, my true ſervice unto her, and ſay; That in the entercourſe of Affection, my Love ſurmounts hers, and that neyther Danger nor Death ſhall alter, or hinder, the wiſhed frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Fancie, ſo fortified by a Princes Favour. To take my farewell, is my thirſting deſire, and to ſeale the deed of my purchaſed Favour, is the Gordian knot, that I moſt wiſh to unlooſe, Be true to thy Queene, wiſe to thy ſelfe, give thy Thoughts no tongue, nor my Name no record. Thus did hee in another meaning, ſatisfie blinded <hi>Mentiga;</hi> who proud of her ſurmiſed ſucceſſe, was ſo raviſhed with joy, that taking a compendious farewell, ſhee poſted (in the conceit of her happie endeavours) to feaſt <hi>Eugenia</hi> with her glad tydings.</p>
            <p>And no ſooner was ſhee gone, but that <hi>Sirap</hi> falling on his knees, beſought God to guard his innocencie, from all <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian</hi> perils, and to free his chaſte tboughts from thoſe tempting <hi>Syrens,</hi> thoſe ruinating Follies, and thoſe laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and nefarious Aſſaults; and that hee would ſo direct him in his wiſedome, and defend him by his power, that he might ſafely (without interuption) goe to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and for the good of his Sanctuarie, remoove that Piller of his Church out of the Houſe of <hi>Dagon,</hi> and bring him home to bee a Glory to his Temple. This Sacrifice was his ſafeguard; His vertuous determination, and conſtant reſolution, meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted well; but his firme affiance in his God, and dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on Divine perfection, ſhielded him, no doubt, from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of that adherent miſchiefe that fell fatally upon the <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Mentiga:</hi> Yet in ſeeking to avoyd <hi>Sylla,</hi> he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12144:60"/>
feared to fall into <hi>Charibdes:</hi> His non-appearance, would make his fraud apparant; and his deluſion, might draw on his ſecret deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Mentiga</hi> comming to her Soveraigne Lady (who long had expected her before ſhe came, though ſhe came long before reaſon could expect her,) chearefully recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto her, what <hi>Sirap</hi> (in truth, but not truely) had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtingly delivered unto her; how pleaſing her Meſſage was to him, how joyfully he entertained the Name of Love, how feelingly he entered into compariſon for his affection, and how comfortably he embraced the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his deſired Fare-well. Theſe, and other demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of Paſſion, ſhe ſo fully and pleaſantly related, that <hi>Eugenia</hi> drowning all thoughts of danger in the conceite of her approaching happineſſe, ſhe dreamed of nought but <hi>Loves</hi> Embracements, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> Delights, and wantonizing Sports; building a Pallace of Pleaſure in her minde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe meant to feaſt all her Amorous deſires, and crowne her thoughts with ſweet Content. To this end, ſhe gave <hi>Mentiga</hi> in charge, that nothing ſhould be wanting, that ſhould be requiſite to further theyr deſignes; Whilſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <hi>Sirap</hi> (being thus Chequ'd by a Queene) lay ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how he might drive it to a Stall, and not receive the Mate, but give ſpeed to his departure. Reſolved he was, not to touch the forbidden Fruit, nor to drinke on <hi>Cirſes</hi> Cuppe; he would not with the Spider ſucke poyſon out of a fayre Flower, nor ſpotte his True-love with the dregges of Maieſty. Proude bewitching Pleaſure could not intice him to Folly, nor rich alluring Treaſures corrupt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant integrity: Hee ſcorned to ſell his Loyalty for Lucre, or Love for Sylver: True wiſedome made his vertuous minde to bend, rather to that which was good in it ſelfe, then to that, which by evill mindes might be judged good. In briefe, his concluſion was, to excuſe his not comming, by expreſſe Commaund from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> that as that night, he ſhould conſult with his <hi>Viſiers,</hi> concerning his negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Babylon.</hi> But this falſe colour need no allowance;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12144:60"/>
Diſpleaſed Iuſtice tooke away all exception, and ſealed him pardon before any accuſation; For the diſmall night being come, Vengeance attended her fatall hower; which appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, ſhe accordingly, changed her attire with <hi>Mentiga,</hi> and brought her as her Hand-mayde to her Royall Bedde, and after, went to <hi>Mentiga's</hi> Chamber, where ſhe waking, wayted for the appointed hower; which come, ſhe caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>Mentigaes</hi> Night-gowne, with a bold heart (beyond the reſolve of her weake Sexe) ſhe paced downe the ſtayres that led into the Garden; Into which ſhe no ſooner entred, but that ſhe ſawe the angry Heavens (then cladde all in blacke) throwing downe with violence, a fiery threatning Starre over-croſſe the Garden, forbidding her farther paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, notwithſtanding the ſable Skies lent not then an other Light: This prodigious Signe, and fearefull premonition, might well have appaled, and back'd a more redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heart, but that the voluptuouſneſſe of her thoughts, extinguiſhed the light of her minde: Love gave her bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and unlimited Luſt directed her (according to her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and deſtinated Fate) vnto the Poſterne gate, which ſhe with nimble facility opened, and there made her feareleſſe ſtand. O imperious and impious Love; thou deluding Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, how rightly did the Poets, and Painters, paint thee blinde, and naked? Since thou haſt no eyes to ſee into how many dangers thou leadeſt thy ſervants; and like thy ſelfe, makes them both blinde and naked, diſroabing them of all their vertuous abilliments, that their naked ſhame may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in theyr found purſuites. Who ſeeketh thee, findeth deceite; and whoſoever followes thee, ſeeketh reproach, and obtaineth repentance. <hi>Care,</hi> is thy Court; <hi>Tyranny,</hi> thy raigne; <hi>Slaves,</hi> thy Subiects; <hi>Folly,</hi> thy attendance; <hi>Luſt,</hi> thy Law; <hi>Sinne,</hi> thy ſervice, and <hi>Repentance</hi> thy wages. But this mighty <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> whoſe wretched folly, was cloathed in danger, had not long wayted for her owne woe, but that there came a baſe <hi>Sarazen</hi> towards her, who of purpoſe did ſtraggle that way, to ceaze upon ſome prey; the fall of whoſe ſteps, gave the found <hi>Sultaneſſe</hi> ſuch hope of <hi>Siraps</hi>

then comming, that over raſhly running upon him; hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for certaine that it was he; ſhe ſaid, Come, come my beſt beloved; and goe with me, where I will lodge thy love in pleaſures lap, and guerdonthy labour with fulneſſe of gold; And therewithall ſhe kiſt him, more then oft deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his rough habit had been but the cloake of his craft. For the Prince, and the Peaſant, differeth but in the fleece, not in the fleſh. But the ſubtile <hi>Sarazen</hi> being capable of his owne good, apprehended the errour, and in hope of gaine, adventured the ſucceſſe. Thus did the mounting Kite, ſeaze on a homely prey, and in her blindneſſe, preferre a greaſie Lampe, before a bright and mighty Starre; and throwing her Mentle upon him, led him towards her laſt prepared bed: where he fearing to be diſcovered, diſveſted himſelfe of his homely habite and rough ſhirt.</p>
            <q>
               <l>And did (redid, and often did) full well,</l>

            <p>And in this furfeit of pleaſure did they cloy themſelves, till themſelves had wholly ſpent themſelves. When wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with delights, they both were ſummoned by leadden <hi>Morpheus</hi> to banquet with blood and death. For the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> (by divine decree) dreaming that night, that the roofe of <hi>Eugenias</hi> Chamber did renting part it ſelfe in two, and was open; and that hee ſawe deſcending downe from a blacke Cloud; a grim ſwarty man, cloathed in a ſhort ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured garment, all to be rent, holding a broad ruſty ſword, dyed with Vermillion red in his beſmeared hand. Who falling on the tapeſtred floare, ſtoode not long; but that <hi>Eugenia</hi> came ſmiling all in white, beſprinkled thicke with blood, and put on him a ſcarlet roabe, ſet her Diadem on his ſhaggie head; kiſſed, and embraced him oft, and then taking him by the ſoyled hand, led him towards her royall bed; which the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſeeming to ſee, cryed out, and ſaid;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12144:61"/>
Stay villaine, ſtay: The Eagle made not her neſt, for the Owle to lye in; The Batte hath no eyes to looke upon the Sunne, nor may the Keſtrell make her pearch within her beames. And therewithall graſping for his Semitar, hee amazedly awaked, and finding it but a dreame, ſmiled, yet was wounded with no little wonder at the ſtrangeneſſe of the ſame. His thoughts ſtill were troubled, and his heart (led thereunto by the force of Fate) gave him ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſire to goe offer incenſe to <hi>Venus,</hi> in <hi>Eugenias</hi> ſhrine, that ſuddenly taking his night roabe, his Semitary, and his key, (which purpoſely hee had made for his ſole, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate paſſage at all times into her Chamber) hee went to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his wanton Sacrifice; and being entred, finding by the dawne of day (for the night began to caſt off her blacke Mantle) that all things as he thought were well, he ioyed at the illuſion of his phantaſticall dreame, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment thereof, withdrawing a little the curtaine, he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly layd him downe by <hi>Mentigaes</hi> ſide: who vpon his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance awaked, and finding her ſelfe intangled in her owne device, grew fearefull of the iſſue, and kept her ſelfe as cloſe as might be. The <hi>Sultans</hi> kinde intreaties, found no reſiſtance, nor yet any pleaſing entertainment. The feare of her death, tooke away all delight of dalliance; and thoſe pleaſures which before ſhee made her Paradice, ſhee now deemed them a mortall puniſhment. Faine would ſhe have killed herſelfe, for feare of death, but death gave her no meanes of death. In this deadly terrour, ſhee lay ſo diſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that every member began ſo to tremble and ſhake, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> in tenderneſſe of her health, (fearing ſickneſſe ſuddaine attachment) haſtily tooke her in his armes, and kiſſing her many times, asked how ſhe fared, but receiving no anſwere (for ſuddaine ſurpriſed Treaſon hath no tongue) he bare her towards the light, to give her better ayre, when ſeeing who ſhe was, and one whom he had ſpent his enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced pleaſures; miſſing <hi>Eugenia,</hi> and remembring his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking dreame; all enraged, hee caſt her to the floare, and treading on her throate, hee tooke his Semitar, and thruſt it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12144:62"/>
quite through her heart, and then violently running at the doore, that opened into <hi>Mentigaes</hi> Chamber, hee burſt it open: The noyſe whereof awaked the ſturdy ſlave, that he might ſee his owne death; who ſeeing one enter with his drawne Sword, not knowing who hee was, nor where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was, leap'd out of his banefull bed, and ſnatching a bed-ſtaffe in his hand, fiercely ruſhed upon his unknowne Lord, got within him, and beeing the ſtronger, had him downe, and ſo liberally belaboured him, that the blood running downe his face, well witneſſed, that the ſlave alone, now leſſe reſpected, and feared him; then many Nations, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt Armies, and greateſt Princes, that onely had trembled at his ſight. Which made the <hi>Sultan</hi> in his diſmay, cry; Treaſon, treaſon; at the hearing whereof, came running in, two Ianizaries that were of his Guard, whoſe allotment was that day amongſt many others to attend. They ſeeing this ſtrange accident, pulled the raſcall off the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and hewed him all to pieces. But the <hi>Sultaneſſe</hi> thus ſurprized with ſhame, with feare, and with amazement, was more confounded at the baſe ſight of her reproachfull deceit, then at the bloudy ſummons of pale Death; and becauſe ſhee would not ſee her owne ſhame, nor looke murther in the face, ſhee crept over the head into the bed, crying fearefully, No <hi>Moore,</hi> no <hi>Moore;</hi> becauſe ſhe ſaw, ſhee had not layne with the <hi>Moore.</hi> Which made <hi>Solimon</hi> ſuppoſe, that ſhee cryed that hee ſhould ſtay his hand, and doe no more; which diſtaſtfull conceit, exaſperated his anger, and added more fewell to his enflamed fire, and in the heate of his irefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, hee ſtep'd to her adulterous bed, and like a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous ſtorme, hee fell upon her, giving her ſtab upon ſtab, ſaying oft withall; Nay, thus much more, and more: And the more hee ſayd ſo, the more hee thruſt his Semitar (not yet dryed with the bloud of the Sarazen) into her body. This ſpeedy and ſuddaine execution, was <hi>Siraps</hi> preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For it tooke away all further knowledge of the cauſe. The Court was now all in combuſtion, and the City hearing that the <hi>Sultan</hi> was ſlaine, inſtantly did riſe, and confuſedly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12144:62"/>
did runne to the Pallace, bearing all downe before them, in ſuch a diſtract ſort, that the Turkes Guard was glad to ſhut the gates againſt them, and to entreate the <hi>Sultan</hi> to ſhew himſelfe out of the Caſement vnto them, which ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed them, that they quietly returned to their houſes. Then was inquiſition made after the knowledge of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens</hi> apparell, which was ſo baſe, that all men wondred not onely that he was there, but how he came there. His mangled body kept him vnknowne, and his meane habite made him no appertenant to the Court. When no notice could be had neither of the one, nor of the other, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed <hi>Sultan</hi> ſent for the Eunuckes that attended his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſſe, and cauſed two <hi>Mutes</hi> to ſtrangle them in his ſight. After, he cauſed all the dead bodies, with the two beds, and all their apparell, to be caried forth of the Citie, and to bee burned all together; and further, gaue in charge, that the two Chambers ſhould be conuerted into houſes of baſe vſe, and that no one vnder paine of death ſhould after ſpeake thereof.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sirap,</hi> who during theſe tempeſtuous ſtormes, lay at anchor in his owne private harbour: as one that knew well, that great men euer enuying the glory, and fortune of ſtrangers, would in this tumults be ready, to ſtab at the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of merit; and that miſchiefe (the curſed Captaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of the vnruly Commons) might in a diſturbed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore endanger his ſafety; hearing now that the ſight of the <hi>Sultan</hi> had allayed the windie Allarum of his rumoured death, and that the preſent murther of the <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> with her Mayde, and vnknowne Paramour, was the occaſion of ſuch diſorder riſing; He grew jealous of the cauſe, ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the errour, and timorous of his welfare. For, though guarded with innocencie, yet was he fearefull, leſt <hi>Mentiga</hi> had caſt ſome ſcandalizing aſperſion vpon his vnſpotted ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. In this fearefull doubt, he kept himſelfe within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, vntill report had further manifeſted not only the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all their deathes, but the ignorance of the cauſe. This diſpierced all cloudes of care, and made him a perfect Iudge
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12144:63"/>
both of the errour, and the event. Then lifting vp his ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted heart, hee ſaid: O <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> thy love I ſee now, hath given me a ſecond life, and my conſtant loyalty, hath kept me from the grave. <hi>Juſtice</hi> hath preſerved the guiltleſſe, and righteouſneſſe hath found mercy in iudgement. Now prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be my God, my ſtrong defence; For hee hath covered me under the wings of his protection, and kept mee from the death of the wicked. Hee hath caſt downe lightning, and burnt up the daughters of <hi>Babell,</hi> that I might be ſafe in their ſuddaine deſtruction. The ſtorme is paſt, and theſe cloudy occurrants threaten another tempeſt. The Sea can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo calme in Summer, but that it may ſwell again with the rage of wrathfull Winter; There is more wiſedome in preventing, then in redreſſing a miſchiefe; Security lives not in tyranny. For though the Tygar hide his clawes, yet in the end, will hee ſhew his Rapine. Revenge hath now ſmoothed the <hi>Sultans</hi> angry browe, and Time hath given ſome peace to his diſpleaſure. The Tide ſerves me, and my prophane aboad with the heathen, is diſpleaſing to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. My Captived Lord cals me away, and <hi>Vienna</hi> ſayes, I am too ſlowe; my marke is ſet, and I levell ſtraight, I will commend my ayme; and therewithall caſting off all further deliberation, he went to the Court to take his leave of <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Who ſeeing him ſtand upon his departure, after ſome private conference, &amp; proteſtations, that he would crowne his returne with higheſt honours advancement, he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed graciouſly to imbrace him, and ſo bad him farewell. The next morning <hi>Sirap</hi> having before cauſed all things to be in readineſſe, the windes ſummoning him to Sea, hee tooke ſhipping, and ſayling by the Ilands, ſcituate in part of the Mediteranian Sea, he landed at <hi>Sidon,</hi> a Port Towne in <hi>Syria,</hi> and there taking Horſe, hee poaſted through the Country, and part of the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and ſo came to <hi>Babylon.</hi> Where we will leave him to looke into <hi>France,</hi> and ſee how <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> brookes her continued thraldome, which was not ſo grievous unto her, as the tormenting ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Sir <hi>Paris</hi> loſſe. Great was her ſorrow in feare of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:12144:63"/>
him, and many her bemoanings for not hearing from him. In ſo much, that <hi>La-nova</hi> ſeeing the increaſe of her grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cares, thus ſadly ſpake unto her.</p>
            <p>Madame, theſe ruthleſſe walls neither melt with your teares, nor yet ſhake, nor ſhrinke with your ſighes. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort dwels not in reſtraint, nor lives Remedie in Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Though your Father be abſent, yet hath he left a iealous Keeper: You may ever weepe and bewayle your eſtate, and lye ſtill in the bed of ſorrow: If you never ſeeke after redreſſe, you ſhall ever finde your ſelfe a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: You know the ſecret way I made to releive you; If ſo you pleaſe, I will convey you through the ſame, to ſome private place, where Metamorphoſed, we will eyther hunt in queſt after Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> or you ſhall reſt unknowne in ſome forraigne Nation, till eyther my travaile ſhall gaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his aboade, or that the death of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> ſhall leave (you for your right) to the tryall of your Friends. Then caſt off theſe mortifying dumpes, and leave now your ſorrow to the Governours, as a pawne for your returne, and let us ſtand upon our Fortunes: Hope lives in Induſtry. and my Adventures ſhall ever wayte on your pleaſure.</p>
            <p>This kinde offer did moove her much, but could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moove her at all: Liberty ſhe ſaid was ſweete to that life, that might take the pleaſures of this life; But to a deiected heart whoſe baniſht content could promiſe no wiſhed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; there a Cloſe-priſon was better then a glorious Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. To travaile (ſhe ſaid) to my <hi>Paris;</hi> would be more pleaſing then painefull to <hi>Vienna;</hi> but not knowing where he is, I might perhaps extravagantly goe further from him then Iam, that am already further off then I would be: Here for his Love was I made a Priſoner, and here will I ſtill reſt a Priſoner for his Love. If he be living and loving, here ſhall I ſooneſt heare from him; and if he be neither in Love nor in Life, here will I end both my Love and Life: Onely take thankes for thy loving care, and kinde reſpect, and be ſtill a true Friend to <hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>Vienna</hi> may ever take comfort in <hi>La-nova.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:12144:64"/>
Vpon this concluſion he parted, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſtrewed the Ruſhes over the private way that gave him entrance: But no ſooner was it done, but that one of the Keepers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (that ſeemed ever moſt ſerviceable unto her) came in, whom the deviliſh <hi>Daulphinis</hi> had before faſhioned to her purpoſe, for ſhe wrought upon his want, as knowing well, that Povertie betrayeth Vertue, and that Wealth bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Wit; Corruption having made him her Creature, ſhee had inſtructed him how to trayne <hi>Vienna</hi> to her deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for nought but Death could ſatisfie her diſdaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full feare: Her malicious and unbounded pride, locked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the danger of her Lords returne: If the <hi>Daulphin</hi> fell, then muſt <hi>Vienna</hi> (though now a Priſoner) be Soveraigne. This made her heart-burning hate to proſecute her over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: And though ſhee had no cauſe to feare her, (for occaſion never yet made her her enemy) yet could ſhe not indure to thinke that ſhee ſhould bee Subject to another, that now was moſt eminent in her ſelfe. To have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, was all her ambitious deſire, and nothing did let but <hi>

               <hi>Don Poltron</hi> (for ſo was hee rightly named) bringing <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennas</hi> mornings repaſt to her, with a bemoaning tongue, and a ſighing heart, complained much againſt Nature, and enveyed more againſt Fortune, that had made beauty ſo miſerable, and Vertue ſo unhappie, as to entombe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the one, and the effecacie of the other, in ſo unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and ſo uncomfortable a place. My eyes (ſayd hee) cannot indure to ſee Dignity ſo diſgraced; nor can my Eares entertaine the killing ſound of your laments: I muſt, and will leave my wounding Service, that at longth I may bee a Stranger to ſorrow, leaſt my griefe for your griefe, make my revived woes as great as your griefe.</p>

Why ſayd <hi>

But in the height of my ioyes and hope of higheſt happineſſe, Death deprived me of my Paradiſed Bliſſe, and not onely made my broken heart the ſad habitation of woe, but alſo turned my mind (which before was a Kingdome to me) into a Hell of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting thoughts. The place of my Birth grew (by her loſſe) ſo hatefull to me, that I was neceſſitated to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the ground that yeelded me no other harveſt but griefe. In briefe, for better portage, I turned all my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance into Iewels of eſtimate, and travelled to <hi>Naples</hi> where I ſpent more of my Wealth then I did of my woes. Then Repentance made me leave that waſtfull Nation, and

ſo I came unfortunately into <hi>France.</hi> Thus he drew on her attention with a faigned tale, that he might without all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition, and with better gaine of beliefe, give more fewell to her deſire, for his further betraying diſcourſe. And to blinde all iealous thoughts, he purpoſely ſeemed by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt end, to be unwilling to proceed further. But <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennois,</hi> where neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled mee to ſeeke this ſervice. And this moſt vertuous Princeſſe, is the Map of my miſery; and ſo hee ſeemed to end, before he had begun; that the Fiſh might bite the more eagerly, when the bayte was pulled away: But oh, ſaid <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> (for now ſhe had ſwallowed the hidden, and hurtfull hooke) didſt thou not perceive the cauſe of his ſo ſecret, and ſo great a griefe? Yes Noble Lady, ſaid <hi>Poltron.</hi> Time and Occaſion gave me meanes to know the ſame; Then good <hi>Poltron,</hi> let me intreat thee ſhe ſaid, to relate the full diſcourſe thereof. For ſuch Subiects of woe, beſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth wofull mindes, and cauſes of dolour and calamity, are ever moſt pleaſing to perplexed perſons. <hi>Poltron</hi> thus hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on, to ſet the trap, that ſhould enſnare her life, thus cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly gave fire to her tinder.</p>
            <p>Though, ſaid he, I am unwilling to ingrieve my thoughts with the ſad remembrance of my friends over-grieuous ſorrowes; yet ſince it is your pleaſure, your will commands my obedience. Then know, moſt faireſt of faire Ladies, that after I had many times obſerved the frenzie of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: and wondring, had noted his broken and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant complaints; hee being at other times moſt adviſedly wiſe, and moſt humbly (though ſadly) patient: As wee were ſitting at the mouth of his Cave, chatting on the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this life, and the croſſes of this uncertaine world, I requeſted him in favour of my deſire, to recount unto me, the cauſe of his ſo often paſſionate laments. In anſwere whereof, he ſaid.</p>
            <p>Though my griefe be already ſuch, as there can be no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſo great an extreame; and though my wounds can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:12144:66"/>
be healed, becauſe they may not be ſearched; yet to giue thee ſome content, know that not farre from <hi>Tolledo</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> I ſerued not long ſince a great and mighty Lord, called <hi>Don Daulphinatus;</hi> who had one onely daughter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Paris-enna,</hi> whoſe beauty was farre fairer then the euening ſtarre, and whoſe vertue was more powerfull then the greateſt conſtellation. By her ſweet influence did I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liue, and breathe; and though my meane fortune durſt not gaze on ſo bright a Planet, yet did her gracious aſpect both ſo ennoble, and inable my towring thoughts, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne I atchiued in honour of her name, many admired exployts. After ſome ſeaſon, both my acts, and my loue, were accidentally made knowne to her, who in time made mee (though moſt unworthy) the Maiſter of her deſires, that was, and ſtill am, a ſervant to her will. Our mutuall mindes thus combined, was like the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in grew more delights, then either Nature now affords, or Art can expreſſe. Our hearts fed on pleaſures, our eyes beheld the bliſſe of each other, and in the full comfort of all content, did we ſleepe in love; and wake, and walke, in all fulneſſe of ioy. From this Paradice, were we driven by fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonious Fortune, who envying our happineſſe, would not ſuffer that we ſhould make this earth our heaven, that was before curſt for our ſinnes. My Lord, her Father, had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, who finding my indignity not worthy of ſuch ſoveraignty, was ſo caried away with diſdainfull ſcorn, and irefull diſpleaſure, that he doomed me to death, if ever I were found within the precinct of his command. This ſeparation (for now I was put to my flight) was ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſive to both our confounded ſoules, that ſhe ſtayed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a greater miſery the deprivation of life; and I wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in unknowne pathes, to ſeeke after a wiſhed death. Long was my travaile, and manifold my fortunes: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance of place, continuance of travaile, happineſſe of fortune, nor tract of time, could free my fancie, nor weary me from my conſtant affection. At laſt, being both wearied and nighted, I came to this harmeleſſe Cell; where in love
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:12144:66"/>
of Solitarineſſe, and in contempt of the world, I vowed to ſpend the unſpent ſorrowes of my Life, and keepe my ſelfe from the knowledge of Men; and thereupon, he devoutly ſwore mee, that I ſhould not make his private aboad knowne to any Man. Whereat the wounded Princeſſe, in her apprehenſion, ſighed, and watered the floare with her baulmy Teares, as knowing by the amplyfied, and conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Names, and by the concurrence and circumſtance of the Matter, that hee was moſt aſſuredly her beloved <hi>Paris;</hi> and thereupon, ſhee demanded what was his Name? <hi>Sans Lieure</hi> (replyed <hi>Poltron)</hi> did he call himſelfe. <hi>Sans Lieure,</hi> ſayd ſhe? Oh how rightly did the Deſtinies Chriſten him; and how truely doth his Name expreſſe his Fate; For Griefe hath but a dead heart, and hapleſſe Love none at all: But where is that Place of playnt, that ſo confines Sorrow in it ſelfe, and makes Woe a habitation for ſo miſerable a Man? Tell mee, O tell me, that I may ſend ſome Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſon to comfort him, and weyne him from ſo wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a life.</p>
            <p>My Oath (anſwered <hi>Poltron,)</hi> will not admit, that any Man be my meanes ſhould know thereof. Then would I were (ſhee ſayd) with him my ſelfe, for by his Name (I now remember) hee is that Divining Man that hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Wonders, and can tell what ſhall befall every one; Oft have I heard of him, and ſtrange things by him fore-told hath come to paſſe. Thus did they both diſguiſe theyr mindes, and with untempered Morter, daube up their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall concealed meanings, and hidden intentions, that they might both the better worke out theyr Advantages. But <hi>Poltron</hi> ſeeing his venemous Plot had (without all ſuſpect) thus poyſoned her beliefe; boldly told her, That as ſhe was no <hi>Man,</hi> ſhee was not within the Condition of his Bond, and therefore (if ſo ſhe pleaſed) he would not only give her full liberty, but alſo bring her unknowne to that hapleſſe Hermite, whom ſhee deſired much to ſee, provided that ſhee ſhould give him Gold, to bring him after to his native Home, and alſo bee directed by him, both for the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12144:67"/>
meanes and the manner of theyr eſcape, and travaile. To this, ſhe anſwered, that Priſons were no Treaſure-houſes, and that ſhe had no Minte to anſwere her minde; onely ſome reſerved Iewels ſhe had, which ſhe would give him. It ſhall (ſaid he) ſuffice; Pitty pleades in your behalfe, your merit claymes redreſſe, and my feeling griefe, to ſee a Princeſſe ſo diſtreſt, commandes the hazard of my Life. Be you but ſilent and ſecret, and you ſhall ſee, that I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the waking eyes of encharged wiſedome, and over-throw the heedfull care of repoſed truſt: And thus it muſt be: By the Print of the Keyes (which I will make in Waxe) will I make other like Keyes, by which all the doores ſhall congee to your Will, and give paſſage to your pleaſure. Then will I have you, for our better ſecurity, homely atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a Boxe under your arme, and Bone-lace hanging out of it, a payre of Shieres tyed to your Girdle, &amp; a Yeard in your hand, that you may ſeeme to be, not what you are, but what in appearance I would have you ſhew to be. And I will with a Pedlers packe on my backe, well ſuited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, travell along with you as your Husband: So ſhall wee both better eſcape, and avoyd ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>But how, ſayd <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſhall <hi>Izabella</hi> beſtow her ſelfe? She, ſayd <hi>Poltron,</hi> muſt ſtay behind in Priſon, to take away the knowledge of our flight; For after our departure, ſhe muſt locke the doore againe, keepe your Bed with the Curtaines drawne, and lay your Cloathes by, moſt in ſight; and when any comes into her, ſhe muſt carefully ſay, that you are not well, and that you are layde downe to ſleepe: So ſhall wee gaine time to prevent our haſty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, and ſhe may after, at her will, repaire to ſome private Friend, in ſuch diſguiſe as I will provide for her. That (ſayd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna)</hi> may not be; for I will never leave her, that hath never forſaken me; Nor will I without her, venture upon any ſuch adventure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poltron</hi> ſeeing it would not otherwiſe be, yeelded, though unwilling thereunto, and like Sinnes Solicitor, mooved, that <hi>Izabella</hi> would play the Pedler, and he would
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12144:67"/>
become a Tinker, with his Budget on his backe, a leathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren coloured Apron before him, a Hammer under his Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and a Brazen Ladle in one of his hands; And thus with his Face beſmeared, would he goe a pretty way before them, as none of their company, and yet guide them in the way. So gallant a Bonelace-ſeller, ſo proud a Pedler, and ſo ſtoute a Tinker, all <hi>France</hi> will not patterne; But thus it muſt be, if you Madam will have your deſire: Nor may you ſcorne that meanes, that promiſeth aſſurance of Liberty, and hope of better Happe. The Gods to have theyr wills, diſdained not to undertake the ſhape of Beaſtes; and wee muſt with the cunning Fowler, cloath our ſelves in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if we will deceive wylie Birdes. It is a Soare, no ſinne, to betray Tyrannie; but a ſhift, no ſhame; to get Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>
            <p>Theſe guilefull enticing words of his, and the betraying inſtructions of the deepe deceitefull <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> were (without any ſemblance of other reach) ſo ſmoothly, and paſſionately delivered, by this damnable and perfideous Villaine, that all his wily words were held as Oracles; and the further he ſeemed to be from her, the neerer ſtill hee touched her to the quicke: In ſo much, that <hi>Vienna</hi> being blindly led in her over-affectionate deſire, beyond the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of all due conſideration, yeelded to referre her ſelfe to his Truſt, and to faſhion themſelves according to his Direction.</p>
            <p>Alaſſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> where diſloyall Treaſon threatens thy ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, and where remorceleſſe Murder is thy Plot, there aſſured danger muſt be thy Harbour, and reproachfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thy Hoſt: Implacable malice purſues thee, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fraude betrayes thee, and too late repentance, will I feare, learne thee, that they are moſt miſerable that make themſelves wretched examples to others. But how ſhould Love (the Child of Folly) looke into a plot of policie, when unſeduced wit can not ſee it, nor untainted wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome finde it. The apparance of Trueth, and the ſhew of Pitty, and ſimplicity, hath in all deceitfull Practiſes, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:12144:68"/>
Cities, depoſed Kings, defrauded Subiects of their Rightes, and taken away the guitleſſe lives of Innocents. How then poore Princeſſe, couldſt thou avoyd thy running upon the Sandes, though Armies of obiections did riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy doubtfull hazard; yet cannot thy good, though free intention, make thee faulty, though thy over-credulity in entertayning of conjectures made thee erre. Thy chaſt thoughts ſhines ſtill, I ſee, in thy vertue; and thy vertue (by divine providence) muſt ſhield thee both from abuſive ſhame, and from unexpected ſlaughter. But now <hi>Poltron</hi> had provided at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennas</hi> coſt all materials; and the Ladies diſroabing themſelves, hid theyr attyres, and to caſt a miſt before the eyes of ignorance, they clothed them to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and at ſupper time, the night being darke, upon <hi>Poltrons</hi> watchword, who then ſtood ſentinell, they came forth, pulling the doore after them: For locke it, <hi>Vienna</hi> would not, becauſe it ſhould appeare which way they came foorth, leaſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> further ſearch, they might find out <hi>La-No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uas</hi> private way, and ſo bring him into trouble, who at the time was in Flanders enquiring after his loſt friend. The next morning their eſcape was diſcovered, the City was ſearcht, <hi>Poltron</hi> miſt, and every way was full of inquiſitors. But that nights travell, and their unſuſpected diſguiſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſuall habite of ſuch wandring profeſſors) brought them ſafe unto a great wood, that ſtood at the foot of a high hill in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where he perſwaded them the <hi>Hermit</hi> had his Cell. At the entrance whereof, <hi>Vienna</hi> ſtumbled, the dull earth forbidding thereby her further paſſage; and <hi>Jza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellas</hi> eyes were ſuddenly, for the time, ſtrucken blinde; as though, the feet of the one, were unwilling to bring their Miſtris into perill: and the eyes of the other were aſhamed to ſee ſuch intended villany. But no preſage can forſtall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, Love lookes altogether after theyr owne fancies, and conſters all things according to her affections. This hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, (the Divels agent,) ſeeing <hi>Vienna</hi> ready to fall, ſtept to her, and taking her by the arme, in ſhew to ſupport her, led her into the thickeſt of the wood, where ſodenly as one
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12144:68"/>
transformed, this ſeeming dove ſhewed himſelfe a vulture; and like Cruelty her ſelfe, with imboſted mouth &amp; ſtaring eyes, he drew his ſhort ſword that hangd by his luſtful ſide, and gaſhly ſwore, that if either of them made any noyſe, he would forthwith kill them both: whereat the weake and wearied Ladyes, were ſo amazed, that all their ſences were ſenceleſſe, their tongues were bound to the peace by Iuſtice feare; they could not ſpeake, nor durſt not cry. Now Luſt, the (execrable parent of murder) ſeeing her abaſhed beauty ſhine like the Sun through a Cloud, had ſo fiered his fancy, that where before it was but kindled by her lookes, now having her within his power, it did violently burne by the touch. Death muſt now forbeare, and attend his pleaſure for his pleaſure; and nothing could ſatisfie this Covetous Foxe, but after the ſtealing of the grapes, he meant to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge the vine. To effect which, he turned <hi>Jzabellas</hi> face to a tree, and bound her armes round about the ſame, and notwithſtanding, flatteringly promiſed them both their lives, if <hi>Vienna</hi> would but conſent to his wanton will; If not, he then prodigally ſwore, that in diſpight of all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he would gather the fruite, now it was ripe, and after leave their flaine bodies a prey unto the beaſts of the field. <hi>Vienna,</hi> having recovered ſome ſpirit, and ſeeing the preſent danger, with elivated eyes, erected hands, &amp; bowed knees, ſhee beſought him not to ſport in her miſery, nor to ſpot his ſoule with the repenting pleaſure of uncleanneſſe. Remember ſayd ſhe, that I am a Princeſſe, ſave but my honour, as thou art my mothers Sonne, and I will freely forgive thee my death as I am my fathers daughter. I ſeeke not life, but the honour of my life; for my long liv'd griefe, makes me hate life, and diſpiſe death, But in the loſſe of my chiefeſt cheriſhed care, my curſes ſhall poyſon thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the wildfire of thy luſt, ſhall burne up all thy worldly welfare, and make thee a ſpeedy prey to ſpeedy deſtruction. O let then my Chaſte teares quench the flame of thy ſinfull Concupiſcence; blaſt not the beauty of the Lilly in the bud; deprive not the Roſe of the fairnes of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12144:69"/>
blome; nor brand not thy ſelfe with the curſed name of a hatefull villaine. The fierceſt Lyon hath no cruelty to hurt a Royall Virgine; Man was made to helpe, not to hurt a ſilly Mayd; and the Lord of hoſtes, hath countleſſe plagues to puniſh ſuch offenders. Thy carnall regard is but momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, but thy ſhame will be everlaſting, and thy puniſhment eternall; For repentance followes fruition; and the reward of ſin is death. Thus did ſhe pray, plead and intreat, and thus would ſhe have diſſwaded him from doing evill, that never yet knew good. But his unruly paſſion, and thirſt of blood, could brook neither interceſſion, nor interruption. His hot untamed deſires prayd in ayde of force, which made her ſhricke, and call full loud on Gods Iuſtice for helpfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; when ſodenly the angry heavens began to make warre againſt him, and to threaten him with a terrible voyce, ſending foorth ſuch fearefull thunder, lightning, and powerfull ſtormes, that force perforce, he was inforced to deſiſt for the time. But as the wofull Ladyes continued ſtill their ſhouting cryes; It fortuned that two Peaſants that had Pomage in the wood, had beene ſeeking of their ſwine who by violence of the diſturbed Skies, and wrathfull Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had taken ſhelter under a Tree. As thus they ſilent ſtood, praying for preſervation, they heard theyr diſmall cries, and haſting (for ſo their good Angels would) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place of playnt, they found the obdurate Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor attempting a freſh aſſault; which made, the ſwifter Man comming in with his Batte, to make him looſe his laſcivious hold.</p>
            <p>This happy accident revived the dying heart of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> and the guilty dread of <hi>Poltron,</hi> fearing to be taken, made him ſo deſperate, that he both wounded and grounded the gentle Peaſant; and as he endeavoured to take away his life, the other comming in, knockt out his braines. This ſpeedy diſpatch gave the Divell his due, &amp; freed the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinis</hi> of all ſuſpect, who otherwiſe had by Drugge taken order for his perpetuall concealements. The Ladies thus ſuccoured, freed, and comforted, prayſed God for their
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:12144:69"/>
deliuerance, and thanked the poore Men for their aſſiſtance; And in guerdon of their ſo happie ſeruice, not knowing otherwiſe how to requite ſo great a good, they wiſhed (concealing themſelues) that they would bring them to the Gouernour of <hi>Viennois,</hi> who they knew would boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully reward them. The vncapable Peaſants, ſmyling thereat, told them, that they would not for <hi>Jaſons</hi> Labour, ſeeke after <hi>Coridons</hi> Hyre: For Perſons (ſaid they) ſo vnremarkable, can neither pleaſure nor profit greatneſſe of State. To which, the Princeſſe anſwered, that by her meanes, they ſhould deliuer into his hands, the two Ladies that were committed to his charge, and that lately had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed themſelues out of Priſon. This golden hope did winne their conſents, and not onely refreſhed them in their Trauaile, but alſo gaue ſpeed to their Iourney: Only it contented <hi>Vienna,</hi> that ſhe ſhould by this meanes requite her Preſeruers, though thereby ſhe made her ſelfe a thrall to time and tyranny. Liberty could giue her no comfort, nor could ſhe tell how hetter to diſpoſe of her loathed Life, then to make her ſelfe a Priſoner to <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Fortune:</hi> The care ſhe had of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> made her the more ſenſetiue of her wrongs; And therefore turning towards her, ſhee ſoftly ſaid; Though the Fruit of the Olyfe-tree come late, yet is the Liquor both good and wholeſome. The tyde now ſerueth, my deere <hi>Iſabella,</hi> take thou the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite thereof, and at laſt free thy ſelfe from participating of my further woes: <hi>Fortune</hi> hath bound my life prentiſe to her frownes, and I am reſolued to ſerue out my time; then leaue me to my fate, and get thee to ſome more happy place, where my Prayers, and thy more fortunate Friends, may purchaſe thee more content.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jſabellas</hi> impearled teares did publiſh her miſlike, and in her griefe ſhe ſaid, that Loue neuer thought that time too long, that did hang on deſert; and that ſorrowes growne to a cuſtome, were pleaſing to miſerable Creatures: Then what ſhould ſeperate my attendance from your Grace, ſince without you I cannot liue, and with you I meane to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:12144:70"/>
dye. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> thanking her, joyed no little in her conſtant Fellowſhip: For Friendſhip is ever moſt ſweeteſt, when Fortune is moſt ſowreſt.</p>
            <p>Thus as they chatted, they came to <hi>Viennois,</hi> where ſhe adviſed theyr two good Conductors, to wayt for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours going to the Church, and then boldly to ſtep to him, and ſecretly to proffer him the delivery of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and her Companion; which done, you ſhall private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring us to him, unto whom wee will preſent what we have promiſed. The Peaſants promiſe (having done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to inſtruction) made the Governour to rejoyce ſo at the newes, that hee returned backe to his houſe, and ſent one of them for the Princeſſe, who yet was not knowne to bee the Princeſſe. Vpon theyr returne, <hi>Vienna</hi> with ſhew of Maieſtie, thus greeted the Governour.</p>
            <p>Let not my Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance</hi> wonder at our diſguiſe, nor queſtion the Cauſe: It may ſuffice, you have your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and wee are content with our alotments: Reward well theſe honeſt Perſons, that with hazard of then Lives, have not onely preſerved our Honours and Lives but alſo freed you from many Cares, and ſaved you perhaps from dangerous troubles. This is all our deſires, we know your charge, and willingly yeeld to your diſpoſe. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour baring (in due reverence) his aged head, with more teares of pittie then of joy, reſpectively ſaluted them, and giving the Peaſants ſtore of Crownes, humbly and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly hee brought the Ladyes to their carefull Chamber, where wee well leave them to learne of <hi>Sirap,</hi> what ſucceſſe wayted on his <hi>Babilonian</hi> endeavours.</p>
            <p>Now had time, and travell, brought <hi>Sirap</hi> (whom wee left in his Iourney) unto <hi>Babilon;</hi> where the <hi>Soldan</hi> (to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>Turke,</hi> and to ſhew his love to Vertue, and his eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Merit) entertayned him with all Magnificence, and variety of Kingly Delights. But after they had feaſted, and ſpent ſome dayes in Courtly ſports: <hi>Sirap</hi> being mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his Lord, deſired to ſee the City, with ſuch Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Antiquities, as were therein; which ſo well
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12144:70"/>
pleaſed the <hi>Soldan,</hi> that to honour him the more, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed him in perſon, ſtill ſhewing him by his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, all ſuch places of note and worth, as then were there remaining: At length they paſt by, (for ſo their paſſage lay) the Caſtle wherein the <hi>Daulphin</hi> was impriſoned. Which Sir <hi>Sirap</hi> long viewing, commended, and in his praiſe thereof, demanded by his Interpreter, what Caſtle or Pallace that was, that was ſo well ſcituated, ſo ſtately built, and of ſuch ſtrength. And they told him, that it was called <hi>Mount Semerian,</hi> built of old by <hi>Semiramis,</hi> Queene unto the firſt great King of the <hi>Aſſyrian Monarchy,</hi> And that as then, there lay as priſoner one of the greateſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>France</hi> in the Weſterne Clime; knowne by the name of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennois, Sirap</hi> ſeemed much to wonder both at the name and Country, as unheard of before, and therefore was deſirous to ſee the ſtature, favour, cariage and manner of thoſe men; and to learne, if he could, the nature, law, religion, cuſtome, and State of the Countrey; which ſtoode ſo well with the <hi>Soldans</hi> liking, that both in one deſire, went to the Caſtle to ſee, and to conferre with the <hi>Daulphin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sirap</hi> building on <hi>Boufoyes</hi> fidelity, as having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what poſſeſt him with his purpoſe, and wrought him to his will; did vſe him as an Interpretour betwixt him and the <hi>Daulphin:</hi> For hee would not altogether, yet diſcover himſelfe to <hi>Boufoy,</hi> and therfore ſpeaking to him in Greek, hee commanded that he ſhould Salute the <hi>Daulphin</hi> in his name, and tell him, that as a Stranger hee was come to ſee him, and of meere humanity to viſite him; which the <hi>Daulphin</hi> kindly accepting, as kindly regreeted, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him with all the gracious remonſtrances hee could. <hi>Sirap</hi> bad him then aske what his Country was, how great; by what lawes they were governed, under what title they were ſubiected, what Religion they obſerved, and what God they chiefly adored; unto which the <hi>Daulphin</hi> thus briefly anſwered.</p>
            <p>

ſpacious, as having in it 27. thouſand Pariſh Churches; It is moſt fertill, and abounds in all plentifulneſſe of fruits, wines, ſalt, corne, fiſh, and wild-fowle; There are many Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities famous therein (the nurſing mothers of all vertue) out of whoſe breſts, youth drawes out the knowledge of all Arts; It hath many large Provinces; and divers aborde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Principalities owe homage thereunto: The Cities are great, and many; rich in Treaſure: and fayre, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme in building; the chiefe whereof is <hi>Paris,</hi> famous for beauty and bigneſſe: the uſuall reſidence of the King, and great traſtique of all kinde of Marchandize. Our lawes are termed the ciuill Lawes, wherein Iuſtice is tempered, and qualified by equity and conſcience; and equity and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are garded and maintained with Iuſtice. Our Monarch is entituled a King, the moſt Chriſtian King of <hi>France,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe protection his people live ſecure, inioying their owne; and under whoſe Greatneſſe, his Subiects reſt feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of forraigne foes. Our Religion is built upon Gods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Word: Truth is the roote thereof, Charity the branch, and good Workes the fruit. Our Paſtors are our Teachers, who like Lampes conſume themſelves, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten others; theyr Doctrine is examined by the twelue Apoſtles: Our prayers by Chriſt taught ſix Petitions: Our Faith by the generall Creed; and our Lives by Gods tenne Commandements. And where the tongue of <hi>Aaron</hi> cannot perſwade, there the Rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth correct, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Wee ſerve and worſhip one onely GOD, in perſons Three: not confuſed, nor divided; but diſtinct: of one and the ſame divine Eſſence, eternity, power, and quality. God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the Holy Ghoſt. The Father being the firſt, chiefe, and originall cauſe of all things: The Sonne his Word and eternall wiſedome: and the Holy Ghoſt his power, vertue, and efficacie. This is that God, that by his Word made the glorious Globe his ſeate, and the maſſie Earth his footſtoole; that fed his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (the unprovided Iſraelites) with food from Heaven, forty yeares in the Wilderneſſe; that divided the Waters,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:12144:71"/>
and brought them dry-foote through the Red Sea, and drencht proud <hi>Pharaoh</hi> therin, that purſued them with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering hearts. To him we offer no burnt offerings, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of blood; but the ſweet interceſſion of devout pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. For thoſe ceremonies ceaſed at the comming of Chriſt, by whom we are called Chriſtians; and wee are received into his Church by Baptiſme, and continued and fed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the other Sacrament of his laſt Supper. And ſuch is our Countrey, theſe our Lawes, ſuch our King; this our Religion, and this the God we onely ſerve, love, feare, and adore. <hi>Sirap</hi> thanked him for his good deſcription, and ſeemed to take pleaſure in the knowledge thereof. Then he demanded how he brookt his Captivity, and hee anſwered like a Prince, and therefore like himſelfe; as one ſubject to chance, and reſolved in the change. Then he bad him aske whether he had any children, and hee all ſighing ſaid, but one onely daughter. Then <hi>Sirap</hi> cauſed him to aske why he then ſo ſighed; and he replying ſaid, that his ſole ſoules griefe conſiſted in her memorry, and ſo made manifeſt his hard, cruell, and unnaturall dealing towards her; and how he had left her a priſoner to his tyranny, and therefore by divine Iuſtice made himſelfe a priſoner to Tyranny. <hi>Sirap</hi> being thus certified, was well pleaſed that <hi>Vienna</hi> yet living, lived his permanent friend; and though hee grieved much for her endurance, yet did he ſmother up his conceived ſorrow, in the recordation of her love. The thought of his exile, and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennaes</hi> thraldome, awaked <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> (the ready Offices of Revenge) to haſten his death: but in the eye of his milder conſideration, knowing him to be his Lord, and <hi>Viennaes</hi> Father; his relenting heart checkd his repining humour, and blew the coales of his hotter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to ſeeke, and to effect his ſpeedy deliverance. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe which, he ſeeming (ſeemed of purpoſe) to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in him, and underſtanding of his Countries cuſtomes, commodities, and government. And therefore he requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Soldan</hi> for the continuance of his contentment, and for his further knowledge of forraigne affaires, to admit,

and tollerate his thither repayre, that he might hereafter (if cauſe ſo required) reduce his learing to practice; which the <hi>Soldan</hi> graunting, gave in charge for his free acceſſe, and ſo they departed; the one glad in that hee had, or could gratiſie ſo worthy a friend: the other proud, in that hee had ſayde a foundation whereon to build. The two next dayes, <hi>Sirap</hi> ſpent in covertly revealings, wherein his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertneſle, and carriage, did both win reſpect, and gave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. The third following day, hee with his Interpretour went to parley with the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> who diſpairing of life, they found expecting death. But after they had greeted, and regreeted each other, with kinde ſalutes, <hi>Sirap</hi> told him by his Interpreter, that as a man hee bewayled his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and as he was a Prince, he lamented his fall. Yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may not noble Lord, ſaid he, ſince all corporall dammages, that happen to mortail men, are either by means remedied, by reaſon ſuffered, by time cured, or by death ended. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and violent ſtormes may for the time cleave the barke from the tree, and rent the branches of his body; yet for all the furious blaſts of wrathfull windes, it cannot bee pluckt up by the Roote. If there be a power above the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of men, then may there come comfort, contrary to the conceit of men. Expectation in a weake minde, makes an evill greater, and a good leſſe: but the reſolved minde diſgeſts an evill being come, and makes a future good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, before it come; Then expect the beſt, ſince you know the worſt at the worſt, will have an end.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Daulphin</hi> conceiting the civill demeanour, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall diſcourſe, and the pious minde of the ſuppoſed impious and barbarous Moore, honoured his milde inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wondered at his regular admonitions, and thanked him for his humane comforts &amp; tender regard. My minde, mindfull (ſaid <hi>Sirap)</hi> of Fortunes fickleneſſe, affects (I know not how, nor wherefore) your deliverance: what then will the <hi>Daulphin</hi> give, if I affect the ſame? The <hi>Daulphin,</hi> whoſe ſmalleſt ſayles of hope, the leaſt windes did blowe, offered the third part of his Principality, when hee ſhould
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:12144:73"/>
come to <hi>Viennois.</hi> Promiſes ſaid <hi>Sirap</hi> of advancement, are no aſſurances of enrichment, and he hath a wit too ſhort of diſcretion that will looſe certaine favours, for uncertaine fortunes. Notwithſtanding, if you will but ſweare unto me by that ſame God, which you ſerve and adore, to grant me one requeſt that I ſhall make when I come to <hi>Viennois,</hi> I will endanger my life to free your life from danger; and leave, and looſe my honours in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> to ſeale and feate my ſelfe with you in <hi>France:</hi> more you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, leſſe (my Country Gods ayding me) I will not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> whoſe flattering hope, ſuddainly gave him a preſent aſſay of future happineſſe, though at the firſt he was very credulous in entertaining ſuch favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, yet hardly could hee ground any firme beleife; ſince knowing him to be but a Stranger, hee thought that ſuch deepe wounds could not be ſearched with ſuch ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Inſtruments. But at the laſt, referring all things to God, and to the will and wiſdome of the ſuppoſed Moore; hee wholly embraced his kinde offer, and anchored all his hope, in his provident induſtry: unto whom, preferring life before livelihood, hee devoutly ſware by his Fathers God, the onely one true God, and God of all Gods, in whom he chiefly, and onely truſted; that whatſoever hee would demaund, ſhould be freely, abſolutely, and willingly given him, In further conſideration whereof, he gave him a rich Diamond, and his Interpretour a hundred French crownes, which for his vſe, if neede required, he had cloſly hid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the lyning of the coller of his doublet. <hi>Sirap</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe ſatisfied, ſaid, it ſufficed. Onely hee required his continuall prayers for his better ſucceſſe, and ſo left him, to feaſt his hopefull heart with the expectation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſucceſſe. The next day <hi>Sirap</hi> taking occaſion to walk to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that famous River that runnes by <hi>Babylon,</hi> there to view the variety of ſtrange &amp; ſeverall ſmall ſhips, he caſually met, and ſecretly compounded with an avarous Pilot, whoſe corruption being gilded over with gold, he was to bring him downe the River through the <hi>Perſian</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:12144:74"/>
gulfe to the next Port Towne upon the <hi>Affricke</hi> ſhoare. The fifth following night hee appoynted to come a boord, attended onely with two men, and therefore gave him in charge, not onely to bee moſt ſecret therein, but alſo that he ſhould make full proviſion of all requiſites. This done, he preſently gave forth, that hee would ſhortly depart, and returne to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and the better to accompliſh his deſire without miſdeeme; he determined (under colour of preparation, and fitly furniſhing himſelfe) to lye ſome few dayes in the Citie, before he would embarque himſelfe. All which hee preſently imparted to the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and humbly with prodigall thankes tooke his leave, ſaying, that his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time, pleaded now his promis'd returne, which in no wiſe he would violate with the high commander of his thoughts, the great and Emperiall Turke, unto whom hee owed all obliged love, and moſt reverent reſpect. And therefore, if ſo it pleaſed his Majeſty to command his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſervice in ought, hee would willingly attend his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and by his Graces imployments, hold himſelfe more then graced. The <hi>Soldan</hi> ſeeing he would depart, preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with many rich gifts of Royall eſtimate, holding himſelfe no little bounden to his Gods, in that they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted him in ſo noble &amp; meritorious a friend: ſo blinded was hee with <hi>Siraps</hi> civill demeanour, and ſo dusked with <hi>Solimans</hi> powerfull commends, that he could not with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed</hi> pry now into the profundity of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requeſting him to take in worth, thoſe ſmall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of his faſt ſealed love, he friendly bad him farewell, and ſo left him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirap</hi> whoſe thoughts travailed now in queſt after the <hi>Daulphins</hi> deliverance, got himſelfe into the Citie, where he chambered himſelfe in a Merchants houſe of great and good regard, where being once left, and ſeated; hee began to call his wits to account, how beſt he might beſt deceive the <hi>Daulphins</hi> Keeper. For providence preventeth misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and gives life to our future actions: And therefore he was neither careleſly, nor over-timorouſly ſuſpitious of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12144:74"/>
that, which might ſiniſterly, and ſuddenly ſucceede: but iealous, &amp; headfull in the hazard, leſt any over-ſight might croſſe his endeavours, and ſo leave his Lord helpleſſe, and himſelfe hapleſſe. But after he had ſtretcht and tentred his wit, and ſet all poſſibilities on the racke of his invention; at length his deſire carrying him beyond all doubt of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; hee armed his determination with ſteeled reſolution, and ſetting his chance on the Dice, he thus attempted, and aſſayed his fortune.</p>
            <p>The day before his departure, hee went unto the Caſtle where gently greeting the Keeper, he told him that he was to returne to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and therefore finding himſelfe engaged to him for his willing paines, and already ready ſhewed kindneſſes, hee was come of purpoſe in perſon to invite him, and all his followers, (vnto whom he had been troubleſome) to ſup with him that night, that hee thereby might acknowledge his thankfulneſſe, and they have cauſe to remember his love, and his perſon: And becauſe (hee ſaid) my Chamber is no receite, and that I am unwilling to be troubleſome, or offenſive to the Maſter of the houſe, let me entreate the uſe of the Caſtle, and ſo make you, my Hoſt, and Gueſt at once. The Keeper blinded with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bounty, ſecured by the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and now drawne on, by the pleaſing ſhew of kinde courteſie; knowing him (whom yet hee never knew) to be of a vertuous diſpoſe, of great eſtimate, and highly favoured of the King; did freely, and gratefully offer himſelfe, his ſervice, and the Caſtle, at his command. The great unknowne diſtance, betwixt the <hi>Daulphins,</hi> and the <hi>Moores</hi> Countrey Clymes, with their admiration of each other, &amp; the difference of their tongues could not make the gulled keeper ſuſpitious, nor can cauſe him once to dreame of deceitfull guile. This illuſion gave <hi>Sirap</hi> hope of happy ſucceſſe, and therefore manifeſting his thankfulneſſe with a rich Iewell, that he (giving) required that he would weare it for his ſake, he left him, and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally povided, what either his purſe could procure, or the time would afford: Hee gave alſo further charge to his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12144:75"/>
that the Table ſhould be ſtill and ever fully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, with many repleat Cups of Greekiſh Wine. For (ſaid he) the coſt is ill ſpared, that is ſpared for coſt; and the beauty of the banquet is there eclips'd, where <hi>Jupiter</hi> raines not downe full ſhowers of <hi>Nectar.</hi> As himſelfe, hee had carefully and ſecretly before provided ſleeping Poppy, heavy Darnell, and the mortifying juyce of life-bereaving Mandrake; with other powerfull powders, a ſmall quantity whereof taken in drink, would make the Receiver fall into a moſt ſuddaine and deadly ſleepe. This did he ſo ſecretly, and ſo frankely beſtow amongſt all the flaggon Pots, but one (which <hi>Bonfoy</hi> had in truſty charge reſerved by marke for himſelfe and his Lord) that every one had in full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, his dormative full waight. Theſe poyſoned Pots hee cloſely kept for the middle of the banquet; and Supper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerved in, <hi>Sirap</hi> ſeated every one in their due places, to the contentment of each one; and then he began to feaſt, and cheare his gladſome gueſts, and like a pleaſant Idoliſt, merrily cheared his feaſted friends. But in the end (they having no end in drinking) hee ſeeing them ſo deuoutly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> hee to honour their Religion, added then more fatall fewell to their drunken fire. Theyr over-drawne Cups were ſtill repleniſhed with the powdered Wines, and ever he plyed them with Cups, till theyr Cups had over-plyed them: That drunke in theyr drowſie devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they falling into a leaden ſlumber, began to ſleepe out all living conſideration. Now <hi>Sirap</hi> ſeeing his hope, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſome perfection, thought it fit to doe homage to opportunity; for in deferring of time, many times, it is both the loſſe of life, and occaſion: And therefore adding execution to time, hee inſtantly went to make all ſuch as were in the Caſtle ſure; which done, hee came backe, and taking the keyes from the Keeper, (who with the reſt of both their Servants, we will leave where they ſilent lay) he haſtily went downe to the <hi>Daulphins</hi> lodging, where they found him proſtrate on the ground, moyſtning the earth with his repenting teares, and piercing the heavens with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12144:75"/>
his prayers, for the ſuppoſed Moores good ſucceſſe; but before he could make an end of his prayers, <hi>Sirap</hi> came to end his prayers, and Purgatory at once; and releaſing him from his oppreſſing Irons, brought him up to view <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> Comedy, which that dull God (with his ayde) had made, and prepared for his pleaſure.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thus when our ſinnes are ripe, and God to Juſtice bent,</l>
               <l>He turnes our greateſt pleaſure, to our juſt puniſhment.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now Time ſtrucke his locke before, and it fitted not to argue what was done; or what was to be done, leaſt they themſelves might be undone; but giving praiſe to God in their ſeverall ſhewed kindes, they preſently buckled up their ſpirits, with theyr legges, like Bees, that having ſuckt the juyce of forraigne Gardens, make wing to their owne hives, that they may make merry with the fraught of their adventures. So did they haſt to the back gate of the Caſtle, which they prizing open, went to the Rivers ſide, where the hyred Pilot courteouſly attended theyr comming: In a ſmall veſſell they imbarqued themſelves, and ſayled to the <hi>Perſian Gulfe,</hi> and ſo a long to the <hi>Affricke</hi> Sea: Vpon the entry whereof, there croſt them a great Pirat of <hi>Arabia,</hi> whoſe uncheckt fortunes, and vncontrouled ſtrength ſtill crown'd his hardeſt attempts with victory. But his Pride was now like a vapour, that aſcending high, ſoone turneth into ſmoake. For he no ſooner ſaw their ſmall Frigot, but counting it his purchaſe, hee haſtily made towards them, and looking for no reſiſtance, hee grapled with them, and commanded them to yeeld. But <hi>Sirap</hi> being unwilling to looſe the rich benefit of his high adventure, having no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintence with feare, and being ever accuſtomed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, drew forth his ſleeping Semitar, which his enraged fury whetted ſo ſharpe, that hee clove the firſt oppoſer downe to the backe, and ſent the head of the next, as an Ambaſſadour, to plead for peace amongſt the monſters of the Sea. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> ſeeing ſuch great chips cut out of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12144:76"/>
ſuch rough timber, wondred at his force, and admired his valour; Death ſeemed now to hold a Seſſions in the Ship, and <hi>Sirap</hi> ſtill gave the ſummons for theyr appearance. For fearing leaſt their entry into his Ship ſhould endanger the <hi>Daulphin;</hi> he to prevent that, hazarded himſelfe the more, by leaping in among his enemies, where his magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minde, armed with the arme of puiſſance, ſo diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his foes, that the Captaine fearing leaſt any more ſhould come to aſſiſt him, cauſed the ſhips to be ungrapled: And no ſooner were they ſeparated, but that the timorous Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot wherein the <hi>Daulphin</hi> was, ſeeing himſelfe ſevered from perill, began to turne the ſterne of his Ship, and with a ſide winde to ſayle backe; which <hi>Boufoy</hi> eſpying, thought it better to dye in adventure of his liberty, then to become a Captive againe to miſery.</p>
            <p>Deſpaire therefore made him valiant, and neceſſity did adde to his courage, which made him to exceed himſelfe in might, and to goe beyond all hope in ſucceſſe: For ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly running the Pilot thorow with his ſword, he woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the next to him ſo ſore, that he could not offend. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> ſeeing the ſucceſſe of his bold attempt, raiſed his falne courage to the height of noble reſolution; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheathing his quiet ſword that <hi>Sirap</hi> had given him, hee gave him ſuch aſſiſtance, as his weake ability could afford. In the end, feare made them valiant, and their valour freed them from feare. The aſſaulted Saylers (being weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) fell in theyr blood; and in theyr overthrowes, did the ſurvivours ſubmit themſelves to the mercy of their ſwords Force now over-awed them, and they were compelled by <hi>Boufoy</hi> to make towards the other Ship, wherein <hi>Sirap</hi> was making an end of an unequall battell. For having at the firſt ſlaine their redoubted Captaine, hee wreſted his approved broade ſhield from him, under which ſhelter, his encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing valour made ſuch ſlaughter, as of ſixteene perſons, he left but three alive, which as <hi>Boufoy</hi> came in, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on their knees for pardon. But when <hi>Sirap</hi> ſaw them, and underſtood of their interaccident, he was more
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12144:76"/>
glad of their ſafeties, then he was of his owne victory. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> ſtood amazed when hee ſawe the Shipt emboſt with ſcattered heads, devided armes, and diſmembred legs; And in his admiration ſaid, If he be but a man, <hi>how this?</hi> If more then a man, <hi>why this?</hi> Such forceable blowes, ſhewes a power beyond all humane power; and yet I ſee he is but a man, though hee hath done much more then many men. This eſtimate of his valour and worth, made him ever after reſpect him more for his incomparable proweſſe, then hee did before for his deliverance. <hi>Boufoy</hi> now thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe happy in ſuch a Maſter, and <hi>Sirap</hi> grew proud of ſuch a ſervant. <hi>Love</hi> (the joy of nature) now ſate in tryumph for their ſecurities; and the wrathfull God of Warre, being wearied with deſtruction, layde him downe in the bed of peace: With theſe two Ships, they ſecurely ſayled, with windes ſuitable to their wills all along the coaſts of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadoxa</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and ſo by <hi>Guine,</hi> where meeting with a Portugall Merchant, they hired the Pilot to bring them to <hi>Marſelles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus did the inſcrutable providence of God, from iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and bad cauſes, produce good effects; making the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the one, to ſave the life of the other; and the love of liberty, to give liberty to love. The change that change of fortune wrought in them all, made theyr mindes more then pleaſing Paradiſes of unſpeakable pleaſures. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> dreamed of nought but Majeſtie and Dignities; <hi>Boufoy</hi> of freedome and preferment: and <hi>Sirap</hi> his rich hopes promiſed him now golden fortunes: yet durſt hee not unmaske himſelfe, leſt he ſhould deprive <hi>Conceit</hi> of his new Chriſtendome, and betray <hi>Policy</hi> of his chiefeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; but ſtill holding the borrowed habite and artificiall colour of a blacke <hi>Moore,</hi> hee ſtill ſpake unto the <hi>Daulphin</hi> by <hi>Boufoy</hi> his Interpreter, by whom he diſcourſed of many things: and againe, and againe, and ſtill againe, enquired of ſuch affaires, as moſt neereſt did concerne him: wherein he tooke double delight, in not onely gaining knowledge of the aſſurance of <hi>Viennaes life</hi> and <hi>love:</hi> but in deceiving
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12144:77"/>
the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> that the <hi>Daulphin</hi> might thereby be the more deceiued. In this clouded communication, wee will leaue them a while, to ſee what befell <hi>Mal Fiance,</hi> whom we left detained in the Tauerne, ignorant of his Lords ſurpriſe, though not innocent of the cauſe.</p>
            <p>Tenne dayes did the Vintner keepe him cloſe, ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that either the Merchant ſhould returne, or that the <hi>Sanzake</hi> ſhould ſend for his reſtrained gueſt. But when he could neither heare of the one, nor the other; hee began to grow jealous of the matter, and premeditating thereon at laſt, faſtned on this beliefe; That the Merchant (like a ſubtill <hi>Mercurian)</hi> had cheated the ſtranger, and after left him, not onely to pay for the wine, but alſo made him a ſtale to conuay himſelfe away vnder the face of honeſty. For otherwiſe he thought, that if there had beene cauſe of taxation, complaint, or examination; there would no doubt haue beene haſty inquiſition made after him.</p>
            <p>In this perſwaſion he ſet <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> at liberty, who now found his repenting errour, in the loſſe of his Lord; Shame rebuk't his tongue, Griefe attach'd his heart, and Feare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted all his thoughts. At this deare rate hee purchas'd wit; which taught him to labour more aduiſedly in the fearefull ſearch of the <hi>Daulphin;</hi> His enquiring eyes did ſtill pry into euery corner of all his carefull and wandring wayes; and in all aſſemblies, hee ſought whom hee could not finde. But when neither weary time, nor warie ſearch, could giue him any knowledge of him. Then happily mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with a Flemming, that was ready bound for <hi>Zeland,</hi> he went a ſhipbord with him, hoping that either hee ſhould finde his Lord returned to <hi>Viennois,</hi> or giue them cauſe to follow him in better queſt. After many dayes ſayling they happily arriued at <hi>Middleburge,</hi> where in an olde decayed Burgamaſters houſe, they lodged <hi>Mal Fiance;</hi> who finding the aged iealouſie of his aged Hoſt, cunningly caried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a ſtrict ſhew of purity; that vnder that deceit, hee might the better deceiue. This ſuſpitious Syre, hauing not onely a beautifull daughter, but a young faire wife, whom
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12144:77"/>
lately hee had eſpouſed, was ſo fearefully jealous of them both, that he confined them within the limit of his houſe; and if either of them were but out of his ſight, hee ſtraight ſuppoſed ſhe was in action; A ſeruice which none can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, that may not themſelues performe. But to take away all meanes that did helpe (not heale) his miſdeemes; hee cauſed his daughter to lye in a lowbed within his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and made the doore to be lockt each night.</p>
            <p>Now it fell out, that there was a great and ſecret loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his daughter, and one <hi>Haunce,</hi> the ſonne of a rich Tanner, that dwelt not farre from him, who by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came preſently after ſupper time to her Chamber window that lookt into the Garden, where he ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately pleaded for the Harueſt of his amorous deſires, that ſhe (being made of fleſh not flint) granted that hee ſhould reape the full fruition of his loue, if hee would but aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the venture of it. For ſo (ſaid ſhe) it is, that ouer and beſides my Fathers watchfull feare, and euer waking iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, I doe lye neere vnto him, within his Chamber, where though I may eaſily giue you entrance, yet to entertaine you without his perceiuance, ſtands not with my beliefe. That matters not ſaid <hi>Haunce,</hi> I will not leaue the venter, for any aduenture; leaue the managing thereof to me, who will for thy ſake attempt the height of the hazard. Loue feares no danger; and pleaſure without ſhew of perill, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the vigour of her ſweetneſſe: I will with feare ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his feare; that I will take from him all apprehenſion of ſuch feare. Onely bee not thou afraid at any thing that thou ſhalt heare, or ſee, and ſo farewell, and expect my comming.</p>
            <p>All this wanton diſcourſe did <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> liſtning heare, as by chance he leaned in his chamber window, which was but the bredth of a poſt from her window; who like a true <hi>Venerian</hi> (knowing their carnall concluſion) reſolued to take the benefit of the match, though ſhee were more then his match, &amp; to put into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, when the winde ſhould ſerue, in that pleaſant Pinnace, wherein
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:12144:78"/>
enhaunced <hi>Haunce</hi> hoped ſolely to ſayle withioy through the <hi>Magellan ſtraights.</hi> To affect which, hee ſate in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell with all his thoughts, how hee might beſt deceive, not onely hopefull <hi>Haunce,</hi> but alſo her jealous Father, and over-amorous Mother; who being ſicke of old ages tedious, and over-long enduring debilities, had many times by her allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring eyes, ſtolne glaunces, and other enticing demeanours, lookt for Phyſick at his hands. At laſt, device adviſed him, that there was no way to binde jealouſie to the peace, and to keepe himſelfe from interruption, but onely by horrour of feare, to make him looſe himſelfe, and ſenceleſſe of all other feare: In proofe whereof, that night, at the dead houre of heavy and leaden ſleepe, hee tooke one of his bed ſheetes, and tying a knot on the top, threw it over him, and like a troubled ghoſt, with doubtfull paces, went into the Burgamaſters Chamber; who being kept waking by his decrepit griefes, heard the fall of his ſteps, and being ſo darke, that he could not ſee, he gaſtly askt who was there: None but <hi>I,</hi> ſaid his watching ſenſuall daughter, ſuppoſing it had beene <hi>Haunce.</hi> Is the doore lockt ſaid he: yes, quoth ſhee, you heard me locke it your ſelfe, and ſo ſhee did, but without the ſtaple. <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> being thus plannet-ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, curſt old <hi>Saturne</hi> for being now ſo oppoſite to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus,</hi> and in his pawſe of doubtfull ſtay, hee light on this ſubtill ſhift; preſently hee crept ſtealingly, vnder his bed, where finding a payre of bellowes, that careleſly had bin throwne, and left there; hee tooke them up, and ſoftly riſing by the beds head, hee blewe many ſuddaine and ſhort blaſts upon him, and then falling downe againe, he ſet his backe to the middle of the bed cordes; where with all his force, hee lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the bed up as high as hee could, and then would let it ſoftly fall, and then raiſing it up againe, would after let it fall ſuddainly; and then would he blaſt them with the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes againe, which ſo amazed and frighted the poore Burgamaſter, that he could not ſpeake, but fearefully crept over the head into the bed, and layd ſuch faſt (though ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) hands, on his wife, that he awaked her: who being
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:12144:78"/>
held over-hard, demanded what ſo appaled him: who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in a low voyce, that there was ſome tormenting ſpirit in the Chamber. Alas ſweet (ſayd ſhee) thinking it to be but the diſeaſe of his iealouſie, you doe but dreame: there is no ſuch thing, give mee leave to ſleepe, ſince you cannot keepe me waking.</p>
            <p>The Daughter, whoſe luſtfull attendance, waked after veneriall copulation, hearing this, and knowing the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; could not but laugh at her Fathers deceiving, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying feare, and in the pride of her naked ſtrength, ſhee prepared her ſelfe (being then moſt ready, when ſhee was moſt unready) both to aſſay, and allay that trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> hauing thus ſecured their ſtirring, by delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their hearing, went boldly to the daughters bed, (the wiſhed port, where he deſired to arrive) where finding no oppoſition, ſhe ſtill deeming him to be <hi>Haunce,</hi> hee caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, that his barque might ride at full Sea: At which time <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> being in coniunction, produced ſuch ſtrange effects, that the bed wherein they ſay, did both ſhake and rocke; which her mother-in-law hearing, began to be halfe afraid, having heard nothing before: yet out of wonted boldneſſe (which was great in bodily adventures) ſhe called to her daughter, and asked her how ſhee did: I doe (quoth ſhee) well, and as well as any woman can doe. It is the better for you replyed the mother, but doe you not heare, nor feele any thing, I heare nothing (ſaid ſhee) that is ill, and moſt aſſured I am, I feele no hurt. Well daughter ſaid the Mother, bleſſe you, and croſſe you well from all evill ſpirits. Nay mother (quoth ſhee) my faith herein hath ever beene ſo great, and ſo good, that I neither feare the devill, nor thinke any man is preſent that endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers me. All this while the poore Burgamaſter lay over the head, in the ſweat of his falſe fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, which did ſo tyrannize over his weakneſſe, that he durſt lye no longer, but haſtily calling up his man, he bad him light a candle: For he would riſe, and goe fetch his ghoſtly Father, Frier <hi>Fredericke,</hi> to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12144:79"/>
come to bleſſe his Chamber, and to ſprinkle it all over with holy water. His wife could not divert him from it; and his daughter, and her unknowne Paramour were ready to betray themſelves with laughter; yet was <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> glad to hide himſelfe in the bed, whilſt to prevent ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the daughter roſe, and took upon her to unlock the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked doores, by which time, the man came with a light, and getting his Maſter up, he holpe to array him, and after went with a Lanthorne with him to ſeeke the Frier. And no ſooner were they gone, but in comes laſcivious <hi>Haunce</hi> in the heat of his deſire, like the Prince of darknes, cloathed in a Bulls hide, with the hornes on his head: (for it much behooved him to have hornes, that muſt leave hornes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him) who finding the doores open, made no ſtay till he came to the daughters bed, where hearing two breath, he ſoftly ſhrunke backe, ſuppoſing it was the Fathers bed, and ſtumbling after by hap on the other bed, where the wife lay all alone, hee holding downe his head, ſoftly ſaid: feare not my Love, it is I, and ſo diſmantling himſelfe, layd him downe by her, who conceiting that it was <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> that had taken the benefit of her husbands going forth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted not, but entertained him with all the full favours, that wanton love could affoord: (Thus doe womens light thoughts, many times make their husbands to have heavie heads:) But in this amorous combat, the very bed did proclaime their forceable encounters, and the fall of bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaves well witneſſed their freſh aſſaults; which the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hearing, deemed that her reſtleſſe mother was tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſome terrour of feare; and therefore calling to her, ſhee wiſhed her to have a good heart, and not to yeeld to idle conceits, which but troubled the minde with decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving imaginations. The mother perceiving that ſome thing was perceived, &amp; that they were heard; tooke upon her to be affrighted, and ſaid; Alas daughter, ſome thing, I know, hath beene upon me, and if ſpirits have any ſubſtances, it is ſurely one; Cover your ſelfe well, ſaid the daughter: By this enterchange of chatte. <hi>Haunce</hi> knew that hee had
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12144:79"/>
travailed in a by-path, which ſo diſtaſted him, that his teeth gnaſhed together for anger, and <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> lay laughing at the knowledge thereof, who remembring now, that <hi>Haunce</hi> would come in ſome fearefull ſhape, to make way for his pleaſure, he thought to worke further on him, and to beat him with his owne weapon; And to give life to his device, he ſtole up, and creeping along the beds ſide where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in enchaffed <hi>Houace</hi> did lye, hee ſought by feeling, and by feeling found, the hayry hide, which by handling thereof, hee knew well was a garment of his Fathers, and as hee threw it over him, with intent to frighten <hi>Haunce,</hi> he heard his Hoſt and the Frier comming into the houſe; who came ſooner then they were expected: Then was hee forc'd to runne behinde the dore, thinking by his hell like habite, to terrifie them all; and ſo get unknowne to his Chamber. Now <hi>Haunce</hi> perceiving light through the dore (for as yet the Frier durſt not come in, till he had ſaid divers <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> &amp; beſprinkled the doore with his holywater ſprinkle) leapd haſtily out of his diſliked bed, and failing to find his devils coate, he pulled the higher ſheet out of the bed, and ſhrewding himſelfe therein, went like a Ghoſt to the other ſide or the dore, thinking likewiſe thereby, ſo ſuddainly to fright them, that undiſcovered he might eſcape. But the tardy-taken-women, that now were more afraid of ſhame, then they were before of ſinne, were driven to ſuch an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that they knew not how to avoyd, neither rebuke, nor reproach; Their ſcarlet bluſhes accuſed them, and the holy Church was at the doore ready to condemne them. In this hell they lay, fearing to bee ſeene, untill the light which moſt they feared, freed them from thoſe they moſt feared. For the new transformed devill, and the late meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed ghoſt, ſuddainly ſeeing each other by the light of the Candle, upon the opening of the dore, were ſo agaſt at the fearefull ſight of either others terrifying, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne ſhapes, that they verily thought, that the divell, or ſome other ill ſpirit, were purpoſel come from hell to carie them away, for their ſinfull aſſuming theyr damned
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:12144:80"/>
formes, to ſuch wicked and forbidden ends. In this feare and fearefull thought, they made ſuch haſt to runne away the one from the other, that they both ruſht at once ſo forceably through the doore, that they beare the old Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamaſter downe, and turned the poore Frier over &amp; over; in which fall hee pittifully brake his face on the houſecill, and halfe drowned the Burgamaſter with the Holy-water that he brought, and ſhed upon him. The carefull women though they were thus cleared of diſgrace, yet were they ſo daunted at the ſight of theſe incarnall divels, that they woefully cryed, and ſhrieked out; the ſervant with the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne, as one diſtract, runne out of doores; <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> as fearefully fled to his Chamber; and heartleſſe <hi>Haunce</hi> moſt amazedly runne into the ſtreet after the ſervant; who looking for feare behind him, ſawe this ſpirit P. running (as he thought) after him; which made him cry out Helpe, helpe, a ſpirit, a ghoſt; a ghoſt, a ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The Watchmen comming by, and hearing him, thought the man was ſtarke mad; but looking a ſide, they ſaw this affrighted, frightning ghoſt comming towards them, which put them all into ſuch amazed feare, that they threw down theyr weapons, and runne away. The coaſt being thus cleared, unhappy <hi>Haunce</hi> got into his Father houſe. But now the next neighbours that had heard the wretched wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſhrieking cries, were riſen, and having gotten lights, ſpeedily came to ſee, and know the cauſe of their out-cries, And finding the Maſter of the houſe, and the Frier (whom feare had entranced) halfe dead on the floore, and the Frier all bloudied by his fall, they ſuppoſing, that they were ſlaine, inſtantly cryed out Murther, murther: The diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed women (that all this while lay over theyr heads, in the bath of their ſweating feare, doing pennance for their ſtoln pleaſures) having their feare both renewed, and redoubled by theſe their cries; cried out as faſt, the devill, the devill; at the hearing whereof, all the neighbours runne out of the houſe againe, and <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> grew upon this dreadfull al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum, ſo fearefully timorous, that hee durſt not moove,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:12144:80"/>
though hee were more then moved. In this agonie of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, did they all lye till breake of day, when light (the comfort of darke diſmay) emboldned the chiefe Officer (who of purpoſe was ſent for) to enter into this houſe of horror, where raiſing them from that place of Purgatory; they found upon examination, that the devill had bin there, and was the cauſe of all theyr diſturbances. But <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> who now had made peace with his diſtracted thoughts; not onely found his owne error, but eaſily apprehended the ſhift and enforced ſubtilty of the other. For remembring that he had disfurniſhed <hi>Haunce</hi> of his blacke Mantle, and ſo prevented him of his infernall ſhape; he conceited, that hee had no other meanes to free himſelfe, then by taking one of the ſheets, and ſo by appearing like a ghoſt to make way for himſelfe. In the beliefe of this conceit, he vowed that <hi>Haunce</hi> ſhould well pay both for terrifying him, and for his planting in anothers Vineyard. And to this end, he ſeeking found him, and told him, that he had a very good Bull hide to ſell him. <hi>Haunce</hi> knowing well where hee lay, was much aſtoniſht thereat, and thanking him, ſaid, He had no neede of any. Then (quoth <hi>Mal-Fiance)</hi> ſhall my Hoſt have it, to make him a night-gowne; but you ſhall pay for the hornes, though you were ſo liberall as freely to give them. For in briefe Mr. Tanner, the abuſe that you have offered mine Hoſt, and the ſcandall that you have raiſed on his houſe, is ſo iniuriouſly great, and ſo ſhamefully iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that unleſſe you will give me tenne pounds, I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe the Devill, and both reveale his adulterous dealing, and tell of your ghoſtly eſcape. <hi>Haunce</hi> ſeeing he was diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, bought his concealment with his coyne; which made <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> ſo wanton, that being ſo well ſilver-ſhod for travaile, he diſcharged all his debts, and in the innocency of his thoughts, not dreaming after any danger, hee made more haſt, then good ſpeed to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennois.</hi> And no ſooner was hee come, and knowne to be in <hi>Vienna,</hi> but that the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance</hi> ſent for him, and demanded where his Soveraigne Lord the <hi>Daulphin</hi> was; who being unable
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:12144:81"/>
to anſwer thereunto, was preſently deemed, either to haue murthered him, or to haue betrayed him to his enemies: For it is a rule by obſeruation true; that they that feare not to be thought faulty, will neither bee afraid to commit the fault, nor aſhamed to be ſeene after the fact. His leauing (howſoeuer) of his Liege Lord, was held worthy ofdeath. And therefore was he ſent bound hand and foote to priſon, till rigour of juſtice ſhould by ſpeedy ſentence award him condigne puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But the bruite hereof, begat ſuch tumultuous vproares, and brought forth ſuch miſchieuous factions, both in Court and Citty, that hardly could the tempeſt be allayed without the vtter ſubuerſion of the ſtate. For how ſhould the low ſhurbs ſtands in rebellion, when the high Cedar was thought to be blowne downe by treaſon? In this combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, ſome ſtood for the indubitate heire the Princeſſe <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> whoſe liberty they proudly required, amongſt whom, Sir <hi>Iaques;</hi> and <hi>La-Noua</hi> were moſt forward. Some for the malicious and proud <hi>Dalphinis,</hi> whoſe Regencie many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, But all malecontents, rupugnant humoriſts, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered men, decayed perſons, and ſeruile peſants (that thriue beſt in mutation of States, and liue by others falling, as Swine doe by the dropping of Acornes) flocked about <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Maligne,</hi> the reputed baſtard of the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> who ambitiouſly would needes (according to the wicked diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of illegitimates) depriue others by ruine and rapine of their rights, and appropriate to himſelfe the Crowne. The fired faſhions began to breake forth into flaming ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious; and masked Rebellion wayted but on time and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, to vſe open force againſt each other: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale did well to ſee her deſtruction in this triumui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; Amongſt theſe briers and brambles, that ſought to ouer-top the ſtately Oake; awfull Iuſtice had no power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full place: Law was no force, and authority loſt all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. For where alteration threatens warre, there the ſword maketh all things lawfull.</p>
            <p>But when the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance,</hi> who was an <hi>Anthony</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:12144:81"/>
in clemencie, a <hi>Traian</hi> in bounty, and another <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in wiſedome, beloued of moſt, and reſpected of all; ſaw this tripertite, and diflentious diuiſion growing to ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous heads: and hearing that many of the giddy headed multitude were already aſſembled together in the Market place, in a moſt confuſed manner, according to the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous natures of the mutable Commons, fearing their apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to innouation, and the ſad effects of ciuill broyles, or ſome ſuddaine ouerture; leauing (becauſe wanting) all time of further conſideration, euen in the aſſurance of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ſtrength of his zeale to his Country, he ſuddenly went to the Market place, where all men (notwithſtanding their diſtemperarures) gaue way to his merit, and in loue followed after him; ſo powerfull was he in popular affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he perceiuing, ſtayed; and turning himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, with teares in his eyes, and his Hat in his hands, more like an humble Suppliant, then a regall Ruler, he made a ſigne for audience; which graunted, hee mildly after ſome few ſighes, ſaid.</p>
            <p>What moues my faſt friends, louing fauorites, and more then deare Countrymen, to this threatning mutinie? What diſturbes your quiet peace, or what ſeeke you by the hurtfull Armes? Doe you want a Prince? Why the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> your liege Lord (for ought that any knowes) liueth; and the Princeſſe his apparant heire is not dead. Doth any vſurpe your rights, or oppreſſe you with wrongs? Why juſtice ſhall giue to euery one his owne, and I am heere ready to ſhed my bloud in your behalfes. Or doth the bare ſuppoſe of your Soueraignes death, thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely moue you to create, and inueſt a new, becauſe <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> is returned without his Lord? A proiect truſt mee, that will being forth ſome notable deceitfull deſigne. If needs he muſt be dead, becauſe none can heare tell that he is aliue; Why then ſhould hee not be as well liuing, becauſe here no one knowes that hee is dead? But admit that our ſinnes haue (which God forbid) depriued vs of him, doth it follow, that the ambitious <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> or that degenerate
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:12144:82"/>
Baſtard <hi>Maligne,</hi> ſhould ſucceed him? What though <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> bee a priſoner to her Fathers will, and my faith muſt keepe her ſtill a thrall to his ſeverity? yet the Father dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the daughters bonds are broken, I diſcharged, and you tyed, to enthronize her for your lawfull Princeſſe.</p>
            <p>Why then ſhould there be any ſuch diſparity of minds, or diverſity of affections amongſt you, ſince you are all ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects born to one end, and <hi>Viennonians</hi> ſworne to one right? What ſhall become of this Principality, when thoſe that ſhould unite themſelves to maintaine the Weale-publique; doe thus divide themſelves, to overthrow the publique weale? Know you not, that by thus banding your ſelves, you doe altogether abandon your ſelves?</p>
            <p>Will not your inſulting, and enchroaching neighbours (the proud <hi>Savonians)</hi> our inveterate and irreconciliable enemies, take advantage of your weakning of your owne ſtrengths, enter forceably upon your rights, diſpoſſeſſe you of your habitations, and make you aliens to your inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances? Yes, yes, be you aſſured, that hatred amongſt friends, gives ever ſuccour to Strangers: and that civill warres within you, will bring forraigne warres upon you. Looke on the <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> of whom I am loath to ſpeak ill, yet in this, I know not how to ſpeake well. Doth not her unwaſted corruption and pride ſhew, that ſhee loves a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace better then her Paradice? that thinkes by ſhamefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, to make her ſelfe a ſinfull Queene?</p>
            <p>Know you not, that they that are ſo greedy, ſo vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to get; will be ever as ready to doe wrong? What co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of claime can ſhe have, that is neither royalized by propagation, nor extract from Princely or Noble blood? Shee had no authority given her in his highneſſe rule; nor hath ſhe any left her at his departure. It is, I ſee, onely her pride, that can ſuffer no equall, and <hi>Malignes</hi> ambition, that can brooke no Superiour: two fire-brands, that burnt up <hi>Romes</hi> moſt glorious Monarchy. O let them both then fall in their pride, that ſeeke ſo uniuſtly to flye before they have wings; and waſh not your eyes, and hands, like <hi>Envy,</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:12144:82"/>
in one anothers fall. In perſiſting to maintaine evill, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne</hi> doth condemne himſelfe; otherwiſe hee would not ſeeke to obtaine that with blood and ſhame; which he can neither get, nor keepe, without ſinne and death, In all the Scriptures there was but one ſole Baſtard (only <hi>Iephiha)</hi> that did come to any good; and yet hee had the marke of the curſe: for his all onely daughter was moſt ſorrowfully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for her great Fathers offence; And this was but to ſhew, that there is no perpetuity, nor long proſperity, in hatefull and condemned baſtardy. And will you then make the corrupt and curſed ſeed, and excrement of ſinne, your unlawfull Prince? that by all divine, nature, and nationall lawes, hath no inheritance on earth; and whom the Iewes counted as no part of their congregation.</p>
            <p>If the Father be an Adulterer, and the Mother a Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the Sonne muſt in reaſon bee a bad liver, and a wicked governour. For he that is borne in double ſinne, muſt of likely hood in nature, bee both ſubiect to many faults, and guilty of many offences. And how can polluted hands make foule veſſels cleane? or how can he that is but the ſonne of the people, be the ſonne of the <hi>Daulphin?</hi> The Mothers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, and proteſtation, is no proofe; that ever fathers them on thoſe that can beſt maintaine them. Shee cannot be true to one, that is untrue to her ſelfe: Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſtill breake out there, where it is once feſtered, How then can you affect the ſonne of ſhame, or without ſhame, yeeld your ſelves ſubiect to the Sonne of a ſtrumpet? If his deſire be beyond his merit and reach, let him fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his hopes, and receive juſt guerdon for his deſerts. As for the vertuous Princeſſe, whoſe right I reverence and whoſe worth I admire. Let her yet remaine (though with better reſpect) where ſhee is. For it is not good over-ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely to open a wound, that hath long beene cloſed up. The greateſt right, may doe the moſt wrong, and the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a good action, is no ſinne; when it cannot be done without committing of ſinne. I have ſworne to her Father, and would bee found faithfull to my Lord; I affect not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:

For in this, I am but like the Sunne that carries his Lanthorne for others, and not for himſelfe. It is better to be doubtfull then over-credulous; and the uncertainty of his death, is no warrant for my diſcharge, nor your diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. There is time for all things, and the <hi>Moone</hi> that is not yet riſen, may riſe, &amp; ſhine in full glory, though now ſhe be eclipſed. What more would you have, or what further (O you fond <hi>Viennonians)</hi> doe you endeavour to affect? Will you turne Traytors to your Lord, rip up your owne bowels, make your wives widdowes, and your children fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, and helpleſſe? Will you put fire to your owne houſes, poſſeſſe your foes with your wives, and wealthes: ſee your daughters deflowred, and make an utter devaſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Countrey?</p>
            <p>Alas, I ſee your wilfulneſſe betrayes your wits, &amp; drawes on your overthrowes into your enemies tryumphes; and griefe makes me to ſhed teares of blood for your owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed deſtructions. Let me at laſt, O let me in love, and tender care of your welfares, dehort you from wounding of your ſelves, and leave theſe ill preſaging jarres amongſt you; and like birdes of one flocke, flye together; Maintaine your ſacred oathes, for the preſervation of your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes right, till better aſſurance acquite you from your obliged faithes. To haſten the knowledge whereof, I will wing many Meſſengers with ſpeede, to enquire, and learne what is become of our Soveraigne Lord, with that the teares did trickle downe his face, which ſtruck ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate regard in all their hearts, that being before made ſenſitive of their errours, and now fully ſatisfied, and reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his tongue of perſwaſion; they ioyfully threw up their Hattes, and ſome lifting him up, cried, God ſave the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance,</hi> under whoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment we will onely live. Thus did his pleaſing words, powerfull authority, milde behaviour, refined and probable ſeaſons, and ſubtilized diſtinction, allay the force of the approaching ſtorme, and gave ſuch contentment to all, that every one departing in love, brought home peace to their neighbours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:12144:83"/>
Thus did this noble Governour (like a good and a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Muſicioner) put all this iarring diſcord, in a good, and true time; which ſo croſt the hatefull hopes of malicious <hi>Maligne,</hi> that failing of native ſtrength, and rebellious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to dignifie his indignities; hee ſuddainly fled unto the <hi>Savoy</hi> Duke, to require forraigne ayde, to royallize his proud baſeneſſe. Such was his aſpiring wrath, that it had no meane, and ſuch his Treaſon, that it had no end. Feare made him now doubt the rigour of law, that before would have beene ſubiect to no law: and therefore did hee in ſuch unſtable waters, and threatning windes, ſeeke for more powerfull eares; which the ſubtile Duke well perceiving, thought to feede on him, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> leane Kine did on the fat:</p>
            <p>But before he went, he adviſed thereof with his politick and ſworne conſiderate friend, <hi>Monſieur Meſchant,</hi> whoſe falſe ſemblable mindes, ever made ſuch a full connexion of wills betwixt them, as what the one pernitiouſly contrived, the other moſt trayterouſly put in practiſe. And therefore <hi>Meſchant</hi> ſeeing him already over the ſhooes in danger, perſwaded him to wade up to the chinne: For, ſaid hee, There can never be any perill in the adventure, where the Foord promiſeth ſo good a paſſage. Danger now onely dwels at home, and the <hi>Savoy</hi> Duke may both fortifie your hope, and raiſe your fortunes. Offer him but intereſt in the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> &amp; you ſhall find that his avarice &amp; pride will in that hope, greedily worke on our broken and diſturbed ſtate. So then happily with ſpeede, and moſt powerfully and ſucceſſively; may you returne; and as prevailent may your ſucceſſe bee, as your going is moſt pertinent. And therewithall, he tooke a ſheete of cleane paper, and laying both ſides ſtraight together, he cut divers rowes through them both; and after cutting them a ſunder, he kept the one halfe himſelfe, and gave the other, ſaying:</p>
            <p>By this, and through this, ſhall you (without either dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to me, or perceivance of any other) ſtill know what is here done, and what I would have you further to doe. For
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12144:84"/>
though I writ my Letters directly, and moſt diſtaſtfully againſt your Apoſtacie, and combination with the publipue foe, and aduiſe you to betray that noble Duke, (which for my ſafety I muſt ſtill doe, leſt in the portage, or otherwiſe, my Letters ſhould miſcarry) yet ſhall you eaſily at all times unmaske my intended intelligence, and finde out both my fallacie, and true inſtructions: if you but take this your cut patterne, and lay it one my Letter, where you ſhall plainly, and formally, reade through the ſame, no more, then what I purpoſely in truth doe write vnto you, &amp; would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enfeoffe you with. In like manner (as I will teach you) may you ſafely by the ſame illuſion, certifie me, of all your proiects and deſignes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maligne</hi> thanked him, prayed his remembrance thereof, and ſo bad him farewell. For feare ſent him poſt away, and hope gaue him ſuch ſpeede, as in ſhort time he came to the Dukes Court, where after hee had moſt reſpectiuely ſaluted him, he related, how that the <hi>Daulphin</hi> his father was dead, and that the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance</hi> affecting gouerment, moſt ambitiouſly ſought to retaine his vſurped rule. That the Princeſſe <hi>Vienna</hi> was in priſon vnregarded of all; and that he had himſelfe, many ſtrong and aſſured fauorites, that would ſtand for his fortune. In furtherance whereof, hee was come to pray his aſſiſtance, and for guerdon thereof, he would interreſt him in that halfe of <hi>Daulphine,</hi> that lay next vnto him.</p>
            <p>Thus did he ſeeke his owne ruine with great labour, and buy repentance with bloudy coſt. Thus did he make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a Bridge for the encroaching Duke to enter vpon his Country: And this gap did he open, that the <hi>Sauonian</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might like an inundation ſubmerge, and ouerwhelme both himſelfe, and the whole body of the State. For the Duke who euer wayted on opportunity, and ſtill watched how the Market went, finding now the Myne diſcouered; he thought good to make profit thereof, and to take the benefit of the Tide, while the floud ſerued. And therefore he embraced the perſon, for the occaſion; and promiſing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:12144:84"/>
him helpe (but with <hi>Judas</hi> ſubtilty to make himſelfe rich) hee leavyed Forty thouſand men well appointed, with whom, with all affected expedition, hee inſtantly in perſon, went to fiſh in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennois</hi> troubled water, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any Conſcience of thruſting his Sickle into anothers Harveſt. The opinion of poſſibility ſo redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his unbounded deſires, that hee thought that time too long, that hee ſpent in going: But it had beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him, with the <hi>Tortoiſe,</hi> to have kept his head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his owne ſhell, then by ſeeking ſo abroad, to raiſe his fortunes out of anothers ruines.</p>
            <p>For that carefull Shepheard (the ever watchfull Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) being now ſummoned by waſtfull Warre, to defend both his Flocke, and his Folde, ſtood not now like a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chyrurgion, to conſult of the ripeneſſe of the ſore; but like an expert Captaine (that at the firſt, would prevent fury by force) hee ſuddainly raiſed 30000. men, whom in pride of his aged age, he himſelfe led into <hi>Daulphine,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the iniurious and intruding Duke.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Meſcant</hi> hearing that the Duke and <hi>Maligne,</hi> were entred into <hi>Daulphine,</hi> and ſeeing the preſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and haſty march, that the governour now made againſt them; He inſtantly writ unto <hi>Maligne</hi> thereof, and thus deceitfully diſguiſed his ſubtill intelligences.</p>

            <p>Thus in a faire Cup of gold did this peſtiferous <hi>Meſchant</hi> utter his hidden poyſon; And under the apparant ſhew of honeſt loyalty, did hee give both treacherous intelligence, and dangerous inſtructions to the hoſtile Enemy. For <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne</hi> upon the receite of this Letter, layd his patterne ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo read his ſubtill &amp; cloked advertiſements through the ſame, as by laying downe, and covering this his Letter, with this exampled patterne, you may plainely perceiue.</p>
            <p>By this time had the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and Sir <hi>Sirap</hi> (after tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous travaile) recovered <hi>Marcelles</hi> in <hi>Province,</hi> through
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12144:85"/>
which they paſt unknowne into <hi>Daulphin;</hi> where the <hi>Daulphin</hi> finding his Countrey, in his declining dayes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with Campes, Carriages, barbed Horſes, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Souldiers; he amazedly asked, and asking learned, the unexpected cauſe thereof; which made him bewaile his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter fortunes, and envie no little againſt that impious ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, his accurſed ſuppoſed ſonne. Griefe now made him weepe at his Countries calamity, and feare made him doubt his owne deprivation. The Harveſt of his ſinnes, yeelded him now more increaſe of woes; then the luſts of his youth afforded him pleaſures. But how ſhould (ſaid the ſorrowfull <hi>Daulphin)</hi> hee that is begotten in my full ſin, and borne in his owne ſhame; live without doing villany, or dye without making miſchiefe? If his being bee from me, why then ſhould he ſeeke to take from me my being? And if he be none of mine, what then hath he to doe with it, which is mine? but he is not mine, but the ſonne of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and ſcorne of nature; and therefore knowes neither his ſhameleſſe ſelfe, nor his ſinfull father. I nouriſhed him (as a Snake) in the boſome of my love, and now hee would ſting mee to death, in the poyſon of his hate. O how juſt are the judgements of God, that payes our amiſſe, in the amiſſe of our offences, and makes our wicked pleaſures our juſt puniſhments.</p>
            <p>In this bemoaning fury, did hee call for vengeance to be powred downe on <hi>Maligne;</hi> which <hi>Sirap</hi> ſeeing, could not but grieue at his ſad lamentations, though otherwiſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, that occaſion preſented unto him both a meanes to ſhew there his proweſſe; and a way to make his Countrey indebted to his valour. For as a ſtranger he knew he ſhould winne honour, and after gaine (being made knowne) more reſpect. The wrath of Warre hee did not feare, nor made hee any doubt of his Countries ſafety. And therefore hee chearefully commanded <hi>Boufoy</hi> to comfort the diſtreſſed <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and to aſſure him, that the God of the <hi>Viennoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had brought him thither, in iuſtice, both to puniſh the treacherie of his degenerate ſonne; and alſo to correct the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12144:86"/>
inſulting pride of the intruding Duke; in both whoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious blouds, hee vowed to bath his revengefull Sword, and by force of the <hi>Viennonian</hi> forces, to overthrow all the <hi>Savonians.</hi> Only intreate him to take up the heate of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation in the embers, and to keepe himſelfe unknowne that thereby he might both receive a true tryall of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects forces, and fidelities; and the eaſier eſcape, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelfe, after, with forraigne ſupplyes, if the <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonians</hi> ſhould unhappily be vanquiſht. As for himſelfe, he would (when they were hotteſt in battaile) ſuddainly thruſt himſelfe amongſt them, where he would write ſuch Tragedies in his enemies bloud, that weeping repentance ſhould teach them, what it is, to invade anothers right, and to diſplant the true Vine. His Highneſſe and <hi>Boufoy,</hi> I would have them, like two peaceable Pilgrims, to ſtand ſafely aloofe, and to view the hazard of the game, till the laſt chance be caſt, and then ſecretly to convey themſelves to ſome cave in the neere adioyning Wood, whether in the darke of night I will undiſcryed repaire, and further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult what after is to bee done. To this the animated <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> ſubſcribed. For in his vertuous valour, and practive knowledge, did he build his new raiſed hope; and on his unreſiſtable force, &amp; moſt fortunate atchievements, did his comfort depend.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sirap</hi> having ever about him his never failing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar, wherewith he vanquiſht <hi>Turbulent the fierce,</hi> and being furniſhed with the Shield, &amp; Armour, that he force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably tooke from the Captaine of the Pirats in the <hi>Affricke</hi> Seas; he made all things in readines, and inſtantly ſent <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foy</hi> to the next Towne with his Shield, to cauſe a Painter to draw omit a diſturbed waved Sea and in the middeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a crowned <hi>Daulphin,</hi> driving other Fiſhes before him, and ſtriking many under the waves with his tayle, with this Impreſſe under. <hi>Crowned to Conquer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus did the <hi>Daulphins</hi> unknowne Knight, in honour of the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> make himſelfe the Knight of the <hi>Daulphin.</hi> But by this time the two Armies marching both on, affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12144:86"/>
each other in ſight, which made the <hi>Sauoy</hi> Duke, to make a ſtand, and to ſet his men in good array of Battaile, which he deuided in two parts. The firſt were his troupes of Horſe, which he aſſigned to be conducted by the Baſtard <hi>Maligne.</hi> The other, conſiſting of Foote, he led himſelfe. In this equipage he ſoberly marcht, till he came to a ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Playne, neere to <hi>Andre,</hi> where hee preparedly ſtayed the comming on of the <hi>Viennonians,</hi> who being well Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled in one meane Battaile, Creſſat-wiſe, with two wings of Horſe on either ſide, came on apace, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their good Generall, the L. <hi>Vray Eſperance;</hi> vnto whom, honour gaue ſpurres; his place, faithfulneſſe; and the loue of his Country courage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maligne</hi> heartned on the Duke with the falſe aſſurance of the <hi>Viennoians</hi> revolt, and the hope to incorporate that Principality to his owne, haled him on the more to that bloudy bargaine. For the charge being giuen, Deſire, and Reuenge, encountred each other with ſuch fury, that the Battaile was long in ſuſpence. Victory enclining to neither ſide, till at laſt, the Troupe of the <hi>Sauonian</hi> Horſes diſranked both the Wings of the <hi>Viennoians,</hi> and brake in vpon the ſquadron of the Foote, with ſuch violence, that they began to ſtagger, and giue backe. When the all-valarous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible <hi>Sirap,</hi> the Knight of the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> came fortunatly in, who finding where danger dwelled moſt, there hee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelfe, and like to a ſuddaine Tempeſt, bare downe all before him. His deſire to approue himſelfe in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries defence, and his implaceable wrath againſt thoſe, that ſought to defeat <hi>Vienna</hi> of her right, and to defraud him of the comfort of his hope, made his blowes fall like thunder, and his ſword to cut like the Executioners Axe. None could ſtand before him, nor durſt there any come neere him; which ſo encouraged the diſheartned remainder of the <hi>Viennonian</hi> Caualirie, that they rank'd themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and came vp to ſecond him. This freſh, and new aſſault, diſordered, and diſmayed the <hi>Sauonian</hi> Troupes, who now fought fearefully, and confuſedly; which <hi>Maligne</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12144:87"/>
purpoſely, and fatally brought up all his Forces, and begirt him round, thinking ſo to end the Battaile, by making an end of him, that both had ended ſo many of their lives, &amp; only maintained the Battell. In this danger, did the undaunted Knight of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> fight ſo long, that his Horſe was ſlaine under him, which he with great agility well and quickly avoyded, and being on foote, perceived his other ſelfe, his entire deere friend <hi>La-nova</hi> (whom hee knew by his coate Armour) to lye in the duſt. This ſight was ſuch an Alarum to waken Revenge, that he grew now more furiouſly wrathfull, and more irefully impatient then before; and being deſirous to recover his body, hee deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſtrid over him, and like valiant <hi>Hector</hi> amidſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girting <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> he ſtood to withſtand all aſſaylers. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova</hi> being thus freed from the ſmothering feet of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, having had time of breathing, came to himſelfe (for he was not mortally wounded) and began to ſtirre, which being found, and perceived by the Knight of the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> (maugre all the force of his ſwarming and preſſing foes) he tooke him up, and bare him to the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance,</hi> unto whom, kiſſing him oft, in manifeſtation of his love, he delivered him, with many ſpeaking ſignes, that hee ſhould be ſent ſafely away. The Generall who had ſeene with the eyes of admiration, the incomprehenſible force, and unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable valour of this unknowne Knight, reſpectively recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, and accordingly ſent him to the next Towne, and then having already brought up his ſtrength of Foote, of purpoſe to ſuccour the <hi>Daulphin</hi> Knight, he followed him in his bloudy paſſage, with intent to horſe him againe, leſt he ſhould miſcary in that perill: In this deſire, he came on ſo furiouſly faſt, that the <hi>Savoy</hi> Duke ſeeing the rage of this tempeſtuous floud, to over-beare <hi>Malignes</hi> Forces, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his maine Battaile and like a terrible ſtorme, fell upon the <hi>Viennonians.</hi> But this lightning laſted not long, for the Knight of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> perceiving that now the dice was caſt, and that they both were to abide their laſt chance, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned all his ſtrength together, and in the vigour of his
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:12144:87"/>
diſpleaſed courage, meeting with <hi>Maligne,</hi> he ſmote him ſo on his Burganet, that he fell'd him, ſore wounded to the earth, where being no reſpight for reſcue, he was ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and troden to death.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thus dyed the ſpawne of ſinne, in ſinfull ſhame,</l>
               <l>Ill was hee got, lewd his life, bad his name.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now notwithſtanding, the withſtanding <hi>Savonians,</hi> the Knight of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> tooke <hi>Malignes</hi> Horſe, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all interruption, hee lightly mounted on him, and with his confounding ſword, he made ſuch a ſlaughter, that he found little reſiſtance. This remarkable act, gave not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freſh hope, but new life to <hi>Eſperance,</hi> who wondred not ſo much, at who hee was, as at what he did; and yet hee thought he muſt be more then a man, that did more then a man could doe. But the doubtfull <hi>Daulphin</hi> ſtanding all this while aloofe, joyfully beholding the heroicall deeds, of his ſecond Saviour, ſaid unto <hi>Boufoy,</hi> that <hi>Siraps</hi> valour was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all apprehenſion, his courage above conceit, his puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance more then humane, and his deedes ſurmounting all opinion.</p>
            <p>By him, ſaid he, I have my ſecond being; and by him I ſee, I ſhall ſtill be a Prince; O would, and as he would have proceeded further, hee made a ſtay to behold the diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Duke, who ſeeing his men diſcomforted and ſlaine, moſt by this alone Knight, came in with a troupe of reſerue; whom hee had commanded, to unite all their forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bend themſelves wholly for the taking, or kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this unknown <hi>Hercules,</hi> the moſt redoubted Knight of the <hi>Daulphin;</hi> but coſtly experience made them loath to come ſo neare him, as to hurt him, leaſt breaking the rule of pitty, they ſhould be guilty of their owne deathes. Yet in ſome preſumption, both of their number, and Armour; they faintly aſſaulted him to theyr repenting detrements. In this freſh conflict, the Knight of the <hi>Daulphins</hi> Beaver was broken; and fell downe, which much more advantaged
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:12144:88"/>
then endammaged, or endangered him. For the Enemies ſeeing his blacke hew, and his wrathfull eyes (being then kindled a new with anger) ſhining like fire, were ſuddainly appald with ſuch dread, and fearfull amazement, that (hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him rather an infernall ſpirit, then a mortall man) they began to recoyle, and to flye from him like a great Covie of frighted Partridges, from the firſt purſute of a fierce Faulcon; whereupon he flouriſhed his Conquering ſword, and cried out in Greeke, <hi>Victory, Victory,</hi> and then followed them with ſuch raging fury, that hee hewed out his way in bloud, till he encountred that proud innading Duke, whom hee knew by his rich Armour, and thinking now to make an end of both him and the Battaile at once, he lifted up his controuling and quelling arme, and ſo enragedly ſmote him on the ſide of his helmet, that neither the ſteele, nor the temper, could ſecure him from that fatall and inevitable blowe; but as all men fall that ſeekes to build up their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes upon others ruines; ſo fell hee now (in the height of his hope) breathleſſe to the ground. Then began the <hi>Savo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to flye on all hands, and light unharneſſed legges were better then well approved armes.

            <p>Night drawing on, the Generall, the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance</hi> commanded to ſound the Retrait. But the Knight of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> purpoſely purſued the Chaſe, that in the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of night hee might the better convay himſelfe away, and undiſcovered goe (as he did) to the Wood, where the glad <hi>Daulphin</hi> ioyfully attended him: And no ſooner did hee ſee him, but that with teares of ioy, that in triumph, trickled downe his cheekes, he haſted to embrace him, and impalling him within the circuit of his armes, he held him faſt, his tongue failing to bee meſſenger of his thankefull heart. For in this paſſion,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Love clipt him faſt, true Comfort held him long;</l>
               <l>Ioy could not ſpeake, for Wonder had no tongue.</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:12144:88"/>
But after his full heart had a little enioyed it ſelfe, and ſomewhat digeſted his ſurfet of ioy. Then, then, his tongue was enabled to applaud his victory; and he both crowned his proweſſe with loud reſounding praiſes, and gave him more then many thankes for his moſt glorious and happy labours; And now with more regard, did he not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriate himſelfe, to doe him all the kinde offices of loue, but alſo humbly offered to unarme him, which in no wiſe <hi>Sirap</hi> would permit, but wearied with that dayes travaile, he betook himſelfe to his reſt; where his reſtleſſe thoughts began a new Warre betwixt his deſire, and determination: faine would he have ſeene her, whom hee loved more then his life, and yet to deliberate well on things profitable, hee held to bee a moſt provident delay, At laſt hee reſolved to keepe himſelfe, and them unknowne for ſome few dayes, that the Country might be ſetled in peace, and he ſee what courſe would be held both for <hi>Vienna,</hi> and for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the interim hee might the better conclude with himſelfe, for his owne affaires. O noble, noble <hi>Paris,</hi> more noble then thoſe, that are enobled with flattering and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding titles. How loving art thou true? How truely wiſe, and vertuous; that not only canſt without pride conquer thy foes; but alſo without folly (beyond nature) command to owne and deereſt affections. If that wanton <hi>Trojan</hi> had had the like ſympathie of minde, and the ſame ſtable ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart, as he had the likeneſſe, and unity of thy name; <hi>Troy</hi> had beene unconquered, and hee had lived longer and in greater glory. But let us returne to the Lord <hi>Vray Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> who after the overthrow and ejectment of the <hi>Savo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> had poſting newes brought him, that the maſicious and imperious <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> upon notice of the victory, fell ſuddainely dead. She could live no longer, that had no hope to rule any longer: He pride and deſire of Soveraignety, could neither brooke ſubjection, nor endure controlment; Beſides the guilt of her owne evill, proclaimed her death; and the feare of looſing her life, was the loſſe of her life. Such is the nature of greatneſſe, that but croſt in their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:12144:89"/>
courſes, they ſhrinke under the waight of their owne burthenous pride. But her remove, moved not ſo much the good Governour, as the miſſe of their glorious preſerver, that invincible and all admirable Knight of the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> that to their amazement, had ſo oft relieved their weakned forces, reſcued their fainting endangered friends, repuls'd their oppreſſing Enemies, ſlaine moſt of their beſt Commanders, daunted the whole Armie, &amp; at two blowes, overthrowne and killed the malignant <hi>Maligne,</hi> and the proud ambitious Duke, that potent Generall: Then hee cauſed inquiſition to be made throughout all his territories after him, and rich rewards promiſed to him that could, or ſhould give knowledge of him: but no one could ſhew what he was, nor where he was: onely ſome declared, that his Beaver being broken in Battaile, they ſawe his face as blacke as darkneſſe, and his eyes as bright as fire; which made the Governor doubtfull, whether he were a man, that did more then many men; or no man that could not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by an hoaſt of men; or that the all-mercifull God in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of their diſtreſſed right, had ſent ſome of his correcting Miniſters, to chaſten, and powre vengeance on the hatefull heads of their uniuſt foes. But the Warre being thus ended, Peace called a counſell for the further eſtabliſhing of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; And the conſideration of theſe bloudy iarres, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned poore <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> to dye; not onely for leaving his Lord, and being unable to give account of his Soveraignes life; but alſo for being the firſt cauſe of perturbation in the State, and after of forraigne invaſion. The loſſe of ſo many of their lives, made them all thirſt after his death; To ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten which, they brought him the next day to the place of execution, where happily the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and <hi>Sirap,</hi> with his man <hi>Boufoy,</hi> came by all in Pilgrims gownes, as they were (by agreement) going to the Citie; who ſeeing and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the cauſe of that Aſſembly, withdrew themſelves, and upon ſhort conſultation, they ſent <hi>Boufoy</hi> to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (who needes would bee there to heare his lateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) that he might learne ſomewhat concerning his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

Lord.) Of him did <hi>Boufoy,</hi> knowing now the cauſe) in the name of his Maſter, the Knight of the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> ſhould be delivered unto him; which granted, hee would undertake to bring them to the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin.</hi> In aſſurance whereof, he (unfolding his Gowne) ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the honour of his Maſters ſhield, as a pledge for his performance; which when the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance</hi> ſaw, hee knew it by the deviſe thereon, to bee the ſame, that the Knight of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> carried in Battaile, and therefore he joyfully tooke it, and kiſſing it reverently, ſayd; That that remarkable badge of his all-vertuous, and moſt glorious worth, (beſides the glad tydings he delivered of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lord) was more then ſufficient, to redeeme a world of lives; And therefore preſenting <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> unto him, hee prayed that they might both ſee the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and the <hi>Daulphin</hi> Knight, whom next to the <hi>Daulphin;</hi> both hee, and all the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennonians,</hi> did, and would ever honour, as their ſole and onely preſerving Patron; And then taking his Chayne from about his necke, hee gave it him, ſaying: Let this bee a witneſſe of my gratefulneſſe, and truly tell thee, with that true joy I entertaine thy welcome tydings. <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foy</hi> humbly thanked his honour, and requeſted him, that he would bee pleaſed to ſee how hee beſtowed <hi>Mal-Fiance,</hi> whom he brought unto the other two Pilgrims, that were walking a little aſide from them. But when the <hi>Daulphin</hi> had diſcovered himſelfe unto him, <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> fell downe at his feet for mercy, and riſing, threw up his Hat into the ayre, and cryed aloud, the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> God ſave my Lord the DAVLPHIN.</p>
            <p>This unexpected, and moſt fortunate accident, made all the company at the hearing therof, to ſhowt for ioy: And the good <hi>Vray Eſperance</hi> haſtily lighting from his Horſe, fell upon his knee, and kiſſing his hand, ſayd; Long may my Liege Lord the <hi>Daulphin</hi> live. Whereat the <hi>Daulphin</hi> ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, embraced him, and told him, that as his loyaltie was crowned with renowne, ſo would he adde honour, and reward to his vertues. But forget not, ſayd hee, my Lord,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12144:90"/>
to welcome this noble and heroicall <hi>Moore,</hi> the thrice wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Knight of the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> that both hath preſerved mee from death and thraldome, and delivered you, &amp; my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from our oppreſſing foes. O with what ioy, and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, did then this loyall reioycing Lord haſten to kneele unto him: For though he held him leſſe then a God, yet he thought he could not be, but more then a man: But <hi>Sirap</hi> ſtaying him, greeted him with all the demonſtrations of love, and reverent reſpect. This done, they mounted both the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and this magnificent <hi>Moore,</hi> who needs would both ride bare-fac'd in theyr Pilgrime Gownes through the Citie; <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> waited on the <hi>Daulphins</hi> ſtirope and <hi>Boufoy</hi> manly carried his Maſters Shield before him, and after went the Lord <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ray Eſperance,</hi> with all the reſt of their retinue.</p>
            <p>Now their approach was no ſooner knowne in <hi>Vienna,</hi> but that they knew their welcomes by their rejoycing bels ſtately boone-fires, and triumphing hearts.</p>
            <p>Hardly could they paſſe for preſſe of people, ſtill they came running to ſee them, eſpecially the Knight of the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> whom they admired for his fame, honoured for his great atchievements, and lov'd for their protection. <hi>Sirap</hi> ſeemed much to admire the French, whom the French themſelvs did more then admire. But in viewing the whole Troupe, his obſerving eye, light by chance on his faſt friend <hi>La-nova,</hi> at which ſight, hee ſighed, yet thought himſelfe happy in the ſight. Thus rode they on triumphant in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and honoured of all. At length they came to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace gate, where diſmounting themſelves, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> now happy in being the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> could not but ſhed ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling teares, in tender remembrance of his too well beloved Wife.</p>
            <p>But as the Generall of an Armie, buries all the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his loſt friend, in the pride and triumph of his Conqueſt: ſo did the <hi>Daulphins</hi> freedome from many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, and the artainement to his neere loſt principality, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh all ſorrow and memory of the dead <hi>Daulphinis.</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:12144:90"/>
So that wiping his eyes, he turned himſelfe towards <hi>Sirap,</hi> and embracing him, ſaid; Moſt worthy Knight, and my deareſt friend, welcome to my Court to my ſelfe, and all that is mine: This Pallace, my Countrey, and I, are all at your diſpoſe; For ſo in my particular obligation, and by your merritorious and pleading deſerts, am I bound unto you: And longer may not I enioy what I now poſſeſſe, then you ſhall finde my promiſes full laden with rich perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. And be further aſſured, that as I onely live through your love, and raigne altogether by your valour, ſo will I ever owe you fealty for my life, and ſtill doe you homage for my Crowne. <hi>Sirap</hi> underſtanding thus much by <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foy,</hi> returned him humble thankes for his ſo gratefull and high eſteeme, both of himſelfe, and his poore endeavours; with proteſtation that he neither wiſh'd, nor expected ſo great, and undeſeruing guerdons; but ſtill held himſelfe moſt indebted vnto his owne deſires, to doe him all further poſſible ſervice.</p>
            <p>This interchange of kindneſſes, gave contentment to them both, and was moſt pleaſing to the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> who yet fed ſo on his freſh feeling happineſſe, that he gave in charge that all his Subiects ſhould honour <hi>Sirap,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and hold his will, as the will of their Lord; For ſo (he ſaid) is your Lords will, that next to the Lord of hoaſts, holds his life, and living of him. Then told he them, how and with what hazard of his life, hee had redeemed him, from moſt baſe bondage, and cruell death; How he had left many heathen honours, to honour him, then greatly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; and how he had protected him at Sea from danger of Pirats: and laſtly, eſtabliſhed him in his regalty, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of his foes. And therefore many, and ſundry were the Triumphs that now were ordained for him; but more then many, were the ſeverall thoughts that afflicted his doubtfull minde: <hi>Vienna</hi> he thought had cauſe to condemne him ſince affection ever thinkes all times of ſtay too long, that hangs on deſert: <hi>La-nova</hi> he knew would rebuke him for violating the ſacred lawes of friendſhip in his conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:12144:91"/>
And his reverend Father might well queſtion his breach of love and duty, that ſo refuſed to ſhew himſelfe a ſonne. One while was he ready to embrace <hi>La-nova;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time to runne to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna;</hi> and by and by hee was ready preſt to fall on his knees to Sir <hi>Jaques.</hi> Now did hee pitty diſtreſſed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> (who in all theſe alterations, was neither moved nor removed) Then did he feare her liberty, ſince her Father had no feeling of her calamity. Thus dubiouſly perplexed in minde hee ſadly ſate, unregarding regarding, the continuing and maintained Iuſtes; untill the <hi>Daulphin</hi> iudging of his ſtormy thoughts, by his clowded counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, thus awaked him by his Interpreter.</p>
            <p>What think'ſt, ſaid hee, my beſt worthy friend of our French Knights? and how ſtands our Court ſports with your liking? <hi>Sirap,</hi> whoſe Martiall minde, was now molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with milder, and calmer thoughts by his man, thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, As Knights of good regard, I regard your Knights; and as noble befitting ſports, I commend your heroicall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes. All doth well, and well doth it ſtand with your Highneſſe, that hath Knights, that can doe ſo well. But the Iuſtes being ended, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> that had read his diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in the deepe characters of his face (for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance oft ſhewes the affects and paſſions of the heart) tooke him by the hand, and privatly led him into a faire ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtred gallery, hanged with moſt artificiall pictures of greateſt Monarches, where he thus againe aſſaved to finde the cauſe of his diſturbance. Let not (ſaid hee) any doubt diſmay mylives preſerver, nor let any remembrance of your laſt, and loſt honours, worke in you any repenting humor; ſince <hi>Viennaes Daulphin</hi> is both willing, and ready, both to accompliſh your demand, and to honour you with all dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. What pleaſeth <hi>Sirap,</hi> pleaſeth the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall content the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> but what ſhall well like <hi>Sirap.</hi> Then aske my Lord, and bee Lord of your asking. <hi>Sirap</hi> thus kindly entreated, and encouraged, lowly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe, and by <hi>Boufoy,</hi> thus replyed.</p>
            <p>Know moſt renowned, and thrice worthy Prince, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:12144:91"/>
doubtfull ſuſpition harbours not in noble hearts; Nor think I once of honours change. Your covenanted promiſe exiles that doubt, and the effect of my requeſt, is the honour that beſt will pleaſe my minde. Then let me ſhew, and ſhewing crave, both what troubleth your ſervant, and what he now (in all humility) demands for his conditioned gift. Not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting honours, the worlds fading glory; nor coveting riches, mans pleaſing evill; but ſeeking contentment in loves felicity. I aske, claime, and require, your daughter my Lord, for my wife, and a wife for my reward. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne of her attractive vertues, and the vertue of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perfections, hath by report ſo captivated my freeſt thoughts ſince my comming to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennois,</hi> that wondring at her Fame, I am wounded with Fancy; and my deſire is to ſee and applaude her excellencies. Then let it not ſeeme ſtrange unto you, that unſeene perfections have thus wrought unknowne paſſions, ſince the eare is as well ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to conceit, as the eye is pliant to affection. The <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> whoſe unnaturall &amp; impenitrable heart felt no longer remorce of her endured miſery, then whilſt hee was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in miſery; and who was no ſooner free, but that hee freed his remorced thoughts, from all thought of remorce; In ſo much, that looking neither after her impriſonment, nor his owne poſterity, hee in his euer over awfulneſſe ſhewed himſelſe now rather an unrelenting Tyrant, then a chaſtiſing Father. But now thus utged by <hi>Sirap</hi> (whoſe warranted demand, and high deſerts, might well challenge an abſolute grant) hee herein (ſtill diſcontented) thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <hi>Sirap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing I ſee (right noble, valiant, and moſt merritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Moore)</hi> ſeemeth worſe to love, then to prefer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e any thing before it ſelfe; For cloath Deſire in plates of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd gold, and Deſire will ſhiver all for colde; and fill affections purſe with treaſure, and fancy wanting content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſtarve for hunger: ſo that nothing can ſatisfie Love, but love. Your deſerts might well have challenged my Principality for your due, my dignities for your right
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:12144:92"/>
and all my treaſure for your owne. But all theſe I ſee ſuffice not, becauſe they ſatisfie not; And to aske you why, is to aske one halfe pyned, why he is hungry. You loue my Lord, you loue but whom? my daughter; yea that is my griefe; Not that you loue her, vnworthy your loue; but that I cannot giue you her, more then worthy her. For ſuch I ſweare (by the eternall, and my all-preſeruing God) hath beene, and yet is, the vndutifull, and moſt obſtinate will of my too diſobedient and degenerate daughter, that neuer yet nor yet euer could I, or ſhall I (I feare) perſwade, intreate, or enforce her to conſent to any, in royall ranke, worth, or majeſtie ſuitable to her ſelfe. For many times many power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Princes, that ſued for her fauour, ſhee hath both care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly diſreſpected, and ſcornefully refuſed; And as many times, many times, hath ſhe therein my will diſobeyed, and contemned. Not regarding her renowne ſhining in their glory; Nor reſpecting my contentment, nor progenie, eclipſed both in her neglect of me, and in her affoorded fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to her farre inferiours; which cauſed me in iuſtice to puniſh her hateful diſobedience with impriſonment, &amp; yet in nature to bewaile her impriſonment, though enforced by Iuſtice, Where I left her, there (ſo you pleaſe) may you finde her, a priſoner to her will, that will not yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her ſelfe to my will; and therefore by my will, worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chaſtiſed without offence to Nature. For where Nature. offendeth law, there law may iuſtly be executed on Nature Aſſay her (moſt worthy of all worth) and put in ballance your fortune with your fancy, and if your hap may drowne her favour, you ſhall redouble the ſmall remainder of my aged dayes, and well ſatisfie the iuſtice of my diſpleaſure, with the honour of your deſired affinity. All my right is yours; your demand, my conſent; and my conſent a full Fathers graunt. <hi>Sirap</hi> acknowledging this his ſo great bounty, gave him more thankes then if he had preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled and inveſted him in the Principality of <hi>Viennois;</hi> Yet ſayd he, it ſeemes not ouer-ſtrange to me, nor ſhould it bee ſo offenſive to your Highneſſe, that one ſo enriched by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:12144:92"/>
ſo admired for Vertue, and ſo endowed by Fortune, ſhould herein againſt all nature, ſo reſiſt the law of nature; ſince Fancie is altogether guided by Deſtiny; and Love is neither ſubiect to duty nor reaſon. Then ſeeing that Love yeeldeth neither reaſon of choiſe, nor change; I will leave to reaſon further of it, and aduenture once to cary up a diſh to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> table, that never yet ſerved in her Court.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Daulphin</hi> glad that his demaund, was of no greater conſequence, ſecretly ſmiled at his ſimplicity, that neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Honours higheſt advancements, onely contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the naked hope of moſt impoſſible favours. But Sir <hi>Sirap</hi> being more aſſured, then the <hi>Daulphin</hi> did aſſure himſelfe, reſted thankfully contented with the ſame; And the next morning in the pride of his ſecret ioy, hee went unto the Caſtle, where (having the <hi>Daulphins</hi> ſignet for his warrant) hee called for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> who fearing ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſtratagem, (for all her hope of welfare was dead) fearefully came to the dore, to know the end of her puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But when <hi>Sirap</hi> ſawe the alteration, that vertuous Conſtancie had wrought in her impriſonment, griefe ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd him, that hee was more mortified at the ſight, then he was Moorefied in ſight; yet after ſome ſecret digeſted ſighes, he cheared up his ingreeved ſpirit, with the ioy hee had to ſee her, and thus by his interpreter he ſaluted her.</p>
            <p>Our Gods of all happineſſe, make faire <hi>Vienna</hi> happy in her deſires, and more fortunate in her life. The ſame <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na (<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> ſaid) yeelds you hearty thankes, and prayes that the like content may countervaile your wel wiſhing. Then ſhall (ſaid he) my love be made immortall in your liberty, and your liberty be purchaſed by my love. <hi>Vienna</hi> abaſh'd at his reply, replyed againe; that griefe had no harbour for love, nor loue any acquaintance with diſtreſſed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna.</hi> A noble cauſe, ſaid <hi>Sirap,</hi> may yet helpe to heale a grievous caſe. Then leave theſe for lorne walls, and let not your will make you a priſoner, that may live in my love a Princeſſe. For know (Madam) that your father being a priſoner in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and allotted there to moſt baſe and cruell death; I
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:12144:93"/>
though by kinde, an unpaſſionate Moore, yet (much more then any Moore) pittying the wiſeries of others, had ſuch compaſſion on your Fathers diſtreſſe, that growing care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of my eſtate (being there then entertained with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſtate) I aduentured with great adventure, to acquit him from ſhamefull bondage, and more cruell death; Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally; that vpon my arrivall with him in this Countrey, he ſhould graunt me, without all exception, one gift, that then I ſhould require; which he then ratified by oath in ſight of his God, and now hath confirmed it, hy will in the preſence of his people.</p>
            <p>Now Madame, hearing the well worthy renowne of your renowned beauty, though being by Nature fierce, yet ſubiect to affection, I could not but in that frailty, yeeld to humane condition. And therefore prizing my content be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Crowne, I required your Ladiſhip for my Wife, which your Father by oath hath graunted, which you in duty ſhould yeeld unto, and which I in love (if love can merit ſuch happineſſe) doe deſerve, and yet moſt humbly doe requeſt. <hi>Vienna</hi> thus moved, remooved thus his flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and aſpiting hope. If, ſaid ſhee, my Father enioy a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond life by your conditionall adventure, you may Preſſe him to the performance, ſo farre, as it it is in his power to accompliſh; more you cannot aske, leſſe hee will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
            <p>But know Sir Knight, that love knowes no ſuch pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall law, that yet was never ſubiect to any law. The Father hath but a conſent, not the choyſe, in the daughters affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; his free thoughts have no feeling of her conceit; and his mettle minde, and corrupted humours, are oft unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his childes fancie; Neither ſtands it with any reaſon, that he that cannot govern his owne paſſions, ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand others affections. Then muſt you of neceſſity, excuſe his impoſſibility, and admit onely of his willingneſſe; that can give nought but conſent for his larges.</p>
            <p>Yet Madame, by your favour (ſaid <hi>Sirap)</hi> ſtands the daughter bound for her Fathers good, and the guerdon is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12144:93"/>
but ungratefull, that is required in contempt. True ſaid <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> but every good muſt not bee rewarded with the beſt; leſt the beſt want fit requitall for due deſert. Let it then ſuffice, that with thankes I acknowledge your great good, and in any other thing will be ready to pleaſure you. Onely in this, pardon me my Lord, for in loves infirmities I have no affinity, A troubled ſoule onely in teares, her comfort ſeekes. It is a heavy comfort, ſaid <hi>Sirap,</hi> that in mourning ſtands, yet, ſaid ſhe, doth the cuſtome of ſorrow leſſen the griefe, and it is ſome comfort to bee voyde of all comfort. Diſpaire, ſaid <hi>Sirap,</hi> is mother to death, and death no fit compannion for beauty. My beauty ſaid ſhee (poore as it is) hath already beene my bane, and made me moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate in my moſt fortunatneſſe.</p>
            <p>Why Madame, quoth he, hath your Grace beene decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? So ſaid ſhe, ſay they that tolde me ſo. But truth hee replyed, ſtands not on the tongues of men; True ſhee ſaid, and that is the cauſe why we are deceived by men: you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me much, ſaid <hi>Sirap:</hi> Nay, ſaid ſhee, not miſtaken, but overtaken you in the truth, and ſo ſhee bad him fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, leaving him tormented in minde, in that hee geſt by her laſt words, that ſome one to advantage himſelfe, or in malice to him, had wronged him in words; Yet could hee not but ſmile, to thinke how his conceit was her deceit. But leaving her, whom hee meant not ſo to leave, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſay her againe, he returned to the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and told him of his hapleſſe ſucceſſe. Who ſmothering his inward ioy, made ſuch ſhewe of diſcontentment, that the angry ocean ſwelled not as he ſeem'd to ſtorme. But <hi>Sirap</hi> neither way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his anger, nor her anſwere, all ſmiling ſaid, that once more he would with <hi>Ixion,</hi> aſſay to embrace <hi>Juno,</hi> and ſee whether in ſhuffling againe of the Cardes, Fortune would deale him a better game. For he would owe her himſelfe, and try whether in his owne language he could weane, and win her to his will, which mooved great laughter, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred further occaſion of pleaſant talke. Thus they paſſed for the reſt of the day, vntill ſupper, which ended, <hi>Sirap</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:12144:94"/>
giving them the good night, went to his Chamber, where calling to minde <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iennas</hi> words, which in his ſuppoſe, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued to report of his diſloyalty, which grieved him much that her griefe would be redoubled by his never intended falſity, and that hee ſhould be ſo wronged by unwronged, and unknowne men. But after he had a little fed his ſad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with his deceiving conceit, hee determined darkly, that darke night, to ſhew his conceit thereon, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue that vaile of miſdeeme, that ſo ſhadowed the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his faithfulneſſe. And therefore furniſhing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with a well tuned Lute, in the dead of night, hee went alone to the Caſtle, where cloſe ſhrowding himſelfe under her window, he ſweetly ſounding, thus chaunted out this irefull ſong.</p>

               <hi>Vienna</hi> pleaſed with the tune, amazed at the voyce, but more then raviſhed with the words, haſtily put her head out of the windowe, and ſaid; <hi>What ſo ever thou art, take thankes of a diſtreſſed Lady, and Heaven comfort thee, as thou haſt, J know not how, recomforted me.</hi> And ſo turning her ſelfe to <hi>Jzabella,</hi> ſhe ask'd whether ſhe had ever heard that voyce before, who replying, ſayd, That if her memory fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her not, it was the ſame, or much like; if not the ſame that they heard in firſt in Court, under her Chamber win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe. Ah <hi>Izabella</hi> ſayd <hi>Vienna,</hi> thou harpeſt too well, to be ſo well. Yet if my minde divine aright (God graunt it may devine) I ſhall heare ſome tydings of my <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades my heart, ſo graunt our God. But ſay <hi>Izabella,</hi> ſay, what ſhall poore <hi>Vienna</hi> ſay to this moralized <hi>Moore,</hi> whoſe civill condition, maieſticall preſence, and ſugred tongue, differs ſo much from his rude, and barbarous Nation. Is not his blacke hue full of ſweet favour, and his favour ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to command beauties proudeſt favour. Now truſt me <hi>Izabella</hi> the gentle <hi>Moore,</hi> more and more would gaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in my affection, but the more I thinke he is a <hi>Moore,</hi> the more (for my <hi>Paris</hi> ſake) I ſcorne to love the <hi>Moore.</hi> And therefore reſolved to live to none but <hi>Paris,</hi> (though <hi>Paris</hi> hath forgotten <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna)</hi> how ſhall I non-ſute his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, whoſe proud hope promiſeth love, and whoſe love is warranted by my Fathers oath. <hi>Jzabella</hi> moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to acquit her of that care (though it was the leaſt care of her care) told her, that her old putrified pollicie, would eaſily prevent that miſchiefe. and therefore having a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Capon in the Caſtle, they preſently diſmembring the body, tooke the two legges, and binding them under her arme holes, where the heate of her body might ſooneſt corrupt them, ſhee preparedly expected his comming the next day. When <hi>Sirap</hi> clad in his richeſt array, ſtrangely faſhioned, came accompanyed with many, that of purpoſe (being made acquainted with his intention) came to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves with his ſo ſuppoſed unuſuall courting. For hee being as they thought, not to be underſtood by his
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:12144:96"/>
tongue, nor to be ſatisfied by his eare; They vainely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that he either would woe her with gifts, or with his countenance, or with variety of geſtures. But hee no ſooner came to the Caſtle (but fruſtrating their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) he requeſted them by <hi>Bouſoy,</hi> to ſtay, and ſtand a while aſide. When winged with the hope of Loves aſſurance, he inſtantly boldly, and all onely, entered, ſaluted, and in French thus courteouſly aſſaulted his faire and friendly foe. How fares, ſaid hee, the imperious Miſtreſſe of my inthralled heart? As a priſoner, not like a Princeſſe, ſhe ſaid, fares the Miſtreſſe of a thralled, and wofull heart. But how came you Sir Knight ſo Frenchified, that erſt was ſo ſtrangefied? Love, ſweet love, he ſaid, hath made my tongue your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man, and my heart your ſervant. Then hath love (ſhee replyed) wrought a wonder in you &amp; an admiration in me. Such ſaid <hi>Sirap,</hi> is the divine power of Loves Deity, ſuch the vertuous force of your heavenly beauty, and ſuch the happy iſſue of our decreed deſtiny. Therefore, yeeld <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Vienna</hi> yeeld, to that, which the Gods have decreed, Love commands, thy beauty requires, our Fortune allots, thy Father wills, and I thy friend requeſt. <hi>Vienna</hi> thus charged, could not tell how to diſcharge her ſelfe of him, but by having a recourſe to her wonted and hidden policy; And therefore uncloathing her Ivory breſts, ſhe all ſighing ſaid, Alas Sir Knight, thy commendable demeanour, and Princely worth, well merits favour; and thy inticing tongue is ſufficient to entrap a well adviſed minde, and a far more ſtayeder conceit. But know moſt noble, and moſt Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Moore,</hi> that I am farre worſe then I ſeeme, and much better then I would be. For behold (ſhee bared her breaſts that he might behold) the untimely corruption of my blaſted beauty, looke on the loathſome fruit of my long, and grievous impriſonment, and but feele; O feele not the filthy ſent of my ulcered and rotting body; and then tell me whether I am not rather to be loathed, then loved; fled from, then followed. <hi>Sirap</hi> aſtoniſhed at her words, but beyond all amazement, danted with the ſmell, neere fainted
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:12144:96"/>
thereat; ſuch was his inſufferable ſorrow for her, that hee curſt himſelfe for her; And yet ſuch was the conſtancy of his never dying love, that encouraging himſelfe, the better to cheere her up, he with a joyfull countenance ſaid; Be it Madame ſo, or worſe then ſo, or what ſo you will; it ſhall not matter, I reſt wholly yours, if for yours, you will accept of mee, that am none but yours. For know moſt conſtant, and my endeered Lady, that <hi>Paris</hi> (if <hi>Paris</hi> bee not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) pleadeth now in perſon for himſelfe, and here offereth his life, and ſervice for your love. In confirmation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſee here the happy ſeale of your love, and the ſole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of my abſence, the loyall, and unvaluable Ring, your Highneſſe gave mee, when firſt being purſued by your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Knights, I departed from you, like a hungry Infant pulled from his Nources breaſt, or a thirſty Hart chaſed from a ſweet Fountaine. Then, then in the pride of your perfections, you paradiz'd mee in the heaven of your love; and now in the decay of your glory will I wed my ever-living conſtancy, to your never dying loyalty.</p>
            <p>Looke, nay looke not on me ſo ſtrangely; my black hue is but an Artificiall vizour, and my borrowed countenance but the aſſurance of my ſafety. <hi>Vienna</hi> not able on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to entertaine ſo great a ioy, ſhrunk downe, deprived of her vitall ſpirits, but chafed, reuived, and enabled by <hi>Jza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> ſhee with teares of ioy diſtilling downe her cheekes, ſadly ſaid. Ah <hi>Paris, Paris,</hi> thy love made me a contented priſoner, but thy long abſence hath made my priſon a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting hell. But now, O happy now; thy thrice happy returne makes my priſon ſeeme a Paradiſe, and my hell a moſt glorious heaven; with that falling on his breſt, and encloſing him within her fainting armes, ſhe often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled, her double doubled kiſſes. <hi>Paris</hi> being likewiſe ſurprized with fulneſſe of ioy, loſt himſelfe in her armes, but being acquitted of that extaſie, he payd her large inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt for her kindneſſe, pleaded ſorrow for her martirdome, and meere neceſſity for his abſence. Ceaſe <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhee ſaid, my <hi>Paris</hi> ſurceaſe theſe needleſſe excuſes of faultleſſe iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:12144:97"/>
ſince to over-fortifie innocencie, is to breed ſuſpition. There is none but I, that have (if offended) offended. As firſt in being cauſe of thy exile, then of thy dangerous travailes, and now in reiecting thy love; but impute the firſt two, to my Fathers ſeverity, not to my love; and the laſt of my ignorance, not to my inconſtancy. For proofe whereof ſee heere, (here ſhewed ſhee the Capons legges (the triall of my truth, which but in pollicy I vſed in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, to withſtand importunate Suters, and all onely to love none but thee, earſt the ſole hope of my life; but now the onely life of my ſoule.</p>
            <p>Thus pleaded ſhee to pleaſe him, and thus it pleaſed him to praiſe her, and both of them ſtill ioying, in that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed each other. Then turning to <hi>Jzabella,</hi> he kiſt her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, and vowed that out of his beſt fortunes, he would bee thankfull to her, for her love to him, but eſpecially for her comforts to <hi>Vienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And taking them both by the hands, he told them how, and by what meanes, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> her Father had freely, and abſolutely given her to him. And therfore he requeſted them to conceale their knowledge of him, and to go along with him, for that he ment to have her Father to deliver her to him; all which they both ſo willingly, and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully did, that the Gent. attending his leaſure, no little marveiled to ſee him lead them ſo familiarly by the hands, and ſo pleaſantly talking with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> in a private manner. But when they were come before the <hi>Daulphin, Paris</hi> (for now is <hi>Sirap</hi> turned againe to returned <hi>Paris)</hi> holding her ſtill by the hand, humbly requeſted him, in the preſence of his daughter, &amp; Barons, to ratifie his vowed guiſt. Which the <hi>Daulphin</hi> both miſliking, and admiring: demaunded of her, whether her liking, and conſent, ſtood to that blacke irreligious <hi>Moore,</hi> that had ſo often refuſed ſo many po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Lords, and moſt accompliſhed Princes. To which ſhee (in all reverence, praying pardon) ſaid. That the blacke ſmeared Smith was moſt pleaſing to the Queene of beauty; That tha conſtant colour unfadible in it ſelfe, well argued
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:12144:97"/>
conſtancie in the perſon. That his barbarous nature, was both reclaimed, and refined by his more civill education; and that his religion would eaſily be conformable to their profeſſion. But howſoever, it ſufficeth, that I love him and love yeelds no reaſon of choyſe, nor hath any reſpect of perſons. His blinde deity, blindes our fancies; and fancy lives not in deſert, but in deſire. We love altogether by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king not for honours; and our wills cannot command our affections, that are not in our powers:</p>
            <p>Then vouchſafe my Soveraigne Lord and moſt gratious Father, of my deſtinied deſire and admit of his wel-merited demand, &amp; let me with your free conſent enioy him for my Husband, that hath ſo well purchaſed me for his Wife; ſo ſhall you honour your ſelfe, in doing him right; reward his ſervices, enworthy your poſterity, and repayre my decayed glory. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> ſeeing that it was but in vaine, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt celeſtiall influence, preordinate be providence divine, and that he could neither in honor, nor conſcience infringe his obliging oath, nor reject his pleading and glorious worth; ſhewed a vertue in neceſſity, and freely gave, and delivered her unto him.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Paris</hi> being thus poſſeſt of his deſire, caſt off his artificiall maske, and lowly on his knees, ſhewed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelfe, the humble and thankfull ſeruant of his Lord. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> finding himſelfe thus deceived by him, that happily deceived the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and his Keepers for him; could not but commend his loyall love, and love him for his ſaving ſervice. His ſuperlative valour, and unvaluable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſhewed that his great fortunes were but Miniſters to his will. And therefore he cheerefully ſaid. In <hi>France</hi> was I honoured by <hi>Paris,</hi> In <hi>Babylon</hi> unthralled by <hi>Sirap,</hi> And at home both I, my Countrey, and people, were protected by the Knight of the <hi>Daulphin.</hi> To <hi>Paris</hi> therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne my love, To <hi>Sirap</hi> I give my daughter, And to the Knight of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> I yeeld my Principality. Then my beloved and renowned ſonne, giue me thy hand, and let me embrace thee with thy valour. And here I ſweare by the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:12144:98"/>
all-ever-living-God, that if I were ſole Monarch of the whole Vniverſe, thou onely ſhouldſt rule for me, and after me: More I cannot give thee for thy <hi>Aſian</hi> loſt honors, leſſe thou ſhalt not have then my whole <hi>Europian</hi> dignities. To confirme which, he preſently cauſed him to be proclaimed his ſonne in law, and the next lawfull and immediate heire to all his Royall Territories. Great was now the wonder of all men, great the preparation to ſolemnize their Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and more then great, the joy, and tryumphes made, and ordained for them. But amongſt them all, there was none <hi>(Vienna</hi> excepted) that reioyced more then old Sir <hi>Jaques,</hi> whoſe ſilver beard, was all emboſſed with pearles of ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling teares, for the ioy of his ſo famous found ſonne. As for his endeared friend <hi>La-nova,</hi> his glad heart ſhewed the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes of ioy, and all his thoughts were raviſhed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and contentments.
