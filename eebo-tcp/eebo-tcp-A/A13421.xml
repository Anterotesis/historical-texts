            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the neither Noble or Ignoble, Lord or Lady, kind or cruell, learned or ignorant, curteous or currish, Christian or Barbarian, Man or Woman, rich or poore: but to all and every one in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and particular.</head>
            <p>MOnsieur, and Madam <hi>Hydra,</hi> to your many Heads and varietie of Censures I have made bold to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a poore, harmelesse, modest, honest, and innocent <hi>Bawd</hi>; I know great persons of worth and Honour, are daily so visited with penurious shreds of <hi>Schollership,</hi> fragments of <hi>Hexameters</hi> and <hi>Pentameters,</hi> scraps of Poetry, the scum and dregs of wit, and the froth and lees of wisdome: One salutes my Lords Lordship at Breakfast with a Funerall <hi>Elegie,</hi> lamentably written, and is most miserably rewarded for his kindness. Another hunts out his VVorships ungentlemanly Knighthood, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving most intolerably be laboured his name with an <hi>Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicke</hi> or <hi>Anagram</hi>) which out of his vacuitie of worthinesse hee rewards with not a peny. A third hath belyed such a Lady or Gentlewomans Beautie and qualities, in most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable fashion, setting her forth for faire and vertuous; for the which hee is rewarded according to the subject he wrote of, and his owne demerits, with as much as comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For these and some other respects, I thought it not fit to desire the patronage of any one person in patticular,
<pb facs="tcp:11700:3"/>
it being a subject that is common to all, for all, or any. At men are dispersed universally through the VVorld, so a <hi>Bawd,</hi> being an universall creature, whose function is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely scattered, I thought it not pertinent or accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that she should be privately protected by any. Therefore as she hath beene and is for al, so I dedicate her to all, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all are better able to reward the <hi>Poet,</hi> than one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. And this is further to advertise the Reader, that where I doe speake of Spirituall <hi>Bawdes, Bawdry, Adultery,</hi> or <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> that I have avoided prophanitie, obscenity, scurrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and all manner of incivility or indecencie; not medling with Religion at all, but with a pitiful derision, and merry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, explaining the abuses, foppish and sottish corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that like so many Cankers or Caterpillers have and doe dayly eate, consume and putrifie both the Puritie and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of that Religion which boalts it selfe to be most <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>Catholike.</hi> For the other part of this Booke, or <hi>Bawd,</hi> shee is altogether civill or temporall, being not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled so much as with one good Ecclesiastical word, but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paradoxicall; setting foorth the rare and singular vertues of a <hi>Bawd</hi>; wherein if any of my Readers can picke any pleasure, it is on apparant signe they have some wit, and if reape any profit, let them either thanke me in words, or else revvard me with silence.</p>

            </l>
            <l>Two little Pamphlets I have wrote before,</l>

            <l>Nor did my <hi>Thiefe</hi> from any man purloyne,</l>
            <l>Or liv'd by filching either goods or coyne.</l>
            <l>And now by chance it came into my mind,</l>
            <l>That with the <hi>Bawd</hi> my Pen was much behind:</l>
            <l>My <hi>Whore</hi> was honest, and my <hi>Thiefe</hi> was true,</l>
            <l>And in this sort Ile give the <hi>Bawd</hi> her due.</l>
            <l>Strange fruit from my poore barren labour springs,</l>

it were to doe her an open injury, for she doth extend her entertainement, to as many as please to <hi>please</hi> her, and her charity doth alwayes stretch as farre as any mans money will reach: And to speake the truth, shee hath great reason on her side; for if a man let his <hi>Horse</hi> to hire, or <hi>Asse</hi> to marker, hee will looke to be paid for the travell or paines of his Beast; and shall a <hi>Bawd</hi> let her Soule to the <hi>Devill</hi> for nothing?

a high point of Doctrine, to love her selfe better then she doth all the world besides: and in this she differs much from a <hi>Romane</hi> Catholike, that she builds not vpon her <hi>Workes,</hi> or hath any hope to be saved by her merits. And should persecution come, she will be no <hi>Martyr,</hi> she will neither hang for one <hi>religion,</hi> or <hi>burne</hi> for another, shee knowes that she came a raw creature into the world, and her resolution is, that neither religion or conscience shall send her roasted out of it.</p>

If a man teach an <hi>Ape</hi> to doe trickes, the honest <hi>Ape</hi> will maintaine him for it; I have seene a <hi>Hare</hi> get her master and dames living, with playing on a <hi>Tabor.</hi> The very <hi>Baboones</hi> are grave examples in this kind, <hi>Tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers</hi> boyes, (and sometimes their wives) doe teach us this duty; and the ignorant <hi>Puppets</hi> doe allow their maker and masters, meat, drinke, and cloath. For mine owne part, If I teach my man to row, I will have for my paines the greatest part of the profit. If I dig or plow and cast my Seed into the ground, I will expect the benefit of the Crop: If I plant or grasse, I should thinke I had but hard measure, if I should not feed vpon the fruit of my labour: By this consequence it is reason that a <hi>Bawd</hi> should reape where she hath sowne, and eate, and live vpon such fruit as shee hath planted.</p>
