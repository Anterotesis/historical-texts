         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS before the coming of Iesus Christ, it is cortain, that <hi>God did
at sundry times, and in diverse manners, speak by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
to prepare the way of this his only and well-beloved Son,
and to dispose Mankind to receive this Soveraign Lord of Heaven and
Earth, with all suitable Respect, Honour and Submission; so since his
return to Heaven, many have pretended Divine and particular Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from thence, authorizing them to alter or add to the Rules and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which he taught and established, for securing and promoting our
Salvation: which is no small Argument for the Divine Authority, of the
Books of the New Testament, where this is very often and in express terms
foretold.</p>
            <p>Almost in every Age, and in every Country, some or other have set up
for Prophets, and have spoken confidently in the Name of the Lord. But
there is one in this Age, <hi>viz. Antonia Bourignon,</hi> whose Pretences are
greater, and far beyond all were before; more cannot, nor yet so much can
be said for the Apostles themselves: for they were but Servants and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to Iesus Christ, who (if she may be believed) only laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for her Work, and did no more than prepare the way for her Design.
The last and greatest Manifestation of the Divine Wisdom, Power, Love
and Goodness was reserved to her, and therefore she is and must be a
greater Person than Iesus Christ himself.</p>
            <p>It is not rare and unusual to see Persons exalt themselves above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and to think of themselves above what they ought to think: But it
is somewhat astonishing, that others should be affected with their Pride
and Vanity, and taken with their Delusion or Imposture, and that they
should become Zealous to support them. Yet so it is, that the strongest
Delusions and the greatest Imposture, have had Admirers and Followers:
and so hath Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon.</hi> She had only two or three Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
who adhered closely to her in her Life-time; for some who admired
her upon the first Acquaintance, deserted her afterwards. But since her
Death, a good many have been proselited, both to her Doctrine and the
Opinion of her Person: there be several on the other side the Sea, but
which concerns us most, the Infection has spread hither to this Isle, and has
seized many especially in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which certainly obligeth every one to
contribute all he can to put a stop to it, and to prevent as much as possible,
the dangerous Consequence. They are not mean and ignorant Persons who
follow this Woman, they are some of the better sort, who have been repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Men of Sense, Learning and Probity; which should lay the Pride of
Man, and teach <hi>him who standeth to take heed lest he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98203:3"/>
Errour, like Sicknss, seizeth upon strong Constitutions, as well as the
weak: And as sometimes the Air is more infectious, and the Bodies of
Men more susceptible of Diseases than at other times; so there are times
which favour Errour very much, and in which it doth exceedingly spread.
At present, there is, all the World over, a wonderful Disposition, in all
serious Persons, to Enthusiasm, and the Delusions which follow it; as in
others a tendency to Atheism and Scepticism: both which are Presages of
some impendent Iudgment.</p>
            <p>I am one of the weakest who may enter into the field, against these Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Truth and True Religion: But God sometimes doth work by the
meanest Instruments; and seeing at this time I have no Charge, which
requires my attendance, I resolve to employ my Time and Thoughts this
way, that I may at least shew my Zeal to the Cause of God, to whose Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I was devoted. I have already publish'd Two Parts of the <hi>Enquiry
into the Nature, Evidence and Necessity of Christian Faith;</hi> and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a <hi>Third,</hi> as soon as the present Task is over, if not before it; by
which (as well as by many other more accurate Treatises) Atheists and
Scepticks may see that the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is no cunning Fable, but a
certain Truth, and worthy to be received. I have turned a while from
the Atheist, only that I may, at the desire of some, encounter the Enthusiast,
who truly does as much disservice to Religion, and is the best Tool which
the Atheist doth work by.</p>
            <p>At first, I design'd only to give some pat Instances to prove that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia
Bourignon</hi> was not Inspired, nor her Doctrine agreeable to the
Scripture; which is sufficient to preserve any from following this Way:
But seeing this is the first time that <hi>Bourignianism</hi> was undertaken, I
was persuaded to do it fully, and not to make an imperfect Work of it; and
especially seeing the Examination of this, discovers all other Enthusiastical
Impostures and Delusions. Our <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> as well as
the <hi>Quietists</hi> and <hi>Pietists</hi> abroad, are of the same kidney, and do all stand
upon the same foundation; so that what overturns one, overturns all.</p>
            <p>To have publish'd at once a full Examination of Enthusiasm, Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Visions, and the particular Tenets of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> would
have required a longer time than the impatient curiosity of some would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow:
For this cause therefore, and for some other reasons, I have been
prevailed with to set it forth by Parts, which are independent upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This is the <hi>First Narrative;</hi> which shews the high Opinion that the
Disciples of <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> have of her, and the Reasons for it: The
next shall go instantly to the Press: So that one may be expected and had
always within three or four Weeks at most after another. I pray God grant
that they may be a means to recover some, and to preserve others from those
Delusions that disturb the Peace and Vnity of the Church, and which lead
private Persons unawares both into Temporal and Eternal Ruine.</p>

            <head>THE
CHARACTER
OF
Madamoiselle ANTONIA BOURIGNON,
By her Disciples,
Consider'd and Examin'd.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ANtonia Bourignon,</hi> the Daughter of one <hi>Iohn</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               <hi>Bourignon,</hi> and Italian Merchant, who lived
at <hi>Lisle</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> was born the 13th. of
<hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1616; and she died at <hi>Franeker,</hi>
in the Province of <hi>Friseland,</hi> the 30th. of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1680:
so that she lived Threescore and four Years, Nine
Months, and Fourteen Days. None of her Friends
had the comfort of attending her when she died: but
a Considerable Person, who some days before was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98203:4"/>
to visit her, came very opportunely to kiss her
Feet, as she was laid in the Coffin, and to get her
buried after the manner she her self desired. And he
who gives this Account of her, adds,<note place="margin">Lavie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, <hi>c. 34. n.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <q>That she was
the most Divine and the most Pure Soul that ever
lived upon the Earth, since Jesus Christ. She was
of a middle Stature, slender and delicate; her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
was agreeable; her Complexion brown;
her Forehead broad, and without Wrinkles; and her
Eyes were a little bluish. She had an ingenious
Air; and such an exquisite Sight, that she never
used Glasses. Her Nose was well made, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.
She was Out-mouthed, having Lips and
Teeth somewhat big. Age had whiten'd her Hairs;
Sickness had made her Face lean; and she was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
about the Eyes. Her Mien, her Speech, her
Address, and way of receiving Persons, were very
taking and agreeable. Her Gate was grave, bearing
her Head a little high; and she did not appear to be
above Forty Years old. All her Senses, except
Tasting, were strong and lively. She was of a quick
and active Disposition. She was never sad, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
of an even Temper. She would never suffer
her Picture to be drawn; not only because she did
not approve of this sort of Vanity, but also because
it very much concern'd her not to be known, upon
the account of her Persecutors. As to the Gifts and
Qualities of her Spirit, her Writings do partly shew
them; but none is capable to know the greatness of
them, save He who bestowed them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> This same Person tells us, <q>That from her Infancy
she had the gift of Chastity in so high a degree,<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 2. p. 21.</note>
that she often said, That in all her life, she never
had, not even upon a Temptation or Surprize, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98203:4"/>
least Thought which might be unbecoming the
Chastity of the purest Virgin-state. St. <hi>Teresa</hi>
writes of her self, That God sometimes favour'd her
with the same Grace. But as for Madamoiselle <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignon,</hi>
she possess'd it to that degree, that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
(if one may have leave to speak so) upon
those who conversed with her. Her Presence and
Conversation did send forth such an Odour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
as made others forget the Pleasures of the
Flesh: And I leave it (saith he) to the Experience
of those who read her Books with attention, to judge
whether they do not feel some Impressions of, and
whether they be not drawn with Inclinations to this
Vertue that is so acceptable to God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though this <hi>Character</hi> of Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon</hi> be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
very great, and declares the great Affection of him
who gives it, yet it is very far short of what is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
said of her; for this only respects her private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
state, and sets her forth as a Woman singularly
Good and Vertuous in this corrupt Age: But if we
will take the Word of this anonymous Author, and
some others, this Woman was above all that is Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane;
she was inhabited by the Spirit of God; and
all she did or spoke, was to be ascribed to Him, and
to be reckon'd not so much hers as His, who design'd
that she should be the greatest Blessing that ever was
conferr'd on Mankind; therefore they are not either
afraid or ashamed to bestow upon her the Epithets that
are given to <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> they set her on the same
Level with Him; they honour her with his Titles;
they apply to her the Prophecies which the Church
hath always believed to be meant of Him; they draw
a Parallel betwixt Him and Her, and do make Him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98203:5"/>
the Type of Her; and not Him but Her the last and
highest Expression of God's Love to Mankind. <q>To
intimate which, God sent a Comet when she was
born, another when she first began to write; and
a third at her death, which was greater and more
dreadful than any that was ever seen before. She
is the Divine Sun of Righteousness; she is Truth,
pure Truth, and the only Truth that can guide
one to Heaven and Eternal Life. There is no other
way of Life Eternal (says he) but what is in the
Mouth, in the Writings, and in the Life of the
most holy <hi>Antonia Bourignon.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. c. 34.</note> And again, If ever
the Church of God be edified upon Earth, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be by any other means but by the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances,
the Rules, Doctrine, Spirit and Example
of Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon.</hi> He calls her the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
spoken of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> who was shewn
to St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in a Vision, whom (saith he) our Eyes
have seen, and by whom our Ears have heard, and
our Hands have handled the Word of Life.</q> And as
he renders unto God Thanks for the Grace of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 598, 601.</note> and of being acquainted with her; so he most
passionately expostulates with God, for suffering her
to die, <q>who was the only Just, the only Holy, the
only Person who had the Spirit of God. Where,
Lord? where is now your Holy Church? Alas! it
is altogether destroyed, and subsists only in ruined
Houses, in some scatter'd Stones; which, as the
Stones of the ancient Sanctuary, are <hi>poured out upon
the top of every street,</hi> broken, defaced and unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
and there is none to gather them together,

for you have taken away the holy Instrument of

your Spirit, whom you had called and filled with
the Treasures of your Grace, to labour in that Work!
You have extinguish'd the Light which you sent
to the World, for guiding well-disposed Souls.
Where is now, Lord, the Truth of your Promises?
Where are now your ancient Mercies, which never
suffer'd the World to be destitute of living Witnesses?
How have you suffer'd the time to come, in which
it may be said, without exception, that <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

us, nor have we any who knows how long?</hi>

            <p>I might bring many other Passages out of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
to this purpose, but I judge these are sufficient
to prove his Sentiments of <hi>Antonia Bourignon:</hi> And
they are not peculiar to him; for all who have taken
this Woman's part, are of the same mind. He who
writes the Apologetick Preface to her Works, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
all the Rhetorick, which Passion, and a strong-heated
Passion can inspire, in defence of this Woman,
to remove the Prejudices which are entertain'd against
her Person and Doctrine, and to convince the World
that she was filled with the Holy Ghost, and sent to
renew the Church, and to bring it to its utmost Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
If this Author ought to be believed, all the
Words and Writings of this Woman are Sacred as
Scripture it self, they ought to have the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and should be as devoutly read; yea, much
rather read: for if it be true what he says, they are
more profitable, and do discover more fully the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

of Madam <hi>Bourignon</hi> either to confirm the Old, or to
explain them, or to correct them. In this Preface,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98203:6"/>
the Author considers the several ways by which God
may and doth communicate himself to Men: and
he asserts confidently of Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon,</hi>
That God used all these several ways with her, as
Visions, external Voices, intimate Impressions upon
the Soul, and such ineffable Communications, as
made her to know and understand the Mind of God,
and all Truths as they are in him: <q>Her whole Life
(saith he) was a continued Series of God's Word and<note place="margin">Pref. Apol. p. 188.</note>
Discourse with her, and of hers with him.</q> And
again, <q>She had so often those Communications with
God, (which he reckons up in the Second Classis)<note place="margin">Ib. p. 192.</note>
that they were very common with her, by which
God communicated to her the intimate Knowledge
of Things Divine and Humane, Matters of Right and
Fact, Things Speculative and Practical, Things My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical,
Things appertaining to Faith and Morality,
Things Future and Prophetick, such as are the Last
Things of which she has often spoken.</q> Finally, He
makes a kind of Union between God and her Soul, and
says,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 193.</note> 
               <q>That they spoke to one another as two Friends
use to do; and that the Discourse which she had
with God, as well as that which He had with her,
proceeded not from her self, but from the motion of
God, which prompted her to speak; and that her
Books are filled with such Divine Conferences.</q>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> The Prophets and Apostles were Men of like Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Infirmities with others, and several instances
of their frailty are upon Record, at the Direction

self, I say, he will not allow her to be guilty of any
slip, or inadvertency, or failing, in Word or Deed,
unworthy of the Spirit of God it self. As it is in
the <hi>Leipsick Transactions; Tantâ cum Religione vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur,
ut &amp; Soloecismos ejus, &amp; in stylo errata dictamini
divino tribuat.</hi> He justifies all she said or did, by
Parallels from the Prophets, from Christ and the
Apostles; and confidently asserts, That the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
she meets with, the Prejudices and Out-cries
against her, or her Doctrine, proceed from the
same Spirit and Principles which persecuted them:<note place="margin">Ib. p. 197.</note>
For to give you his Sentiments in short, <q>She was
the Purest, the most Dis-interested and Self-denied
Soul, and the most resigned to God that ever was
upon Earth. The World, and all that is in the
World, was of no Value to her; she was perfectly
denied to all Sense, and to every thing that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon Imagination. In her Divine Conferences
(that is, her conversation with God) she used neither
Ideas nor Meditations; but was in an admirable
vacuity of all Desire of knowing either this or that:
having no will of her own, nor any Inclination
nor Fondness for any Sentiment, no, not the most
intimate and most divine; but a total, perfect, and
most accomplished Resignation for receiving what
it would please God to communicate to her, and
no other thing, with an absolute Resolution to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
whatever would please God; tho' in doing it,
it behoved to combat the World and Hell, and lose
a Thousand Lives. In this Habitual and Invariable
State, where she continued from the Eighteenth
year of her Age, to the last moment of her Life:
None but God alone could act in the Fund of her
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98203:7"/>
Soul, in all those several ways mentioned: And the
whole Conduct of such a Person could not be but
Divine, seeing she was united to God by a perfect
Resignation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Now that the Reputation of <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> may
not stand upon the Credit of two obscure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Authors, who were afraid to expose their
Names; that what hath been said, may not be thought
their particular Rhapsodies, I will confirm the same,
by Instances from some who have publickly owned
it, and do glory in it. I will begin with Monsieur <hi>de
Cort,</hi> one of her first Disciples, who was Superiour
of the Oratory, and Pastor of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Mechlin,</hi>
and who (as it is said) lost his Life in her Cause.
This Man, in a Letter to the Vicar-General of the
Archbishoprick of <hi>Mechlin,</hi> after having told him how
he had happened to read that Passage, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xxii.
about <hi>Hilkiah</hi>'s finding the Book of the Law of the
Lord, and sending to <hi>Huldah,</hi> the Prophetess, to
enquire about it; he writes, <q>That having made a
very serious Reflection upon all this, he was touched
with a sensible Grief, considering that we have here
an Excellent Woman, a Friend of God, the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of Jesus, the Organ of the Holy Ghost, who
is greater than <hi>Huldah,</hi> to whom God has commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
himself extraordinarily, and to whom he
has discovered all his Secrets. She never yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
any person, was always faithful, firm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
immoveable; She possesseth the Holy Ghost,
with his Gifts of Wisdom, Understanding, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Piety, Courage, Counsel, fear of God; and
together with these, she possesses the Twelve Fruits
of the same Spirit; Charity, Joy, Peace, Patience,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98203:7"/>
Longanimity, Goodness, and the rest: The Eight
Beatitudes do also shine in her; she lives not to her
self, but altogether to God; she speaks as she lives,
and she lives as she speaks: Her words are Lively,
Efficacious, and Operative; they are conform to
the Gospel and the other Scriptures. Her Life is
altogether miraculous: And I do remember that
which your Reverence hath often said to me, how
that she was an admirable Maid, that there was
never found her like; we are happy to have such
a Treasure; and truly she hath the Holy Ghost.
Moreover, I remember, how I have brought Letters
to her, in which you have earnestly desired her
Prayers for your self and for your Friends, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
to her many particular Affairs; and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow
as concerning the Publick, in the time of Universal
Scourges; in all these Dangers no body consults
her, no body makes Prayers to her, no body em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
her! These Thoughts have touched my Heart
very sensibly. As for me, I have thanked you, and
do still thank you infinitely; because God inspired
you to send me to this Creature. I never received,
neither from Arch-Bishop, nor from Bishops, nor
from Pastors, nor from my Directors and Superiours,
nor from Saints, nor from God himself immediately,
more good than from her by God only. I beseech
you, for the Honour of God, for the Good of the
Church, for your own private good, and for the
good of all those who are under your Charge, to
consult her, and to believe her as to that which
she shall tell you from God concerning these deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Times. St. <hi>Ierome</hi> says, That <hi>Deuteronomium
est secunda Lex, &amp; Evangelicae legis praefiguratio,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98203:8"/>
that is, <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> or the Book that was found
in the time of <hi>Huldah,</hi> is the Second Law, or the
Second Establishment of the Law of God, and that
it is a Figure of what shall be under the Evangelical
Law. Now, I am of the Mind, that the Evangelical
Law, which was first Established, and afterwards
forgotten and lost, shall be renewed and re-established,
as <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> was a Second time under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of this New <hi>Huldah.</hi>
               </q> This Letter is prefixed
to the Treatise which bears the Title of, <hi>The Word of
God, or the interiour Life of Madamoiselle</hi> Bourignon:
Where also there are Extracts of some Letters of the
same Vicar-General, bearing a Testimony unto her.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Here we have had one bearing witness to <hi>Antonia
Bourignon,</hi> not upon hear-say, or any uncertain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
but from his own Experience. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
still alive, who knew her, was intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with her, and who gives her a Character
above what either Man or Woman (besides Jesus
Christ) ever deserved. It is Monsieur <hi>Poiret,</hi> who
may be called the Chief Disciple, or First Apostle of
<hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> he having spread her Fame and
propagated her Opinions more studiously, and with
more Zeal and Fervour than any other. As St. <hi>Paul
desired to know nothing save Iesus Christ and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi>
so this Man seems to desire to know nothing
but Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon.</hi> He does not believe a
God more firmly, than that this Woman was divinely
inspired: His words were (to some of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
who visited him) <hi>Tam certus sum eam Virginem
inspiratam esse quam Deum existere.</hi> She is ever in
his Mouth, and on all occasions he recommends her
Books as having Light and Instruction, and all desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98203:8"/>
Advantages above all the Books in the World,
without excepting the Scriptures. Some few Years
after her Death, he sent a Memorial to Monsieur <hi>Bale,</hi>
to be inserted in the <hi>Novelles de la Republique de la
Lettre,</hi> that all the learned World might have the
Knowledge of this wonderful Woman: And because
Monsieur <hi>Bale</hi> had dropt something which did not
savour of that respect which is due to Madamoiselle
<hi>Bourignon,</hi> he again expostulated with him, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
him by another Memorial; both which may
be seen in the Ninth Articles for the Months of <hi>April</hi>
and <hi>May,</hi> for the Year 1685.</p>
            <p>All which Monsieur <hi>Poiret</hi> writes now, is upon the
Principles of this Woman: Her Doctrine is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of his <hi>Oeconomy Divine,</hi> in which he imagines
that he has explained all the Mysteries both of Nature
and Religion, cleared all Difficulties either in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
or Divinity, and revealed the secret Purposes
of the Counsel of God, both in respect of what is
past, and of what is to come. All these great things
he hath done by the Light which his Beloved Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
afforded him: Take his own words for it.
<q>I ought to acknowledge, that these Principles and<note place="margin">Pref. <hi>n.</hi> 28.</note>
many other things are not of my own Invention,
but that I have been led to them by the Divine
Writings, and by the Instruction of one of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Worth. I should never have come to the
knowledge of these Truths of my self, if the Light<note place="margin">Tom. 3. c. 11. n. 16.</note>
which God communicated to one of his Saints,
had not Administred the Occasion: She is a Person
whose Writings have led me into the Knowledge of
the solid Principles of all things. Madamoiselle
<hi>Bourignon</hi> hath received from God such certain and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98203:9"/>
particular Light, as without which I neither could
have seen, nor been sensible in this manner of these
Divine Truths, how palpably soever the Text of<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 12. p. 21.</note>
Scripture may seem to lead the attentive Reader
unto them. God hath drawn me forth, not by
the force and subtilty of my wretched Reason, nor
by Study, or by Reading the Books of Learned
Men, but by the Writings of a Woman, through
which God has touched and illuminated my Heart,
making me see a perfect Light in all these Matters
and Difficulties, as well as almost in all other<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 17. p. 340.</note>
things, whether Divine or Humane, Natural or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural.
Behold a great and notable Truth, and
a Key of an infinite number of admirable Lights
for explaining a Thousand Passages of Divine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of the charitable and adorable Conduct
of God towards Men? Nothing is wanting to make
this rare and incomparable Truth to be received of
Men, but that its Discovery, and the Explication
of these Passages of Scripture, which point it out,
have not been communicated by some Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or by some great Doctor, but by an unlearned
Woman, to whom God has been pleased to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
himself so far, notwithstanding of the contrary
Judgment of some bearded Animals. Whosoever<note place="margin">Tom. 4. chap. 16. p. 379.</note>
would see these things in the most sensible and most
Divine Light that can be desired, have no more to
do but to consult the Works of Madamoiselle <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignon;</hi>
particularly, these Three or Four; <hi>The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
of the Gospel-Spirit, Antichrist Discovered,
The Light of the World, and the Touchstone:</hi> For I
do acknowledge, That I have not perceived, that
God, since the beginning of the World, did ever
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98203:9"/>
discover more clearly, more sensibly, more strongly,
more plainly the greatness of Man's Corruption,
as he hath done in our Days, by that excellent
Organ of the Holy Ghost: And nothing but the
Discovery of this Evil has offended all wilfully
wicked Persons at her; their Proud Heart would
not humble it self, nor be covered with Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
nor can they be induced to hate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
themselves. The Devil also, their good
Friend, who dwells in their corrupt Hearts, not
enduring to be thus exposed; has resolved to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
by his Diabolical Slaves, against this Divine
Light, and this Holy Soul which declares it, his
two ordinary Machines, <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> which
he hath inspired abundantly into the Hearts of
many wicked Persons, both Learned and Idiots,
who have not been wanting hitherto to labour
in this, as it becomes them, in favour of their
Master and King, the Murtherer, the Persecutor,
the Lyar, the Calumniator from the Beginning,
who will one Day give them his common Pay,<note place="margin">Tom. 7. c. 3. p. 92.</note> if
they do not defeat the Work which they have Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically
made for him against the most Divine, the
most Splendid, and the most Solid Truth which ever
yet appeared.</q> Thus far Monsieur <hi>Poiret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that I may not be thought to impose upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>
               <hi>English</hi> Reader, by Quotations from foreign Books,
which are little known, and in few hands, I will
justifie this high Character of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> by
Passages of a parallel strain out of the Prefaces to her
Treatise of <hi>The Light of the World,</hi> which is now
rendred into English, <hi>to be read, understood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
by all who desire to be saved,</hi> as the Title-page
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98203:10"/>
bears. There her eminent Sanctity is declared and
set forth in words which were never applicable to any
Creature before; for none but <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was ever
said to be <hi>perfect,</hi> and <hi>without sin.</hi> 
               <q>But the Purity<note place="margin">Preface to the English Reader, p. 21.</note>
of <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi>'s Life was exact and constant;
she was a perfect Pattern and living Exemplar of
the Spirit and Doctrine of the Gospel. In short, We
may all truly affirm, That we never observed in
her any Vice, Sin, or any Weakness of Spirit;<note place="margin">M. <hi>Corte</hi>'s <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 43.</note>
but a perfect and solid Vertue, surpassing Natural
and Humane Strength; which made us say, That
her Life was altogether Miraculous, as if <hi>Adam</hi> had
never sinned in her.</q> And as to her Knowledge and
Understanding, it is made Infinite; <q>for there were
<hi>hid in her the Treasures of Divine Wisdom,</hi> which<note place="margin">Ib. p. 17.</note>
enabled her to utter things unheard of, so marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and sublime, that we often remained quite lost
with Admiration; for we had never heard such
things. She explained likewise the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note place="margin">Ib. p. 41.</note>
so perfectly, that none of the holy Fathers
have ever so done, nor any body since the Creation
of the World.<note place="margin">Ib. p. 44. 45.</note> She knew the secret Thoughts of
Men's Hearts, and Things to come; and did not
foretell them by way of Supposition, or related
them as if she had dreamt them. We found also, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
times, that she could tell what past in her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and how our Souls behaved themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> In short, This Divine Soul told us so
many Secrets of the Mystical and Inward Life, that
all our Theology was too short and insufficient to
answer her to so high Questions, not only in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Theology, but also in all other Matters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the various Rencounters and Occurrences
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98203:10"/>
which fell out: so that one would have thought,
that though a Man had perused all sorts of Histories,
and grown old in the study of all sorts of Sciences,
he could not know, with such Understanding, all the
things which this Pilgrimess told us. It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to write in particular the admirable things
which we have heard of this Pilgrimess:<note place="margin">Ib. p. 46.</note> so that We
may say of her Discourses, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> said of his
Rapture, That <hi>he had seen and heard things which
eyes had not seen, nor ear heard, and that it has not
entered into the mind of man what God has prepared
for his elect.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, lest any should think that this extraordinary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>
Knowledge came to her by Natural Means, or that
it was the effect of some Art and Industry, which
others had not the happiness to know, neither were
capable to undergo; we are told,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 41.</note> 
               <q>That she never
read, nor learn'd of any body; That she was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Study, even without Reading;<note place="margin">Ib. p. 33.</note> and, which is
more, without Meditation. Years and Experience
make others Wise and Knowing,</q> but she had her
vast Knowledge from the beginning: she was not
wiser in her Old Age than in her Youth; for she
was infallible in both: neither was there any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for correcting or amending that which she spoke
or wrote in her first years;<note place="margin">Ib. p. 21.</note> 
               <q>For if you peruse her
Writings impartially, you will meet with many
remarkable Characters that are not ordinarily to be
found in many Writings. A clear and distinct Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Essential Truths of Christianity, with
a constant urging of them as <hi>the one thing necessary,</hi>
and distinguishing them from the accessory Truths
which are not necessary to Salvation; an inimitable
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98203:11"/>
simplicity of Expression, which a Child may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
with as singular a sublimity of Thoughts, a
convincing power and force going along with them;
a plain unfolding, in a few Lines, the Difficulties
about which the Learned write many Volumes; a
constant harmony and uniformity of Sentiments,
in the Writings of a course of forty years, from
about the Twenty third to the Sixty fifth year of
her age, in which she died, with an evidence and
clearness to the conviction of our Natural Reason:
And all this by one who never read any Books;
never conversed with the Learned, to be instructed
by them; never premeditated what she wrote;
never blotted out nor mended what was once writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
but being attentive to the Love of God, in
the calm and inward recollection of her Spirit, wrote
as fast as her hand could guide the Pen; and when
some Writings were laid by unfinish'd, for some
years, returned to them and finish'd them after the
same manner, without reading any more of what
had been written, than some few of the immediately
foregoing Lines, to make a due connexion.</q>  Thus
Memory, and those Rational discussive Faculties which
help others to the knowledge of Truth, were of no
use to her; because they make her to have had an
immediate intuition of all things in God,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 13.</note> 
               <hi>with whom
she had inward Conversation from her Childhood.</hi> She
neither did nor would learn any thing from the
Scriptures, though they were given by Inspiration,
and were designed to make every Man of God perfect,
and <hi>throughly instructed to every good word and work.</hi>
She would take nothing from the second-hand, but
would have all things immediately from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98203:11"/>
and therefore she asked Him Questions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Answers from Him,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 19.</note> about the smallest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
In a word, the design of these three <hi>Prefaces</hi>
is to prove, That all her Words and Thoughts are
God's, and that the Spirit was not given to her by
measure, no more than it was to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and that
there was the same reason for both: For as God had
chosen a Virgin for his Mother; so he had chosen
another Virgin to be the Organ of his Light and
Spirit, by whom he designed to renew his Church,
and to give the last Blow and Overthrow to Satan's
Kingdom; for which cause she is called <hi>the Light of
the World:</hi> and these words of <hi>Isaiah</hi> are applied unto
her, <hi>The people that walked in darkness have seen a
great light: They that dwell in the land of the shadow
of death, upon them hath the light shined.</hi> And upon
this account,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 46, 47.</note> Monsieur <hi>de Cort</hi> says, <q>I look upon
her Acquaintance, as a greater favour than all the
Graces and Favours which God hath bestowed on
me in this World, yea, even than my Creation it
self; for that would serve me in little stead, without
the working out of my Salvation, which would
have been in great danger, if I had not attained to
the knowledge of my self, and of the Designs and
Marvels of God, which I have learned and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the means of this Creature; and she has
certainly been sent me as the only Means of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of my Soul, and of all those who will profit
by the recital of this <hi>Narrative,</hi> which I find my
self obliged to publish, for the profit of many. This
is the true <hi>treasure hid in the earth;</hi> he who shall
find it, ought to sell all that he has, to by this
Ground, to the end he may find and discover this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98203:12"/>
Treasure, and take it up with Joy, as the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
thing in the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have insisted the longer upon the Character of
Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon,</hi> her personal Endowments
and Qualifications, her Divine Mission and Authority,
as they are declared and set forth by her Disciples,
because they are Material Points in our Enquiry about
her: And for the same reason, I have chose to give
these things in their own words, that it may appear
to all, that I do not charge them with things which

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> And now I may have liberty to add, That if Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiselle
<hi>Bourignon</hi> deserves the Character, which is
here given to her; if it be true what these Authors
I have quoted do say of her; if their Commendations
and Praises are not rash and groundless, but built
upon a solid Foundation, then she is, not only a very
Singular and Extraordinary Person, but, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
the greatest that ever was Born of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
She is above all the Ancient Patriarchs; she
is to be preferred to <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, to <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Baptist and the Apostles; and at least she ought
to be honoured equally with Jesus Christ, who is said
to be <hi>God blessed for ever.</hi> She was as much without
Sin as he was; and her Body was of a better Frame
and Temper; for his was so much wasted by his
Travels and the fatigues of his Ministry, that he
seemed to be Fifty while he was not much above
Thirty: Whereas <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> did not appear
to be Forty years old, when she was Sixty and odd.
And though I cannot pretend, that they do assert,
in express terms, that she was personally united to
the God head, yet I do think it is a clear Consequence
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98203:12"/>
from what they say; for I cannot understand how
otherwise she could know all Truths, the deepest
Mysteries of Nature and Religion, things hidden
from the Wisest in all Ages; nor how she could, on
all Occasions, speak and write about both small and
great Matters certainly, clearly, and infallibly, as
well as live up to the highest Perfection of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Piety; and all this without consulting either
Men or Books, without previous Reflection and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;
I say, I cannot understand how all this
could be done by a meer Creature; and therefore
she must either have been always personally united
to the Deity, and so to be esteemed <hi>God-Woman,</hi> or
else, as some Ancient Hereticks said of Jesus Christ,
her Body and Humane Nature were not real, but a
meer Phantome and Apparition by which God was
pleased to declare his Mind and Will unto Men. And
which soever of these be held, or whatever way God
acted in her and by her, all her Words and Writings
are Sacred as Scripture; they are of the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and do deserve the same respect, and ought to
be read publickly, for the Honour of God, and the
Edification of Men. Finally, there ought to be a
Commemoration of <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> in the Publick
Liturgies, as well as of Jesus Christ, and of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles. And as
the Church has always used to give unto God Names
and Titles, from the Signal Manifestations of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and as the latter took always place of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
because more honourable and glorious; thus
<hi>the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the fear of</hi> Isaac, <hi>he that brought
the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and delivered
them from their Captivity,</hi> which were God's Names
in former times, have been laid aside, to give way to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98203:13"/>
that of the <hi>God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ:</hi>
So this, and all these should now give place <hi>to the God
of</hi> Antonia Bourignon, <hi>to the Spirit who spoke by her,</hi>
because she has brought a greater, a clearer, and a
fuller Light into the World, and has made greater
Discoveries of the Wisdom, and Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, than what came by Jesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> These things follow naturally and clearly from
what was formerly delivered concerning <hi>Antonia
Bourignon;</hi> but then they are of that importance,
that none, but Madmen and Fools, will admit either
the Premisses or Consequence without sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Authority. For, if the things that are
said be not true; if there be more ascribed to Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle
<hi>Bourignon</hi> than what ought to be, then to
pay her such Honour, Respect, and Esteem would be
abominable Idolatry and horrid Blasphemy: If she
require it, she is an Impostor, a Messenger from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
the Organ and Instrument of the Devil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he designs to seduce the Simple and Unwary;
She is not the true Light to be followed, but an <hi>Ignis
fatuus,</hi> a false and dangerous appearance, to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
avoided by all who love and seek their own
safety; and they who proclaim such high things of
her are false Prophets; if they believe sincerely what
they say, they are sadly infatuated and deluded; and
if otherwise, they are monstrously and egregiously
Wicked: if they be right, we cannot so much as give
this Woman one Contradiction, without betraying
our Conscience,<note place="margin">Pref p. 47.</note> as M. <hi>de Cort</hi> speaks: But if they
do not speak the Truth, then if we hearken unto them,
we receive those who speak in the Name of the
Lord falsely, and we shall provoke God's Wrath and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98203:13"/>
Jealousie, by the grievous offence of giving Divine
Honour to another.</p>
            <p>It therefore highly concerns us what part we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/>
ought to take in this Matter, whether we ought to
admit these Men and their Testimony, or if we
should reject them. And indeed, whatever respect
be due to these Gentlemen, I crave leave to say, that
the Matter in hand is of greater weight, than to be
supported merely by their Authority; nor can their
Testimony be judged sufficient to receive <hi>Antonia
Bourignon</hi> for such a Woman as they have described
her. I will not reflect upon their Honesty, nor will
I deny Integrity to some of them: Nay, I will easily
grant that all of them may speak as they think, and
that they have written these things of this Woman
from no other Motive than the sincerity of their own
Perswasions. But what then? This cannot reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
decide the case: Nor can we, without a most
culpable rashness, join issue with them, until we
examine the Grounds of their Belief, and see their
Reasons why they come to be so and so perswaded.
Every one that is Honest, is not also Wise and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Nor are all infallible who may be numbered
amongst the Wise and Learned. Good Men may be
mistaken; nor are well meaning Persons secure from
being deceived and imposed upon: Nay, not only
the Simple and Ignorant are liable to be seduced,
but also Men of Understanding, Learning, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
of which many Instances may be brought both
out of Ancient and Modern Histories. <hi>Tertullian</hi>
was carried away by the Error of <hi>Montanus.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the first, nor yet all the present followers
of <hi>Mahomet</hi> ought to be reckoned Dunces or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
Men: Nor were it Just to deprive all the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98203:14"/>
Disciples of <hi>George Fox,</hi> of Understanding and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity;
and yet he would not act wisely nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously
who should plead for these <hi>Impostors,</hi> and
justifie their Errors and Delusions, because some in
other things of Sence and Judgment, have taken part
with them. None indeed, but wicked Men and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
will study a Cheat, and endeavour to impose
upon the World that which they know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be false: But how often have we seen and
known Persons seduced and drawn into such hellish
Designs, who ought not to be branded with such
odious Characters; though at the same time I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but say, that whatever reason there may be to
excuse their Sincerity, there is all the reason in the
World to censure their Judgment, Discretion and
Conduct; for who does not act wisely and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously,
can never be said to act innocently, though
he may not be so culpable as others.</p>
            <p>As no Man loves to be cheated in any thing, so no
Man should suffer himself to be cheated in Religion
and Messages from Heaven; for they are Matters
of the highest Importance, and therefore our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
about them should be built upon some sure
Foundation: without some reasonable Conviction,
without some Evidence which may satisfie Sober
Men, and which may be defended when required
and called in Question, we ought not to receive
<hi>Doctrines,</hi> nor embrace particular Systems of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
nor should we close with this or that Method
of Salvation, otherwise we are shamefully lazy, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and easie in things which do most concern
us. 'Tis true, the generality of the World practise
the contrary, they take these things upon trust,
and are satisfied with that which is first proposed,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98203:14"/>
and which lie nearest them: But this is a Reproach
to Mankind, nor can there be a greater instance of
the Corruption of Humane Nature, than this, that
Men use their Reason least in things of greatest
moment. However we are not to consider what is
commonly done, but what should be done; what is
fit to be done by wise and good Men, by such as would
build their present Peace and Comfort, and their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Interest, not upon Sand, but upon a Rock which
can hold out against Storms and Tempests.</p>
            <p>Now, if in such cases a reasonable Conviction, a
satisfying Evidence be necessary, then to receive
Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon</hi> as one so highly dignified
by God, and her Scheme of Religion and System
of Opinions as Divine, and absolutely necessary to
be followed, we ought to have something more than
the Authority and Testimony of those Men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
quoted: for whatever their Morals be, they
are fallible as others; if they will not wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
yet they are liable to be deceived; and if
they have been imposed upon, where are we if we
follow them. The Testimony of Men is only va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
so far as they are competent Judges of the
things which they declare: It is unjust to deny the
Testimony of sincere honest Men, when they bear
witness only to Matters of Fact, to things which
they have heard and seen; but when it comes to
Opinions, Perswasions and Sentiments, both good
and wise Men ought to be submitted to a Tryal and
Examination, whether there be Reasons for their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
Now the Case before us, is of the Nature of
the last; that is, It is not a Matter of Fact, but a
Matter of Faith and Opinion; and therefore we must
be allowed to judge the Validity of the Reasons of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98203:15"/>
these Mens Sentiments of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> before
we can or ought to be of their Side: And I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
that if their Reasons be weighed in the Balance,
if they be put into just and equal Scales, they will be
found light, and wanting Weight to make them pass
for the Value which is put upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> I will not conceal any of their Reasons, nor will
I misrepresent them. I do not remember to have
met with any besides those which follow, which
have been suggested and which may be gathered
from what has been said above. 1. An Early and
Extraordinary Sanctity. 2. The secret Knowledge
of Mens Thoughts. 3. Foretelling things to come.
4. A Sublime and Wonderful Knowledge of Divine
Mysteries, with an Uniformity and Agreement of
Sentiments both with her self and Scripture. 5. The
Supernatural Means and Method of her coming to
the Knowledge of all these things, <hi>viz.</hi> without Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without consulting Men or Books, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Meditation. 6. The apparition of Comets at
her Birth, when she began to Write, and at her
Death. From these Reasons they conclude that she
was Divinely Inspired, and sent to the World upon
some great Design; and for these Reasons they make
her the Woman in the Revelation who was cloathed
with the Sun, and had the Moon under her Feet,
they call her <hi>the Spouse of Christ,</hi> and give her that
large Character which we have seen above.</p>
            <p>I intend to consider these Reasons calmly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially.
First, whether supposing them true, the
Consequence drawn from them be just and necessary,
and then what truth is in them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> I begin with the First, <hi>viz.</hi> her Early and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Sanctity. And I do acknowledge that true
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98203:15"/>
Sanctity is only from God. It is not the work of
Nature but of Grace; No Man can be perfectly Holy
of himself, nor can the Devil either intend or effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate
such a thing; if therefore any have the Gift
of Sanctity, they have it from above, God certainly
is the Author of it, whose Spirit only can subdue
our Natural Corruption, and raise us to a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Divine Nature. And as this Gift is of
God, so it is more valuable than the Gift of Miracles,
Prophecies, speaking with divers Tongues, and such
like; for it is a greater sign of the love of God, and
does better secure an Interest in him. When our
Lord bestowed the Power of Miracles and of cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out Devils upon the Seventy Disciples, that they
might not overvalue this Special Privilege or boast
too highly of it, be said unto them,<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Notwithstanding
in this rejoyce not, that the Spirits are subject unto you,
but rather rejoyce, because your names are written in
Heaven.</hi> Now all who are truly holy have their
Names written there: Many who have Prophesied,
and cast out Devils, and done many wonderful Works,
shall be disowned in the great Day of the Lord; they
shall be commanded to Depart from Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
but they who are truly sanctified, will never
be separated from him, theirs is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for ever.</p>
            <p>But though Sanctity be a great and most desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
token of God's Love and Favour, yet it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
attended with extraordinary Illuminations and
Inspirations: It may be without these, and these
may be separated from it. Good and Holy Persons
in the other World shall have a full and clear Vision
of all things, then they shall understand the Intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Providence, and the Secrets of the Divine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98203:16"/>
Counsel; then they shall <hi>see God as he is, and know
even as they are known:</hi> But at present the best and
most Holy see as through a Glass darkly, and are
ignorant of many things, as well as others; nay,
persons very good and holy, and very dear to God,
may not know so much as some that are wicked and
unsanctified. What St. <hi>Paul</hi> supposeth, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by several Instances, that one may have the Gift
of Prophecy, and understand all Mysteries, and all
Knowledge, and yet be without Holiness; for if they
may want Charity, they want a special part of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.
Wherefore suppose we should grant Sanctity
to <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> suppose her to be truly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
Holy; yet she is not therefore to be
reckoned Infallible, nor endued with all Knowledge,
nor are her Doctrines to be received Implicitly. Let
her Sanctity be never so great, yet that alone doth
not raise her to the Station and Dignity of a Prophet,
at whose Mouth the Church, and all particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
should receive the Law and Will of God; for
though Holiness doth certainly not only dispose Persons
to receive special Influences of the Spirit of God,
but also give a deeper Sence of Divine Truths than
Reading, even as Practice in any Art doth make one
Wiser and more Skilful than Speculation; yet every
Holy Person must not pretend a Revelation of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
or to know the Mind of God in every thing:
Wherefore we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> distinguishing warily what
was his own Judgment, from what he had certainly
from God. Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon</hi> might be Holy,
and yet no Infallible Oracle.</p>
            <p>And there is yet far less reason upon this account
to entitle her the peculiar Organ of the Holy Ghost,
the Singular Spouse of Christ, the Queen of Heaven,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98203:16"/>
the Mother of the Faithful, and the like: For though
Saints be dear unto God, and very precious in his
sight; though he has prepared for them <hi>things which
Eyes have not seen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred
into the heart of Man;</hi> though they receive secret Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and Communications, which none knoweth
neither can understand, save he who receiveth them;
yet they themselves should keep still the distance of
Creatures, and cloth themselves with Humility, and
acknowledge their Unworthiness: And others when
they honour them, should beware of running into
Excess; they should not exalt them unto an Equality
with God, nor yet unto Degrees which approach
near to it; for this is to Deify Creatures, which as
it is foolish, so it is very provoking. 'Tis true, God
bestoweth, in the Scripture, upon Saints great and
glorious Epithets, which are most worthy of our
Contemplation, because they declare the Greatness
of God's Love: but also we may perceive that the
Saints were both ashamed and afraid to receive them,
from the sence of their unworthiness and infinite
distance from God. Humility is the foundation of
true and perfect Sanctity, and it teacheth neither to
reject or despise the free Expressions of that great
Love, with which God is pleas'd to honour his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
nor yet to claim and enhance them by way
of merit. For any to arrogate these Divine Honours
as peculiarly belonging to them, is intolerable Pride;
as it is high Presumption and Insolency for any to
take upon them to give or appropriate these unto
others, without special Command and Direction: For
the giving of Honours is an Act of Soveraignty, and
appertains to God, and not unto Men. The Saints
in Scripture, shewed the greatest Humility when God
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98203:17"/>
magnified them most, and they used to speak of one
another with great Modesty. The affecting of great
Names and Titles proceeds from Pride and Vanity,
and none but rash, inconsiderate and unthinking Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
will bestow them lavishly.</p>
            <p>High Encomiums are the Effects of a strong, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
and interess'd Passion, and not the Product of
a solid Judgment. We ought, indeed, to praise fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Men,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 44. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> according to the Exhortation of the wise
Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> that others may be excited to imitate
them; but then our Praises should be just and true,
modest and proper, suitable to the present Condition
of Mankind, which is frail and mortal, and liable to
many weaknesses. We ought to praise Men, but we
should also remember that they are Men, and not
magnifie them above what they are, or make Gods
of them. I do not know which is more Criminal
or more to be censured, whether the detracting from
ones just Praise, or the giving extravagant and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Commendations: perhaps more may be said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this. It has many pernicious Consequences,
and does proceed from the same partial Spirit, which
regards Humour and Interest, more than Truth or
Justice: both are reproved and condemned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the one as well as the other, is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
the Spirit of the Gospel, which requires
us not to rest in the Admiration of the Persons of
Men, or of any Creature, but to carry our Thoughts
from these up towards God, who alone is worthy to
be admired and praised, and who is the Author of all
the good that is in any.</p>
            <p>There ought, indeed, to be a Cognizance of the
Divine Wisdom, Power, Goodness, Mercy and Grace
which are manifested in any, or towards any; we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98203:17"/>
ought also to honour those, whom God has honoured
thus, yet only so as to make them the Subject Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of praising and honouring God. But we make
Idols of Men, when we either ascribe to them Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
which they never had, or fix upon their
personal Qualifications, and consider their Virtues as
theirs, without looking higher. This was a great
part of Heathenism, and from hence sprung that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Idolatry which the World was so full of:
Immoderate Flattery of Mens Persons, was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it. To prevent which among Jews and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
the infinite Wisdom of God did and doth still
represent those worthy Persons he made use of, as
Men, that is, as Persons of the like Passions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
with other Men: The meanest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
or Apostles were greater by far than the Gods
whom the Gentiles worshipp'd, and yet that Divine
Honour might not be paid to them, that they might
not be adored as Gods, as Originals of their own
Virtues and Qualifications, their Failings and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
are not concealed, but exposed to the View of
all the World; they shewed themselves Earthen Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
while they manifested the heavenly Treasures of
Wisdom and Power committed to them, that the
Praise may be unto God, and not unto Men. God
is a Jealous God, and is not pleas'd, when the Glory
which is due to himself is given either in whole or
in part to another: which may be done without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Sacrifice, or burning Incense, or making Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
for this is done by an excessive Admiration of
any ones Person, by thinking of them above what
we ought to think, by ascribing to them much more
than is due, and expecting from them that which
God only can be the Author of. Upon this account
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98203:18"/>
we accuse the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of Idolatry towards
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other Saints, because she raiseth
and honoureth them above the Rank and Condition
of Creatures: And yet neither the Virgin, nor any
other pretended or real Saint is so much honoured by
that Church, as Madamoiselle <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> is
by Monsieur <hi>de Cort,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Poiret,</hi> and their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.
There have been Published several Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Encomiums of the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> but they are
all short of that which has been said above of this
Woman: and therefore I can be bold to say, that the
<hi>Bourignianists</hi> are at least in this as much guilty of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
as the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor can they ever
justifie themselves, without proving that she is no
Creature, but a God or Goddess. Her Sanctity will
not excuse them, be it never so great or unspotted;
nor though it would, is her Sanctity so great as
is pretended. Which is the next thing I intend to
shew.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> It may look a little Invidious to go about to lessen
the Reputation of another, and I have always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
them as sordid Souls, like Swine, who take
Pleasure in raking up the Faults of others: But as in
some cases there is reason for it, so here it is necessary
for curing the dangerous Delusions of some, and for
securing others from the like Contagion. Truth must
be always preferr'd to Persons.</p>
            <p>If the fond Favorites of Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon</hi>
had only represented her as a Devout Religious and
Virtuous Woman, it might have passed; if they had
only propos'd her as a good Pattern, how one may
escape the Pollutions of the World, and be good
and upright even in a Corrupt Age, none could have
found Fault with them, nor was there reason for Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98203:18"/>
to suspect the Truth of what they say. But
they have betrayed themselves by an Extravagant
Immodesty, and their Truth and Sincerity may be
justly questioned now that they ascribe to her more
than what is possible, if we look upon their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
by the Light of the Scripture. For they make
her Impeccable, at least they say, (as was shewed
above) that she never actually sinned, no, not in
Thought, and that she derived no Guilt or Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from <hi>Adam,</hi> which must be Monsieur <hi>de Cort</hi>
his meaning when he said, that <hi>it seemed</hi> Adam <hi>never
sinn'd in her.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 51. 5. 1 K. 8. 46.</note> Whereas the Scripture saith that we are
born in Sin and conceived in Iniquity; that <hi>there is
no man, not the most just and perfect, that doth good
and sinneth not;</hi> and that none are perfectly righteous
in the sight of God, but all are guilty before him.
If Monsieur <hi>de Cort</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Poiret</hi> their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> be true, she did not as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh in the Name of the rest of Mankind,
carry about with her a Body of Sin and Death, she
had not <hi>a Law in her Members warring against the Law
of her Mind;</hi> she needed no High Priest, nor Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for Sin, and the Blood of Christ would be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to her in vain, for she is clean without it. If
Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon</hi> was the Woman which they
represent her, she was indeed a very great Miracle,
yea, the greatest Wonder amongst Mankind, for she
was the Offspring of sinful and unclean Parents, and
yet clean her self; she was born of Flesh, and yet
no Flesh, or without the Natural and Inherent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of Flesh, and so she or they give the lye,<note place="margin">Job 14. 4.</note> not

               <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 6. 1 Joh. 1. 18.</note> but also to our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who said positively, <hi>That which is born of the flesh
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98203:19"/>
is flesh.</hi> But shall a <hi>De Cort</hi> or a <hi>Poiret,</hi> have more
Credit than the Son of God? Should their words be
received in Contradiction to the Scripture, which we
know was given by Inspiration of the Holy Ghost?
what Impudence is it in them to impose such noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Falshoods upon us? or how strangely are they
infatuated if they believe themselves? Both he that
saith of himself, that he hath no Sin, and he that
saith that another is without Sin,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>is deceived and
the truth is not in them.</hi> This one Instance, as well
as many others which follow, doth sufficiently prove
that the Insallible Spirit of God has not guided the
Pens of Monsieur <hi>de Cort,</hi> or Monsieur <hi>Poiret:</hi> and
that though they pretend to be the truest and most
perfect Christians, because Followers of <hi>Bourignon;</hi>
yet it is much more probable that they belong to
that Party, which the Apostle St. <hi>Iude</hi> describes,
which he makes <hi>spots in the Christian feasts of Charity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jude 16.</note>
               <hi>whose mouth speaketh great swelling words, having mens
persons in admiration because of advantage. Antonia
Bourignon,</hi> was either Mother or Midwife to some
wild Metaphysical Whimsies, and Extravagant No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which Monsieur <hi>Poiret</hi> is passionately fond of,
and therefore to make them be received by all for
Divine Truths, she must be exalted above the present
State and Capacity of Humane Nature. Lord, how
doth passion Blind Men! How do their Affections
transport them without all bounds of Sense and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> But it will perhaps be replied by the <hi>Poiretans</hi>
and <hi>Bourignianists,</hi> that there is no reasoning against
Matter of Fact, that a thing may be true, though it be
strange and unaccountable; that Madamoiselle <hi>Bourig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
is an extraordinary Instance, and an Exception from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98203:19"/>
the General State of Mankind. And therefore I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
further to shew, First, That the things instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by them, which they insist most upon, and
which they talk most of, are not certain Proofs of
Sanctity. Secondly, That several things are own'd
both by her self and them, which are very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with such extraordinary Sanctity as is ascribed
to her.</p>
            <p>First, I say, that the things instanced, are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/>
certain Proofs of Sanctity, By certain Proofs I do
not mean strict Demonstrations, such as the Science
of Mathematicks requires and doth afford; but such
good Moral Assurances as may be the Ground of a
reasonable Belief, and which may satisfie that we are
not deceived and imposed upon. The present case
differs very much from that of judging and censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Lives and Actions of our fellow Christians,
who pretend to nothing extraordinary; there, a strict
Enquiry is not necessary; there, Charity should bear
the sway; and then we ought to believe and hope
the best, providing we do not destroy the Notions of
Good and Evil, nor yet recommend an evil Action
out of an excess of Charity: But here, where there
are more than common Pretensions, where an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Sanctity is pretended, a Sanctity worthy
to be observed and imitated, a Sanctity which is
thought sufficient to make the Person worthy to be
received as a Prophet, as one sent from God to give
great Light and Instruction both by Doctrine and
Example; then every prudent Person ought to make
a narrow Enquiry, and to judge warily; then we
should ask for good and sufficient Evidence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, we have all reason to suspend our Belief, and
to deny our Assent. Now I do ingenuously declare,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98203:20"/>
That having considered seriously both what <hi>Antonia
Bourignon</hi> writes of her self, and the Accounts which
others have given of her, I do not perceive any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
or extraordinary Instance of Sanctity, besides
affected Solitude and Retirement, her Celibacy and
resisting all Importunities to Marriage, Fastings,
Watchings, Humiliations, wearing of Sack-cloth,
a contempt of the common Ornaments of her Sex,
and such like Austerities; as also great Raptures and
Extasies in Prayer and Devotion: none of which are
certain signs of true and solid Piety; for as these
things may, and do sometimes proceed from the
right Knowledge of God, a sincere Love to him,
and a serious Consideration of our own Nature, and
the Nature of other things; so they may be and often
are only the Effects of a particular Temper and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
as they may be, and often have been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
by Persons <hi>in the gall of bitterness, and bonds
of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things make a great shew, which both sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
unthinking Beholders, and also deludes the
Persons themselves; but they deserve not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
or praised, except when they are transacted
by Persons of sound and solid Judgment, whose sence
and understanding are under no suspicion of being
Sick, and when they are accompanied with a Spirit
of great Humility and Submission towards God, of
Meekness and Charity towards others; when there is
a sincere respect had to all God's Commands, and
suitable Honour and Obedience paid unto Men. But
when these things are done by one that is continually
a quarrelling with Providence and the state of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Affairs, by one that is vain, proud and censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
full of himself, and who has no esteem for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98203:20"/>
others; who observes no distance, neither pays any
respect to other Mens outward Dignities or Moral
Endowments; who is above all Advice and Counsel;
who pretends a Privilege from Obedience, and a Right
to Command; then I say these things are to be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and slighted deservedly; then we may, without
uncharitableness, conclude that they are done out of
some sinistrous Design, or that they are the Effects
of a melancholy Head, or crazy Brain, or of some
surly, peevish predominant Humour.</p>
            <p>How many Instances may be given of the long
Fastings and Watchings,<note place="margin">See <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabon</hi> his Treatise of <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asme,</hi> and <hi>Burton</hi> of <hi>Religious Melancholy.</hi>
               </note> of rigid and severe acts of
Mortification performed both by Hypocrites and
Fools? How often have both Madmen and Wicked
seemed to be transported strangely in the Exercises
of Devotion? therefore these things are not certain
Signs, nor sufficient Proofs of true solid Sanctity:
Which consists in the Rectitude of the whole Man, in
a sincere Conformity of our inward Thoughts and
Sentiments, and of our outward Actions to the Will
of God, manifested to us by Reason and Revelation.
And therefore also we have no reason to take them
for Divinely inspired, who mistake the Nature of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,
who take fallible Signs and uncertain Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
for sure Demonstrations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> is often represented as having as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/>
much Evidence from Heaven as Jesus Christ had. I
think the Comparison not only odious but impious;
nor is there the least ground to make it: yet we are
obliged to consider it, for detecting and curing the
strange Delusions of this Party. Sure, his Sanctity
was infinitely more evident than hers, none that hath
either Eyes or Judgment, and are unbyass'd, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any true or real Resemblance. His Sanctity
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98203:21"/>
was constant, and did shine with such a convincing
Lustre, that no place is left for doubting it. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
made no vain ostentation of great Austeritius,
he did not amuse People by severe and unimitable
acts of Mortification; He wisely avoided these him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
nor would he enjoin them to his Disciples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knew the superstitious humour of Mankind,
how fond they are of an External Religion, how
much inclin'd to be Bigot, for things of an Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Nature, rather than to love and esteem that
which is really Good, and how ready to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
for the Sins of their Soul by the Exercises
of their Body; and therefore he would not give any
Example which might confirm their Errors, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them in their Delusions: But he gave In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of a true and perfect Sanctity, a Sanctity
which cannot be contradicted, a Sanctity against
which no shadow of Objection can be framed, either
on the account of Deficiency or Redundancy. None
but God can see the Heart of Man, but the Heart may
be known by the Actions, and that the Heart of Jesus
was Right, that it was full of the Love of God and
wholly intent upon the pleasing him, is evident to
a Demonstration, by his chearful complyance with
the Will of God in every thing, whether it was to
do or susser; He embraced all Opportunities of
shewing Zeal for God, and he went up and down
continually doing good unto Men, never wearying
in either, whatever Difficulties, Discouragements and
Provocations he met with; He wanted no Virtue,
and exerted every one in the most perfect manner,
neither over-acting any thing, nor yet being defective
in any thing; His Life was so perfect, his Words and
Actions so conform to Truth, so well adjusted to the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98203:21"/>
Occasion, to the Time, Place, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
that Divine and Infinite Wisdom is not more
discernible in the Creation, Contrivance and Harmony
of the Material World, than in the Life and Actions
of Jesus Christ, and therefore we are sure that both
proceeded from one and the same Almighty, most
Wise, and most Holy Spirit; for as the Invisible
Things of God, his Eternal Power and Godhead, are
clearly seen by the one; so from the other, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable
that the fulness of the Godhead dwelt
bodily in Jesus Christ: for so great an Effect could
not be produced by any less Cause, nor could such
exact Sanctity, such perfect Holiness, proceed from
any meer Man. The most inspired Prophet was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to him, and though this Holy Jesus has had,
and I hope still hath, many sincere Followers, yet
never any was, neither can any be so perfect, so holy
as he was: for his Holiness will exceed others, as
much as the Works of Nature are beyond those of the
most perfect Art. And there is as much, nay more
foundation for a Parallel between the Actions of a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamite
and the even Tract of a most wise and virtuous
Man, than for a just Comparison of the Sanctity of
<hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> to that of Jesus Christ. His Sanctity,
like all the Works of God, will be found the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and more admirable, the more narrowly it is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
and considered; whereas the Sanctity of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiselle
<hi>Bourignon,</hi> and all other (especially En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastical
or Conceited Persons) shews best at a
distance: for if we view them near, they appear very
defective, and wanting several stroaks to give them
a true resemblance to Jesus Christ, who is the only
Model and Standard of perfect Sanctity, whose Life
ought to be studied with great attention, both for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98203:22"/>
getting right Notions of Sanctity, and also for faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litating
the attainment of it. Others are to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
only so far as they are Followers of him; and
we may assure our selves that nothing is an essential
part of Sanctity, or a necessary Demonstration of it,
but that which he practised: for as he declared all
the Counsel of God concerning us, so he gave us an
Example of every thing that is absolutely good or
necessary to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> I will not transcribe here, that which I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
elsewhere about Corporal Austerities;<note place="margin">Serm. XV. <hi>On</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 23.</note> nor will
I at present enter upon the Examination of Raptures,
Extasies and Visions, which are given as signs of the
extraordinary Sanctity of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> because
I may have hereafter a more proper occasion for this:
But before I pass to another Head, I judge it may be
of use, to speak more particularly of Solitude, and
a Total retreat from the World, which is recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as a Special Act of Sanctity, by the Example
and Sentiments of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> and which
others also, besides her Followers, seem to be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
taken with.</p>
            <p>Whether the Preference should be given to an
<hi>Active,</hi> or to a <hi>Contemplative Life,</hi> has been much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
both by Heathens and Christians, and also by
Ancients and Moderns: And I must say; that very
few have offered a just Decision of the Matter; for
the Advocates of either side, as generally those who
manage Law Suits, have endeavoured to shew Wit
rather than Truth, and the Judges have passed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
by Inclination or Interest, more than from the
serious Consideration of the Nature of the Thing.
Sanguine Persons have favoured the Active Life,
as the Contemplative has been preferred by those
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98203:22"/>
that are Melancholy: Men have been in love with
Publick Employment, when things succeeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Mind; but when they went cross, then
they turn'd peevish, and only admired Solitude.
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth was sensible of the declining of his
Affairs, and did foresee a change of his Fortune, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he thought of changing an Imperial Crown and
Palace with a Monastery, or of preferring the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Retirement to the Privilege of Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Command.</p>
            <p>But to come close to the Point, I say, nothing is
more disserviceable to Religion, or more prejudicial
to Mens Peace and Comfort, than the consining Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to a life of Solitude and Retirement. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating
the Name of Religion to Cloisters and
Monasteries, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done, is
Unjust, it is Insolent and Scandalous, and is the
Cause of much Mischief. It renders serious and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispos'd
Souls sad and melancholly when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enter into that State, which is represented as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
or highly expedient for their Perfection or
Salvation; and it frightens and discourages others
from the Practice of Piety and the serious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religious Duties, upon the opinion that they
are only proper for such as are Cloister'd and retired
out of the World. The Providence of God has inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the generality of the World in an active Life,
and made it impossible for them to retire from Trade
and Business; shall we therefore say that by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, it is impossible for the greatest part
of Mankind to be Religious? that all whose Necessity
and Circumstances involve them into Publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
or the Affairs of the World, are exempted
from the Obligations of Religion and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98203:23"/>
'Tis true the Soul is better than the World,
and one had better forfeit this than lose that. But
who has Authority to impose harder Conditions than
God has done? Does he require that all should be
Monks or Hermits, that there should be no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
or Society kept up, nor business done. He
has indeed Commanded not to love the World inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately,
not to set our Affections upon it, not to
be Covetous, nor anxious about the things of this
Life: but neither these, nor any other Command,
make Trade, Commerce, or negotiating the Affairs
of the World unlawful; nor do they imply that a
Contemplative Life, or Total Retreat from the World
is more Religious, than Business or Worldly Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
God may be served the one way as well as
the other; and a Man of Business, who manages his
Affairs with Discretion, by the rules of Justice and
Equity, without Covetousness, without sordid and
sinistrous Dealing, keeping a Conscience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
towards God and Man, and who regards the
other Life which is not seen, as well as the present
which is seen; I say, This Man is really as Devout
and Religious as any Monk or Hermit, or retired
Person can be. <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Lot, Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
and several others mentioned in Scripture were
such, and they are more worthy Examples, than
any which can be produced from amongst either
the Ancient or Modern <hi>Asceticks, Anchorets,</hi> or <hi>Coeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites.</hi>
Nay, I say further, That the <hi>Antonies</hi> and
<hi>Teresaes,</hi> the <hi>Brunoes</hi> and <hi>Catherines,</hi> the Founders
and Observers of the strictest <hi>Orders,</hi> are not only
short of those eminent Examples which the Spirit
of God has thought worthy to be put upon Sacred
Record; but also, that they have not exerted greater
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98203:23"/>
or more sincere Piety, than many others who nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
Business, and conversed freely in the World:
Nor were their voluntary Penances and Austerities,
such Acts and Instances of Humility, Patience, Self-denial,
contempt of Honour and Esteem, as the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Insults and Impertinencies, the Follies and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretions,
the Slights and Affronts, which daily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
exposes one to.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot pass over a vulgar Error con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Clergy, which is, That they all ought
to be Men of Study and Retirement. Indeed, they
ought not to undertake Imployments which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Dignity of their Character, nor should they
intangle themselves so much in Affairs, or engage
in any such Business as may take them off from the
exercise of their Function, or which may hinder them
from pursuing the Ends of their Sacred Calling:
And therefore by the ancient Canons it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<note place="margin">VI. Can. Apost. III. Can. Con. <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</hi> Novel. Just. 123.</note>
for a Clergyman to be so much as a Tutor or
Guardian, or the Executor of any one's Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
because all these were Incumbrances to the
Work of the Ministry. But yet it is a Mistake to
think that they should never be seen out of their
Closets, or only when they are to Preach or Read
Prayers; for their Business is not only to Preach, but
to be <hi>an example of the Believers, in Word, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 12.</note>
               <hi>in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity;</hi>
which they cannot be if they be wholly abstracted
and retired from the World, for then they put their
Candle under a Bushel, which cannot give light to
the House. As in the Pulpit they teach the Necessity
of the Divine Laws, so by their Practice they should
shew the possibility of them: And he who can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Conversation innocently, walking by the Faith
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98203:24"/>
which he Professes, and the Doctrine which he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
teaches; who, as the occasion requires it, can
be Serious without Melancholy, or Chearful without
being Prophane; who can hear himself praised with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Vanity, and accused without wrath, who can
accept good things when they are offered without
Scruple or brutal Joy, and yet never out of humour
when they are wanting; and who can frame both his
Discourse and Actions, so as to make them suitable
to the times and the present State of the Church,
his own Circumstances, and the Circumstances of
his Company, I say, he who can do all this, doth
answer his Character, and doth prosecute the ends of
his Calling better than he who shuts himself intirely
up; and his Conversation does more good, and does
more promote Piety than the others Contemplation
and Study.</p>
            <p>But to Return. True Religion and Piety do agree
with an Active Life as well as the Contemplative;
and one who converses daily in the World, may be
as devout and may serve God as faithfully as he who is
totally sequestred from it; therefore <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did
not advise the People, nor the Publicans, nor the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to abide with him in the Wilderness, or to lay
down their several Imployments, but only gave them
Rules, how they might follow them with Integrity
and Uprightness towards God and Man. If all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
consisted in Study and Contemplation, then
every one who desired to be Religious, ought to seek
out Solitude and a retired life; but it is also the Will
of God that every one do that Business which his
Place and Station, his Necessity and Circumstances,
or the Duty which he owes unto others do require at
his hands; and as this cannot be neglected without
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98203:24"/>
Injustice, so he who humbly submits to it, and who
patiently and chearfully undergoes the fatigue of it,
not out of respect to worldly Gain and Profit, but
because it is the Will of God, and what his wise Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
calls him to, he doth give as great a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his love to God, as any who affects Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and Retirement: which deserves to be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
especially by all religious Wives and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that out of a pretext of Devotion, as has been
too often done, the one may not neglect the Service
of their Masters, nor the other the Affairs of their
Husbands, and the Care of their Family and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>Further, as it is evident that Religion cannot be
confined or annexed only to the Contemplative Life, or
a State of Sequestration from the World; so neither
must we think this State more perfect or more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
than any other. Perfection is attainable by the
Active as well as Contemplative Life; and the choice
of either is to be justified only by the prudent conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of one's Natural Constitution, his outward State
and Circumstances, for neither of these are agreeable to
all, or proper for all. Retirement may be very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and proper for some in some Cases, and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prudent nor commendable for others, nor for
the same Persons at other times; but may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
deservedly an instance of unmanly Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and of a shameful desertion of their Post. So
that in my judgment neither of these States is to be
preferred to the other; nor do they wisely consider
them who presume to determine absolutely which is
best, for the one or other is best according to one's
personal State and Circumstances or his Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements.
And I do also think that he is in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98203:25"/>
happiest Condition who partakes of both States, whose
life is neither wholly Contemplative, nor wholly
Active; but which is made up of both by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of Retirement and Business: For he that is
wholly retired, lives only to himself, which makes
him an idle Drone with regard to others, and he is a
Drudge to the World who is always imployed in
Business, and who neither has nor takes time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
his Mind with the sweet Pleasures of Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Solitude is more Profitable for one's self,
but Business and Conversation renders one more Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the World. In the one we enjoy our selves
best, but it is only by the other that we can do any
good, or manifest the Vertues and Graces which
God hath bestowed on us. By Solitude we acquire
Knowledge, and by being conversant in the World
we learn Experience: In Retirement we may more
easily preserve our Innocence, but without Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
and Business we cannot exert Christian Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Courage, and other necessary Vertues.
Solitude and Retirement are a safe Refuge for weak
Constitutions; but they who are strong, should shew
themselves upon the Theatre of the World. A Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Retreat is as necessary to the Spiritual, as Rest
is to the Bodily Life; for by it we renew our decayed
Spirits, we recollect our dissipated Thoughts, and add
strength and vigour to our wise Resolutions, and
pious Purposes. It is impossible that one can act
wisely, who never thinks seriously; or that he can
think seriously and to purpose, who is always in the
hurry of Affairs. Therefore certainly every one who
consults his own Good, and is in any wise Master of
himself, will so wisely contrive his business, and so
order his affairs, that he may have Hours and Days,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98203:25"/>
if not Weeks and Months for Meditation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation:
That by this means he may have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
and acquaintance with Heaven, while he
lives upon Earth; that he may be fortified against all
Encounters, and be qualified for gaining that Victory
over the World, which will give him a right to the
Crown of Glory.</p>
            <p>And I am of the opinion, that frequent retreats are
more adviseable to religious Persons, than a constant
or total sequestration from the World. For such is the
weakness of our Minds, while they are clogg'd with
this gross Flesh, that they cannot hold out long, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wearying, in those divine and spiritual Exercises,
for which Solitude and Retirement are to be desired.
If our Spirits be too much extended at once, they
will flag, and will become no more capable of being
elevated unto degrees of Fervour, than a tired and
spent Body is of quick and vigorous Motion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Devotions of Cloister'd Persons are very
often-dry and insipid, and they do frequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Exercises with less tast and satisfaction than
Men in the World. If there be not care taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
those devout and sublime Thoughts which soar
above material Things, and a sublunary World, they
will either quite evaporate, or they will condense into
airy Notions, or fantastical Conceits; whence it is
that Dreams and Visions, and such like Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
do happen unto Persons altogether or very much
abstracted from the World, more than unto others.
Religious Retirements are liable to be abused, and are
sometimes attended with dangerous Consequences,
as well as Conversation and Business; nor have Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who are entangled in the Affairs of the World
more need of Monitors, than those who have seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
themselves, of wise Directors.</p>

All I shall add more upon this Head, is, That as
the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath erred grossly, in chaining
Religion so much to Monastries and Cloisters; so it
was a great blemish in our Reformation, to demolish
these Houses entirely, which as they ought to have
been reformed from the abuses that had crept into
them, so they might have been kept up to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Religion, and to the benefit of both the
Publick, and particular Persons: They are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
if the snare of Vows, and the delusion of a
peculiar Sanctity in them be removed.</p>
            <p>This Digression, about the nature of Solitude, and
a Contemplative Life, is not altogether from our
purpose; which is to shew the Mistakes of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Persons, who commonly are excessively fond
of this state, and do ascribe more to it than it well
deserves.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> But now to return to Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon:</hi>
As the chief Instances alledged are not certain Proofs
of her Sanctity; so there be several things, which she
her self confesses, and which they who write her
Life do acknowledge, which do not very well agree
with that extraordinary Sanctity that is ascribed
to her. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We are told, That until the Eighteenth Year
of her Age, she run into a vain, light and idle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and followed the Pleasures, Recreations and
Divertisements of the World, by which she <hi>lost her
Conversation with God,</hi> as the Author of the <hi>Preface
to the English Reader</hi> saith: which, in my judgment,
is a flat Contradiction to what he said some few lines
before,<note place="margin">Light of the World,</note> 
               <hi>viz. That from her Childhood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pref. p. 14.</note> 
               <hi>she had inward
Conversation with God.</hi> It is, indeed, no strange thing
to see Children and Youth taken with Vanities, when
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98203:26"/>
those of riper years do too much follow them: nor
would there be reason to upbraid it here, if Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoifelle
<hi>Bourignon</hi> and her Disciples did not pretend
that she was Sanctified from the Womb, and boast
that at three or four years of age she was Divinely
Inspired, and that even so early she began to express
a sense of Divine Things above what all the Doctors<note place="margin">La Vie Contin. c. 2.</note>
of the Church are capable of. They will have her,
when she was little more than a weaned infant, to be
sensible of Christian Perfection, and how much short
of it those about her were: when she could hardly
lisp out a word, it is pretended that she asked se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
whether there were any Christians, or Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Jesus, and where they lived? Now, if all
this be true, and if these things had proceeded from
the Spirit of God, to give early notice to the World,
that He had anointed her to be a Prophetess, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his Will; I say, if so, it is no ways likely that
God would have left her so soon to her self, or that he
would have suffered her to be corrupted, whom he had
appointed to be so great a Light. <hi>Samuel, Ieremiah,</hi>
and St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> who were consecrated Prophets
from their birth, and who were set apart to be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
and signal Instruments of a Reformation among
God's People, they never turned aside to a wicked,
vain, or light Conversation; all their Life was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
from the World, and from their very Infancy
they were Examples of a severe Piety: But this New
Light of the World suffered an eclipse for some years,
though, as is pretended, it began to shine very early.
The early impressions of Piety which <hi>Antonia Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignon</hi>
is said to have had, were for some time smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered;
and she who is brought in, at four years of
age, complaining of other Christians, did her self,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98203:27"/>
when grown up, follow their vain Example. Which
is not agreeable to the Methods of the Divine Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
heretofore, if God had raised up this Woman,
and called her out to so great and high things as She
and her Followers alledge. It is said of our Blessed
Lord, that as he grew in Stature, so he did grow in
Wisdom, and Favour both with God and Man: And
if God had designed Madamoifelle <hi>Bourignon</hi> a second
Saviour to Mankind, to finish the Work which was
only begun by the other; it is not at all to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that he would have given place to a Spirit of
Folly and Vanity, or that he would have suffered her
to commit such things as were offensive to himself,
and contrary to his own Purposes; that is, which
were so far from reclaming Men from their Sins, that
they rather tended to confirm them therein.</p>
            <p>That which they say tempted her to this vain course
of life, was the Censures and Misconstructions put
upon her early Seriousness and Retirement; for upon
that account, she was represented as simple, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
and wanting Spirit. But could not the
Spirit of God break through this Temptation? Was
her extraordinary Grace too weak to resist it? Could
one so Divinely Inspired, find out no other means of
rectifying Peoples Mistakes? And must so holy a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
do evil, merely to pass for a Wit? Is Sense and
Judgment no where to be manifested, but in the acts
of a vain and trifling Conversation? But whatever
was her motive and temptaion, or however she may
be excused, she confesses that she was far engaged into
the Vanities of the World, and the love of them:<note place="margin">'La Parole de Dieu, n. 3.</note>
If we may believe her self, <hi>she was ambitious of Honour,
and did love the Pleasures and Divertisements of Sense
and Riches, because they did procure them: she took
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98203:27"/>
pleasure in the company of Young Men, admitted their<note place="margin">La Vie Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terieure, §. 4.</note>
Courtship and Addresses, and was well pleased when they
commended her Wit, and especially when they praised her
for being Handsom and Agreeable, because she had been
called always Ugly, by her Mother.</hi> Thus it appears,
that Pride and Ambition, Sensuality and Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
prevailed with this Maid: and where these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
the Spirit of God does not much reside. It is
said, indeed, That God did often visit her even in this
state;<note place="margin">Light of the World,</note> 
               <hi>That he did not cease, now and then, to awaken
her,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pref. p. 14.</note> 
               <hi>even in the midst of her Divertisements; but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and these Amusements, still got the ascendant:</hi>
that is, in plain terms, she all this time resisted the
Spirit of God, and walked contrary to the Dictates
of her Conscience: <hi>Videt meliora probatque, deteriora
sequitur.</hi> Which is not compatible with a state of
extraordinary Grace and Sanctity. I would not exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate
this so much, if I was not provoked by the
strange Impudence and Delusion of those, who will
have us to receive this Woman, as more than Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
as without Sin, as equal to Jesus Christ, who
never yielded to the strong Temptations of the Devil,
whereas she was carried away by the weak Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Men.</p>
            <p>Again, As there appeared no extraordinary Sanctity
in <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> before she arrived to the age of
Eighteen; so even after this, which is pretended to
be the time of her Conversion, she did not determine
the great and important state of her Life, by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Principles of Religion. It is the End, which
sanctifies our Actions; and Persons truly Devout and
Holy, make God the End of all that they do. They
who respect only or chiefly their own Ease, Pleasure
or Profit, are not to be reckon'd very holy, or above
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98203:28"/>
the common rate of Mankind, whatever state of Life
they betake themselves to: For the height of one's
Sanctity is not to be taken from their Outward Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Behaviour, but from the Inward Principles
which move them. He that is sober only or mainly
for saving of his Money, or on the account of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Health, doth indeed wisely; but his Temperance
is no more an act of Religion, than another's eating
and drinking out of Pleasure. He that retires from
the World, because he loves his Ease, and has an
aversion to Trouble and Vexation, his Retirement
is not Religious, nor is he himself to be esteemed
more holy than another who follows worldly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
            <p>Now if Madamoifelle <hi>Bourignon</hi> had been so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
holy as is pretended, if she had been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
from Above in every thing, she would have
considered God, and not her self; she would have
consulted that which was best for his Service, and
not her own Humour and Conveniency: But she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
upon a Coelibate State, only because she would
not be cross'd and uneasie; because she hated the
Restraints and Troubles of Marriage, though they
be both the Occasions and Proofs of great Virtue,
which was no great Instance of any peculiar Sanctity.
She did not chuse a Virgins State, that she might
<hi>only care for the things of the Lord,</hi> as the Apostle
speaks, and not be incumbred in the doing that, by
the Obligations of <hi>pleasing a Husband</hi> too: But she
preferred this State to Marriage, only because she
had no great or good opinion of the Husbands, who
were offered to her, and because she was afraid that
they might be all like her Father, who was sometimes
rough, surly and ill-natur'd towards her Mother.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98203:28"/>
This is the Account which she gives her self.<note place="margin">La Vie Ext. § 6. <hi>p.</hi> 148.</note> And
he who continues her Life, according to his usual
Custom, doth enlarge upon this Passage, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
it to a great Act of Piety, not without a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon the rest of her Sex.<note place="margin">La Vie Cont. c. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 20.</note> 
               <q>When, saith he,
she perceived her Father rough and unkind to her
Mother, notwithstanding the Care and Pains which
were taken to please him, she retired and prayed,
<hi>That God might never suffer her to Marry.</hi> A Prayer
very unlike to that of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> before his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
which was, <hi>Lord give me the gift of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity,
but not yet;</hi> fearing to be too soon healed of
the damnable and transient Charm of the Flesh.
And yet (saith he) more will favour the Prayer of
St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> than comply with the Prayer of Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle
<hi>Bourignon,</hi> which was so acceptable to God,
that he granted to her the full Intent of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I leave it to the fair Sex, to make what Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they please upon this Author's plain Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that all of them have strong Inclinations to
Marriage, that they do heartily wish for an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
and are guilty of gross Dissimulation, when
they pretend the contrary: But whether this be true
or not, and whatever Opinion this Man may have of
Women upon this account, I do say, that those who
embrace Marriage, may do it upon more Religious
Motives and Principles than this <hi>Idol Mistress</hi> of his
did refuse it, who did so, because she undervalued all
she saw, and could find none of Merit enough to
deserve her. <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> like the rest who
pretend to more than ordinary Sence and Spirit, was
nice and difficulty pleas'd, Critical and Censorious,
apt to be disgusted at the least blemish, whatever
Virtues it might be compensated with; She, as others
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98203:29"/>
who have a high conceit of themselves, aim'd at
something above what is common, she would have
had a more perfect Creature than Nature uses to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
and a Husband with all Kinds and Degrees of
Happiness, which the present Oeconomy of the World
will not allow: And 'twas a wonder that she had
not the common Fate of that Proud Gang, which
is to take up with one at Fifty or Sixty, Inferiour
to any of those whom they slighted at Twenty and
Thirty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> by the Account we
have of her, seems to have been of a very obstinate
wilful Temper, neither respectful of those who were
Elder, nor tractable or obedient to those, to whom
God and Nature had subjected her: which is so far
from being consistent with true Sanctity, that it is a
shrewd sign that it is wanting. For where this Grace
is given in any good measure, it corrects the rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our natural Constitution; it makes them who
are naturally Stubborn, pliant and advisable; It fills
them with Respect and Esteem towards others, and
especially, it renders them Obedient to Parents. So
it is said of him, who was a true Instance of most
perfect Sanctity,<note place="margin">Luke 2. 51.</note> That <hi>he went down to Nazareth, and
was subject unto his Parents.</hi> But as for madamoiselle
<hi>Bourignon,</hi> this wonderful Holy Maid, she was cross
and refractory, she would not obey her Parents in
those things, in which they had a right to command,
and pursued her own will, not only contrary to their
Inclinations, but also against their express Commands.
I could give several Instances, but one may serve,
which was her Importunity to be admitted into the
Cloister of the <hi>Discalceated</hi> or <hi>Bare footed Carmelites,</hi>
even after her Father had most passionately declared
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98203:29"/>
against it,<note place="margin">La Parole de Dieu. <hi>n. 8. p.</hi> 5. La Vie Ext. §. 6.</note> saying, That <hi>he would rather see her Dead,
or a Clinick and Bed-rid all her life-time, than a Nun
of any Order whatsoever.</hi> And notwithstanding that,
he charged her strictly to resort no more to the
Houses of these Nuns, <hi>threatning to break her Legs if
she did;</hi> yet she often went, and spoke to one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Lawrence,</hi> who was <hi>Prior,</hi> to receive her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
her Father's consent; and when that would not
do, she stole away privately from her Father's House,
dress'd up like a Hermit, as shall be related here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the Defendants of this Woman will say,
That this cannot be reckoned any Instance of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect
or Disobedience to her Parents; because she
did it not only from a Religious Principle, that in
that condition she might serve God better, but also
by a particular Inspiration, which ought not to have
been resisted; for <hi>it is better to obey God than Man.</hi>
But what! Is Religion inconsistent with it self? doth
it teach a Contempt of Parents! a breach of the first
Command with Promise? Can a Violation of the
Natural Right of Parents, be compensated by a Nuns
Hood and Habit? Is it not the express Law of God,
that the Vows of a Daughter shall not bind, unless
ratified by her Father? 'Tis true, God has a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Authority over his own Laws, and all Persons;
Father and Mother must be forsaken and hated, when
he requires it: But how does it appear that he gave
such a Command to this Maid? She says it, indeed,
but is that sufficient to believe it? have we not seen
Bedlamites pretend the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost,
for most ridiculous things? must every whimsical
Conceit of a disturb'd Head, of an uneasie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled
Mind be thought to come from God? When
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98203:30"/>
God gives extraordinary Commands, especially which
seem to dispense with any of his former, he gives
them with a convincing Evidence, and at the same
time he inclines the Heart of such as have Power and
Authority over those who receive particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and Commissions, that they may either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Execution, or give no hindrance to it. Thus
when God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to go to <hi>Egypt,</hi> the
Heart of <hi>Iethro</hi> his Father-in-Law, was moved to let
him go in Peace, with his Wife and Children: And
though God hardened <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Heart for a time, that
he might have occasion to exert his Soveraign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to shew his Almighty Power, and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to all the World, that he was the only true
God; yet the People of <hi>Israel</hi> were not to move a
foot towards their commanded Journey, until he was
willing to let them go. Nor is there so much as
one Instance in all the Scripture, of a Wife, or Child,
or Servant, or Subject, their being commanded to
do any thing of an Indifferent Nature, which is not
absolutely and necessarily good, without any regard
to the Consent and Approbation of Husband, Parent,
Master, and King. If the Case had been about turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christian, Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon</hi> ought to have
done it without a particular Revelation, whether her
Father would or not; but 'twas not lawful for her,
either to Marry, or to devote her self to a Coelibate
Life, against his Will or Without his Consent: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her obstinacy to be a <hi>Carmelite Nun,</hi> was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with true Sanctity, was not of God, but only
a wilful humour from a suddain inconsiderate Whim
which struck her fanciful Noddle at that time. If it
had been of God, the Revelation would have been
made plain to her Father, or by some secret Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98203:30"/>
he would have been inclin'd to favour it. And
it was evident afterwards, that either she did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
this pretended Revelation, or that 'twas not of
God, for she did not pursue it, when Father and
Mother were Dead; when she was at her own dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
she neither engag'd her self into that <hi>Order,</hi> or
any other, but hated and abhorred all. She indeed
went and stayed some time at <hi>Mons,</hi> with the <hi>Nuns</hi>
of <hi>Notre Dame</hi> there; but they soon wearied of her
and she of them. But to go on,</p>
            <p>I will give you a Fourth Instance, which all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byass'd
Persons must acknowledge, very unsuitable to
one of Extraordinary Sanctity; nay, which does not
well agree with common measures of Grace and good
Nature, because it proceeded from an inordinate love
of the World, and could not be managed without
great disrespect to her Father.<note place="margin">La Parole de Dieu, <hi>n. 91. p.</hi> 62.</note> And this is her suing
her Father at the Law, to divide his Goods with her,
when he Married a Second time.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>Bourignon,</hi> upon his first Wife's death,
employed some Priests and others who were most
likely to prevail, that they might perswade his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Antonia</hi> to abide with him, and to take the charge
of his House and Family; which she did with some
difficulty, for her Mind was wholly upon Solitude
and Retirement from worldly Business: though her
Father's Necessity and Command shewed that it was
the Will of God that she should at that time lead an
Active Life, and the Revelation ought to have been
very Evident, which could excuse the not assisting
her Father when he wanted it so much; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was told her, that even Vows were dispensable
in this Case. She says that she manag'd the Affairs
of her Father's Family very well, and also did take
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98203:31"/>
time for <hi>Interiour Retreats;</hi> but her Father was not
so pleased with her Management, as not to think of
taking home a Wife, which he at last did; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
his Daughter to deliver up to her the whole
Charge of his House. <hi>Antonia</hi> continued with her
Father four Months longer, but without great Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
either to her self, or to her Father and his
new Wife. As these Relations seldom agree well
together, but are often picking Quarrels and finding
Fault one with another; so it was here: Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selle
esteemed her <hi>Mother-in-Law</hi> a Fool, and had her
in the utmost Contempt, which the other did not
bear patiently, nor could the Father well suffer it.
He was obliged to take his Wife's part, and not to
countenance his Daughter, which made her very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie;
and at last to resolve upon leaving the House,
which Monsieur <hi>Bourignon</hi> would neither encourage,
nor yet hinder; but he flatly refused her Money,
which did very much Pique her. And while she was
in this discontented humour, he who was Husband
to her deceas'd Sister, perswaded her to commence a
Law Suit against her Father. He himself was a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
at Law, and no doubt for his own Profit, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
this Process, hoping to wheedle the simple
Maid out of all, or a great part of what the Law
might give her; but both he and she was disappointed
at this time, for Monsieur <hi>Bourignon</hi> did cast them:
And, indeed, whatever Singularities were in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case; which might give litigious Persons a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for a Process, it seems very unreasonable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
a Father to bestow a Portion on a Daughter before
she be Married, or has any particular occasion for it,
especially when he is willing to keep and maintain
her at home, if she will prove Dutiful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:98203:31"/>
But suppose Monsieur <hi>Bourignon</hi> had been obliged
in Justice to have granted to his Daughter a Portion
at this time; yet it was not becoming true Piety and
Sanctity to go to Law with him. The using private
Methods, and the Intreaties of Friends to bring him
to rights, was allowable; but the going to Law was
hardly justifiable, because it both increas'd his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
and Wrath at her, and also exposed him as
an Unreasonable, Unjust and Undutiful Father, who
regarded neither the good of his Child, nor the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of his former Wife. Law Suits are sometimes
unavoidable, and it may be lawful for the most De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Christian sometimes to go to Law, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Law Suits are Scandalous, and are very unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to that Piety and Perfection which Christians pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
and should aim at. They shew that there is little
Justice, little Charity, little good Nature, and too
much of Inordinate Affection for the things of this
Life, either in the Plaintiff or Defendant, and too
commonly in both. As a Wise Man will part freely
with some of his Interest, to redeem himself from
the Vexation and Slavish Dependance which are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
from Law Suits; So a Good and Pious
Man will, without the compulsion of Law, do more
than that which he is obliged to in strict Justice. It
does not favour of great Piety, when one is either
very tenacious to keep all they have in Possession, or
very rigid to exact of others every thing they may
claim. <hi>Now therefore,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>there is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
a fault among you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>because ye go to Law one with
another: why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not
rather suffer your selves to be defrauded?</hi> If it is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Christians to go to Law, except in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and unavoidable Cases; if they ought to take In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98203:32"/>
and suffer Wrong, rather than do it, how doth the
Extraordinary Sanctity of <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> appear,
who went to Law with her own Father, when she had
neither Law nor Reason on her side. She that would
have had others live up to the Letter of the Christian
Law, why did she not so her self here?</p>
            <p>Though she gives an account of this Law Suit with
her Father, yet he who enlarged and continued her
Life, takes no notice of this Passage, so that it seems he
knew not how to justifie it. But he gives an account
of another Law Suit after her Father's Death, for
recovering a Share of his Fortune from her Mother-in-Law,
which was justifiable enough, if she had not
pretended to so much Self-denial, to an entire ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractedness
from the World, and to be sent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
others from their Worldly-mindedness, and to
Establish a most Spiritual Kingdom upon Earth. The
aforesaid Author was sensible of this Objection, and
therefore he obviates it,<note place="margin">La Vie Cont. c. 12.</note> and according to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and Blasphemous Custom, he ascribes it to God:
And says, That <hi>he engaged her in this Suit, and told
her, that it was for his Divine Glory, and that she
would have occasion for the Goods she obtained.</hi> He
also runs out in the Enumeration of the good Deeds
done by <hi>Madamoiselle,</hi> to shew how happy 'twas for
others that she was Rich: and he might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc'd
one more, if the Story be true which goes
of Monsieur <hi>Poiret,</hi> who is said to be the Author of
this Life, <hi>viz.</hi> That she left him a very good Legacy.
But may not any thing be justified after this manner?
Did not <hi>Iudas</hi> varnish his Covetousness with a shew
of Charity? Compassion to the Poor was pretended,
but the real cause why he complain'd of the <hi>wast of
Ointment,</hi> was the keeping of the Bag. How many
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98203:32"/>
do excuse their Covetousness, and sordid Drudgery
after the Things of this Life; by the Commands of
being Diligent in their Business, of providing for
their Family? But what signifie Words when Actions
declare the contrary? Actions are true Indications
of the inward Temper, and it doth sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by these Particulars, That though <hi>Antonia</hi> talked
often of a Contempt of the World, yet like other
pretended Saints, her Mind looked very much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it.</p>
            <p>Which is further made out by her becoming Heir
to Monsieur <hi>Du Cort,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. c. 22. Dictionaire Hist. &amp; Critique per M. Baile.</note> to the great disturbance of
her own Quiet, and to the Prejudice of others.
This Man was so devoted to this Woman, that he
thought nothing good but that which she approved,
and therefore certainly he would not have made over
his Estate to her, without her Advice and Direction,
especially seeing they lived in one House together.
Therefore also we may very justly conclude, that
this Saint had a little tincture of Covetousness, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
she desired Goods which she had no manner of
Right to, which she did not need, having enough
besides, and which she could not possess without
defrauding the Relations and Kinsfolk of <hi>Du Cort,</hi>
nor without a considerable diversion to that great
Design, upon which she pretended that she was sent
to the World, <hi>viz.</hi> The renewing the Church, and
the bringing Men to true Perfection. For this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
her in great Trouble, raised her many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and was the occasion of very hot Persecutions;
all which she would have avoided, if she had not
minded the things of the World as much or more
than the things of God. <hi>No man,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 4.</note>
               <hi>that warreth, entangleth himself with the affairs of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98203:33"/>
this life, that he may please him who hath chosen him to
be a soldier.</hi> If she was called to build the House of
God, how came she to study so much the encrease
and bettering of an Earthly Fortune, especially to the
wronging of others? Are Riches necessary to the
erecting of a Spiritual House? Is not this suspicious?
Was this grasping at all she could get, a proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to convert Men from the love of the World?
Was this like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who would not use his own
Right, that his Doctrine and Ministry might not be
suspected? How can they compare this Woman to
<hi>Iesus Christ?</hi> How can they raise her Sanctity to an
exactness with His, when she endeavoured to be as
rich as possible? whereas He, both to shew and
teach a true contempt of the World, did chuse to be
poorer than the <hi>foxes,</hi> or the <hi>fowls of the air;</hi> for the
one have <hi>nests,</hi> and the other have <hi>holes,</hi> but <hi>he had
no place where to lay his head?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not the only disagreement which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Madamoiselle <hi>Bourignon</hi> and Jesus Christ: so
that she cannot be reckoned either truly or perfectly
holy, if he be the Standard. For,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As it could be proved by a thousand Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
she was exceedingly vain, and used always to
magnifie her self; she despised others, and could not
believe well of any body; nay, she would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that there was so much as any sincere Christian
in the World; she slighted the Sacraments, and all
holy Ordinances, as far below her, contrary to the
practice of Jesus Christ, who though he needed them
as little as any, yet he submitted to them, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
observed them, out of respect to the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
to give good Example unto others, and to
teach Humility to the most Perfect. She withdrew
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98203:33"/>
from the Publick Worship, and did forsake the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of all sorts of Christians, contrary to the express
Precept of the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 25. These, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Particulars will fully appear hereafter;
and both these and the former Instances, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are incompatible with such great and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Sanctity as is ascribed to <hi>Antonia Bourignon;</hi>
they do not appear to me small Beauty-spots, but like
ugly Scabs and Ulcers, which quite disfigure the Face
of a Saint.</p>
            <p>Thus the first Pillar which prop'd up the high
Character formerly given to <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and I judge the rest may be taken away with
as little difficulty.</p>
            <p>A Second thing pretended for exalting Madamoiselle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/>
               <hi>Bourignon</hi> above all Mankind, is, her knowledge of
Secret Thoughts, and of things done at a distance.
And if 'twas true, she must indeed be acknowledged
to be somewhat more than Humane: For both Reason
and Scripture give it as a peculiar Property of God,
to know the Heart of Man, and their Thoughts afar
off; and this is one of the Proofs of the Divinity of
our Lord Jesus Christ, that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: that
he needed not that any should tell him what was
in Man, because he knew it before-hand. But how
doth it appear that this Woman did penetrate so
much into the Hearts of Men, that she could know
what was transacted there, without communication,
and without external appearances? for otherwise it
was no strange thing. We have only some general
Assertions of Monsieur <hi>du Cort</hi> for it, and not any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
which may convince us. And by several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
it doth appear, that he was one very easily
imposed upon: He was possessed with a high Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98203:34"/>
of this Woman; he verily believed that she was
Inspired, and therefore was fully disposed to magnifie
every thing which she said or did, as her Vanity was
ready enough to feed this extravagant Fancy. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possession
has a strange ascendant upon Mens Belief.
Thus the Vulgar, who follow Mountebanks, Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers
and Fortune-tellers, make one another believe
wonderful Instances of the Skill of these Persons, in the
discovery of Secrets: when all the while, the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Men only told them the things which they had
learn'd from themselves, by their simple and unwary
Answers, and the inconsiderate words which had
dropt from them.</p>
            <p>The Knowledge of Things at a distance, though it
be rare and unaccountable, yet it is not so miraculous
as the knowledge of Mens Thoughts, nor doth it
prove the Person Inspired. It is certain, that some
Persons, in the High-lands of <hi>Scotland</hi> particularly,
have that which is called the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> by which,
sometimes, they have imparted to them those things
which are transacted in some distant place, or which
are to fall out shortly: And it is also certain, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Testimonies both from credible Histories,
and living Witnesses, that an Account of Battels has
been given the very day and hour in which they have
been fought, at some hundred and thousand miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
I could give Instances of both these in our
own time, if I had allowance to publish them, from
the Persons whose Names I should be obliged to use.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as there is no Evidence or sufficient
Proof, that <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> knew the secret Thoughts
of Mens Hearts; so, supposing that she did sometimes
declare the things done in places remote from her, yet
this is not a good foundation for so sublime and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98203:34"/>
a Character as she hath amongst her Disciples;
because this has been, and is still done by some or
other, who can lay no claim to any extraordinary
Merit, or particular Communication with God. How
this should come to pass, I will not adventure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain;
for I reckon it among the <hi>Arcana Dei &amp; Naturae,</hi>
which Philosophy it self cannot reach, except it be
said that it is by the means of Spirits, whose Motion
and Knowledge do much exceed ours, who are wrapt
up in the thick and heavy Vehicle of the Flesh.</p>
            <p>A Third Pretence for Elevating <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/>
so high, is, her being able to <hi>foretell things to come;
which</hi> (says Monsieur <hi>du Cort) she did not by way of
Supposition,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Light of the World, <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 44.</note> 
               <hi>nor did she relate them as if she had dream'd
them:</hi> So he would have us to believe that she fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
future things plainly and positively as they were
to happen, and as they did come to pass. And this,
indeed, is so far above all the Knowledge which can
be acquired by Natural means, that it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd,
that they who can do this, must have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than common Nature bestows. The
Wisest, by either Reason or Observation, can only
guess at that which shall be, and they both may be,
and often are mistaken in their most reasonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.
Events, and Future Accidents, are not to be
seen, by the best Telescopes, in the Stars and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
though Astrologers have long pretended to it:
but the vanity of their Science has been often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and there can be produced manifold Instances
of the foolish and miserable Delusions of those who
have trusted to it.</p>
            <p>Some think the Fore-knowledge of all things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
and therefore they deny, even to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the Prescience of such things as depend upon the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98203:35"/>
arbitrary Will and Pleasure of Free Agents, among
whom Monsieur <hi>Poiret</hi> makes one: But this is a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
God of an Essential Attribute, which Reason and
Scripture give unto him, and of which he has given
many wonderful and convincing Manifestations. God
certainly knows every thing which is to fall out in
the World;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Christian Faith, <hi>part. 2. p.</hi> 121.</note> nothing can happen contrary to his Will,
or beyond his Knowledge and Expectation, if I may
be allowed to speak so: for as he cannot be resisted,
so neither is he liable to be surprised. This is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible,
but it is true; and they who think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
have no true Notion, but mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable
Thoughts of the Infinite Being. And as God
certainly hath the fore-knowledge of all things, so
unless they be revealed some way or other, no
Man can know before-hand these things which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
not upon Natural Causes, neither are the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of that Order that is established in Nature, as
Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, the Conjunction of
the Planets, and the like, which those who are skilful
in Astronomy can calculate for some thousands of
years to come.</p>
            <p>Sure and undoubted Prophecies, as well as true
Miracles, are certainly from God; they both bear
their own Testimony, and are a sufficient Testimony
to Persons and Things which are agreeable to the
Nature of God, and which do not contradict his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
and positive Will. St. <hi>Peter</hi> preferreth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of Prophecy to that of Sense: <hi>We have not</hi>
(saith he) <hi>followed cunningly devised fables, when we
made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord
Iesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his majesty: And
we have also a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye
do well that ye take heed,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 16, 19. But though
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98203:35"/>
all Miracles and Prophecies are Super-natural, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Persons nor Doctrines are to be received as from
Heaven, upon single Instances of either Miracles or
Prophecies, especially if the Consequence be unworthy
of God, and contrary to other certain and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
Declarations of his Will. For God himself
hath forwarned us, <hi>Deut.</hi> xiii. 1. that he may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
permit False Prophets, for a tryal to his People,
who may do Wonders, and give Signs which come
to pass; and he there not only forbids to hearken to
such, but also he ordains the putting such False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
to death, notwithstanding of their Wonders and
Signs. So likewise it is said, That <hi>there shall arise
false Christs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. xxiv. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and false prophets, and shall shew great
signs and wonders, insomuch that (if it were possible)
they shall deceive the very elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, even supposing that <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi>
has uttered some Prophecies, and foretold somethings
which came to pass, she may deserve to be rejected,
instead of paying her Divine Honour, as some do.
But how much more deservedly is she to be abhorred,
if she has uttered Lyes, and spoken falsly in the Name
of the Lord! <hi>When a prophet speaketh in the name of
the Lord, if the thing follow not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. xviii. 22.</note> 
               <hi>nor come to pass, that
is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
hath spoken it presumptuously; thou shalt not be afraid
of him.</hi> Now this Woman has told things very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and positively, which have not yet come to pass;
as, That the Last Judgment was near at hand, when
she had her Conferences with Monsieur <hi>du Cort;</hi>
That within Three Years it would begin: <hi>Believe
me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

                  </gap>f. 2. part 1. p. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Sir, There is nothing more true; we actually live
in the Last Times; and the Iudgment is so near, that
before Three Years, I believe that you will see <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:98203:36"/>
of it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">La Vie Cont. <hi>c. 19. p.</hi> 275.</note> These Conferences were written in the
Year 1664, though they were held long before; so
that it is almost Forty Years since, and yet there is
no more appearance of the near approach of that
Terrible Day, than there was some hundred of years
before she was born. So that here is a notorious
Falshhood, besides a great Presumption, to take upon
her to declare that which Jesus (whom we have all
reason to believe) says the very Angels in Heaven do
not know, nor any save the Father, and which shall
come upon Men <hi>like a thief in the night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, she put Monsieur <hi>du Cort</hi> in hopes
of seeing Christ actually in the Clouds:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Light of the World,</hi> part 1. p. 144.</note> And as for
her self, she did not doubt it, but expected it very
shortly; and yet both he and she are dead, without
that desirable Sight. Could she therefore speak these
things by Divine Inspiration? Doth it not appear
that she was a Deceiver of others, and also deceived
her self? Indeed, she was so much deceived, that she
would not believe that she was a dying, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her Age and Sickness; and when it came to
the extremity, that she see perceived Death inevitable,
she said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>La Vie Cont.</hi> c. 34. p. 580.</note> 
               <hi>That it was not the Will of God, that she should
die then; for she had not done that for which she was
sent, nor that which she should have done and written.</hi>
Thus there did not appear in this Woman the true
Signs of the Spirit of God, but strong Delusions to
the very last; and they must be strangely deluded
and infatuated, who can believe this Woman Divinely
Inspired, when they themselves do write and publish
her gross Deceptions and Mistakes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/> A Fourth Reason which perswades the Discipless of
<hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> to have her in so high esteem, is,
Her sublime and wonderful Knowledge of Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98203:36"/>
with an Uniformity and Agreement of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
both with her Self and Scripture. It must
indeed be acknowledged, that this Woman does speak
and write more plainly and intelligibly than any of
the <hi>Mystick Sect;</hi> and is somewhat more upon the
<hi>Moral</hi> than others of that Gang, who feed too much
upon curious Speculations: nor is she behind any in
her attempts to penetrate into all the Mysteries of
Nature and Religion, and is as positive as any Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
can be: which inconsiderate Persons take for
plain Evidence. Her Spirit was not common, and
she often takes high flights; but they are flights for
which her Fancy is to be admired, rather than her
Judgment. She, indeed, soars above Dull, Sober,
Thinking Souls, who cannot rise higher than Reason
and Meditation will permit; the last of which, they
say, she was never clogg'd with, and the first very
seldom. I do not deny that her Notions are sublime;
and if that be a good reason for giving to her extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Honour, we ought also to honour no less many
a Bedlamite, whose Notions are and have been as much
surprizing. But who will not preferr Common Sense,
and a Sound Head, to the most sublime Conceits, if
they either proceed from, or be attended with Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Truth is of more value than Sublimity, and
Useful Knowledge is to be studied rather than Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
Many are presumptuous to thrust themselves
within the Veil whither they are forbidden; they
search farther into Secrets and Mysteries than they
are allowed, and they obtrude upon the World Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
which are not plain and evident; and for
that very cause they ought not to be admitted,
nor received with credit, whatever sublimity be in
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:98203:37"/>
As to the consistency of her Notions, and their
agreement with Scripture; if this was true, 'twould
prove something: But it is so far from being true,
that I dare venture my Reputation, to prove that the
Notions of <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> do neither hang well
together, nor are they consonant to the Scriptures:
Which, with God's assistance, shall appear to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of all unbyass'd Persons, in the following
<hi>Narratives,</hi> when I come to examine her particular
Tenets and Opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> A Fifth Inducement to the receiving <hi>Antonia Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignon</hi>
as one Divinely Inspired, is, The Super-natural
means by which she came to the Knowledge of all
things, <hi>viz.</hi> without reading, without consulting
Men or Books, and even without Meditation. Her
Knowledge, as they say, was not acquired like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mens, by the fatigue of Reading and Study, or
the trouble of Thinking, but all was immediately
inspired into her. And indeed it must be owned,
that she consulted Men and Books very little, for she
had both in great contempt; nay, the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
themselves were not considered by her, for she
threw them aside, as unworthy of her study, saying,
<hi>That she could easily write such Books her self.</hi> And yet
after all, there is no great reason to flourish so much
in the commendation of her Knowledge, and sublime
Thoughts; for unless they be solid and true, 'tis not
much matter how she came by them; and besides,
they were suggested by her Conversation with others,
by the Sermons which she heard, by Conferences
with Confessors, Priests, and learned Men. They
had said something, if they had made her to be born
and bred up in an Island by her self, like <hi>ABN YOK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OAN,</hi>
whose History Dr. <hi>Pocock</hi> translates from the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98203:37"/>
               <hi>Arabick;</hi> and as it is fabled of him too, if immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
upon her first coming forth, without instruction,
or the least suggestion from any, she had been able to
speak upon all Points, both common and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
It was visible that the Apostles were Inspired,
when without Education, without being acquainted
with Letters, when after so many years drudgery in
their particular Trades, they were capable to speak all
Languages, to reason with Priests, Scribes and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
about the highest Points of Religion, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the fulfilling of dark Prophecies, and to unfold
the hardest Texts of Scripture. But what wonder is
it, that one of Spirit, and quick Imagination, given
to Contemplation and Retirement, should talk of
things that were the common subject of those she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with, especially when she misses the Mark
as often as she hits it, and runs her self and others into
gross Mistakes.</p>
            <p>This Account they give of <hi>Antonia Bourignon;</hi> and
the magnifying her so much for it, brings to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
two mean Persons, one of them lived
within the first Parish that I had under my charge,
the other border'd upon it. This last could read, and
was a contemplative Person; he did not much value
the World, and follow'd no Trade, except sometimes
to teach the Children of his Neighbours to read; he
had not the opportunity of Books, and yet he stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
the high Points of Predestination, Election,
Free-will, and its consistency with Divine Prescience
and Providence, of the state of departed Souls, and
the manner of their Resurrection; and I have often
been surprized with his Notions. The Metaphysical
Head of Monsieur <hi>Poiret</hi> would have been much
delighted with him; and if he had known him,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98203:38"/>
he had certainly coupled him with <hi>Antonia Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other was a common Weaver by his Trade,
and followed it, who could neither read nor write,
but he had a Head capable of Knowledge, and did
actually know both the Historical and Doctrinal part
of Scripture, and did point out the particular Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Verse where any Passage was, as well as those
who could read; he could give some Account of the
Primitive Church, the Doctrine, Discipline, Heresies
and Councils of the first Centuries, and understood
pretty well the modern Controversies with the <hi>Church
of Rome, Quakers, Anabaptists,</hi> and others, and all
this merely by his careful attention to Sermons, and
by getting some or other to read to him such Books
as he could find, while he was at work for himself
and Family: but which was best in this Man, he was
not vain, nor self-conceited; he did not despise the
Publick Ordinances, nor set himself up above the
Teaching of his lawful Pastors. None was more
ready to receive Instruction; and I have several times
employed him to teach and prepare some of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
especially the Servants and Youth, for their
Publick Examinations, that they might be capable to
receive the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXV"/> The last Reason given for having Madamoiselle <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignon</hi>
in so high esteem, is, The Appearance of a
a <hi>Comet</hi> when she was born, when she first began to
write, and at her death. This I think hardly worth
the considering, for 'twill have but little weight with
Persons of Sense and Judgment. For though I am
far from slighting the Signs, Wonders, and Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Appearances which God is sometimes pleased
to give in those Regions above; yet the Inferences
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98203:38"/>
are not much to be regarded, which fanciful and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Men draw from them, to amuse unthinking
People, and to dispose them to favour their Humour,
Interest and Passions. Eclipses were sometimes as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
as Comets; and though Comets be not yet
so well understood, because they appear seldom; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
some Skilful Astronomers have calculated their
Motions, and reduced them to some System, which like
that of other Planets, may be improv'd by after Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
Comets indeed are Prodigies; that is, they are
prodigious and stupendous Instances of God's Power,
of the Vastness of the Creation, and Extent of the
Universe; But how can they be said to point out
particular Persons and Places? when, like the Sun,
they are seen every where. <hi>Madamoiselle</hi> must be
equal to Jesus Christ in every thing, and because
there was a Star which directed the Wise Men of
the East to his very Door, therefore she must have
a Comet; and I wonder that he did not give this
Reason, why her sign was more visible than his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she was to be the greater and more Publick
Blessing; no doubt the next Edition of her Life will
have it. But the Fool should have remember'd that
'twas not for the Credit of his Adorable Mistriss, to
mention a Comet, or to apply it to her; because all
the Superstitious Observers of Comets, have look'd
upon them as Presages of the Divine Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance:
If therefore these Comets were given for a
sign to <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> they signifie that she is the
Scourge of God, a heavy Judgment to all who follow
her. Which Interpretation is more just and reasonable
than the other; for there cannot be a greater Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than to be given up to Lyes and strong Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which is the Judgment threatned to those who
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98203:39"/>
do not believe the Truth, but have Pleasure in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,
that they may be Damned.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/> Thus I have considered and examined the Reasons
pretended for the high Character of Madamoiselle
<hi>Bourignon,</hi> and have shewed the weakness of them;
and if the Reasons be not sufficient to perswade us,
the Authority of <hi>De Cort, Poiret,</hi> and others, who
have publish'd her History will be found yet of less
avail; for it is evident to all who read them, that
they take but little heed to what they say: Passion
and Fancy do inspire them more than Truth, and
they write not like faithful Historians, but like Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers,
like Flatterers, and those who are brib'd to
make Panegyricks, who study Hyperboles, and the
Art of magnifying every thing. They are far from
the Integrity and Candour of the Holy Apostles and
Evangelists, who propose things plainly without any
Affectation of Language, they write the Naked Truth,
and despise the Artificial Dress of Words, which in
the Judgment of all Wise Men, doth deface rather
than beautifie; they set the Matter simply before us,
and leave the Readers to draw the Consequence, which
is done like Men who neither are deceived, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to deceive. Whereas the other disguise Matters,
being afraid to shew them as they are; they study
the enticing words of Man's Wisdom, and in the
multitude of their words, they lose themselves and
the Truth too, and deceive others with an empty
sound.</p>
            <p>I will give one or two Instances, and let any judge
whether I have not Reason on my side. The First
shall be concerning that Passage of <hi>Madamoiselle,</hi> when
but four Years old, which is very much insisted upon,
<hi>viz.</hi> That then <hi>she ask'd for the Country of Christians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">La Vie Ext. § . 3.</note>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:98203:39"/>
               <hi>and often desired to be carried thither.</hi> I do confess,<note place="margin">La Vie Cont. c. 2.</note>
that if at that Age she understood what she said,
'twas remarkable; 'twas much for a Child to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the contrariety betwixt Christians and the
Religion which they profess; though nothing is more
palpable, and that one may, even in Christendom it
self, ask for a Christian, as well as the Philosopher
at <hi>Athens</hi> did look for a Man at Noon-day, that is,
one who acted wisely and reasonably. But yet even
this is not Matter of much Admiration, when it is
remembred that common Children do often drop
Sayings worthy of the wisest, without being sensible
of the Importance of their own words. This might
have been occasion'd by the Pious Discourses of her
Father and others about her,<note place="margin">See <hi>Light of the World,</hi> Part. 1. p. 7.</note> when they read the New
Testament, which Monsieur <hi>Bourignon</hi> caus'd to be put
into the hands of his Children, notwithstanding that
he was in the Communion of the Roman Church.
However, the Author of her Life shews only his own
vain Humour, when he spends almost a whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon it, and magnifies this above all that was
ever said or written. <q>All Doctors and Teachers,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 16, 17.</note>
yea, all the World ought to be silent, and to hearken
to the Lisping of this Infant; and for my part, I
love better to hear and meditate on these four words,
(<hi>where is the Country of Christians</hi>) than to turn over
all the Volumes of all the Learned of the World.
Millions of Millions of Sermons are not to be
compared to them from which more Light,
more Instruction, more Saving Knowledge, more
Rules for the Conduct of Life, may be drawn,
than from all the most reasonable Opinions and
Speculations, which often do not import much,
and which have not more certainty than the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98203:40"/>
fo the probable Opinions of the <hi>new Saviours
of the World.</hi>
               </q>
               <note place="margin">Noveaux Saveurs de la Terre.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again, The Account of her Chastity, which is set
down in the Second Article of this Narrative is a high
stretch beyond Truth and the common sence of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
for however free <hi>Madamoiselle</hi> might be of
carnal Inclinations after her serious Conversion to
God, yet it is hardly credible that all the while she
followed a vain Conversation, <hi>she</hi> never had <hi>one
Thought unbecoming the Chastity of the purest Virgin
State;</hi> especially when she confesses that she delighted
much in Mens Company. If the Opinion of some
be received, that none are pure Virgins but such as
do not know the distinction of Sexes; <hi>Madamoiselle</hi>
cannot pass for one, for she had as much Philosophy,
I will not say Experience, as to know that, nay, and
the use of these Distinctions too; for sometimes she
talks pretty sensibly of the Pleasure of Conception
and Propagation, that Sin only hinders Women from
having as much Pleasure in the Birth, as now they
have in the Conceiving, and that in the other World
this Pleasure shall not be light and short as at present,
but lasting and perpetual.<note place="margin">La Vie Cont. p. 330.</note> 
               <hi>Antonia</hi> was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
free of Suspition, but I will not accuse her; yet
if she was not guilty of actual Defilements, there
is one Passage which gives occasion to suspect her
Imagination. Take her own account of it, which
is thus: <q>One <hi>Sunday</hi> after Dinner,<note place="margin">La Parole de Dieu, p. 158.</note> being in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
retreat, it was said to me, <hi>Why does thou not
desire Children?</hi> I answered, Children, Lord? give
me Children. Instantly the Pastor (which I suppose
was Monsieur <hi>de Cort</hi>) was strongly imprinted in
my Fancy, as if he had cast himself into my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces.
I was surprized and said, Men, Lord, these
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98203:40"/>
are Men? It was answered, Yes, they are Men.
Upon which, I thought, I conceived five comely
Persons, <hi>P. C. E. L. L.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever may be pleaded for <hi>Madamoiselle</hi> her
self; Monsieur <hi>Poiret,</hi> or whoever it was that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
her Life, strain'd a Figure above all Truth, and
rais'd his Hyperbole to a perfect Falshood, when he
said, <hi>That she sent forth such an Odour of Continence, as
made others forget the Pleasures of the Flesh:</hi> For both
he and she give an Account how that she was several
times assaulted, first at <hi>Blatton,</hi> when she fled from
her Father's House, disguised as a Hermite, where she
was taken up, by some Soldiers, as a suspected Person,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>La Parole, de Dieu,</hi> p. 16. Ib. p. 64.</note>
and where the Officer that commanded them kept
her all night in a Chamber with himself, continually
importuning her to lie with him. Again, In her Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
at the Church of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> near <hi>Lisle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib. p. 77, 78.</note> a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
of the Pastor of that Church made attempts
upon her. And lastly, The famous Monsieur <hi>Saulieu,</hi>
whom at first she took for a great Saint, pursued her
so much, that she was forced to ask the assistance of
others, to be delivered from him.</p>
            <p>Now what regard is to be paid to these Men, who
do so little consider what they write, who contradict
themselves while the Pen is in their Hand, and are so
impudent as to require a Belief, contrary to their
own very Relations. I know no excuse for this, but
that which Monsieur <hi>Poiret</hi> gives on another occasion,
in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his Treatise of the <hi>Oeconomy Divine;</hi>
with which, I suppose, very few will be satisfied:</p>
            <q>
               <p>All Diversity is not Contrariety; often, Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
are only in Appearance, and in the Spirit
of the Readers: but to deal ingenuously, I desire
the Reader not to give himself the trouble, more
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98203:41"/>
than I do, to adjust my Sentiments together, but
but let him search out the Truth independently
from what I have said before. Commonly, when I
write a thing, I do not consider what I have said
else where, but I proceed to discover the Truth anew.
Lying, may be in a thousand ways contrary to it
self: whosoever puts off Falshood, ought to have a
good Memory, and to remember what he has said;
<hi>Mendacem oportet esse memorem:</hi> but as Truth is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
so whosoever follows its course, needs neither
Memory nor Reflection upon what is past.</p>
            </q>
            <p>A most notable way for reconciling Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and for removing the shame of belying one's
self! By Monsieur <hi>Poiret</hi>'s leave, Memory and Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
are very necessary to secure us from wandring
out of the way of Truth; and it is certain, that he
who contradicts himself, as he has often done, does
not tread the paths of Truth: And therefore neither
his Evidence, nor the Evidence of Monsieur <hi>du Cort,</hi>
(who are the Heads of the <hi>Bourignianist Faction</hi>) are
sufficient for receiving <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> as sent of
God, and Divinely Inspired; especially when the same
Monsieur <hi>Poiret</hi> recommends Persons as Divine and
Extraordinary, whom wise and sober Men can have
no esteem for, as particularly <hi>Iacob Behmen,</hi> who is
only to be admired for his wild Notions and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
But why should not <hi>Fowls of a feather fly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?</hi>
