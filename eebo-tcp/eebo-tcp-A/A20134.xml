            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore it was not without cause that Clothiers were then both honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and loued, among whom these nine persons in this Kings dayes were of great credit, viz. <hi>Thomas Cole</hi> of Reading, <hi>Gray</hi> of Gloucester, <hi>Sutton</hi> of Salisburie, <hi>Fitzallen</hi> of Worcester, (commonly called <hi>William</hi> of Worcester) <hi>

Euery one of these kept a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of seruants at worke, spinners, carders, weauers, fullers, diars, shéeremen, and rowers, to the great admiration of all those that came into their houses to behold them.</p>
            <p>Now you shall vnderstand, these gallant Clothiers, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their dwelling places, seperated themselues in thrée se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall companies: <hi>Gray</hi> of Gloucester, <hi>William</hi> of Worcester, and <hi>Thomas</hi> of Reading, because their iorny to London was all one way, they conuerced commonly together. And <hi>Doue</hi> of Exceter, <hi>Sutton</hi> of Salisburie and <hi>Simon</hi> of South-hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, they in like sort kept company the one with the other, meeting euer altogether at Bazingstoke: and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>How King Henry sought the sauour of all his subiects, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Clothiers. Chap. 1.</head>
               <p>THis King <hi>Henry,</hi> who for his great learning and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was called <hi>Beauclarke,</hi> being the third son to the renowned Conqueror: after the death of his brother <hi>William Rufus,</hi> tooke vpon him the gouernment of this land, in the absence of his second brother <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of Normandy, who at this time was at warres against the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and was chosen King of Ierusalem, the which he, for the loue he bare to his owne country, refused<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour returned from the holy Land; of whose comming when King <hi>Henry</hi> vnderstood, knowing he would make clayme to the crowne, sought by all meanes possible to winne the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of his Nobility &amp; to get the fauor of the Commons by cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie:
<pb facs="tcp:5607:3"/>
for the obtaining whereof hee did them many fauours thereby the better to strengthen himselfe against his brother.</p>
               <p>It chaunced on a time, as he, with one of his sonnes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his Nobilitie, rode from London towards Wales, to appease the fury of the Welshmen, which then began to raise themselues in armes against his authority, that he met with a great number of Waine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> loaden with cloth, comming to London; and séeing them still driue on one after another so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny together, demaunded whose they were: the Waine-men answered in this sort: <hi>Coles</hi> of Reading (quoth they.) Then by and by the King asked an other, saying: Whose cloth is all this? Old <hi>Coles</hi> (quoth he:) and againe anone after he asked the same question to other, and still they answered, Old <hi>Coles.</hi> And it is to be remembred, that the King met them in such a place, so narrow and streight, that he with all the rest of his traine, were faine to stand vp close to the hedge, whilest the carts passed by, the which at that time being in number aboue two hundred, was néere hand an houre ere the King could get roome to be gone: so that by his long stay, he beganne to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, although the admiration of that sight did much quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his furi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The fellow séeing the king (in asking that question) to bend his browes, though he knew not what he was, yet being abasht, he answered thus: Why sir; if you be angry, no body can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you; for possible sir, you haue Anger at commandement. The king séeing him in vttering of his words to quiuer and quake, laughed heartily at him, as well in respect of his simple answere, as at his feare: and so soone after the last waine went by, which gaue present passage vnto him and his Nobles: and thereupon entring into communication of the commoditie of clothing, the king gaue order at his home returne, to haue Old <hi>Cole</hi> brought before his Maiestie, to the intent he might haue conference with him, noting him to be a subiect of great

ability. But by that time he came within a mile of Stanes, he met an other company of waines in like sort laden with cloth, whereby the King was driuen into a further admiration: and demanding whose they were, answer was made in this sort: They be goodman <hi>Suttons</hi> of Salisbury, good sir: and by that time a score of them were past, he asked againe, saying: whose are these? <hi>Suttons</hi> of Salisbury (quoth they) and so still, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the King askes that question, they answerd, <hi>Suttons</hi> of Salisbury. God send me many such <hi>Suttons,</hi> said the king. And thus the farther hee trauelled westward, more waines and more he met continually: vpon which occasion he said to his Nobles. That it would neuer grieue a King to die for the defence of a fertile countrie and faithfull subiects. I alwayes thought (quoth he) that Englands valour was more than her wealth, yet now I see her wealth sufficient to maintaine her valour, which I will seek to cherish in all I may, and with my Sword keepe my selfe in possession of that I haue. Kings and Louers can brooke no partners, and therefore let my brother <hi>Robert</hi> thinke, that although hee was heyre to England by birth, yet I am King by possession. All his fauourers I must account my foes, and will serue them as I did the vngratefull earle of Shrewsbury, whose lands I haue seized, and banisht his body. But now we will leaue the King to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:5607:4"/>
asked them if they had not heard of the Erle of <hi>Moraigne</hi> his escape out of the land: what is he fled quoth Gray? I muse much of that matter, being in such great regard with the king as he was: but I pray you, do you not know the cause of his going quoth, Cole? The common report, quoth Gray, is this that the couetous erle, who through a greedy desire, neuer left begging of the King for one thing or other, and his request be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now denied him, of méere obstinacie and wilfull froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, hath banished himselfe out of the land, and quite forsaken the Countrey of Cornewall, hauing made a vow neuer to set foote within England againe, and as report goeth, he with the late banisht Earle of Shrowsbury, haue ioyned themselues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Robert duke of Normandy, against the king, the which action of theirs hath inflamed the kings wrath, that their Ladies with their children are quite turned out of doores succorlesse &amp; friendlesse, so that as it is told me, they wander vp and downe the countrie like forlorne people, and although many do pittie them, yet few do releeue them.</p>

No verily said Margaret, but I would be right glad to learne to do any thing whatsoeuer it be.

                  </gap>hither to store her selfe of diuers commodities and when shee had boght what she would, she told her neighbor she had great néed of a maid seruant or twaine: therefore qd she, good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor go with me and let me haue your opinion. With a good wil, said her neighbor, and together they went, and looking and viewing the maidens ouer, she tooke speciall notice of Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. Beléeue me, quoth she, there stands a very proper may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and one of a modest and comely countenaunce. Uerily, said her neighbor, so she is, as euer I looked vpon.</p>
               <p>The mayden séeing them to view her so well, was so aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that a scarlet colour ouerspred her lilly chéeks; which the woman perceiuing, came vnto her, and asked if she were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to serue. The mayd with a low curtesie, and a most gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle speach, aunswered it was the onely cause of her comming. Can you spinne or card, said goodwife <hi>Gray?</hi> Truely Dame, said she, though my cunning therein be but small, my goodwil to learne is great, and I trust, my diligence shall content you. What wages will you take, quoth good wife <hi>Gray?</hi> I will referre that, said Margaret, to your conscience and curtesie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring no more than what I shall deserue. Then asking what country woman she was the maiden wept, saying, Ah good Dame, I was vntimely borne in Shropshire, of poore parents, and yet not so néedy as vnfortunate, but death hauing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their sorrowes, hath left me to the cruelty of these enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons times, to finish my parents tragedy with my troubles. What maiden! qd her Dame, haue you a care to do your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, and to liue in Gods feare, and you shall haue no care to regard Fortunes frownes and so they went home together.</p>
               <p>Now, so soone as the goodman sawe her, he asked his wife where she had that maiden She said, at the faire. Why then quoth he thou hast brought all the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Woman I meane this, that she will proue a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, to draw the harts of al my men after her, and so we shal haue wise seruice done of all sides. Then said his wife, I hope
<pb facs="tcp:5607:10"/>
husband, Margaret will haue a better care both to her owne credit, and our commodity then so, and let me alone to looks to such matters. Is thy name Margaret (quoth her master?) proper is thy name to thy person, for thou art a pearle indeed, orient, and rich in beauty.</p>
               <p>His wife hearing him say so, began to change her opinion: What husband (quoth she) is the wind at that doore? Begin you to like your maid so well? I doubt I had most need to look to your selfe: before God, I had rather then an angell I had chosen some other: but heare you mayd you shall pack hence, I will not nourish a snake in my bosome, and therefore get you gone, I will none of you prouide a seruice where you may.</p>
               <p>The mayden hearing her say so, fell downe on her knees, &amp; besought her saying. O sweet dame, be not so cruell to mee, to turne me out of doores now: alas, I know not where to go, or what to do, if you forsake me. O let not the fading beauty of my face dispoyle me of your fauor: for rather then that shall hinder my seruice, this my knife shall soone dissigure my face, and I will banish beauty as my greatest enemy. And with that her abundant teares stopped her spéech, that she could not utter one word more.</p>
               <p>The woman seeing this could not harbour anger longer, nor could her master stay in the roonie for weeping? Well <hi>Margaret,</hi> sayd her dame (little knowing that a Lady knéeled before her) vsing thy selfe well, I will keepe thee and thou shalt haue my good will, if thou gouerne thy selfe with wisdom; and so she sent her about her businesse. Her husband comming to supper sayd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it is to be vnderstood, that <hi>Gray</hi> did neuer eate his meate alone but still had some of his neighbors with him before whom he called his mayd, saying, <hi>Margaret,</hi> come hither. Now because there was another of the same

               <head>How the Kings maiestie sent for the Clothiers, and of the sundry fauours which he did them. Chap. 4.</head>
               <p>KIng <hi>Henry</hi> prouiding for his voyage into France, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst King <hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of Normandy his owne brother, commited the gouernement of the Realme in his absence, to the Bishop of Salisbury, a man of great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and learning, whom the King estéemed highly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he thought good to send for the chiefe Clothiers of England who according to the kings appoyntment came to the court, and hauing licence to come before his Maiesty, hee spake to this effect.</p>
               <p>The strength of a king is the loue and friendship of his people, and he gouerns ouer his Realme most surely, that ruleth iustice with mercy, for hee ought to feare many, whom many do feare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore the gouernours of the common wealth ought to obserue two speciall precepts, the one is, that they so maintayne the profit of the commons, that whatsoeuer in their calling they do, they referre it thereunto: the other, that they bee alwayes as well carefull ouer the whole common wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th, as ouer any part thereof, lest while they vpholde the one, the other be brought to vtter decay.</p>
               <p>And for as much as I doe vnderstand, and haue partly seene, that you the Clothiers of England are no small benefit to the wealth publike, I thought it good to know from your owne mouths, if there be any thing not yet graunted that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit you or any other thing to be remoued that doth hurt you.</p>
               <p>The great desire I haue to maintayne you in your trades, hath moued me hereunto. Therefore boldly say what you would haue in the one thing or the other, &amp; I wlil grant it you.</p>
               <p>With that, they all fell downe vpon their knees, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired God to saue his Maiesty, and with all, requested three dayes respit to put in their answere: which was graunted, And thereupon they departed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5607:11"/>When the Clothiers had well considered of these matters, at length they thought méete to request of his Maiesty for their first benefit, that all the Cloth measures, through the land might be of one length, whereas to their great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage before, euery good towne had a seuerall measure, the difficulty thereof was such, that they could not kéepe them in memory, nor know how to keepe their reckonings. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing whereof they found themselues greeued, was this, that the people would not take crackt money, though it were neuer so good siluer: whereupon it came to passe, that the Clothiers and diuers other receiuing great summes of money, to take among it much crackt money, it serued them to no vse, because it would not go currant, but lay vpon their hands without profite or benefit, whereof they prayed refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The third was a griefe, whereof <hi>Hodgekins</hi> of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyfax complayned, and that was, that whereas the towne of Halyfax liued altogether vpon clothing, and by the reason of false borderers &amp; other euill minded persons, they were oft robbed, and had their clothes carried out of their fieldes, where they were drying, that it would please his Maiesty to grant the towne this priuiledge, that whosoeuer hee was that was taken stealing their cloth, might presently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further triall be hanged vp. When the day of their appearance approached, the Clothiers came before the King, and deliuered vp their petition in writing, which his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty most graciously perusing, sayd, he was ready to fullfill their request: and therefore for the first poynt of their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he called for a staffe to be brought him, and measuring thereupon the iust length of his owne arme, deliuered it to the clothiers, saying, This measure shalbe called a yard, and no other measure thoughout all the Realme of England shall be vsed for the same, and by this shall men buy and sell, and we will so prouide, that whosoeuer he be that abuseth our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects by any false measure, that he shall not onely pay a fine for the same to the king, but also haue his body punnished by imprisonment. And as concerning the second poynt of your petition, because of my sudden departure out of the land, I
<pb facs="tcp:5607:11"/>
know not better how to ease you of this griefe (of crackt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) this decrée I make, because they account crackt money not currant I say, none shalbe currant but crackt money. And therefore I will giue present charge, that all the money through the land shalbe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But now for your last request for the towne of Halyfax, where by théeues your clothes are so often stolne from you, séeing the lawes already prouided in that case are not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to keepe men in awe, it is indeed high time to haue shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per punishment for them.</p>
               <p>With that <hi>Hodgekins</hi> vnmannerly interrupted the King, saying in broad Northern spéech, Yea gude faith, mai Liedge, the faule eule of mai saule, gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The king smiling to heare this rough hewne fellow make this reply: Content thee <hi>Hodgekins,</hi> for we wil haue redresse for all: and albeit that hanging of men was neuer séene in England, yet seeing the corrupt world is growne more bold in all wickednes, I thinke it not amisse to ordaine this death for such malefactors: and peculiarly to the towne of Hallifaxe I giue this priuiledge, that whosoeuer they find stealing their cloth, being taken with the goods, that without further iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they shalbe hanged vp.</p>
               <p>Thus (sayd our king) haue I graunted what you request, and if heareafter you find any other thing that may be good for you, it shall be granted; for no longer would I desire to liue among you, then I haue care for the good of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: at which word ended, the King rose from his royall throne, while the clothiers on their knées prayed for both his health and happy successe, and shewed themselues most thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for his highnesse fauor. His maiesty bending his body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, sayd that at his home returne, he would (by the grace of God) visit them.</p>

Euen by and by, husband (quoth she) the meat will be ready. Presently after comes in <hi>Hodgekins</hi> and <hi>Martin,</hi> who strayght asked for <hi>Cutbert</hi> of Kendall. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere was made, that he was in his Chamber. So when they had called him, they went to dinner: then they requested that their host and hostesse would sit with them.</p>
               <p>Husband, said she, you may go if you please: but as for me, I
<pb facs="tcp:5607:13"/>
will desire pardon. Nay, good wife, go vp said her husband. What woman, you must beare with your ghests. Why hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, qd. she, do you think that any can beare the flerts &amp; trumps which that Northern tike gaue me the last time hee was in towne? now God forgiue me, I had as liefe sée the diuell as sée him: Therefore good husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> go vp your selfe, and let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, for in faith, I shall neuer abide that Iacke while I liue.</p>
               <p>Upon these words away went her husband, and though he sayd little he thought the more. Now when he came vp, his ghests bade him welcome. I pray you sit downe, good mine hoast, quoth they, where is your wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what will not shee sit with vs? No verily sayd he, the foolish woman hath taken such a displeasure against <hi>Cutbert,</hi> that she sweares she will neuer come in his company Is it so, said the other? then trust me we are well agreed. And I sweare by my fathers sale, quoth hée, that were it not more for good will o you, than loue to her, I would neuer come to your house more. I beléeue it well, said old <hi>Bosome.</hi> And so with other communication they droue out the time, till Dinner was ended.</p>
               <p>After they were risen, <hi>Martin</hi> &amp; <hi>Hodgekins</hi> got them forth about their affaires, but <hi>Cutb.</hi> took his host by the hand, saying, My host, Ile go talk with your wife; for my part I thought we had béene friends: but seeing her stomacke is so big &amp; her heart so great, I will see what she will say to me; and with that hee s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

he sayd: Tis pitty my host, that your aged yéeres that loues quietnesse, should be troubled with such a scolding queane. I, God help me God helpe me quoth the old man; and so went toward the Stable; which his wife watching, sodainly stept out and gaue <hi>Cutbert</hi> a kisse.</p>
               <p>Within an houre after, the old man craftily called for his Nag to ride to field: but as soone as he was gone, <hi>Cutbert</hi> and his Hostesse were such good friends, that they got into one of the Ware houses, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ockt the doore to them: but her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hauing set a spye for the purpose, sodainly turned backe, and called for a capcase which lay in the Warehouse. The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant could not find the key by any meanes. Whereupon hée called to haue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lock broke open. Which they within hearing, opened the doore of their owne accord. So soone as her husband spied her in that place, with admiration he sayd O, the passion of my hart, what do you heer? what you two that cannot abide one another? what make you so close together? is your chiding and rayling, brabling and brawling, come to this? O what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblers are these! Why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my hoast qd. <hi>Cutbert</hi> what need you take the matter so hotte? I gaue a Cheese to my country man <hi>Hodgekins,</hi> to lay vp, and deliuered it to your wife to bee kept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then is it not reason, that she should come and seeke me my Cheese? O, qd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the old man, belike the doore was lockt, because the cheese should not run away. The doore said his wife vnknowne to vs clapt to it selfe, and hauing a spring lock, was presently fast. Wel, hus-wife, qd. he; I will giue you as much credit as a Crocadile; but as for your companion I will teach him to come hither to looke cheeses.</p>
               <p>And with that he caused his men to take him presently, and to binde him hand and foote. Which being done, they drew him vp in a basket into the smokie louer of the hall, and there they did let him hang all that night, euen till the next day dinner time, when he should haue beene at the banquet with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for neither <hi>Hodgekins</hi> nor <hi>Martin</hi> could intreat their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed hoast to let him downe.</p>
               <p>And in such a heate was he driuen with drawing him vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was faine to cast off his gownes, his coats, and two

               <p>The yong princes hauing giuen promise to be with the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers kept their houre, but when al the rest went to giue them entertainment, <hi>Simon</hi> was so busie in supping his pottage, that he could not spare so much time. Which when the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces sawe, with a smiling countenance they said, Sup <hi>Simon,</hi> theres good breath, or else beshrew our hostesse: quoth he, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer looking behind him to sée who spake, till the prince clapt him on the shoulder. But good Lord, how blanke he was when he spied them knowing not how to excuse the matter.</p>
               <p>Well, the princes hauing ended their banket, <hi>Garrat</hi> coms, and with one of his hands took the table of 16 foot long quite from the ground ouer their heads, from before the princes, and set it on the other side of the hall, to the great admiration of all them that beheld it.</p>
               <p>The princes being then ready to depart, the Clothiers mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them in pleasant maner, to be good to one of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that did neither sit, lie, nor stand. Then he must néedes hang, qd the princes. And so he doth, most excellent princes qd they; and therewithal told them the whole matter. When they heard the story, downe to <hi>Bosoms</hi> inne they goe, where looking vp into the roose, spied poore <hi>Cutbert</hi> pinned vp in a basket, and almost smoked to death, who although he were greatly ashamed, yet most pittifully desired that they would get him released.</p>
               <p>What is his trespasse, said the prince? Nothing if it shall like your Grace qd he, but for loking for a cheefe. But he could not find it without my wife, said the good man: the villaine had lately dined with mutton, and could not digest his meate without cheese, for which cause I haue made him to fast these twenty houres, to the end he may haue a better stomacke to eate his dinner, then to vse dalliance.</p>
               <p>Let me intreate you quoth the prince, to release him: and if

               <p>THe Clothiers being all come from London, <hi>Suttons</hi> wife of Southhampton who was with her husband very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and pleasant, brake her mind vnto him in this sort.</p>
               <p>Good Lord husband, wil you neuer be so kind as let me go to London with you? shall I be pend vp in South-hampton, like a patrat in a cage, or a capon in a coope? I would request no more of you in lieu of all my paines, carke and care, but to haue one weeks time to sée that faire citie: what is this life if it be not mixt with some delight? and what delight is more pleasing than to see the fashions and maners of vnknowne pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Therefore good husband, if thou louest me, deny not this simple request You know I am no common gadder, nor haue oft troubled you with trauell. God knowes, this may be the last thing that euer I shall request at your hands.</p>
               <p>Woman quoth he, I would willingly satisfie your desire, but you know it is not conuenient for both of vs to be abroad, our charge is great, and therefore our care ought not to be small. If you will goe your selfe, one of my men shall goe with you, and money enough you shall haue in your purse: but to go with you my selfe, you sée my busines will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me.</p>

               <p>When the Marchants of London vnderstood they were in towne, they ira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ited them euery day home to their owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, where they had delicate good cheere: and when they went abroade to see the commodityes of the City, the Marchants wiues euer bore them company, being attyred most dainty and fine: which when the Clothiers wiues did sée, it grieued their hearts they had not the like.</p>
               <p>Now when they were brought into Cheapeside, there with great wonder they beheld the shops of the Goldsmiths; and on the other side, the wealthy Mercers, whose shops shined of al sortes of coloured silkes; in Watlingstreete, they viewed the great number of Drapers in Saint Martines, Shooma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, at Saint Nicholas church, the flesh shambles, at the end of the old change, the fishmongers; in Candlewéeke stréete the Weauers, then came into the Iewes stréete, where all the Iewes did inhabite; then went they to Blackwel hall, where the country clothiers did vse to méete.</p>
               <p>Afterward they procéeded, and came to S. Pauls church, whose steeple was so hye, that it seemed to pierce the clouds, on the top whereof, was a great and mighty whethercocke, of cleane siluer, the which notwithstanding seemed as small as a sparrow to mens eyes, it stood so exceeding high, the which
<pb facs="tcp:5607:16"/>
goodly weathercocke was afterwards stolen away, by a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cripple, who found meanes one night to climbe vp to the toppe of the stéeple, and tooke it downe, with the which, and a great summe of mony which he had got together by begging in his life tune, he builded a gate on the North-west side of the city, which to this day is called Criple gate.</p>
               <p>From thence they went to the Tower of London, which was builded by <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who was Emperour of Rome. And there they beheld salt and wine, which had laine there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer since the Romans inuaded this land, which was many yeares before our Sauiour Christ was borne, the wine was growne so thicke that it might haue bin cut like a ielley. And in that place also they sawe money that was made of leather, which in ancient time went currant amongst the people.</p>
               <p>When they had to their great contentation beheld all this, they repaired to their lodgings, hauing also a sumptuous sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ordained for them, with all delight that might be. And you shall vnderstand that when the country weauers, which came vp with their dames, saw the weauers of Candlewike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stréet, they had great desire presently to haue some conference with them, and thus one began to challenge thother for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, quoth <hi>VVeasell,</hi> ile worke with any of you all for a crowne, take it if you dare, and he that makes his yeard of cloth soonest, shall haue it. You shall be wrought withall, said the other, and if it were for tenne crownes; but we wil make this bargaine, that each of vs shall wynde their owne quilles. Content quoth <hi>VVeasell:</hi> and so to worke they went, but <hi>VVesel</hi> lost. Whereupon another of them tooke the matter in hand, who lost likewise: so that the London weauers trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed against the country, casting forth diuers frumps.</p>
               <p>Alas poore fellowes, quoth they, your hearts are good, but your hands are ill. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Cutbert</hi> hearing this, being cholericke of nature, chafed like a man of law at the barre, and he wagers with them foure
<pb facs="tcp:5607:16"/>
crowns to twain, the others agreed, to work they go: but erab conquered them all. Whereupon, the London weauers were nipt in the head like birds, and had not a word to say.</p>
               <p>Now saith <hi>Crab</hi> as we haue lost nothing, so you haue won nothing, and because I know, ye cannot be right weauers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you be good fellowes, therefore if you will go with vs, wee will bestow the ale vpon you. That is spoken like a good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and like a weauer, quoth the other. So along they went as it were to the signe of the red Crosse.</p>
               <p>When they were set downe, and had drunk well, they began merrily to prattle, and to ertoll <hi>Crab</hi> to the skies.

home, their husbands had no little to do: Especially <hi>Simon,</hi> whose wife daily lay at him for London apparell, to whome he sayd, Good woman, be content, let vs go according to our place and ability: what will the Bailiffes thinke, if I should prancke thee vp like a Peacocke, and thou in thy attire surpasse their wiues? they would eyther thinke I were madde, or else that I had more money then I could well vse: consider I pray thée good wife, that such as are in their youth wasters, doe prooue in their age starke beggars.</p>

You may then thinke, wife (quoth he) she got them not with idlenesse.</p>
               <p>But wife, you must consider what London is, the chiefe and capitall City of all the land, a place on the which all strangers cast their eyes, it is (wife) the Kings chamber, and his Maiesties royall seate: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And in the morning when she should rise, the good soule fell downe in a swowne, which put her maidens in a great flight, who running downe to their master cried out, Alas, alas, our Dame is dead, our Dame is dead.

               <p>Which <hi>Roger</hi> Bishop of Salisbury, who gouerned the realme in the Kings absence, did alwayes certifie the King thereof, with his letters written in their commendations.</p>
               <p>And afterward it came to passe, that God sent his Highnes victory ouer his enemies, and hauing taken his brother priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, brought him most ioyfully with him into England, and appointed him to be kept in Cardife castle prisoner, yet with this fauour, that he might hunt and hawke where he would vp and downe the countrey, and in this sort he liued a good while, of whom we will speake more at large hereafter.</p>
               <p>The King being thus come home, after his winters rest, he made his summers progresse into the west country, to take a view of al the chiefe townes: whereof the Clothiers being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, they made great preparation against his comming, because he had promised to visite them all.</p>
               <p>And when his Grace came to Reading, he was entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and receiued with great ioy and triumph: <hi>Thomas Cole</hi> being the chiefe man of regard in all the towne, the king ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored his house with his princely presence, where during the kings abode, he, and his son, and nobles were highly feasted.</p>
               <p>Where the king beheld the great number of people, that was by that one man maintained in worke, whose harty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and loue toward his maiestie did well appeere, aswell by their outward countenances, as their gifts presented vnto him. But of <hi>Cole</hi> himselfe the king was so well persuaded, that he committed much trust to him, and put him in great authoritie in the towne. Furthermore the king said, That for the loue which those people bore to him liuing, that he would lay his bones among them when he was dead. For I know not said he where they may be better bestowed, till the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed day of resurrection, than among these my friends which are like to be happy partakers of the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5607:20"/>Whereupon his Maiesty caused there to be builded a most goodly and famous Abbey: in which he might shew his deue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, by increasing his seruice, and leaue example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his successors to doe the like. Likewise within the towne he after builded a faire and goodly castle, in the which he often kept his court, which was a place of his chiefe residence du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life saying to the Clothiers, that séeing he found them such faithfull subiects, he would be their neighbor, and dwell among them.</p>
               <p>After his Maiesties royal feasting at Reading, he procéeded in progresse, til he had visited the whole west countries, being wondrously delighted, to sée those people so diligent to applie their busines: and conuning to Salisbury, the Bishop recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his Maiesty with great ioy, and with triumph attended on his Grace to his palace, where his Highnes lodged.</p>
               <p>There <hi>Sutton</hi> the Clothier presented his Highnesse with a broad cloth, of so fine a thréed, and excéeding good workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ship, and therewithall of so faire a colour, as his Grace gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation thereof, and as it is said, he held it in such high esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that therof he made his parliament robes, and the first parliament that euer was in England, was graced with the Kings person in those robes, in requitall whereof his highnes afterward yielded <hi>Sutton</hi> many princely fauours.</p>
               <p>And it is to be remembred, that <hi>Simon</hi> of Southhampton (séeing the King had ouerpast the place where he dwelt) came with his wife and seruants to Salisbury, and against the K. going forth of that city, he caused a most pleasant arbour to be made vpon the toppe of the hill leading to Shaftesburie, beset all with red and white roses, in such sort, that not anie part of the timber could be séene, within the which sate a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den attired like a Quéene, attended on by a faire traine of mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, who at the kings approach presented him with a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of sweet stoures, yielding him such honour as the Ladies of Rome were wont to doe to their Princes after their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: which the King tooke in gracious part, and for his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well from that country, they bore him company ouer part of the Plaine, with the sound of diuers swéet instruments of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke.
<pb facs="tcp:5607:20"/>
All which when his Grace vnderstood was done at the cost of a Clothier, he sayd he was the most honoured by those me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aboue al the mean subiects in his la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: &amp; so his highnes past on to Exceter, hauing giuen great rewards to these maydens.</p>

                  <hi>Thomas Doue</hi> and the residue of the Clothiers, against his Graces comming thither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had ordained diuers sumptuous shewes; first, there was one that represented the person of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus Caesar</hi> the Emperour, who commanded after the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuasion, that their City should be called <hi>Augustus,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne name, which beforetime was called Isea, and of latter yéeres, Exeter.</p>
               <p>There his Maiesty was royally feasted seuen daies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the onely cost of Clothiers, but the diuers delightes and sundry pastimes which they made there before the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Nobles, is too long here to be rehearsed. And therefore I will ouerpasse them, to auoide tediousnes.</p>
               <p>His grace then coasting along the country, at last came to Gloucester, an ancient City, which was builded by <hi>Glove</hi> a Brittish King, who named it after his own name, Gloucester. Here was his maiesty entertained by <hi>Gray</hi> the Clothier, who profest himselfe to be of that ancient family of <hi>Grayes,</hi> whose first Originall issued out of the ancient and honorable Castle and towne of Rithin.</p>
               <p>Héere was the King most bountifully feasted, hauing in his company his brother <hi>Robert</hi> (although his prisoner the same time.) And his Grace being desirous to see the maidens carde and spinne, they were of purpose set to their worke, among whom was faire Margaret with the white hand, whose excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty hauing pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now when his Grace was come from thence, he went to

Worcester, where <hi>William Fitz-allen</hi> made preparation in all honourable sort to receiue him, which man being borne of great parentage, was not to learne how to entertaine his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, being descended of that famous family, whose patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lay about the towne of Oswestry. which towne his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors had inclosed with stately walles of stone,</p>
               <p>Although aduerse fortune had so grieuously frowned on some of them, that thier children were faine to become trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whose hands were to them instead of landes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing God raised againe the fame of this man, both by his great wealth and also in his posterity, whose eldest son <hi>Henry,</hi> the Kings god-son, became afterward the Mayor of London, who was the first Mayor that euer was in that Citty, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the same 23. yéeres: and then his son <hi>Roger Fitz-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> was the second Mayor.</p>
               <p>The Princely pleasures that in Worcester were shewen the king, were many and maruelous, and in no place had his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty receiued more delight then here; for the which at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture he did shew himselfe very thankfull.

               <p>And thus from one to another, the office of the Hangman was poasted off. At last a Rogue came by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom they would haue compelled to haue done that deed.

               <p>When <hi>Wallis</hi> saw the matter brought to this passe, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan stoutly to reply, saying, My masters of the towne of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax,</hi> though your priuiledge stretch to hang vp men present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that are found stealing your goods, yet it giues you no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to imprison them till you prouide them a hangman, my selfe with these my fellowes haue here yéelded our selues to satisfie the Law, and if it be not performed, the fault is yours and not ours, and therefore we humbly take our leaue: from the gallowes the xviij of August. And with that he leapt from the ladder, and cast the halter at <hi>Hodgekins</hi> face.</p>
               <p>When the Clothiers saw this, they knew not what to say, but taking them by the sléeues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> intreated to haue their owne againe. Not so qd <hi>VVallis,</hi> you get not the valew of a plack or a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When <hi>Hodgekins</hi> saw, that notwithstanding their thée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, how they flowted at their lenity, he was much moued in mind: and as he stood in his dumps, chewing his cud, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his dinner with a dish of melancholy, a grey Frier reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently saluted him in this sort: All haile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> goodman <hi>Hodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> happinesse and health be euer with you, and to all sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors of lewd liuers, God send euerlasting ioyes.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Hogekins</hi> heard this he was somewhat comforted in mind, and sayd to the Frier, that if by his cunning he would performe it he would once againe make suite to the King to haue his grant for the same. The Frier willed him to haue no doubt in him: and so when he had deuised it, he got a Carpenter to frame it out of hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hodgekins</hi> in the meane time posted vp to the Court, and told his Maiesty that the priuiledge of Halifax was not worth a pudding Why so, sayd our King?

               <p>It came to passe, as I sayd before, that two of their officers, by arresting of a man, were at one instant slaine, by meanes whereof the Bayliffes were inforced to seeke others to put in their roomes, but by no means could they get any, wherefore according to their wonted maner, they made proclamation, that if there were any man that would present himself before them, he should not onely be settled in that office during their liues, but also should haue such maintenance and allowance, as for such men was by the City prouided: and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that it was an office most necessary in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, yet did the poorest wretch despise it, that liued in any estimation among his neighbours.</p>
               <p>At last a couple of Flemings, which were fled into this land, by reason that their country was drownd with the sea, hearing the proclamation, offered themselues vnto the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffes, to serue in this place, who were presently receiued and accepted, &amp; according to order had garments giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which were of ij. colors, blue &amp; red, their coats, breeches &amp; stockings, whereby they were known and discerned from other men.</p>

               <p>The catchpole thinking he had killed the man, he left his Mace behind him and ranne away: the creditor hee ran after him calling and crying that he should turne againe: But the Fleming would not by any means come backe, but got him quite out of the city, and took sanctuary at Westminster.</p>

                  <hi>Doue</hi> being dismayd at this mischieuous chance, knew not what to do: at last he requested the catchpole that hee would not violently cast him in prison, but stay till such time as he could send for a friend to be his surety; and although kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in a catchpole be rare, yet was he won with faire words to do him this fauor: whereupon <hi>Doue</hi> desired one to goe to his host <hi>Iarrat,</hi> who immediatly came vnto him and offred himselfe to be <hi>Doues</hi> surely.</p>

               <p>The Duke at these words made this reply, that if she consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, she should not dread any danger.

               <p>The mayden hearing this, who with many other words was long wooed, at last consented; where yeelding to him her heart with her hand, he departed, appointing to certifie her from Cardiffe Castle what determination he would-follow: so taking his leaue of <hi>Gray,</hi> he went to his brothers, and with them posted to Cardiffe.</p>

If I be thy friend, who da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth be thy foe? and what is he that will once call thy name in question for any thing? therefore swéet gerle, be better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised, and refuse not my offer being so large.</p>

Hereupon it is certaine, that the knight was driuen into such a conceit, as none could perswade him but his nose was so great indeed; his Lady, or any other that spake to the contrarie, he would say they were flatterers, and that they lied, insomuch that he would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to strike some of them that commended or spake well of his nose. If they were men of worship or any other that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him in his opinion, he would sweare they flowted him, and be ready to challenge them the field. He became so asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of himselfe, that after that day he wold neuer go abroud, whereby <hi>Margaret</hi> was well rid of his company.</p>
               <p>On a time, a wise and graue gentleman seeing him groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his conceit so strongly, gaue his Lady counsell, not to contrary him therein but rather say that she would séeke out some cunning Phisition to cure him: for, said he, as sir <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> hath taken this conceit of himselfe, so is he like neuer to beare other opinion, till his owne conceit doth remoue it, the which must be wisely wrought to bring it to passe.</p>

               <p>Alas sir quoth she I spake it (God wot) because you should not grieue at it, nor take my words in ill part, neither did it indeed become me to mislike of your nose.</p>
               <p>All this we will quickly remedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> said the phisitian, haue no doubt: and with that, he very orderly prickt him in the nose, but not in any veine whereby he might bleed: and presently hauing a tricke finely to vnstop the quill, the blood ranne into abason in great abundance: and when the bladder was emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the bason almost full the Phisition seemed to close the veine, and asked him how he felt his nose, shewing the great quantitie of filthy blood which from thence he had taken.</p>

               <head>How Thomas of Reading was murdred at his hoasts house of Colebrooke, who also had murdred many before him, how their wickednes was at length reuealed. Cha. 11.</head>
               <p>THomas of Reading hauing many occasions to come to London, as wel about his owne affairs, as also the kings businesse, being in a great office vnder his Maiesty, it chanced on a time, that his host and hostesse of Colebrook, who through couetousnes had murdred many of their ghests, and hauing euery time he came thither great store of his money to lay vp, appointed him to be the next fat pig that should be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: For it is to be vnderstood, that when they plotted the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of any man, this was alwayes their terme, the man to his wife &amp; the woman to her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, Wife, there is now a fat pig to be had, if you want one. Whereupon she would answere thus, I pray you put him in the hogstie till to morrow. This was, when any man came thither alone without others in his company, and they saw he had great store of money.</p>
               <p>This man should be then laid in the chamber right ouer the kitchin, which was a faire chamber, and better set out then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other in the house; the best bedsted therein, though it were little and low, yet was it most cunningly carued, and faire to the eye: the feet whereof were fast naild to the chamber floore, in such sort, that it could not in any wise fall, the bed that lay therein was fast sowed to the sides of the bedsted: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that part of the chamber whereupon this bed and bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéed
<pb facs="tcp:5607:28"/>
stoode, was made in such sort that by the pulling out of two yron pinnes below in the kitchin, it was to be let downe and taken vp by a draw bridge, or in maner of a trappe doore: moreouer in the kitchin, directly vnder the place where this should fall: was a mighty great caldron, wherein they vsed to séethe their liquor when they went to brewing. Now, the men appointed for the slaughter, were laid into this bed and in the dead time of the night when they were sound a sléepe hy pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out the fore said iron pinns, downe would the man fall out of his bed into the boyling caldron, and all the cloathes that were vpon him: where being suddenly scalded and drowned, he was neuer able to cry or speak one word.</p>
               <p>Then had they a little ladder euer standing ready in the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, by the which they presently mounted into the sayd cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and there closely tooke away the mans apparell, as also his money, in his male or capcase: and then lifting vp the sayd fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling floore which hung by hinges, they made it fast as before.</p>
               <p>The dead body would they take presently out of the Caldron and throw it down the riuer, which ran néere vnto their house, whereby they escaped all danger.</p>
               <p>Now if in the morning any of the rest of the ghests that had talkt with the murthered man ouer eue, chanst to aske for him, as hauing occasion to ride the same way that hée should haue done, the goodman would answere, that he took: horse a good while before day, and that he himselfe did set him forward: the horse the goodman would also take out of the stable, &amp; conuay him to a hay-barne of his, that stood from his house a mile or two, whereof himselfe did alwaies keepe the keies full charily, and when any hay was to be brought from thence, with his owne hands he would deliuer it: then, before the horse should go from thence, he would dismarke him: as it he ware a long taile, he would make him curtall, or else crop his eares, or cut his maine, or put out one of his eyes; and by this meanes he kept himselfe a long time vnknowne.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Thomas</hi> of Reading as I sayd before, being markt, and kept for a fat pig, he was laied in the same chamber of death but by reason <hi>Gray</hi> of Gloucester chaunst also to come that: night, he escaped scalding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5607:29"/>The next time he came, he was laid there againe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fell asléepe, or was warme in his bed, one came riding through the towne, and cried piteously, that London was al on a fire, and that it had burned downe <hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> house in West cheape, and a great number more in the same stréet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Which tidings when <hi>Thomas</hi> of Reading heard, he was very sorrowfull, for of the same <hi>Becket</hi> that day had he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a great peece of money, and had left in his house many of his writtings and some that appertained to the king also: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no nay but he would ride back againe to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don presently, to see how the matter stood; thereupon making himselfe ready, departed. This crosse fortune caused his hoast to frowne, neuerthelesse y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> next time (quoth he) will pay for all.</p>

               <p>Another time when he should haue beene layd in the same place he fell so sicke, that he requested to haue some body to watch with him, whereby also they could not bring their vile purpuse to passe.

Let me see: I haue but one child in the world &amp; that is my daughter, and halfe that I haue is hers, the other halfe my wifes. What then? shall I be good to no body but them?

               <p>With that, his hoastise dissemblingly answered, saying. Doubt not. Master <hi>Cole,</hi> you are like enough by the course of nature to liue many yéeres. God knowes (quoth he) I neuer found my heart so heauy before. By this time, pen, inke and paper was brought, setting himselfe to writing, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the name of God, Amen I bequeath my soule to God, and my body to the ground, my goods equally betweene my wife Elenor, and Isabel my daughter.

               </p>
               <p>Ha, how say you my hoast (qd he) is not this well? I pray you reade it. His hoast looking thereon, sayd, why Maister <hi>Cole,</hi> what haue you written h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Then folding it vp, he sealed it, desiring that his hoast would send it to Exeter.

               <p>Alas, pretty soule, said his hostesse, this was but meer kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the girle, and it seemeth she is very fond of you. But alasse, why should you grieue at this? you must consider that it was but childishnesse. I, it is indeed, sayd <hi>Cole,</hi> and with that he began to nod. Then they asked him if he would go to bed. No sayd he, although I am heauy, I haue no mind to go to bed at all.

               <p>This musicke comes very well (said <hi>Cole</hi>) and when he had listned a while thereunto. he said, Me thinks these instruments sound like the ring of S.

The musicions being gone, his hoast asked if now it would please him to go to bed; for (quoth he) it is welneare eleuen of the clocke.</p>
               <p>With that, <hi>Cole</hi> beholding his hoste and hostesse earnestly, began to start backe, saying, what aile you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

they are neither bloudy nor foule: either your eies do greatly dazell, or else fancies of a troubled mind do delude you.</p>
               <p>Alas my hoast, you may sée, saide he, how weake my wits are, I neuer had my head so idle before. Come, let me drinke once more, and then I will to bed, and trouble you no longer. With that he made himselfe vnready, and his hostesse was very diligent to warme a kerchefe, and put it about his head.

               <p>His host and hostesse, that all this while noted his troubled mind, began to commune betwixt themselues thereof. And the man said, he knew not what were best to be done. By my consent (quoth he) the matter should passe, for I thinke it is not best to meddle on him. What man (quoth she) faint you now? haue you done so many, and do you shrinke at this? Then shewing him a great deale of gold which <hi>Cole</hi> had left with her, she said, Wpuld it not grieue a bodies heart to loose this? hang the old churle, what should be do liuing any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? he hath too much, and we haue too little: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the meane space the Musitians had béene at the Inne, and in requit all of their euenings gift, they intended to giue <hi>Cole</hi> some musicke in the morning, The goodman told them he tooke horse before day: likewise there was a guest in the house that would haue borne him company to Reading; vnto whom the hoste also answered, that he himselfe set him vpon horse backe, and that he went long agoe. Anone comes the man that owed the mare, inquiring vp and downe to know and if none of them missed a horse, who said no. At last hee came to the signe of the Crane where <hi>Cole</hi> lay: and calling the hostlers he demanded of them if they lackt none: they said no. Why then said the man, I perceiue my mare is good for something; for if I send her to field single, she wilcome home double: thus it passed on all that day and the night folowing. But the next day after, <hi>Coles</hi> wife musing that her husband came not home, sent one of her men on horse-backe, to sée if he could méet him; and if (quoth she) you méet him not betwixt this and Colebrooke, aske for him at the Crane, but if you find him not there, then ride to London; for I doubt he is either sicke, or else some mischance hath fallen vnto him.</p>

               <p>When the king heard of this murder, he was for the space of vij. dayes so sorrowfull and heauy as he would not heare any suite, giuing also commaundement, that the house should quite be consumed with fire wherein <hi>Cole</hi> was murdred, and that no man should euer build vpon that cursed ground.</p>

her, wherein he requested, that she would be ready to méete him in the forest, betwixt Cardiffe and Gloucester.</p>
               <p>The young Lady hauing secretly receiued his message, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to her master or dame, in a morning betime made her readye and got foorth, walking to the appointed place, where her loue should méete her.</p>
               <p>During her aboad there, and thinking long ere her lone came, she entered into diuers passions, which indéed presaged some disaster fortune to follow. O my déere Loue, sayd shée, how slacke art thou in perfourming thy promise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why doe not thy déeds agrée with thy inditing? see, these are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy words, Come my deere <hi>Margaret,</hi> and with <hi>Cupids</hi> swift wings flie to thy friend, be now as nimble in thy footing, as the Camels of Bractria, that runne an hundred miles a day, I will waite and stay for thee, so I stay not too long. There is no countrey like Austria for ambling horses, &amp; to carry thee I haue got one.</p>
               <p>O my Loue (quoth she) heere am I, but where art thou? O why doest thou play the trewant with Time, who like the winde slides away vnseene? An ambling gennet of Spaine is toe flow to serue our turnes. A flying horse, for flying Louers were most meete. And thus casting many lookes through the Siluane shades, vp and downe to espie him, she thought euery minuse, an houre, till she might see him, sometimes she would wish herselfe a bird, that she might flye through the aire to meet him, or a pretty squirell no clime the highest tree to discry his comming: but finding her wishes vaine, she began thus to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him and perswaded her selfe, saying.</p>
               <p>How much too blame am I, to finde fault with my friend? Alasse men that lacke their liberty, must come when they can, not when they would, poore prisoners cannot doe what they desire, and then why should I be so hasty?

Thus leauing fayre <hi>Margaret</hi> in a sweete slumber, we will returne to Duke <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> who had thus plotted his escape from his keepers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5607:32"/>Hauing liberty of the King to hawke and hunt, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on a day, as he should folow the chase, to leaue the hounds to the Hart, and the hunters to their hornes and being busse in their sport, himselfe would fly, which he perfourmed at that is time, when hee appointed <hi>Margaret</hi> to méete him, and so comming to the place, his Horse all in a water, and himselfe in a sweate, finding his Loue a sléepe, he awaked her with a kisse, saying. Arise, fayre <hi>Margaret,</hi> now comes the time wherein thou shalt bée made a Quéene: and presently setting her on horsebacke he posted away.</p>
               <p>Now when the Keepers saw they had lost his company, and that at the killing of the game, he was not present, they were among themselues in such a mutiny, that they were ready one to stabbe another. It was thy fault, sayd one, that he thus escapt from vs, that had more minde of thy pleasure, then of thy prisoner, and by this meanes we are all vndone. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sayd as much to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he had thought he had followed him in the chase: but leauing at last this contention, the one posted vp to the King. while the others coasted vp and downe the countrey to search for the Duke, who hauing kild his horse in traueling, was most vnhappily met on foote with fayre <hi>Margaret,</hi> ere he could come to any Towne, where he might for money haue another. But when he spyed his Kéepers come to take him, he desired <hi>Margaret</hi> to make shiftfor her selfe, and to seeke to escape them. But she being of a contrary mind, sayd, she would liue and dye with him.</p>
               <p>The Duke séeing himselfe ready to bée surprised, drew out his sword, and sayd, he would buy his liberty with his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would yeeld to be any more a prisoner; and thereupon began a great fight betwixt them, insomuch that the Duke had killed two of them: but himselfe being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But in the meane space, when <hi>Graies</hi> wife had mist her mayde, and saw she was quite gone, she made great lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for her among her neighbours: for she<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> loued her as dearely

as any child that euer she bore of her owne body. O <hi>Margaret</hi> (quoth the) what cause hadst thou thus to leaue mee? if thou did it mislike of any thing why didst thou not tell me? If thy wages were too little, I would haue mended it: If thy appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell had béene too simple, thou shouldest haue had better: If thy worke had beene too great. I would haue had help for thée.</p>
               <p>Farewell. my sweete <hi>Meg,</hi> the best seruant that euer came in any mans house many may I haue of thy name, but neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thy nature, thy deligence is much in thy hands I laid the whole gouernment of my house, and thereby eased my selfe of that care which now will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Well, quoth her neighbours, there is no remedy now, but to rest content, you shall one day heare of her, doubt you not and thinke this, that shee was not so good, but you may get an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as good, and therfore do not take it so heauily. O neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, blame me not to grieue, seeing I haue lost so great a iewell, and sure I am perswaded, that scant in a bodies life time, they shall meete with the like.</p>
               <p>I protest, I would circuit England round about on my bare feete to meete with her againe. O, my <hi>Meg</hi> was surely stole away from me, else would she not haue gone in such sort. Her husband on the other side grieued as much, and rested not night nor day riding vp and downe to seeke her: but shee, poore soule, is fast lockt vp in prison, and therefore cannot be met withall.</p>
               <p>But when the King vnderstood of his brothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ies should be put out,
<pb facs="tcp:5607:33"/>
and he kept in prison till his dying day; appoynting also, that the maid should lose her life for presumption in louing him.</p>
               <p>This matter being rumored ouer all England, it came to the eares of <hi>Gray</hi> and his wife, who hearing that <hi>Margaret</hi> also was there in prison appointed to die, the good aged woman neuer rested til she came to the court, where knéeling before the King, with many teares she besought his Maiesty to spare the maidens life, saying, Most royall king consider I humbly beséech you, that the duke your brother was able to intice any woman to his loue, much more a séely maiden, especially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising her marriage, to make her a Lady, a Dutchesse, or a Quéene, who would refuse such an offer, when at the instant they might get both a princely husband and a high dignitie? if death be a Louers guerdon, then what is due to hatred? I am in my heart persuaded, that had my poore <hi>Margaret</hi> thought it would haue bred your highnes displeasure, she would neuer haue bought his loue so deare. Had your Grace made it kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to your commons, that it was vnlawful for any to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the duke your brother, who would haue attempted such an action? if she had wilfully disobeyed your Graces commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, she might haue bin thought worthy of death; but sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorantly she offended. I beseech your Grace recall the sentence, and let me still inioy my seruant, for neuer will I rise till your Maiestie haue graunted my petition.</p>
               <p>His Highnes, who was of nature mercifull, be holding the womans aboundant teares, tooke pitty on her, and graunted her suite; which being obtained, she went home with all haste possible. And from thence, she with her husband taking their iorny to Cardiffe castle, they came at that very instant when the maiden was led toward hir death, who went in most ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sort to the same, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they were not worthy to be accounted true Louers, that were not willing to die for loue: and so with a smiling countenance she passed on, as if she had eaten <hi>Apium Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:5607:34"/>
Kings letters; and with that she deliuered them vp to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of the Castle, who reading them found these words written: We pardon the maids life, and graunt her libertie, but let her not passe, till she see her louers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies put out, which we wil haue you to do in such sort, that not only the sight may perish, but the eie continue faire, for which cause I haue sent downe doctor <hi>Piero</hi> that he may execute the same.</p>
               <p>The gouernour of the Castle hauing read the Kings letter, said thus to the maiden. The Kings maiesty hath pardoned thy life, and allowed thy liberty. but you must not passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you see your louers eies put out. O sir, said the maiden, mistake not your selfe, they are my eies that must be put out, and not the Dukes: as his offence grew by my meanes, so I being guiltie, ought to receiue the punishment.</p>
               <p>The kings commaundement must be fulfilled, said the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor: and therewithall D <hi>Robert</hi> was brought forth, who hearing that he must lose his eies, said thus: the noble mind is neuer conquered by griefe, nor ouercome by mischance: but as the Hart reneweth his age by eating the serpent, so doth a man lengthen his life with deuouring sorrow: my eyes haue offended the King, and they must be punished, my heart is in as great fault, why is not that killed?</p>
               <p>The Kings maiesty said the gouernor. spares your life of méere loue, and onely is content to satisfie the Law with the losse of your eies, wherefore take in good part this punishment and thinke you haue deserued greater than is granted.</p>
               <p>With this <hi>Margaret</hi> cried out, saying, O my deare loue, most gentle Prince, well may you wish that I had neuer bin borne, who by séeing of me must lose your sight; but happie should I count my selfe, if it so please the King, that I might redeeme thy eies to my selfe, or else, that being an equal offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, I might receiue equall punishment: hadst thou sustained this smart for some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>u. or Princesse of high bloud, it might with the more ease be borne, but to indure it for such a one as I, it must néeds cause atreble griefe to be increased.</p>
               <p>Content thée faire <hi>Margaret</hi> said the duke, for honor ought to be giuen to vertue, and not riches: for glory, honor, nobility
<pb facs="tcp:5607:34"/>
and riches, without virtue, are but clokes of maliciousnes. And now let me take my leaue of thy beauty, for neuer must I behold thy face: notwithstanding I account my eies wel lost, in that I do forgo them for so péerlesse a paragon. Now faire heauens, farewell, the Sunne, Moone and Starres shall I in this world neuer behold againe; and farewel also the fruitfull earth: wel may I féele thée, but those poore windowes of my body are now denied to view thee any more: and though the world hath neuer bin my foe, yet wil I bid it farewell too, and farewell all my friends; whiles I liue here in this world, I must suppose to sléep, &amp; wake when I come in heauen, where I hope to sée you all againe. Yet had it pleased the King, I had rather haue lost my life than my eies. Life, why what is it but a floure, a bubble in the water, a spanne long, and full of miserie? of such small account is life, that euery souldier will sell it for six pence.

               <p>With that the Doctor prepared his instrument, and being ready to set to the Dukes eies, he said, O stay master doctor, till I haue conueyed my loues countenance downe into my heart: Come hither my swéete, and let me giue thée my last kisse, while my eies may direct me to thy cherry lippes. Then imbracing her in his armes, he said, O that I might giue thée a kisse of xx yeares long, and to satisfie my gréedie eies with thy faire sight: yet it doth somwhat content me because thou art present at my punishment, that I may hold thee by the hand, the comfort my heart at the sodaine pricke of my eie.</p>
               <p>This being said, the Doctor performed his duetie, and so put out the cristall sight; at what time D. <hi>Robert</hi> started vp, and with a most manly courage said, I must thanke his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, that though he depriueth me of my sight, yet he leaueth me eies to weep for my sinnes. But so soone as <hi>Margaret</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the deede, she fell downe in a swowne, and much adoe her dame had to recouer hir life: which when the duke vnderstood, he was wondrous woe, groaping for her with his bleeding eies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saying.

               <head>How Tom Doue being fallen to decay, was forsaken of his friends, and despised of his seruants: and how in the end he was raised againe through the liberatity of the Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Chap. 14.</head>
               <p>SUch as seeke the pleasure of this world, follow a shaddow wherein is no substance: and as the adder Aspis tickleth a man to death so doth vaine pleasure flatter vs, till it makes vs forget God, and consume our substance, as by <hi>Tom Doue</hi> it is apparant, who had through a free heart, and a liberall mind wasted his wealth, and looke how his goods consumed, so his friends fled from him: And albeit he had béene of great ability, and thereby doue good vnto many, yet no man regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in his pouerty, but casting a scornefull countenance vpon him, they passed by him with slender salutation: neither would any of his old acquaintance do him good, or pleasure him the value of a farthing; his former friendship done to them was quite forgot, and he made of as much account, as <hi>Iob</hi> when he sate on the dunghill.</p>
               <p>Now when his wicked seruants sawe him in this disgrace with the world, they on thother side beganne to disdaine him. Notwithstanding that hee (to his great cost) had long time brought them vp, yet did they nothing regard it, but behinde his backe in most scornfull sort derided him, and both in their words and actions greatly abuse him, reuerence they would do none vnto him but when they spake, it was in such mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert sort, as would grieue an honest mind to heare it.</p>
               <p>At last it came to passe, that breaking out into meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, they said they would stay no longer with him, and that it was a great discredit to them, to serue a person so beggarly:
<pb facs="tcp:5607:35"/>
whereupon they thought it conuenient to séeke for their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits elsewhere. When the distressed man found the matter so plaine, being in great griefe, he spake thus vnto them. Now doe I find, to my sorrow, the small trust that is in this false world. Why my masters (quoth he) haue you so much forgotten my former prosperitie, that you nothing regarde my present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity? in your wants I forsooke you not, in your sicknes I left you not, nor despised you in your great pouerty: it is not vnknowne, though you doe not consider it, that I tooke some of you vp in the high way, other some from your needy parents, and brought the rest from meere beggery to a house of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where from paltry boyes, I brought you vp to mans estate, and haue, to my great cost, taught you a trade, whereby you may liue like men.

               <p>This is farre from the minds of honest seruants. The fierce Lion is kind to those that do him good: plucke but one thorne out of his foote, and for the same he will shew manifold fauors. The wilde Bull will not ouerthrow his Dam: and the very Dragons are dutifull to their nourishers. Bee better aduised, and call to mind, I beseech you, that I haue not pluckt a thorne out of your feete, but drawne your whole bodies out of perils, and when you had no meanes to help your selues, I only was your support, and he, that when all other forsooke you did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you in all your extemities.</p>
               <p>And what of all this, quoth one of them? because you tooke vs vp poore, doth it therefore follow, that wee must bee your slaues? We are youngmen, and for our partes, we are no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to regard your profit, then it may stand with our prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Why should we lose our benefit, to pleasure you? If you taught vs our trade, &amp; brought vs vp from boyes to men, you had our seruice for it, whereby you made no small benefit, if you had as well vsed it, as we got it. But if you be poore, you may thanke your selfe, being a iust scourge for your prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and it is my opinion plaine, that to stay with you, is the next way to make vs, like you, neither able to help our selues,

               <p>O my good Master and Dame, too long haue I dissembled my parentage from you, whom the froward distinies do pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue to deserued punishment. The wofull daughter am I of the vnhappie Earle of Shrewsbury, who euer since his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haue done nothing but drawne mischance after me: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me intreate you (deere Master and Dame to haue your good wills, to spend the remnant of my life in, some blessed Monasterie.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Gray</hi> and his wife heard this, they wondred great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as well at her birth, as at her strange demaund. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her dame knew not how to call her, whether Maiden or Madam, but said O good Lord, are you a Lady and I knew it not? I am sory that I knew it not before. But when the folkes of the house heard that <hi>Margaret</hi> was a Lady, there was no small alteration: and moreouer her Dame said, that she had thought to haue had a match betwéene her &amp; her sonne: And by many perswasions did séeke to withdraw her from being a Nun saying in this manner, What <hi>Margaret,</hi> thou art young &amp; faire the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> world (no doubt) hath better fortune for thée, whereby thou mayst leaue an honourable issue behind thée, in whom thou mayst liue after death.</p>
               <p>These and many other reasons did they alleadge vnto her, but all in vaine, she making this replie, Who knoweth not that this world giueth the pleasure of an howre, but the sorrow of many daies? for it payeth euer that which it promiseth, which is nothing els but continuall trouble and vexation of the mind. Do you thinke, if I had the offer and choice of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mightiest prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Christendome, that I could match my selfe better then to my Lord Iesus? No no, he is my husband, to whom I yeeld my selfe both body and soule, giuing to him my heart, my loue, and most firme affection: I haue ouerlong loued this vile world? therefore I beseech you farther dissuade me not.</p>

               <p>All things being therefore prepared the yong Lady was in most princely wise attired in a gowne of pure white sattin, her kertle of the same, imbrodered with gold about the skirts, in most curious sort, her head was garnished with gold, pearles, and precious stones, hauing her haire like thréeds of burnisht gold, hanging downe behind her, in maner of a princely bride: about her iuory necke iewels of inestimable price were hung, and her handwreasts were compassed about with bracelets or bright shining diamonds.</p>

Then came the yong Lady most like an heauenly Angell out of her masters house; at what time all the bells in Gloucester were solemnly rung, she being led betwixt the Kings maiesty, hauing on his royall robes and imperiall crowne, and the chiefe Bishop wearing his Miter, in a Cope of cloth of gold, ouer her head a Canopy of white silke, fringed about in princely manner: before her went an hundred priests singing, and after her all the chiefe Ladies of the land: then all the wiues and maidens of Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester followed, with an innumerable sort of people on euerie side standing to behold her. In this sort she passed on to the cathedrall church, where she was brought to the Nunry gate.</p>

Farewell the pride &amp; vanity of this world. The ornaments of her head were the next she gaue away: and then was she led on one side, where she was stripped, and instead of her smocke of soft silke, had a smocke of rough haire put vpon her.</p>
               <p>Then came one with a paire of sheares, and cut off her gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

coloured lockes, and with dust and ashes all bestrewd hir head and face. Which being done, she was broght again into the peopls sight barefoot and barelegd, to whom she said: Now farewell the world, farewell the pleasures of this life, farewell my Lord the King, and to the Dukes swéet loue farewell; now shall my eies wéep for my former transgressions, and no more shal my tongue talke of vanity: farewell my good master and dame, and farewell all good people.</p>
               <p>With which words she was taken away, and neuer after séene abroad.
