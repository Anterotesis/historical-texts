            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>AFter the Antient Piety, Zeal, and Strictneſs of Life, exemplary in the Primitive Chriſtians, had in a meaſure put the Dominion of this World, and the Keyes of the next into the hands of the Clergy; care of gaining Souls became (in a few Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies) Obſoleted: The former Illuſtrious times of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue vaniſhed, and a gloomy night of Ignorance ſoon over-ſpread the Univerſe. The Clergy (the Authors of this Unhappineſs) finding their Religion and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be maintained by Power and Policy; and Conſcious to themſelves, that their Lives and Doctrine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57669:3"/>
held no good Correſpondence with the Purity and Poverty of their Predeceſſors, took a courſe (becauſe they had little left of their Own) to Trade with the Piety of the Ages paſt, and prop up their own Ignorance and Sloath by that means. To work they go; They make Gods of the deceaſed Propagators of Chriſtianity, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrine their Rotten Bones, or thoſe of others in Caſes of Gold and Silver. The next thing was, to perſwade or Compel the People to Adore them. In this Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new Order of demy-Gods, they imitated the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans in their Wickedneſs, but not in their Vertue or Valour, and Clapt the Feſtivals of theſe new Pa-Gods into the Calendar in places of the old Holy-dayes of <hi>Saturn, Minerva,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> &amp;c. This Project anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red expectation; they grew greater, but not better. The Miracles pretendedly wrought at thoſe Shrines, and multitude of Ceremonies, dazled the Vulgar, ſupported the Reputation, and ſupplied the Defect of the Clergy. The glorious Lives, Wonders and Martyrdoms of the Antients were made into Mantles to hide the Ignorance, Luſt, and Avarice of worthleſs Impoſtors; and Laws made every where, were made to reſtrain Men from peeping into the Ark of the Church. And to ſtrip Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces privily of their Power, and to draw their Subjects to other dependencies, numourous Orders, and Societies are Conjured up (as though the Laity had not groaned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough under the Seculars) to Erect a Kingdom in every Kingdom for the Pope, and to ſupply him in every Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with a Villain Spiritual, to Stab or Poiſon what Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>Things thus Jog'd on till the days of our Grand-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when in <hi>England</hi> the Pope and his Clergy were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; And it was made death for any Romiſh Prieſt to enter the Realm; yet ſince, they have not only come hither, but by help of Factors and Proſelites acquired great Eſtates in theſe Kingdomes, and Arrived to a height of no leſs Confidence than of ruling the Roſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying us all, and introducing Popery. This is as clear
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57669:3"/>

               </p>
               <p>It is manifeſt, that the Grandees of the Roman Church make no more account of Religion, than the profit and convenience it brings along with it, are able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: Yet they ever begin with a Holy <hi>Canticum, In</hi>

               <p>In this wicked thing call'd an Oath, they Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly ſet up the <hi>Bleſſed Mary,</hi> St. <hi>Michael,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Ruſhton</hi> the Prieſt, in an equal Claſſis with God Almighty; But mention not Chriſt, till they come to declare the Pope to be his Vicar, and that thereby the Pope hath Letters-Patents to impower him to do what he ſhall think fit, in Heaven, Hell, Earth, and in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, to Depoſe and Kill Heretick-Kings, yea, and Catholick ones too, when he wants opportunity to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a Harlot, a Baſtard, or a Nephew.

               <p>Our New Explanation or Expoſition, far exceeds the Old Text, and is a Superſtructure upon that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Foundation of Villany, erected ſince thoſe times. The Bleſſed Trinity, the Holy Sacrament, and the whole Hoſt of Heaven, are made ſtalking Horſes for impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mortals in the ungodly, uncharitable, Anti-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Works of ruining Kings, Kingdomes, and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind beſides themſelves, only to ſet up the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a deſpotick Power. Theſe horrid Impieties (but that we are promiſed the gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt them) might make conſciencious men, with Trembling, preſage and dread, That the Ruin of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57669:5"/>
is not far off. Theſe men, when they ſwear their miſled Proſelites into Treaſons, Murders, Fellonies and Secrecy, little mind to conſider what is taught in Holy Writ concerning an Oath, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>And thou ſhalt Swear, The Lord liveth in Truth, in Judgement, and in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. What regard theſe Oaths have to Truth, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Righteouſneſs, let the Reader take notice and proceed to obſerve one unparrallel'd Clauſe in the Oath, viz. <hi>And that no hopes of Reward, Threats or Puniſhments, ſhall make me Diſcover the Reſt, concerned in ſo Pious a Work; and if diſcovered ſhall never confeſs any Acceſſaries with my ſelf concerned in this Deſign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here they lead their Proſelites into a Laberynth of wickedneſs; but then they leave them no way or means to diſ-ingage themſelves, or others out of it, and conſequently to be Hanged and Damn'd afterwards. This may learn the moſt Wilful and moſt Obſtinate Charity, to have a care how it extends it ſelf, in believing the words of the late dying Jeſuits and others. <hi>Dicite Juſtitiam Moniti,</hi> And let it teach all good Proteſtants the nature of of theſe Romiſh Wolves, who though they change their Hair, will never change their Hearts.</p>
               <p>Now having given an Account of the Oath of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; next I will render you an Account how the Jeſuits and popiſh Prieſts do inſinuate themſelves into the hearts of thoſe, that they enſnare to engage in this damnable Deſign: which particularly being exemplifi'd in my own ſelf, may ſerve as inſtructions, how others were induced and encouraged to propagate their Helliſh Principles; The relation is as followeth.</p>
               <p>About the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> 1676. <hi>Thomas Thwing</hi> a Prieſt, and <hi>William Ruſhton,</hi> another popiſh Prieſt, who was my Ghoſtly Father, came to my Houſe at <hi>Shippon-Hall,</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and did there examine me how I was affected and did like the Romiſh Religion, ſince I was of it, and if there were any occaſion, what would I do for the good of that Religion? To whom I replied, that I was ſo well affected to the Romiſh Religion, that I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57669:6"/>
would venture my Life and Eſtate in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Deſign whatſoever, for the good of that <hi>RELIGION.</hi> The Prieſts then ſaid, That they were glad to hear me in ſo good a Humour, and did heartily wiſh, that all the Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> were of my mind, and further did tell me, that all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in a little time would be Roman Catholicks; for that the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> next Heir to the Crown, had renounced the Proteſtant Religion. Therefore force was to be uſed for the more ſpeedy bringing him to the Crown. But added, that before I could be any further acquainted with the particulars of this, Deſign, I muſt firſt take the aforementioned Oath of Secrecy, which all good Catholicks muſt take; for if any Catholicks did refuſe it, they could not be admitted to know of their Deſigns and Contrivances: For that Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigne, Thomas Gaſcoigne</hi> Eſquire, and other Gentlemen, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſame, and engaged themſelves, and given Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for their reſpective performances.</p>
               <p>Then I told the ſaid Prieſts that I would not deny to take it, for I would obey my Ghoſtly Father in all things. And on <hi>Candlemas</hi> day 76. I did accordingly go to <hi>Barm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-Hall,</hi> as was formerly agreed, where I did hear Maſs, &amp; take the Oath of Secrecy from the hands of my Ghoſtly Father, to be private, and keep ſecret the Deſign of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Sacred Majeſty, and the deſtruction of all ſuch Proteſtants, as would not be of the Romiſh Religion; Which Oath of Secrecy is before related, and is the true Copy of the ſaid Oath as I got it from the ſaid <hi>Ruſhton</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, the very ſame day it was Miniſtred it unto me by him.</p>
               <p>Before I did take the Oath of Secrecy, I did go to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, where my Ghoſtly Father in my ſaid Confeſſion did tell me that I muſt Believe, <hi>That it was a Mortal Sin to Reveal what was told me by my Ghoſtly Father in my Confeſſion, and that I was certainly Damned, if ever I did Diſcover the concerns of this Deſign, or taking the ſaid Oath of Secrecy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after I had taken the ſaid <hi>Oath of Secrecy,</hi> and was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57669:6"/>
Acquainted with the Deſign, when ever I went to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, my Ghoſtly Father would be ſure to Examine me, how I had kept my Oath; upon which, if my Father Confeſſor did judg, that I had not ſo truly kept the ſame, as I ought to have done, then muſt I have taken the ſame Oath over again. Beſides, my Ghoſtly Father did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Teach me how to make uſe of Equivocations and Mental Reſervations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> How to defend my ſelf againſt the Proteſtants, if I were ask't by a ſtranger whether Mr. <hi>Ruſhton</hi> were a Prieſt; That then I might lawfully deny it, or upon Oath before a Magiſtrate, I might poſſitively deny my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Ruſhton</hi> to be a Popiſh Prieſt: but then I muſt privately to my ſelf make uſe of this Equivocation, That I did not ſee the ſaid <hi>Ruſhton</hi> take his Orders beyond Sea, therefore could not ſwear him to be a Prieſt. And then followed the benefit of Abſolution for this or any other ſervice done for the good of the Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And indeed my Penance in Confeſſion, was once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned me by Father <hi>Ruſhton</hi> to laſh my ſelf with a Cat of nine Tailes, or Diſcipline, becauſe I did not deny with Aſſeverations to one Mr. <hi>Burman</hi> that he was no popiſh Prieſt; although I did not confeſs the ſame to Mr. <hi>Burman,</hi> yet he alledged, that I did it but faintly, and therefore that ſhould be my Penance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If Reproacht by the Proteſtants; that they of the Romiſh Religion made no Conſcience to deſtroy thoſe that were of contrary Opinion to them.</p>
               <p>Then with Imprecations I might lawfully deny the ſame; only making uſe of this Reſervation to my ſelf, that I muſt deny any thing which is againſt the Intereſt of the Church: beſides, if I ſhould own it to be the Doctrine of the Romiſh Church, that then the Proteſtants would beat out my Brains, as was taught me by my Ghoſtly Father <hi>Ruſhton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That ſince the Diſcovery of this Popiſh Plot, if I did at any time hear the Proteſtants diſcourſe, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57669:7"/>
they of the Romiſh Church did Teach the Murthering of Kings and Princes, and that the King was to have been Murthered by the Papiſts, that then I muſt Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Romiſh Religion, Arguing, that ſuch Doctrine the Papiſts held not, with Reſervation to my ſelf, that I muſt not Own ſuch a Deſign, unleſs effected, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Proteſtants being Hereticks had no power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine me, neither was I obliged to Anſwer directly to the Queſtion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>The Cerimonies, Manner, and Form, uſed in the taking of the ſaid Oath of Secrecy, is thus.</head>
               <p>AT the Chappel Door, I did Sprinkle my ſelf with Holy Water, and then went into the Chappel, where Bowing towards the Altar, I made the Sign of the Croſs, and ſaid, <hi>Sprinkle me with</hi> Hyſop <hi>and I ſhall be Cleanſed, waſh me and I ſhall be whiter than Snow;</hi> Then kneeling, I made the Sign of the Croſs, and ſaid, <hi>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghoſt, Amen.</hi> After that, I ſaid certain Prayers uſed before Confeſſion, and at the Concluſion, made again the Sign of the Croſs; which being ended, I went into the Veſtry, where Kneeling, I ask't my Ghoſtly Fathers Bleſſing, as Children uſually do their Parents. Then after that, I made again the Sign of the Croſs, and then had the benefit of Confeſſion, and Abſolution from my Sins, and then I went into the Chappel, and ſaid Prayers before Receiving the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>But when Maſs was ſaid, I did not Communicate with the reſt there preſent, although the Sacrament was Conſecrated for me, but after the reſt were gone, then <hi>William Ruſhton,</hi> my Ghoſtly Father, call'd me to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57669:7"/>
Altar, where bowing my Body and kneeling, I made the ſign of the <hi>Groſs;</hi> then I kiſt the Maſs-Book, and laid my Right Hand upon it, and ſo had the Oath of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy given me by my Ghoſtly Father <hi>Ruſhton,</hi> repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it after him. But at theſe words, <hi>In Teſtimony whereof I do Receive this moſt Holy and Bleſſed Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, Ruſhton</hi> put the Sacrament into my Mouth, and ſaid this little Latine Prayer following:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Corpus Domini noſtri</hi> Jeſu Chriſti <hi>Cuſtodiat animam tuam in Vitam Eternam.</hi> Amen.</q>
               <p>Then again I kiſt the Maſs-Book, held in the Prieſts Hand, but held my Hand on the Maſs-Book all the time I was taking the Oath aforeſaid; and after that, riſing, bowed my Body to the Altar, in an humble manner, and ſo returned to my place again.</p>
               <p>Now after I had taken the ſaid Oath of Secrecy, <hi>Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> went again into the Veſtry, to ſay his Prayers on his Breviary, but I continued ſtill in the Chappel to ſay my Prayers uſed after the taking of the Sacrament. Then after <hi>Ruſhton</hi> my Confeſſor came forth out of the Veſtry, he went towards his own Chamber, whither I followed him; but Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigne</hi> haſtily calling the ſaid <hi>Ruſhton,</hi> he laid down his Breviary in his Cloſet (to which was no Door, and is ſcituate neer his Chamber) which ſaid Breviary I taking up, found therein the ſaid Oath of Secrecy; of which Oath I had a ſufficient time to take a true Copy, and it is the real Copy which is before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; although when I took the Copy of the ſaid Oath, never intended that any Proteſtant ſhould have ſeen it.</p>

Month of <hi>February,</hi> I had an Indulgence, or Pardon, for <hi>Thirty Thouſand</hi> Years, given me by the ſaid <hi>Ruſhton,</hi> my Ghoſtly Father, for my Encouragement in my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of being ſo Zealous againſt his Majeſty, and Government; and the Penance enjoyn'd me, was to ſay every day a Letany, for the Interceſſion, and Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>England:</hi> but if I did twice a day ſay the ſaid Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, then ſhould I each day Redeem a Soul out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatoty.

               <p>About the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> 1678. my Occaſions called me to <hi>Leeds-Market</hi> within four Miles of my Habitation, and a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket that I frequently uſed: after my particular buſineſs was done, my curioſity lead me (as uſually <hi>I</hi> did) to a <hi>Coffee-Houſe;</hi> where, amongſt other News and Reports, <hi>I</hi> heard that one Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey,</hi> a Juſtice of Peace at <hi>London,</hi> was miſſing, and that it was ſuſpected and feared, that he was Murthered, or made away by the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>At my return home, <hi>I</hi> repaired to Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coignes</hi> Houſe at <hi>Barmbow,</hi> one quarter of a mile from my Houſe, and there meeting his Son <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigne</hi> Eſquire, <hi>I</hi> Acquainted him with the News <hi>I</hi> heard at <hi>Leedes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who thereupon took a Letter out of his Pocket di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to himſelf, which he ſhewed me; which Letter was Subſcribed <hi>I. Corker,</hi> wherein he acquainted the Eſquire in words to this Effect: <hi>That Sir</hi> Edmund-bury Godfrey <hi>had been a very buſy Man, and a great Enemy to the Catholiques, therefore they had procured him to be Deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſome few Dayes after, we had the ſame thing confirm'd in Print, <hi>viz. That he was Murthered.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, my Ghoſtly Father <hi>(William Ruſhton)</hi> ſent for me, to come to <hi>Maſs</hi> at Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoignes</hi> Houſe; and at Confeſſion, did charge me to give out, <hi>That I heard, that Sir</hi> Edmond-bury Godfrey <hi>was a Melancholly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and in a Diſcontent went into the Fields, and there Murdered himſelf with his own Sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57669:10"/>
Which accordingly I did, as occaſion offer'd, in all Companies I happened into; but was Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by many; and by ſome, that it could not be, for, that his Neck was broke, which he could not do after he had Murder'd himſelf; nor be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to do it, if his Neck was broke before: And being thus run down in my Aſſertions, I Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſaid Ghoſtly Father <hi>(William Ruſhton)</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, who told me, he had received New Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he ſhewed me in Writing, and were to this Effect:</p>
               <p>That Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey</hi> was a Gentleman who had often attempted to Deſtroy himſelf; that he did really Hang himſelf in his own Silk-girdle, in his Chamber at the Beds-feet; which being Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, two of his Servants acquainted his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers therewith; who coming thither, Contrived his taking down, and the carrying him to the Place where he was found, where they run his Corps through, on purpoſe to throw it on the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> thereby to ſave the Eſtate to themſelves, and from being Forfeited to the <hi>King:</hi> and that the two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had <hi>Fifty-Pounds</hi> a piece given them to keep it Private. He alſo ſaid, that one of them, which was a Maid-Servant, did offer to Diſcover this Contrivance to his Majeſty and Council, but that ſhe was by them rejected: Nevertheleſs, for all this (at the ſame time) <hi>Ruſhton</hi> did own to me, that he was Murthered by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but by what hands he knew not; and further, he ſeemed much concern'd that it was done; wiſhing it had never been done, becauſe it would make the Murther of the <hi>King,</hi> the more difficult to be performed.</p>

            <p>I Being ſent down by an Order of Council bearing Date the Seventeenth day of <hi>October,</hi> 1679. to Search ſeveral Papiſts Houſes in <hi>Yorkſhire, Lancaſhire,</hi> Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>Northumberland;</hi> among other Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Searching the Manſion-Houſe of <hi>Richard Sherborn</hi> of <hi>Stony-hurſt,</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi>

            <p>This ſame <hi>Cottam</hi> (upon the Death of <hi>Henry Long,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſaid Paper) was by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Sherborn</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd as his Domeſtick Prieſt, in the ſtead and place of the other, who (as the Papiſts gave out) did Drown himſelf; but was rather made away by the <hi>Romiſh Party,</hi> as being one that was Diſcontented in his Mind, and of whom they had a Suſpition, That he would Diſcover this <hi>Damnable Popiſh Plot,</hi> carryed on by the Papiſts; who therefore, as I have heard from ſeveral Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Papiſts,</hi> engaged in the <hi>Plot,</hi> procured his Death.</p>

Having thus given the <hi>Reader</hi> an Account of this <hi>Paper,</hi> how I came by it, and in whoſe Cuſtody I found it, I ſhall leave it to the Conſideration of any perſon of Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judgement, what ſhould be the Deſign of ſo many Prieſts and Jeſuits to make ſuch Orders and Conſtitutions among themſelves? And for what Reaſon thoſe Orders muſt be Confirm'd by ſo many Manual Subſcriptions? Certainly the Orders of their Society needed no ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations. This muſt be then ſome Eccentrick Buſineſs, for ſo many Prieſts and Jeſuits to Meet and Cabal in the Remote parts of the Nation; and there alſo to appoint Treaſurers and Collectors, not ordinary perſons neither, but ſuch as could not be Named without the Title of <hi>Moſt Reverend Lord;</hi> which imports them not the Treaſurers of Almes, but of Contributions. Now, Contributions ſignifie Sums; and Sums, it cannot be imagin'd, ſhould be Collected in thoſe parts for the Jeſuits to <hi>Build Colledges</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains then, that <hi>Theſe Collectors</hi> were Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Collection of Conſiderable Sums (the Largeſſes of <hi>Blind Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Deluded Piety,</hi> or the price of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences</hi> for Fifty Thouſand Years, &amp; Exemptions from <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory)</hi> to carry on the great Work of their <hi>Damnable Plot,</hi> which (it is apparent) was Hatching in the Year 1675. and long before.</p>
            <p>And this I hope, may in a large meaſure ſerve to prove, and make good, that part of my <hi>Information</hi> already given; Wherein I have Declared, That in the Counties of <hi>York, Lancaſter, Northumberland,</hi> and Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> there have been no leſs than <hi>Thirty Thouſand Pounds</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> (which were, no queſtion, the Effects of ſuch <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> as theſe above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named) for the more ſpeedy bringing to paſs, the <hi>Deſtruction of His moſt Sacred Majeſty,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Long, Dalton, Thurſton, Anderton, Tho. Eccleſton,</hi> and <hi>Urmeſton,</hi> I know them to be all <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and ſo, that it is but Rational to believe all the reſt of the ſame Stamp.</p>
