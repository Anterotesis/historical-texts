            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>AMongst those many Things which
are made Publick; it may be
thought, perhaps, of <hi>Sermons;</hi>
that they are, of any other, the
least wanted; and for the future, least
likely to be found wanting: since to that
rich and inexhaustible Store, with which
the Learned and Orthodox Divines of
<hi>England</hi> have already furnished us, there
is daily fresh addition, from worthy and
able Hands. Neither, have we cause to
fear a Cessation in this kind; or that
so great a Blessing is likely to fail us,
for the future; having such security,
not only from the unwearied Zeal of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Divines (of whom we may always
hope a worthy Succession) but, from the just
esteem which the Publick never fails to
shew, for such pious Discourses: Upon
which account, we find that many of these
<pb facs="tcp:56135:3"/>
are every day made Publick; and, as it
were, forced into the World; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great Modesty of their Authors,
whose Humble Thoughts, and devoutly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
Affections, lead them not towards
Eminence, and Advancement in the
World.</p>
                  <p>It may seem strange, therefore, that
in such an Age as this, any one should
be so officious, as to search after, and
publish the Sermons of a Man long since
dead, who (himself) never meant to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
any; or thought so highly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as that he could benefit the World by
such a Publication.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, that we must not ever
imagine, nor can it enter into a Mind
truly Christian, that because we see not an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
Change for the better, in the Lives
of Christian Professors; that, therefore all
<hi>Preaching</hi> is ineffectual; or, that here
in <hi>England,</hi> the Labours of the most
Eminent Divines that perhaps the World
ever afforded, have been of no use at
all: It might be said with the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(tho' very prophanely, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
that because the Christians are not
reported to exceed the other Nations of
the World, in Probity, and Good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
but are said to be rather inferior
<pb facs="tcp:56135:3"/>
in this respect, to the Civilized People,
whether Pagan or Mahometan, lying round
them; that therefore the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is of no effect at all, nor any ways
operative upon the Lives of its Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
                  <p>But, if we consider this, as becomes
us; and not perversely, as many do; it
will be found that we are, even in this
sense, the most highly indebted to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;</hi>
and should look upon <hi>It</hi> as the
greatest Blessing imaginable; not only for
its spiritual Advantages, which are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable;
but for its Temporal Benefits,
and Securities; inasmuch as that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
being so inclinable to Ill, we should
have a Religion so full of all good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and so enforcing with respect to all
the Duties of Morality, and Justice. So
that our Amazement ought rather to be;
how Men, with such a Religion, should
lead such Lives! and how Malice, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
or Division, should have place in
such Societies as these; which we might
expect to see distinguished from all others,
rather by a perfect Harmony, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
than by the fiercest Quarrels,
Contentions, and Animosities.</p>
                  <p>And, indeed, when we consider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Preaching;</hi> how excellent an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:56135:4"/>
and Establishment it is; how highly
raised and magnified in the Christian
World: When we consider Numbers of
Holy Men set apart for this great Work;
having all advantages given them, the
better to set forth those Glorious Truths
of Revelation, and to create a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Religion in the Minds of Men;
when we consider the Solemnity of a Church-Assembly,
and the awful Presence and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Christian Orator; we may
be apt to wonder perhaps, why we see
not greater and more happy Effects here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in the World. However, we must of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
conclude, That <hi>this Institution</hi> being
undoubtedly so powerful a support of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
if such Assemblies as these were not
upheld, if such Authority as this did not
subsist, the consequence would be, that as
in a little time there would be no more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
left in the World, so neither any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality;
since, notwithstanding all the
Helps of <hi>Preaching,</hi> and the Assistance
and Support which Virtue receives from
hence, the Lives of Men are still so far
from being Reform'd, and the World
so little Improved, in these latter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                  <p>But, how reverently soever we have
cause to think concerning <hi>this Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56135:4"/>
and the undoubted good Effects of it,
upon Mankind; and, whatever high Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Esteem we may justly have of
their Performance in whose Hands this
Power is placed; it seems not wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
but that there may be some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in this great Affair; and that the
Causes of ill Success may not lye altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Depravity, Perverseness, or
Stupidity of Mankind, who are the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
and Readers of these Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>In some Countries, and amongst some
sorts of Christians, we have seen, that
the Whole of <hi>this Institution</hi> has not been
appropriated to Spirituals; but, that a great
part of those Divine Exhortations have
had something in common with the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the World, and the Affairs of
Government. And, of whatsoever Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
this may have been to Mankind, or
to the Peace of the Christian World; it
must be own'd that <hi>Preaching</hi> it self,
will be so much the less apt to make any
happy Revolution in Manners, as it has
at any time been serviceable to Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in State, or to the support of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Interest than that of Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>Nor do we find, since the Arts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and Mysteries of Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:56135:5"/>
have been thus suited together; that <hi>either</hi>
has been much advantag'd by the Union;
it having never yet appear'd, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
has been greatly better'd by Policy;
or that Policy has been any where mended
by Divinity.</p>
                  <p>Amongst those Writers who have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in making this Unprosperous Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and Building a Political Christianity;
there has been * <hi>one</hi> of our Nation (in the Time
wherein our Author liv'd) who whether he may
have been serviceable any way to the Civil
Government, or Christian Church; it may be
concluded, at least, that he has done but
very ill Service in the Moral World. And,
however other parts of Philosophy may be
obliged to him, <hi>Ethicks</hi> will appear to have
no great share in the Obligation. He has,
indeed, with great Zeal, and Learning,
been oppos'd, by all the eminent and worthy
Divines of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And
had the same Industry been applied to the
Correction of his Moral Principles, as has
been bestow'd in refuting some other of his
Errours, it might perhaps have been of
more Service to Religion, in the Main.</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>He</hi> who reckoning up the Passions,
or Affections, by which Men are held toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Society, live in Peace, or have any
Correspondence one with another, forgot to
<pb facs="tcp:56135:5"/>
mention Kindness, Friendship, Sociable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Love of Company and Converse, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Affection, or any thing of this kind;
I say <hi>Forgot,</hi> because I can scarcely think
so ill of any Man, as that he has not by
experience found any of these Affections
in himself, and consequently, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
none of them to be in others. But
in the place of other Affections, or good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
of whatever kind, this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
has substituted only one Master-Passion,
<hi>Fear,</hi> which has, in effect devour'd all the
rest, and left room only for that infinite
Passion towards <hi>Power after Power,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leviathan.</hi> pag. 47.</note>
                     <hi>Natural</hi> (as he affirms.) <hi>to All Men,
and never ceasing but in Death.</hi> So much
less <hi>Good-nature</hi> has he left with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
than what he allows the worst of
Beasts: Having allotted to us, in the way
of our Nature, such mischievous Passions
as are unknown to them; and not so much
as allow'd us any Degree of their Good
ones, such as they All are known to have,
and are never wanting to exert towards
their own Kind: By which Excellency of
Nature (so little reckon'd upon, in the
Case of Mankind) their common Interest
is duly serv'd, and their Species propagated
and maintain'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56135:6"/>Had not the Poyson of these Immoral,
and (in reality) <hi>Atheistical</hi> Principles been
diffused more than 'tis easie to imagine, (at
that time especially when Dr.<hi>Whichcot</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd)
we should, perhaps, where Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was concern'd, have heard less of
<hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Punishment;</hi> and more, of
<hi>Moral Rectitude</hi> and <hi>Good-nature.</hi> At
least, it should not have grown customary
to explode Good-nature, and detract
from that Good which is ascrib'd to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
Temper, and is accounted <hi>Natural
Affection,</hi> as having Ground and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in <hi>Meer NATURE:</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
it would have been the Business of
those who had manag'd the Cause of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to have contended for these better Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
and to have shewn, how deep a
Root and Foundation they had in Human
Nature; and not, just contrary-wise, to
have built on the Ruine of <hi>these.</hi> For,
with some people, this was then become a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to prove Christianity. Revelation was to
owe its Establishment to the Depression and
Lowering of such Principles as these, in
the Nature of Man: And the Weakness of
these was made the Strength of Religion. As
if Good-nature, and Religion, were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
A Thing, indeed, so unthought of,
amongst the <hi>Heathens;</hi> that <hi>PIETY</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56135:6"/>
(which was their best Word to signifie <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>)
had more than half its Sence, in
Natural and Good Affection; and stood
not only for the Adoration, and Worship of
<hi>God;</hi> but for the Natural Affections of
Parents to their Children, and of Children
to their Parents; of Men to their Native
Country; and, indeed, of all Men in their
several Relations one to another.</p>
                  <p>It must be confess'd, that it has been the
Reproach of some Sects of Christians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us; that their Religion appear'd to
be, in a manner, opposite to Good-nature;
and founded in Moroseness, Selfishness, and
Ill-will to Mankind; Things, not easily
reconcileable with a Christian Spirit. But,
certainly, it may be said of <hi>the Church of
England,</hi> if of any Church in the World,
that this is not <hi>Her</hi> Spirit: But, it is by
Characters and Features just contrary to
these, that <hi>this Church</hi> shews Herself, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all others, most worthily and nobly
Christian.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, that there is nothing more
contended for, by those who would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
admit a Deity; nor is there any
thing of greater Use to them, in their Way
of Reasoning; than to have it pass as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that there are in Man, no Natural
Principles inclining him to Society; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:56135:7"/>
that moves him to what is Moral,
Just and Honest; except a Prospect of some
different Good, some Advantage of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Sort from what attends the Actions
themselves. Nor is it strange, that they
who have brought themselves off from so
much as believing the Reality of any Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Action, perform'd by any of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
meerly through Good Affection, and
a Rectitude of Temper; should be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to apprehend any Goodness of that
sort, in <hi>a Higher Nature</hi> than that of
<hi>Man.</hi> But it is strange to conceive, how
Men who pretend a Notion and Belief of
<hi>a Supream Power</hi> acting with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Goodness, and without any Inducement
but that of Love and Good-will; should
think it unsuitable to a Rational Creature,
derived from <hi>Him,</hi> to act after <hi>His</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
and to find Pleasure and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Works of Goodness and Bounty,
without other Prospect. But, what is yet
more unaccountable, is, that Men who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
a Religion where <hi>Love</hi> is chiefly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd;
where the Heart is expresly call'd
for, and the outward Action without that,
is disregarded; where Charity (or Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
is made all in all; that Men of
this Perswasion, should combine, to degrade
the Principle of Good-nature, and refer
<pb facs="tcp:56135:7"/>
all to Reward; which being made the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Motive in Mens Actions, must exclude
all worthy and generous Disposition, all
that Love, Charity, and Affection, which
the Scripture enjoyns; and without which,
no Action is <hi>Lovely,</hi> in the Sight of God,
or Man; or in it self, deserving of Notice,
or kind Reward.</p>
                  <p>But, perhaps, one Reason of this Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
has been; that some Men, who
have meant sincerely well to Religion and
Vertue, have been afraid least by advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Principle of Good-nature, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too great a Stress upon it, the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Need of <hi>Sacred Revelation</hi> (a Thing
so highly Important to Mankind) should
be, in some Measure, taken away. So that
they were forced, in a Manner, to <hi>wound
VERTUE,</hi> and give way to the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of being <hi>Mercenary,</hi> and of<note n="†" place="margin">Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dr. <hi>Whichcot</hi>'s.</note> 
                     <hi>Acting
in a slavish Spirit, in Ways of Religion,</hi>
rather than admit a sort of Rival (in
their Sense) to the Faith of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
Seeing that Christianity (they
thought) would, by this Means, be made
less necessary to Mankind; if it should be
allow'd, that Men could find any Happiness
in Vertue, but what is in Reversion.</p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>one Party</hi> of Men, fearing the
Consequences which may be drawn from the
<pb facs="tcp:56135:8"/>
Acknowledgment of Moral and Social Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
in Human-kind, to the Proof a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's
Existence; and, <hi>another Party</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as much from thence, to the Prejudice of
Revelation; <hi>Each</hi> have in their turns,
<hi>made War</hi> (if I may say so) even on <hi>Vertue</hi>
it self: Having exploded the Principle of
Good-nature; all Enjoyment or Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Acts of Kindness and Love; all
Notion of Happiness in temperate Courses
and moderate Desires; and, in short, all
Vertue or Foundation of Vertue; unless
<hi>that,</hi> perhaps, be call'd <hi>Merit,</hi> or <hi>Vertue,</hi>
which is left remaining, when all Generosity,
free Inclination, Publick-spiritedness, and
every thing else besides <hi>private Regard,</hi> is
taken away.</p>
                  <p>If this may be said to be our Case, under
this Dispute; and, that true Religion it
self (which is <hi>Love</hi>) be thus endanger'd;
and Morality so ill treated, between two
such different and distant Parties; if each
of these, notwithstanding their vast Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement,
do yet, in this Matter, so fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agree; to decry Human Nature, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Belief of any immediate Good or
Happiness in <hi>Vertue,</hi> as a Thing any way
suitable to our Make and Constitution; there
is, then, so much the more Need of some
great and known Man to oppose this Current.
<pb facs="tcp:56135:8"/>
And, <hi>here</hi> it is that our <hi>Author</hi> has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
so signally. <hi>Whatsoever</hi> (says he)
<hi>some have said;</hi> Man's Nature <hi>is not so
untoward a Thing (unless it be abused)
but that there is a secret</hi> Sympathy <hi>in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature, with Vertue and Honesty;
which gives a Man an Interest even in bad
Men.—God, in infinite Wisdom, has
so contrived; that, if an Intellectual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sink it self into Sensuality, or any
way defile, and pollute it self; then,
Miseries and Torments should befall it,</hi>
in this State—<hi>VERTUE, and VICE</hi>
(says he) <hi>are the Foundations of</hi> Peace
and Happiness, <hi>or</hi> Sorrow and Misery.—
<hi>There is</hi> inherent Punishment <hi>belonging
to all</hi> Vice; <hi>and no Power can divide or
separate them. For, tho' God should
not, in a</hi> positive Way, <hi>inflict Punishment;
or any Instrument of God punish a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
yet, he would</hi> punish Himself; <hi>his
Misery and Unhappiness would arise</hi> from
Himself.—Thus speaks our excellent
Divine, and truly Christian Philosopher;
whom, for his appearing thus in Defence of
<hi>Natural Goodness,</hi> we may call <hi>the Preacher
of Good-nature.</hi> This is what he insists
on, every-where; and, to make this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
is, in a Manner, the Scope of all his
Discourses. And, in conclusion of all this;
<pb facs="tcp:56135:9"/>
'tis hop'd that what has been here suggested,
may be sufficient to justifie the Printing of
these Sermons.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>our Author</hi> himself; what his
<hi>Life</hi> was; how great an Example of that
happy Temper, and God-like Disposition,
which he labour'd to inspire; how much he
was, for the Excellency of his Life, and
admirable Temper, esteem'd and belov'd of
all; and even in the worst of Times, when
Feuds, and Animosities, on the Account of
Religion, were highest (during the Time
of the late great Troubles,) how his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
and Behaviour drew to him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of all Parties, so as to make him be
remarkably distinguished; how much in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
he was with the greatest Men; and
how many constant Hearers he had of the
best Rank, and greatest Note, even of the
most eminent Divines themselves; this is
sufficiently known. And the Testimony which
the late <hi>Arch-bishop Tillotson</hi> has given
of him, tho' it be in a Funeral Sermon, is
known to be in nothing superiour to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.</p>
                  <p>The Sermons whieh are here Printed, have
been selected out of Numbers of others less
perfect; there being not any of our Author's
extant, but such as were written after him
at Church: He having used no other than
<pb facs="tcp:56135:9"/>
very short Notes, not very legible: Tho'
these have been of great Use to the Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
in whose Hands they have been.</p>
                  <p>The unpolish'd Style, and Phrase of <hi>our
Author,</hi> who drew more from a College,
than a Court; and who was more used to
School-Learning, and the Language of an
University, than to the Conversation of the
fashionable World, may possibly but ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
his Sense to the Generality of
Readers. And, since none of these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
were ever design'd for the World, in
any other Manner than as he (once for all)
pronounc'd them from the Pulpit; they must
of Necessity appear to have a Roughness
in them, which is not found in other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
more accurately penn'd by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
For, tho' the Publisher has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
supplied him out of himself, by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
to a defective Place, that which he
found in some other Discourse, where the
same Subject was treated; yet, so great a
Regard was had to the very <hi>Text,</hi> and <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of <hi>his Author;</hi> that he would not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to alter the least Word: And, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he has added any Thing, to correct
the most apparent Omission, or Fault of the
Pen-man; he has taken Care to have it
mark'd in different Characters: That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might appear as <hi>our Author</hi>'s own,
<pb facs="tcp:56135:10"/>
which was not perfectly <hi>His.</hi> Tho', some
others in the World have been very far from
this Caution: Since, of late, some things
have been set out in <hi>our Author</hi>'s Name,
which his best Friends disown to be his;
and which any one who studies him in his
Genuine Works, will easily know to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of him.</p>
                  <p>And, now, when these Disadvantages
which have been mentioned, are considered;
since they are no more than what sensible
People will easily make Allowance for; 'tis
presum'd there may be in the World some
Persons who will, notwithstanding, think
these Sermons to be of Worth, and may
perhaps discover in them some peculiar Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
such as are not to be despised for want
of that Ornament which might have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
them, I know that there are now
growing up, in the World, too many who are
prejudic'd against all Pulpit-Discourses; and
who, in this prophane Age, are led to think
not only <hi>the Institution of Preaching,</hi> but
even the <hi>Gospel</hi> it self, and <hi>our Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
to be a Fraud. But, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Prejudice of this kind; 'tis to
be hop'd that even some of these Persons (if
they have any Candour left) may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to applaud some Things that they may
meet with, here: So as from hence, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb facs="tcp:56135:10"/>
to like Christianity the better. <hi>This</hi>
we may with Assurance, say; that were
there besides ours, any Religion, Ancient; or
Modern, that had so Divine a Man as
this, to shew; these very Men would admire
and reverence him; and, tho' a Priest of
that Religion, and bound to comply with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish'd
Superstition, would praise his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and, perhaps, be the forwardest to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
his Sentences and Works, in Opposition
to our Sacred Religion. But this is hard,
that even <hi>Heathen Religion,</hi> and <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi>
can be more mildly treated, and cause
less Aversion than <hi>Christianity.</hi> To such
Men as these, I can say nothing further.
But, if they who are thus set against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
cannot be won over, by any Thing
that they may find here; yet we may assure
our selves, at least, of <hi>this</hi> good Effect from
hence; that the excellent Spirit which is
shewn here, and that Vein of Goodness, and
Humanity, which appears throughout these
Discourses, will make such as are already
Christians, to prize and value Christianity
the more: And, the Fairness, Ingenuity,
and Impartiality, which they may learn
from hence, will be a Security to them, against
the contrary Temper of those other irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
Enemies to our Holy Faith.</p>

                  <p>BEcause there are amongst us, those
who are bold to call into questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
DEITY; those who dispute
against the main and principal
Matters of Christian Faith, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Reason</hi> (the Excellency of God's
Creation, by which I will be concluded;)
therefore I make choice of these Words
to deal with them, with their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Never any Man spake as our Lord and
Saviour.</hi>—I will not lay the Stress of
my Argument upon the Credit of those
who spake these Words; for they were
I know not whom: And I will make
no more Advantage than I will give to
the Devil himself, who is related to speak
many things that are <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>orted in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
But I will found my Argument on
the Quality of the Matter.—Yet, it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56135:12"/>
is considerable, that they who are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the contrary * <hi>Party,</hi> are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Enemies, and have a contrary Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
that even <hi>they</hi> are over-born, and
so far subdued, as to make an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</p>
                  <p>There are, among us, Persons, that
are Sensual, and out-right Brutish; that
put off Human Nature, and discharge
themselves of Principles of Reason and
Understanding. I think no Man doubts
of this. It seems to be evident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable.
Yea, they themselves are self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemn'd
in what they do: And Men
that do distemper themselves, and put
themselves out of the Use of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
when they do recover; they wish
they could do otherwise.</p>
                  <p>But, then, there are those that pretend
to dispute against Deity; and, under
Excuse of Reason, pretend to be Atheists.
These make a great Bluster and Noise in
the World, and undertake to defend
themselves with Show and Colour of
Reason and Argument.</p>
                  <p>And again: There are those who will
admit of Principles of Reason to the full,
and all the immediate necessary Results
and unavoidable Deductions from it;
and yet they s<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ick at Reveal'd Truth;
pretending Want of Evidence, and a Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
in point of Assurance, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56135:12"/>
Conviction and Confirmation.
These Men avoid Atheism: But stick in
Infidelity.—* <hi>Now</hi> with him that
pretends to Atheism, or * <hi>who</hi> if he doth
acknowledge Deity, is an Infidel and
sticks at Reveal'd Truth; these <hi>two</hi> last I
will deal with, from this Scripture: For,
* <hi>as for</hi> the first sort; they being self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemn'd,
are easily convinc'd.</p>
                  <p>Among other Excellencies of Divine
Truth, this is none of the smallest
Weight; that when it is declared, it
doth recommend it self to, and satisfies
the Mind of Man concerning its Reality
and Usefulness. Men are wanting to
themselves, that they do not see with
their own Eyes; that they do not make
a particular Search; that they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine;
that they do not consider; or,
in a word, that they do not use the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of discerning. For we that are of
the Reform'd Religion, who deny the
infallible visible Judge, we do allow to
every Christian a private Judgment of
discerning; not * <hi>only</hi> as <hi>his Priviledge</hi>
that God hath granted him; * <hi>but</hi> as his
<hi>Charge.</hi> Where People are of no Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
have no Liberty or Advantage in
respect of Leisure, or other Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
we do advise them to use Modesty,
and Humility, and to be rather Learners
than forward to Teach. For it is good
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56135:13"/>
Councel, and it is that which is done in
all other Affairs: Whosoever he be that
hath not the Opportunity to acquaint
himself with the Mystery; it is safer
for him to make use of other Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
than for him to be peremptory in a
Resolution. But this, for certain, Men
are wanting to themselves, if they do not
see with their own Eyes; if they do
not search and use a Judgment of discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For Men attain to no settled State
in Religion, no Heights or Excellency of
Spirit, who do not make a Discernment
by their Judgments: But they run away
with Presumptions, Suppositions; with
conceited Imaginations, with received
Dictates; are Light of Faith, credulous;
do comply with others in Sence, in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in Practice: And it is their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
so to do; if they will not make
Matters of Knowledge their Business:
There cannot be receiving of Truth in
the Love of it, and consequently in the
certain Obedience of it, where there is
not receiving of Truth, in the particular
Judgment of the certain Verity of it, and
the Sence of the Goodness of it. This
Advantage Truth hath: It hath so much
of Self-evidence, it is so satisfactory to
the Reason of an ingenuous Mind, that
it will prevail, unless there be an Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in the Receiver. This I take for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56135:13"/>
the certainest Matter of Experience: All
things are according to the Disposition
of the Receiver, one Man will interpret
into a Courtesie, that which another
turns into an Injury. According as Men
are in Preparation and Disposition of
Mind, so will things be entertain'd that
are offered to Consideration, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
But Truth, if it doth appear, if it be
represented and fairly proposed; it will
find Entertainment in a Man's Mind; if
a Man's Mind be not by contrary Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
made in an Incapacity. Truth
is the Soul's Health and Strength, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and true Perfection. As increated
Wisdom speaks to God; (<hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30.)
so Truth speaks the same Language to
Man's Soul: <hi>I was by him, as one brought
up with him, I was daily his Delight.</hi> Truth
is so near to the Soul; * <hi>so much</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Image and Form of it; that it may
be said of Truth; that as the Soul is
by <hi>Derivation</hi> from God, so Truth by
<hi>Communication.</hi> No sooner doth the Truth
of God come to our Souls sight, but our
Soul knows her, as her first and old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance:
Which, tho' they have been
by some Accident unhappily parted a
great while; yet having now, through
the Divine Providence, happily met,
they greet one another, and renew their
Acquaintance, as those that were first and
ancient Friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56135:14"/>Truth is of a different Emanation (for
I cannot distinguish Truth in it self; but
in way of descent to us:) <hi>Truth</hi> either
<hi>of first Inscription,</hi> or <hi>of after Revelation</hi>
from God.</p>
                  <p>The Truth of first Inscription is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
to Man, it is the Light of God's
Creation, and it flows from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of which Man doth consist, in his
very first Make: This is the Soul's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
                  <p>And Truth of after Revelation is the
Soul's Cure, the Remedy for the Mind's
Ease and Relief. The great Expectation
of Souls, is the Promise of God's <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah:</hi>
They <hi>wait for the Consolation of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
For this hath been the State of the
World: Man, in Degeneracy and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy,
disabled himself, prejudiced his
Interest in God: Losing his Interest, by
his Degeneracy and Apostacy, he is in
Hope and Expectation of some Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from God, concerning Terms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
and Recovery: And when
these did appear, then * <hi>was it</hi> said;
<hi>Lord now lettest thou thy Servant depart
in Peace.</hi> Here comes Truth of <hi>after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
for the Recovery of Man, when
he was Apostatized from the Truth of
<hi>first Inscription.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former of these, is of things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in themselves, in their Nature, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56135:14"/>
Quality; so, immutable and indispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The latter, is the voluntary Results
and Determinations of the Divine Will.
Things that are of an immutable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible
Nature, we have Knowledge
of them by the Light of first Impression.
The voluntary Results of the Divine
Will, we have by Revelation from God.</p>
                  <p>Man's Observance of God in all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Morality, these are Truths of
<hi>first Inscription;</hi> and these have a deeper
Foundation, greater Ground for them,
than that God gave the Law on Mount
<hi>Sinai;</hi> or that he did after ingrave it
on Tables of Stone; or that we find
the Ten Commandments in the Bible.
For God made Man to them, and did
write them upon the Heart of Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he did declare them upon Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi>
before he ingraved them upon the
Tables of Stone, or before they were
writ in our Bibles: God made Man to
them, and wrought his Law upon Mens
Hearts; and, as it were, interwove it
into the Principles of our Reason; and
the things thereof are the very Sence of
Man's Soul, and the Image of his Mind:
So that a Man doth undo his own Being,
departs from himself, and unmakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
confounds his own Principles, when
he is disobedient and unconformable to
them; and must necessarily be self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56135:15"/>
—The Law externally given
was to revive, awaken Man, after his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
and Sin, and to call him to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
Advertency, and Consideration.
And, indeed, had there not been a Law
written in the Heart of Man; a Law
without him, could be to no Purpose.
For had we not Principles that are <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created;</hi>
did we not know something,
no Man could prove any thing. * <hi>For</hi> he
that knows nothing, grants nothing.
Whosoever finds not within himself, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
sutable to the Moral Law, whence
with Choice he doth comply with it; he
hath departed from himself, and lost the
natural Perfection of his Being: And to
be conformable to this, is the Restitution
to his State.</p>
                  <p>Things of Natural Knowledge, or of
first Inscription in the Heart of Man by
God, these are known to be true as soon
as ever they are proposed: And he hath
abused himself, and forc'd himself from
his Nature, and deformed the Creation
of God in him, whosoever doth not take
Acquaintance with, subscribe to, make
acknowledgement of these great Things,
<hi>The great Principles of Reverence of
Deity: Of Sobriety in the Government
of a Man's own Person: Moderate use of
the Pleasures and Contentments of this
Life: The great Instances of Righteousness
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56135:15"/>
and Justice in Mens Transactions one
with another:</hi> For they are Connatural to
Man.</p>
                  <p>Then, for Truth of Gospel-Revelation,
that, speaks for it self, recommends it
self, and shews it self to be of God. In
this Case, we may say as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to
the Woman: They were brought to take
Cognizance of our Saviour, by the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Report of the Woman: But after
they had had converse with him; <hi>Now,</hi>
say they, <hi>we believe in him, not for thy
Words</hi> (but we credited thee so far forth
as to come and see him:) <hi>but because we
have seen, and heard.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 42.</note>—Such are the
Declarations of Faith in God by Jesus
Christ, of Remission of Sins, of God's
accepting of Sinners upon Repentance,
that any Man that is awake to any true
Apprehensions of God, he will readily
believe them, and embrace them, when
they are declared to him by any Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The great Things of Reveal'd
Truth, tho' they be not of Reason's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
yet they are of the prepar'd
Mind readily entertain'd and receiv'd:
As for Instance: Remission of Sins to
them that repent and deprecate God's
Displeasure; it is the most credible Thing
in the World: For God made us Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
fallible, at the best. Now here is
<hi>finite and fallible;—failing and miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56135:16"/>
—repenting and reforming, upon
a Declaration from God.</hi>—So false is it
that the Matter of our Faith is unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
or that there is any thing unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in Religion; that there is no such
Matter of Credit in the World as the
Matters of Faith; nothing more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.
It was a Mystery <hi>before;</hi> God in
Christ reconciling the World: <hi>Now</hi> all
the World is taken into a Possibility of
receiving Benefits hereby. Tho' there be
nothing of Merit on the Creature's side;
nothing that we can do that can deserve;
yet it is a Matter of very fair Belief, that
the Original of all Beings, the Father of
all our Spirits, the Fountain of all Good,
will, one way or other, pardon Sin, and
do what behoves him, for the Recovery
of his laps'd Creation: And any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Narration made in the Name of
God, of the Way and Means, and the
particular Circumstances whereby God
will do it, will fairly induce Belief with
sober, serious, and considerate Minds: And
what have we to do with others, upon
the Account of Religion? If they be not
serious and considerate, they are not in a
Disposition towards Religion. That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of <hi>the Seed of the Woman breaking the
Serpent's Head:</hi> God hath been speaking
this out further and further, by his vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Revelations in the several Successions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56135:16"/>
of Time: He has represented it in divers
Shapes: But now we have it expounded.
For <hi>the Seed of the Woman is,</hi> God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
in the Flesh: And <hi>breaking the
Serpent's Head</hi> is, destroying the Work
of the Devil. The Anti-type doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
answer the Variety of the Types.
All foretold of our Saviour was fulfill'd
in him.—We have many things in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Stories in several Ages that give
Testimony and Light to Parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
Truth. Many of their Stories are
in Imitation of Scripture History: As
<hi>Nisus</hi>'s Hair in Imitation of <hi>Sampson's:
Deucalion's</hi> Floud in Imitation of <hi>Noah</hi>'s:
<hi>Hercules</hi> in Imitation of <hi>Joshua, &amp;c.</hi>—
Many of the Heathens that were not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by Education, or Interest, or the
Strain of the Time, do relate many things
that are consistent with those that are in
the Bible. St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, he found
the Beginning of the First Chapter of
St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel among the Platonists.
<hi>Eusebius</hi> read in the Commentaries of the
Heathens those Circumstances and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact that the Evangelists do men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and also the Signs at our Saviour's
Crucifying, as the Eclipse of the Sun,
and an Earthquake, and other Accidents.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks of sundry things which
<hi>Pilate</hi> writ to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> sutable to what
the Evangelists relate concerning our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56135:17"/>
Yea, <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself, who is
the last great Impostor, doth mention
the Souldiers apprehending our Saviour
with an Intention to put him to Death:
Acknowledging him to be a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
but he tells us, when those Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were stricken down, God took him
away, and they lighted upon another
something like him, and crucify'd him.
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> an Eminent Author, gives us
an Account of <hi>Pan,</hi> the great Daemon of
the Heathens, who was heard greatly to
complain, that a <hi>Hebrew</hi> Child was born,
and they never heard him after; all the
Oracles then ceasing. <hi>Porphiry,</hi> tho' of
no great Credit, says, that after one whom
they called <hi>Jesus,</hi> came to be worshipp'd,
they never could receive any more Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
by any of their Gods. One of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Emperors was so possess'd with what
was related concerning a Kingly Race
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and was so startled with
the Credibleness of the Report, that he
set himself to destroy all of the Family.
<hi>Publius Lentulus</hi> gives the Senate an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that he saw, himself, and was an
Eye-witness of the Man Jesus among the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who cured all Diseases and raised
from the Dead: Insomuch, that <hi>Tertullian</hi>
bids the Heathen Emperor search their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords:
For your own Kalender * (<hi>says
he</hi>) recites the Things that are done by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56135:17"/>
our Saviour. This, in the Days of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
who was turn'd off, by the Feuds
and Exasperations, by the Factions and
Divisions among those that were call'd
Christians. Insomuch, that he hated Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;
but otherwise, a Man of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Justice, and Good to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
One who was a Philosopher
gives an Account of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<q>The Christian Religion (says he)<note place="margin">Am. Ma.</note>
consisting in Spiritual Worship and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to God, Purity of Mind, holy
and unblameable Conversation; of all
things that are call'd Religion; it is the
most Entire, most Pure; but only
mightily hurt by some who have fill'd
it with superstitious Things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that we may resolve, that the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of Faith arises from the wicked
State of the Subject, rather than from the
Incredibility of the Object. It is hard to
act otherwise than the State from within
doth dispose a Man. It is not imaginable,
that any Man can believe contrary to the
Life he lives in: When he lives in the
State of eternal Death; to believe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life: Or to believe the Pardon of
Sin, when he lives in it, and slights the
Sin he lives in. For our Saviour says,
<hi>You cannot believe because of your wicked
Hearts.</hi> It cannot stand together: To
live in Sin; and to look for Pardon of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56135:18"/>
Sin. For God doth not give to any one
that is impenitent, the Power of Faith.
<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Be not conform'd to this wicked World, but
be ye transform'd by the renewing of your
Mind, that you may prove what is the good
and acceptable Will of God:</hi> Intimating,
that if a Man lead a wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Life; if a Man in respect of State,
Complexion, and Constitution of Soul,
be in Contradiction to the Principles of
Religion, the Principles of God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he cannot <hi>prove what is that good
and acceptable and perfect Will of God.</hi>
They that were in a Religious Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did readily believe and entertain our
Saviour, and acknowledge him to be
the <hi>Messiah</hi> that was promis'd of old: But
those that were perfectly obstinate, in
the Pharisaick Disposition, they rejected
him. And this is clearly true, that Men
cannot believe while they live in Sin, and
are in Impenitency, and are under the
Commands of their Lusts. For we find
that an ingenuous Mind, and one that is
a true Penitent, he doth with more Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
forgive himself, than God doth.
He that is truly affected, and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
turns to God, he is truly sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the Deformity and Impurity of
Sin: Though Repentance give Heart's
Ease and Satisfaction, and tend to
the Quiet of his Mind; yet he doth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56135:18"/>
more hardly excuse himself, than God
doth. But a Man that is wedded to the
World, that is under the Power of his
Lusts, that applauds and magnifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in Self-will, is given up to the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
Arrogancy, and Self-assuming,
how can this Man give himself Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning Pardon of Sin, when he
is in a contrary Spirit, in a contrary Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position?
He cannot believe that God
will pardon Sin; because he himself doth
not pardon any other Offender. God's
Goodness well consider'd, speaks him to
be propitious and inclinable to Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
But Impenitency speaks a Man's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity
of being pardon'd.</p>
                  <p>This is the Sum. All Divine Truth
is of one of these two Emanations:—
Either it flows from God, in the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and Moment of God's Creation;
and then it is the Light of that Candle
which God set up in Man, to light
him; and that which by this Light he
may discover, are all the Instances of
Morality; of good Affection, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
towards God; the Instances of
Justice and Righteousness of Men, and
Temperance to himself:—<hi>Or</hi> else, it
is of an after Revelation and Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Man being out of the Way of his
Creation, by his Defection from God,
is recover'd by this Revelation. Upon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56135:19"/>
this Consideration, that Man was never
better than finite and fallible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that we have given an Offence;
and * <hi>considering</hi> the Relation that God
stands in, to his Creatures; and that
he is the first and chiefest Goodness; it
is * <hi>what</hi> may be fairly supposed, that
God will recover his Creation, one way
or other. Wherefore, <hi>that</hi> which the
New Testament doth discover, is that
which was in general Expectation.</p>
                  <p>Now the Terms of the new Covenant
are possible to Sinners:—They are
Just and Fit, Reasonable and Equal:—
They are to us (who are departed from
Truth) Restorative:—They are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
to our Mind, and quieting to our
Conscience.—For if I have offended
against the Rule of Right, I ought to
repent of it, confess it, be sorry for it,
and do my endeavour to commit it no
more. And there is Reason to think
that God can pardon. For every ones
Right is in his own Power. Every one
doth dispose of his Right in that way
which he will. Since therefore it is God's
Right, upon the Failure of Obedience,
to reduce the Creature by Punishment;
it is in his Power to abate of Punishment if
he pleases, or to remit it. And it is most
reasonable to think, that God should be
allow'd to do this in what way he would.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56135:19"/>Therefore we conclude, that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Christian Doctrine, either they
are fairly knowable, if we use our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and Understanding (* <hi>and these are
the great Instances of Morality and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Reason;</hi>) or else, if we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
those Things that are considerable
in the Case; the Things of Reveal'd
Truth, are of fair and easie Belief. The
former of these, the great Principles of
Reason, they are * <hi>by</hi> awakened Minds
easily and readily found out. The latter
are, * <hi>by</hi> prepar'd Minds, fairly admitted
and entertained. This I say against the
Atheism of the prophane World, and
those that do affect to be Infidels, because
they pretend they have not the Assurance
of former Times, * <hi>nor of</hi> powerful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
                  <p>I will now instance in those Assurances
that we have, to settle us in the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of Divine Truth. And they
are these Five:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. They are concurrent with the Sence
of the Heathens and Strangers, who
do agree with us in all the Instances
of Morality; in these we cannot
speak beyond them, they speak and
act so as to shame us: For how
many of us do act below them in
these Particulars? and as to many
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56135:20"/>
Things of the New Testament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Christ, we have great Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
from them; as was shew'd.</item>
                     <item>II. The Representation that is made to
us by Truth concerning God. He
is represented worthy himself, and
so as we may credit what is said of
him.</item>
                     <item>III. The ingenuous Operation that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Truth hath upon Mens Minds.</item>
                     <item>IV. Its Fitness to Man's State.</item>
                     <item>V. The Agency of the Divine Spirit
in pursuance of it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> As to Morals; we have the full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
with us of Heathen Authors,
all those that are any whit reform'd. And
for the rest, we have a good Rule in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
which tells us, that he is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
to give Testimony upon account
of Morality, that is himself vicious. For
he that is vicious, is himself a Moral
Monster. And upon a Moral Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
every Man is vicious that either is
stupidly ignorant, or dissolute and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane.
And their Judgment in point of
Truth is considerable. In Morals, all
those of the Heathens that have attain'd
to any Reformation, either to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of their Intellectuals, or the
Refinement of their Morals, they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
with these immutable and indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56135:20"/>
Verities. And as to those reveal'd;
the several Parts of History concur in all
the Things that the Evangelists do declare
concerning Christ. It is very true, there
have been in the World several Persons
that have grosly neglected the Materials
of Natural Knowledge; so that Men have
suffered their Faculties to lie asleep: The
Mind and Understanding have been in
most Men useless and unemploy'd: And
there hath been invincible <hi>Ignorance</hi> as to
the great Points of Reveal'd Truth in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ages and Places of the World: But
this I dare assure you; that there never
was any considerable <hi>Opposition</hi> against the
main Principles of Natural or Reveal'd
Truth, by those that have any knowledge
of it. No Man of any Competency of
Knowledge, or Proportion of Goodness,
hath risen up against any of these great
Instances of Morality, or the main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Christian Faith: But these have
had (as I may say) <hi>Universal Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
For if any have risen up against
them; they have been incompetent; and
so of no Moral Consideration: The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Acknowledgement of a Thing for
Truth doth not lie in every individual
Persons receiving it (for then you have
nothing that is of Universal Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement;)
but in the due and even
Proportion it bears to the Universal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56135:21"/>
of Mankind. This Principle no Man
in his Wits will deny, <hi>That it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the same thing should be, and not
be, at the same time.</hi> Yet some were so
perverse and cross, absurd, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from sober Reason, that they did
deny it. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
yet was ever in the World so absurd,
but some have held it.</hi> Therefore we may
entertain that which any sober Man in
the due Use of Reason hath entertain'd,
and proposed, upon Terms of Reason,
for the Satisfaction of others. And we
may conclude, that the Universal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of a Thing as Truth, it
doth not depend upon every individual
Persons receiving of it; but upon the
even and true Proportion that things
bear to the Universal Reason of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
This is all that can be said, when
Men pretend to prove any thing by Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Reason. Thus the Being of a God
is proved by Universal Reason. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
only Monsters (those that are, upon
the Account of Morality, very Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
Persons that have grosly neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Understandings, and lived like
Beasts;) none else but have acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Deity.</hi> Men improved in their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals,
and refin'd in their Morals, have
received and entertain'd it on Grounds of
Reason.—It is observable, that the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56135:21"/>
great Differences that have been between
Men in the several Ages of the World;
they have not been about any necessary
and indispensable Truth, nor any thing
that is declared plainly in any Text of
Scripture: But all the Differences have
been either in Points of very curious and
nice Speculation, or in Arbitrary Modes
of Worship. Now, notwithstanding these
Differences; I dare say, and give assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that God gives Men leave, with a
safe Conscience, to live in Peace, and to
keep the Communion of the Church of
God in the World, and to submit to the
Government. Whosoever hath professed
himself a Christian doth acknowledge
Christ to be the Head. The Christian
World scattered into particular Ways,
and multiplied into Sects and Parties, yet
do agree in the great and bright Truths
of Reason and Christianity, such as are
fixed, and of the greatest Magnitude.
The <hi>Mahometans</hi> themselves did never
charge <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> as being Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors:
For they acknowledge <hi>Moses,</hi> as
we do, for a true Prophet; and go along
with us in the History of Christ, till the
Fourteenth of <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. and
there is their first Departure. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
all that is related concerning
Christ: Only they tell us that what Christ
said of sending the Spirit, and another
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56135:22"/>
Comforter, is meant of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> and
they tell us that our Saviour set down his
Name; but afterwards his Disciples put it
out. They acknowledge Christ to be a true
Prophet, and beyond <hi>Moses;</hi> and out of
respect to him, they deny all that is said
about his Death and Crucifixion.</p>
                  <p>Reason doth <hi>suppose</hi> two things by
which we may be further confirm'd in the
Truth of our Religion.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>(1<hi>st.</hi>) That if it had been a Cheat and
an Imposture, it would have been depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in length of Time: being often
told, and in several Ages and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
sometimes by parts, sometimes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and under several Circumstances,
and upon several Occasions; there would
have been some Differences in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Had there been any thing false in
our Religion, * <hi>or that were</hi> not solid,
true and substantial; it having past
through sixteen Ages, being above Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred Years old, those Men that
lived before us being inferiour to none of
us for Parts; they would have depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
it as guilty, and forewarn'd us of
it. Therefore we may take it for granted
that the great Matters of Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Faith, that have pass'd through
so many Ages and Generations are solid,
true, and substantial; and that the Book
call'd <hi>the Bible,</hi> which hath run done,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56135:22"/>
from the time of our Saviour and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
to this Day, may be received with
double Assurance, Credit, and Advantage.
For Error and Falshood is never long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd:
but Truth is Eternal, and that
which will continue for ever.</item>
                     <item>(2<hi>dly.</hi>) I do <hi>suppose</hi> another thing with
great Reason: and that is, considering
the Goodness of God, the Care he has of
his Creatures, his Love to Truth, and the
Respect that he bears to those that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him; that he would not suffer the
Good Intentions of such, to be abused by
any Imposture, nor suffer that which is
false to take such place in all Times and
Ages of the World, without the least
Check or Controul.—But some may
object; if this be so; what say you to
the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and the great <hi>Factions</hi>
that have been in the World and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed?
Are not these, Testimonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Truth of our Religion?
—As for <hi>Mahomet;</hi> he had only the
Assistance of an Apostate Monk who
taught him to compound a Religion out
of Gentilism and Judaism, and in the
Composition that he hath made, so far
as he hath added any thing of his own,
it is so contemptible to sober Reason, and
so contrary to those things that he hath
taken out of the Old Testament, that it
is not hard to detect him for a Cheat and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56135:23"/>
an Imposter. For devest him but of those
things which he stole out of the Bible;
and that which is his own, will appear
base, vile, and contemptible to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Mankind, and most ridiculous.
Now if God had given Testimony to <hi>his</hi>
Religion; it would have been in a way
of Reason, and most agreeable to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
of Men; and not in a way
of stupid Ignorance: but in such a way
as might challenge the greatest Opposers
to find any thing contrary to those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Reason and Understanding which
he hath planted in Man's Mind. But as
to <hi>Mahomet;</hi> History doth declare him
to be a Person of a Debauch'd Life; and
one that had not Credit in the time of his
Life.—As to the great Factions that
have been in the several Ages; though
they have been many Persons; yet they
have been but one <hi>Party:</hi> and one Party
is to be consider'd but as one Opinion:
for if there be a thousand Men in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
it is but <hi>one</hi> Opinion: and one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Person is as much as a whole Party.
All those of a Party are bound up to one
Opinion, * <hi>and to believe as their Party
believes.</hi> Therefore I except against those
that have blindly gone on without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
For these have not acted by
the Guidance of Humane Reason.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56135:23"/>Now I shall give you some <hi>Intrinsick
Arguments,</hi> by which I shall convince
those of their Wickedness, and Folly,
that affect either Atheism, or Infidelity.
The first is this, (which is the second As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
we have of Divine Truth) The
Representation that Religion makes to
the Mind of Man concerning God: even
such a Representation as the Mind of
Man, if duly used, and well informed,
would conceive concerning him. For God
is represented Lovely, Amiable, and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
in the Eyes of Men: and what is
said of God, is worthy of Him, and is
consistent with what Man is <hi>made</hi> to
think, or know, concerning him. For
this is truly Divine, and God-like, to do
Good, to relieve, to compassionate: and
on the contrary it is Diabolical, and most
opposite to the Divine Nature, to destroy,
to grieve, to oppress. And what a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth the Bible make of God to be
Merciful, Gracious, Long-suffering, Full
of Compassion?—So, * <hi>on the other
side,</hi> how is the Devilish Nature describ'd
and represented to us?—The Devilish
Nature is hurtful, given to Malice, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and Revenge: but the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is placable, and reconcileable; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to forgive, full of Compassion, and of
great Goodness, and Kindness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:56135:24"/>
This, for the Representation that both
Old and New Testament make of God,
and this is agreeable to the Sense of every
awaken'd Mind. All that the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
is, Repentance from Dead Works,
and Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. And
this is the Sum of all that is declared and
super-added, and nothing in all the
World can be declared or required upon
Terms of greater Justice, Reason, and
Equity. For will not any one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that if an Inferiour give Offence
to a Superiour, he ought to humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and ask Forgiveness? Can any
Man's Reason in the World be unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in this?—Then, for Faith in our
Lord Jesus Christ: is it not very equal,
and fit, that if God will pardon Sin, he
should do it in what way he thinks fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?
that if we go to him for Cure, he
should take that way to recover us which
he thinks best?</p>
                  <p>So that these * <hi>Terms</hi> which are super-added
to the Principles of God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are such, that there were never
more equal, fit, and reasonable, proposed
to Men: neither is this all: but they are
satisfactory to the Reason of our Mind:
For this is found to be true upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the Mind of an Impenitent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receive Satisfaction nor Consolation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56135:24"/>
in any other way. Should all the Men
in the World, or an Angel from Heaven
speak * <hi>Pardon</hi> to an Impenitent; the
Sense of Repentance would be better Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to his Mind; beyond any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Testimony whatsoever. Though
God should tell me, my Sins were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd;
I could not believe it, unless I
repent and deprecate God's Displeasure.
For Repentance is satisfactory to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of my Mind; is necessary to quiet
my Conscience; and I should not be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
or intelligent in Religion unless I
satisfied my Mind: which is to do what
I can to revoke what I have done amiss,
and to deprecate God's Displeasure; and
then apply to him for his Grace, in that
way which he has declared.</p>
                  <p>Therefore these * <hi>Terms</hi> are not only
just and equal in themselves; but tend to
the Quiet and Satisfaction of a Man's
Mind; * <hi>and</hi> are Restorative to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
—Now the Representation that
is made to us by Divine Truth, either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
or reveal'd, is that which is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
and consonant to the Reason of
our Mind: it is that which doth justly
represent God, as he stands in opposition
to the Cruel, Devilish, and Apostate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
as being Placable, Compassionate,
and Reconciling: and <hi>so,</hi> in the use of
true Reason a Man would have thought
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56135:25"/>
and imagin'd concerning him; that he
would not be wanting to afford unto
Men fitting Aid and Assistance for their
Recovery. And thus is God represented
Lovely, Beautiful, and Amiable, in the
Eyes of the whole Creation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>* <hi>Another</hi> Intrinsick Argument (which
is the <hi>Third Assurance</hi> of Divine Truth)
is, the ingenuous Operation that Divine
Truth, both Natural and Reveal'd, hath
upon the Mind and Understanding of
Man. For these Truths call Creatures to
Self-resignation, to commit themselves to
God, to depend upon him. And how
doth this tend to the Heart's Ease, * <hi>and
to the</hi> Quiet, and Satisfaction of a Man's
Soul? For we know by Experience that
even the best, and wisest of us, are oft
times transcended by our Occasions, and
at a loss. The Affairs of the World do
transcend the Capacities of our Mind and
Understanding. Now Religion both
Natural, and Reveal'd, doth teach us,
that in respect of God we are but Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
assumed, determin'd, and limitted,
(and it is no Disparagement to an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
if it fail) that we are but Creatures;
and have our Dependence upon him.
And how doth this tend to the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Minds! because we know that
God is wiser than we, and that he is
greater, and every way better than we:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56135:25"/>
* <hi>So that if any thing succeed ill;</hi> which
either the Honour of God, or the Good
of his Creatures, * <hi>seem'd to</hi> require;
then, we being but God's Instruments,
and subservient to him, * <hi>may</hi> know that
we should not have failed, unless God
would. Thus our Religion teaches us
Submission to God, Acknowledgment of
him, Dependence upon him: It assignes
to Man his proper place respectively to his
true Center; and so lays a Foundation of
Heart's Ease, Quiet, Content, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
The Grace of the Gospel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we hope to be saved, doth not only
give Continuance, Help, real Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and Assistance to Natural Truth,
(which lost much by Man's Apostacy
from God; and so needed a hand to help
it up:) but it also doth its own proper
work; by emptying the Mind of Man of
Wilfulness, Presumption, and Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
which is incident to his Nature; and
so making room for the help of Grace,
and Divine Assistance, and Forgiveness.
—But to pursue this Argument a little
further.</p>
                  <p>A Gospel-Spirit doth excel in Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Gentleness, Modesty, Humility, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
Forbearance: and these are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Endowments, and mightily qualify
Men to live in the World. This is that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56135:26"/>
which makes Men bear universal Love
and Good-will; and over-comes Evil
with Good.—This I dare say, had we
a Man among us that we could produce,
that did live an exact Gospel-Life; were
the Gospel a Life, a Soul, and a Spirit to
him, as Principles upon Moral Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are; this Man, for every thing
that is excellent, and worthy, and useful
would be miraculous and extraordinary
in the Eyes of all Men in the World:
Christianity would be recommended to
the World by his Spirit. Were a Man
sincere, honest, and true in the way of
his Religion; he would not be grievous,
intollerable, or unsufferable to any Body;
but he would command due Honour,
and draw unto himself Love and Esteem.
For the true Gospel-Spirit is transcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and eminently remarkable every way,
for those things that are Lovely in the
Eyes of Men; for Ingenuity, Modesty,
Humility, Gravity, Patience, Meekness,
Charity, Kindness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—And for all
this that I have said, I will refer you but
to that of the Apostle, where he doth
set out the <hi>fruits of the Spirit,</hi> and the
<hi>works of the Flesh:</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 20.</note> He tells you, that <hi>the
works of the Flesh are Hatred, Malice, Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
Strife, Sedition, and such like:</hi> All
of a kind; and all of them do speak Hell
broke-loose, and come in upon us in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56135:26"/>
World. For these are from Hell, and tend
to Hell, and represent to us in this World
the Hellish State that we dread to meet
with hereafter.—But on the other side;
the fruits of the Divine-Spirit in Men,
they are <hi>Love,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Joy, Patience, Long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
Meekness, Gentleness,</hi> and such like.
And all of these are such lovely things
that they make Heaven, in a degree,
where they are found. * <hi>Whereas</hi> the
former turn the World into a kind of
Hell.</p>
                  <p>Such is the Nature of Religion, that
it keeps the Mind in a good Frame and
Temper: it establishes a healthful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of Soul, and makes it fit to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
it self duly in all its Offices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, with its self, and with Men.
Whereas the Mind of a wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Man, is a very Wilderness, where
Lust and exorbitant Passions bear down
all before them; and are more fierce and
cruel than Wolves and Tygers. So the
Prophet, <hi>Isaiah 57. 20. The Wicked is
like the Raging Sea, always casting forth
Mire and Dirt:</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. ver. 12.
<hi>One had better meet a Bear robbed of her
Whelps, than a Fool in his Folly:</hi> and you
all know who is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Fool; even
every wicked Man.—The Heavenly
State consists in the Mind's Freedom from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56135:27"/>
these kind of things. It doth clear the
Mind from all impotent and unsatiable
Desires, which do abuse a Man's Soul, and
make it restless and unquiet: It sets a
Man free from eager impetuous Loves;
from vain and disappointing Hopes;
from lawless and exorbitant Appetites;
from frothy and empty Joys; from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
presaging Fears, and anxious Cares;
from inward Heart-burnings; from Self-eating
Envy, from swelling Pride, and
Ambition; from dull and black Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly;
from boyling Anger, and rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fury; from a gnawing, aking Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
from Arbitrary Presumption;
from rigid Sowerness, and Severity of
Spirit: for these make the Man that is
not byass'd and principled with Religion,
inwardly to boyl; to be Hot with the
Fervours of Hell;<note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 57. 20.</note> and, <hi>like the troubled
Sea, when it cannot rest, whose Waters cast
up Mire and Dirt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But on the other side; Things that are
con-natural in the way of Religion, the
<hi>Illapses,</hi> and Breakings in of God upon
us; these require a Mind that is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Passion; but in a serene and quiet
Posture; where there is no tumult of
Imagination. It is observed among the
Rabins that if a Prophet fall into a Rage
and Passion, the Spirit of Prophesie leaves
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56135:27"/>
him. They say that <hi>Moses</hi> did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
after the Spirit of Passion moved
him. But sure it is, there is no genuine
and proper effect of Religion, where the
Mind of Man is not composed, Sedate, and
calm. I find among the Philosophers,
that they never had expectation of any
Noble Truth, from any Man that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Power of Lust, or under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Fancy and Imagination; or that
lived in the Common Spirit of the World.
They thought that God did not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
himself to such. But this is certain;
that no Man that is immers'd in a sensual
Brutish Life, can have any true Notion
of Heaven, or of Glory. These things
must signifie no more to him, than a <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Happiness, and sensual Enjoyment;
than the highest and greatest Gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Animal Principle: all that he
can think of Heaven is, that it is a Place
of great Enjoyment; some Local Glory;
something that is suitable to the sensual
Mind. For we cannot ascend higher in
our Actings than we are in our Beings,
and Understandings: And these Men
that think our Happiness lyes in the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Objects of Delight, are not capable
of understanding either the Reason or
Necessity of Mortification, inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal,
and Regeneration, in order to
admittance into Heaven. For they do not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56135:28"/>
look upon Heaven as a State and Temper
of Mind, which is requisite to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the Nature of God, and to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Mind and Will.—But
Religion is the Introduction of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Life into the Soul of Man: and
Men cannot possibly be really happy in
the separate State, but by these things;
by having a Divine Love ruling in their
Hearts; by Self-resignation, and Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Divine Will, and by being
like unto God.</p>
                  <p>Things are very well known what
they are in being, by what they are in
working; what the Principle of them is,
by the effect that flows from them. Now I
may say of Divine Truth, whether Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
or Reveal'd, that these do satisfie the
Mind of Man, and keep him from being
barbarous, cruel, and inhumane. Raligion
doth give such Evidence and Assurance
of it self, that if you put it in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with any thing that any Natural Man,
whether Atheist or Infidel doth ever rest
upon; it will appear to have a greater
Foundation in Nature, and * <hi>on</hi> the
Grounds and Principles of common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Equity, and Justice, than any thing
which can be set up against it, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
it. And Reveal'd Truth super-added
to Natural, doth not only give as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
to it, and helps to recover <hi>that</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:56135:28"/>
which we know by the Light of God's
Creation, (which is weakned by Man's
Sin, and * <hi>his</hi> Apostacy from God) but
it doth also do its own proper work, and
teach a Man to return to his own place,
to acknowledge God, depend upon him,
and be subservient to him: * <hi>It teaches
him</hi> to empty his Mind of all Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Pride, Arrogance, and Self-assuming:
So that a Man is fit to receive the Grace
of Pardon and Forgiveness of Sin, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all Divine Influence, Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and Assistance.</p>
                  <p>But since I have laid so mighty a
weight, and so great a stress upon this
Acknowledgment in the Text; I must
needs here prevent an Objection which
may be raised; and it is this.—Some
may object, and say, you have no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority for these words: for tho'
they are in the Bible; they are but here
<hi>related.</hi> I confess I have no more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from these words, (being spoken
by these Persons of whom they are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
than if they were clean the contrary
to what they are. For I do find concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Lord and Saviour, that some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of like Disposition, say, that he did
do his Miracles by <hi>Belzebub</hi> the Prince of
Devils: and if we lay the stress upon the
Sayers; we must as well credit them, as
these. Therefore I will grant you, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56135:29"/>
I have no Authority for ought I have said,
from these words materially consider'd,
or as related and put down here: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I lay any weight or stress on the
Sense of these Reporters: for I will grant
that it might be hap-hazard what these
Men said; for as much as they did not
speak out of any purpose or intention, or
out of any settled Principle: and such
Men have, upon the like occasion, given
a clean contrary Report.—Now I will
give you a profitable Observation from
hence. Take care how you quote Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
for <hi>that</hi> is Scripture for which you
have Divine Authority; not <hi>that</hi> which
is barely related in the Text. For you have
the Speeches of the Devil, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the worst or Men related in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
—Scripture is only consider'd in
the truth of Matter of Fact, and that
these things were done: but it doth not
follow from hence that they are materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Good: No Man must pretend to do
as <hi>Ehud</hi> did; because his Action is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in Scripture. No Man must pretend
to borrowing without Intention of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did: for if they had
not extraordinary warrant, they were
* <hi>to be</hi> condemn'd in their Practice. So,
for us, to curse our Enemies, as we read
in the <hi>Psalms</hi> the Prophet did, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in what Spirit it was done; * <hi>it</hi> is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56135:29"/>
not warrantable for us to do the like
from thence. Neither must we hate any,
because the Jews were to hate and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the <hi>Seven Nations;</hi> which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
a Commission to hate <hi>all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
but themselves.</hi> Therefore in like
case, we cannot certainly prove that any
thing in the Book of <hi>Job</hi> is certainly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
that was spoken by <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends;
because God himself declares, that they
had not spoken that which was right
concerning him, as his Servant <hi>Job</hi> had
done. Therefore if you will have Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority; see what is said; and
think it not enough that it is barely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in the Book. Neither is it enough
to pretend to a single Text, nor the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
or Perswasion of any Man whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
nor to any thing accidentally spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that can amount either to Matter of
Faith, or Divine Institution: it must be
express Scripture; it must be Scripture in
conjunction with Scripture: For Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as a Rule of Faith, is not one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
but all. And therefore, tho' I have
taken advantage from these words; yet
all along, I have laid such certain and
such infallible Grounds tending to give
Satisfaction in the Matters of Reason and
Faith, as the several Points are capable
of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56135:30"/>
And now I proceed to a fourth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is this.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> The Suitableness of Natural Truth to
Man in the State of his Creation: And
the Suitableness of Reveal'd Truth to
Man in his lapsed and fallen Condition,
in order to his Restitution and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                  <p>And first, for the Suitableness of that
which we call <hi>Natural Religion.</hi>—Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Religion was the very Temper and
Complexion of Man's Soul, in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Creation: It was his natural
Temper, and the very Disposition of his
Mind: It was as con-natural to his Soul,
as Health to any Man's Body. So that
Man forc'd himself, offered Violence to
himself, and his Principles, went against
his very make and Constitution, when
he departed from God: And consented
to Iniquity.—It is the same thing in
Moral Agents, to observe and comply
with the Dictates of Reason, as it is with
inferior Creatures, to act according to
the Sense and <hi>Impetus</hi> of their Natures.
It is the same thing with the World of
intelligent and voluntary Agents, to do
that which right Reason doth demand
and require, as it is in Sensitives, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Guidance of their Sences, or in
Vegetatives to act according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56135:30"/>
It is as natural for a Man, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Principles of God's Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in him, to live in Regard, Reverence,
and Observance of Deity; to govern
himself according to the Rule of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and Temperance; to live in Love;
and to carry himself well in God's Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
this, I say, is as natural for him, as
for a Beast to be guided by his Sences, or
for the Sun to give light.—How far
therefore are we degenerated and fallen
below the State in which God created us;
since it is so rare a thing for us to comply
with the Reason of Things!—No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more certainly true, than that all
Vice is unnatural, and contrary to the
Nature of Man. All that we call Sin,
that which is nought, and contrary to
the Reason of Things, is destructive of
Human Nature: And a Man forceth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
when he doth it. So that, to comply
with those Principles of natural Light and
Knowledge which God did implant in
us, in the Moment of our Creation; and
exactly to be obedient to the Ducture of
Reason; is con-natural to Man, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the State of God's Creation.
And it may be as well expected from an
intelligent Agent, to observe God, and to
live righteously, and soberly, as from any
sensitive Agent, to follow its Appetite.
—Humility, Patience, Meekness, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56135:31"/>
such like Vertues, they do favour Nature;
whereas Passion, Pride, and Envy do
waste and destroy Nature.—<hi>Nature</hi>'s
Desires are all moderate, and limited:
But <hi>Lust</hi> is violent and exorbitant. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is content with a very few things.
But if a Man give way to inordinate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
then there is no Satisfaction to be
obtain'd. Lust is not a thing that will
be satisfied by adding and adding: But
he that would be satisfied, must abate and
moderate his Desires, and undue Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
—It is certain, that all <hi>Natural
Truth,</hi> all that is founded in Reason, and
that derives from the Principles of God's
Creation; that all of these, do agree
with Man's Constitution, in the State of
Innocency.</p>
                  <p>And for Reveal'd Truth; <hi>that</hi> fits and
supplies Man, in his lapsed State.—Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man that knows his State, feels want
in himself, of Health and Strength. And
Reveal'd Truth is <hi>that</hi> which doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
this Want: And is <hi>that</hi> which he
would have wish'd for, from God. In
this, he hath Terms proposed to him of
Pardon and Reconciliation, upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and returning to God. Never
did Patient and Physician meet more
happily; Disease, and Physick; than
Man in a lapsed Condition, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals
that are through the Grace of God
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56135:31"/>
in the Gospel. In the <hi>one</hi> there is Man
full of Misery; in the <hi>other</hi> the Grace of
God for Mercy and Forgiveness. Man's
Language in that State is,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>O wretched
Man, who shall deliver me from this Body
of Death!</hi> The Grace of the Gospel puts
these Words into his Mouth; <hi>I thank
God through Jesus Christ my Lord, that he
hath deliver'd me.</hi> And he is bid to have
no evil Heart of unbelief. There is a
State of Guilt on the one side; a State
of Justification on the other: A State of
Sin; and a State of Holiness: Fear of
eternal Death: And a Promise of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life.—So that the Grace of the
Gospel is fitted to Man in his lapsed State
and Condition, in order to his Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Recovery.</p>
                  <p>The fifth and last Argument is, <hi>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
of the Divine Spirit, in pursuance of
what God hath done in the Way of Divine
Truth.</hi> For God sends not his Truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World alone: But having done
one thing; will also do another, to make
the former effectual. Now they that have
not the Divine Spirit, want the great
Commentator upon Divine Truth in the
World. And therefore let such Men
look after it. For this is a great and a
certain Truth; that God, in his Grace
and Goodness, will give his Spirit to
guide, and teach, and assure the Minds
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56135:32"/>
of good Men: Tho' none know it but
those that feel him. But they who have
the Spirit of God, know nothing more
certain. For they have Satisfaction, and
inward Peace, and Joy in believing:
They perceive such Operations of God
in themselves, whereof the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receive any Account. The Divine
Spirit doth open their Understandings,
as it did the Apostles; brings Things to
their Remembrance; mekes them consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Inwards of Things; and calls
them to Advertency and Consideration.
The great Work of the Divine Spirit is
to lead Men into right Apprehensions,
and stay a Man's Thoughts in Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
till the Principles do receive Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance,
and become a Temper and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
till they infuse and instil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and make a lasting Impression.
Tho' for my part, I do believe, that the
Scripture is clear and full of Light, as to
all Matters of Conscience, as to all Rules
of Life, as to all necessary Matters of
Faith: So that any well-minded Man that
takes up the Bible and reads, may come
to Understanding and Satisfaction. And
hence it is that we have Sufficiency from
God, to preserve us from Cheats of all
sorts. So that a well-minded Man, that
hath this Instrument of God, need not
be mistaken in any necessary Matters of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56135:32"/>
Faith. For the Bible is sufficient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
in the Way of Religion, and
for all the Purposes thereof, as any other
Book, for the Learning of any other Art
or Science. And upon this Account God
hath done that which will justifie him;
and at our Peril be it, if we be found ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
or have been deceived. For we
needed not ever have been ignorant, or
mistaken in any thing that is vital in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
and to this Purpose there is also
the Divine Spirit still to attend upon this
Instrument of God. So that they who do
acknowledge God, and pray unto him
for his Help and Assistance, have the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of being taught by the Spirit,
and by Means thereof, are in a sure Way
of Knowledge, with the consequent Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Holiness and Goodness.</p>
                  <p>By these <hi>Five</hi> Arguments, a Man may
be resolved against the Atheism, Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and Prophaneness of the World.
And from this Discourse, about which I
have been long, I do infer.</p>
                  <p>That Atheism and Infidelity are the
most unaccountable Things in the
World, and inexcusable. The Athiest
must be <hi>every where</hi> self-condemned:
And the Infidel <hi>within the Pale of the
Church.</hi> There is nothing that God hath
done more in any way whatsoever, than
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56135:33"/>
he hath done for the Security of Men
against Atheism. For I dare say, if any
Man do but think, and use Reason, he
may know all Natural Truth. And what
can a Man do less? How is he a Man, if
he do not either of these? Doth any
Man know any thing but by Thinking
and Considering? Yea, perhaps, <hi>this</hi> is
all that we pretend to: For we are born
to nothing else. All Habits and Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
all actual Knowledge, is our own
Acquisition (with respect to the Grace of
God.) No Man is born to any actual
Knowledge in the World, or to speak
a Word, or understand a Notion: But
all Habits and Dispositions are acquired.
And therefore an Atheist shall be self-condemned,
as one that never used his
Reason, nor so much as exercised his
own Thoughts. And for the Infidel
within the Pale of the Church: If he
will but search and consider; he may
find that which will beget Faith and
Belief. And therefore the Athiest and
the Infidel are the most unaccountable
and unexcusable Persons in the World:
For they have done nothing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
They have not so much as
thought or consider'd; they have not
seen with their own Eyes.—If a Man
living in the World, or in the Church,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56135:33"/>
be either an Atheist, or an Infidel; he
hath been an idle Person in the World,
and a Sluggard. His Understanding hath
received no Culture or Care; he hath
made no Improvement of himself, nor
done any thing worthy of a Man.</p>

                  <p>Now if * <hi>this be</hi> so; we may concur,
in Sence and Resolution, with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle:
<hi>I am not ashamed of the Gospel,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I am not ashamed.</hi>—This intimates,
that there is some where Matter of <hi>Shame,</hi>
within the Compass of the Business. Now
here Man's Apostacy, and Sin, these are
shameful Things: Which was the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Gospel-Revelation. The Grace
of the Gospel, which comes to repair,
and to restore, puts us in mind of our
ruinous and necessitous Condition: So
that there is cause of Shame in the Case
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56135:35"/>
tho' Cause of Glory and Triumph in the
Grace of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is the Power of God unto Salvation.</hi>
POWER, not <hi>strictly;</hi> as limiting to
one Perfection: But eminently to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the Efficacy of Divine Grace
* <hi>these two Things, viz.</hi> Regeneration,
Nativity from above (which is the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of this State;) Glorification, and
consummating us in Holiness; which is
the Salvation of the Future.</p>
                  <p>To advance this Grace, and to raise
our Apprehensions of it, consider the
Author of it (it is the Effect of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom, the Fruit of the Divine
Love:) What it is in it self: <hi>And</hi> of what
Benefit to us.</p>
                  <p>There must be Greatness of Power to
erect such a Fabrick and Structure as the
World is; and Excellency of Wisdom,
to administer the Affairs of it, in all Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Cases. Now it is pitty any should
do the like, that cannot also recover, and
restore, if Necessity require: For so
should finite and fallible (as we are) if in
any Error or Mistake, be under an Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of Redemption. It is according
to Nature's Sence, rather never to have
been; than for ever to be irrecoverably
miserable. Wherefore, if I believe God
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56135:36"/>
made me; I will also believe God can
restore me.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is clearer in Reason, nothing
is fuller in Scripture, than that God is
the first and chiefest Good. In respect of
his Relation to his Creatures, earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
do but resemble him: <hi>John</hi> 3. 16.
<hi>God so loved the World, that he gave his
only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. It must be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Goodness and Compassion:
because it was that which we cannot say,
he was at all bound to do: It was that
which he could not be constrain'd to do:
It was that which he was no Gainer by:
for our Righteousness is not profitable to
him.—The Gospel of Christ is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Humane Reason. Man neither
prevented God, nor recompenced him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Only the Necessity of Man's State
required it; and God's Goodness afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it: the Excellencies of Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Goodness, and Power, are display'd
in it.</p>
                  <p>It's not a Mystery now; tho' formerly
it was <hi>hid from Ages and Generations.</hi> But
now it is <hi>the Council of God's Will decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Col. 1. 26.</note>
—He that <hi>darkens words without
Knowledge,</hi> brings us back again to the
Infancy of the World. It was the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and Shortness of the Mosaical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56135:36"/>
that it was Tipical, Mystical,
Ceremonial, Symbolical; full of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
things that did vail and darkly
represent. Obscurity is Imperfection, as
Darkness in comparison with Light. Life
and Immortality, and all * <hi>the</hi> Principles
of it are brought to Light through the
Gospel.</p>
                  <p>The Gospel is admirable Speculation;
excellent Matter of Knowledge: for here
is the Revocation of an insolent bold Act
of Usurpation upon God, by Christ's full
Submission and intire Self-resignation. A
Prince and a Saviour is raised up by God,
sent into the World, not to make Havock,
to ruine and destroy; not as it is 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
12. 31. where the People were put under
Saws and Harrows of Iron, made to pass
thorough Brickilns: a thing intolerable
to behold; dreadful to read of: (tho'
in this impotent incompetent World,
many great Warriours are made famous
for such things, even in unjustifiable
War:) but he came to give Repentance
and Forgiveness of Sin: He came to seek,
and to save that which was lost.</p>
                  <p>The Gospel is a <hi>Vital Principle,</hi> not of
Natural Life, but Divine; <hi>as</hi> it satisfies
the Reason of our Minds by Removal of
Fears and Doubts, by the Life of Faith,
Affiance, and Trust in God:—and, <hi>as</hi>
it reforms our Spirits and Lives; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56135:37"/>
and communicating Principles of
Goodness and Righteousness: * <hi>by which</hi>
we are made Partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The Substance of the Gospel is, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from Dead Works, and Faith in the
Lord Jesus Christ. These do go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and encourage each other: in as
much as no Man repents, who doth not
believe: nor can any believe, who doth
not repent. <hi>To believe,</hi> there is requisite
an internal Disposition and Preparation
of the Subject, as well as a Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to build upon. <hi>John</hi> 5. 44. <hi>Can you
believe who receive Honour one of another,
and seek not Honour from God?</hi> The same
is in all Cases of Inordinacy and Sin. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Faith in the Gospel, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
used: <hi>He that believeth on the
Son hath eternal life,</hi> John. 3. 36. Now
he doth not really believe, who doth not
truly intend to do answerably. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
calls <hi>believing</hi> on Christ, <hi>receiving of
him.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">John. 1. 12.</note> If we receive him; then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him <hi>such</hi> as he is, and to <hi>such</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and Purposes as God sent him for:
Now God sent him to bless us, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us from our Iniquities. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
useth <hi>Synecdoches.</hi> Sometimes <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi>
is put for the whole of Religion:
sometimes <hi>Repenting:</hi> sometimes <hi>Fearing:</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:56135:37"/>
sometimes <hi>Love.</hi> If we would not be
partial, nor deceive our selves; we must
always take in, all concomitant Acts.
Scripture, as the Rule of Faith, is not <hi>one
single Text,</hi> (which may be short, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
another thing) but <hi>the fulness of
Scripture.</hi> In all other cases, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
doth according as he thinks.
Faith includes an Intention of new Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>I may with great Reason say, that the
Matter of the Gospel is <hi>a Vital Principle:</hi>
as it satisfies the Reason of our Mind, * <hi>and</hi>
so sets us as Rest and Quietness within
our selves; as thereby seeing and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that we are out of danger.—In the
intellectual Nature, a Principle of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<hi>as to the Understanding,</hi> is Vital;
as well as an habitual Disposition, <hi>as to
the Will.</hi> What more Satisfaction can
there be to the Reason of our Minds,
* <hi>what more</hi> tending to the Quiet of our
Consciences, than to be assured, in a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of such Importance to us, that God, to
whom we are so obnoxious by Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Sin, is most placable and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable,
of himself, through the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his own Nature; and that he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
resolv'd and engaged, by his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Determination and Promise, to
pardon Sin, in, and through Christ, to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56135:38"/>
all who repent and believe the Gospel.
and this, and nothing less than this, is
the Matter of the Gospel. This is <hi>to be
accepted in, and through Christ;</hi> and is the
real Explication of Justification by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Righteousness. For this being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and proving true; We are sure of
God.—We know his Terms.—The
Terms are fair and equal in themselves;
fit and just: for should not an Offender
do what is in him, to undo what he hath
done amiss?—The Terms are good for
us: for we cannot be happy by God, in
a way of opposition to God; but by
Submission and Reconciliation to him.
—They are such as are possible, through
the Grace and Assistance of God.—So
that there is nothing in the whole World
that we have more Reason to desire and
pray for, than that they be verified, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
and accomplished in us.</p>
                  <p>There are no two things more inward
to us, than Satisfaction to our Reason,
that we may be at quiet; and the settling
of our Minds in Frame and Temper, that
we may enjoy our selves. In these <hi>two</hi>
the Life of Man consists: and these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the Knowledge of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>* <hi>Now,</hi> the Matter of the Gospel is
* <hi>also</hi> a Vital Principle, as it is a byass
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56135:38"/>
upon our Spirits, an Habitual Temper
and Disposition constantly affecting us,
and inclining us <hi>God-ward,</hi> and to ways
of <hi>Goodness, Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi>
For it is inwardly received, so as to dye
and colour the Soul; so as to settle a
Temper and Constitution: and so it is
restorative to our Natures.—That
which we do but indifferently by our
Ability; we are able to do dexterously
and easily by Custom. Through the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Grace and Assistance we are both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and freely willing. The Law of the
Spirit of Life in Christ, frees us from the
Law of Sin and Death. The Principles of the
Christian Religion do not only controul
intemperate and exorbitant <hi>Acts;</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
the inward Frame and <hi>Temper</hi> of
Mind, the Inclinations, <hi>elicit</hi> Acts, and
first Motions. As Christ said to God,
<hi>not my Will but thy Will;</hi> so we must,
through Participation of Christ, be let
into a Temper of Meekness and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to our fellow-Creatures, and a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive
self-denying Frame in respect of
God. Hence our Lives and Manners are
of another fashion. By the Spirit of the
Gospel we are transformed into another
Nature, Life, and Temper. Neither do
I terminate the Ultimate Issue of Christ
in the happy Effects of Renovation in our
selves, and Reconciliation to God; (tho'
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56135:39"/>
these are Benefits transcendent to all
worldly Wealth, Greatness, and Power:)
but it doth not now appear, neither can
we now bear the thought of it, what we
may be when God shall be all in all; and
all Enmity subdued.—These are <hi>two</hi>
things, and very different; what Man
may come to, by the Improvement of
himself, in the right use of himself, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Power and Faculties; directing
himself by his ordinary Rules; * <hi>as</hi> he is
God's Creature, and may attain his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
State and End: and what Man may
come to, as he is indued with Power
from above; as he is assumed into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to God, by Jesus Christ; as he is
a Member of that Body whereof Christ is
the Head; as the Adoption of God by
Jesus Christ; and as he is so enliven'd by
the Divine Spirit, as did not belong to
Man in the State of Innocency.—But
these are not things of our present State:
for even <hi>Adam,</hi> as he was made, was not
fit. <hi>For Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the
Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Application now only remains.</p>
                  <p>Having made appear to you that the
Doctrine of the Gospel, both in respect of
its proper Vertue and Efficiency, as also
in respect of Divine Intention, is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56135:39"/>
to the bringing of Men to Salvation;
then are you, <hi>First</hi> to acquaint your selves
throughly with the Terms of the Gospel,
to pass * <hi>Judgment</hi> upon it, to consider
well all the Circumstances that make up
the case; <hi>Our contracted Impotency and
great Deformity by our Fall; the Necessity
of Recovery and Restoration; The Efficacy
and the Freeness of the Grace of God to
Conversion.</hi> So that we may resolve our
Minds; tho' our Case be very forlorn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of our Defection and Apostacy
from the Innocency of our Creation, and
self-contracted Misery; yet nothing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate,
nothing is impossible in the Case;
but our Recovery, through the Grace of
God, is fairly easie.</p>
                  <p>And being thus prepar'd by such Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Apprehensions; pursue the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Gospel in your own Spirits,
and in Conjunction of your selves with
others; by free Communication in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
For this is certain, and found by
Experience, that the only way to do a
Man's self good in Intellectuals and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals,
is to do good to others. No Man
gains so much as by Teaching. No Man
so improves in Intellectuals, as by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication:
which doth much commend
Intellectuals; that <hi>they increase by expence.</hi>
If a Man hath brought himself to some
Perfection by Consideration; he will
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56135:40"/>
make himself much more, by free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication:
and in free Communication,
you will have another suggest that which,
it may be, you did not think of: So he will
put you upon further Consideration; or
else preserve you from Presumption. None
are of such modest Spirits as * <hi>they</hi> who
live in free Communication and Converse.
This I subjoyn, for the improving of a
Man's self in the way of the Gospel, and
answering the vigorous Spirit of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
<hi>be communicative.</hi> And this is the
Purpose of all our Meetings: free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
to answer every Man's
Doubts; to give every one Satisfaction.
It is the highest Service, and greatest Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
we can do one another, freely to tell
what we have conceiv'd: and we do
our selves most effectual Good, when we
carry on others with us; when we do
Good unto others.</p>
                  <p>The first thing in Religion is to teach a
Man's own Mind; to satisfie a Man's self,
in the Reason of things; to look to the
Grounds and Assurance that a Man hath
for his Thoughts, Apprehensions, and
Perswasions: But then it is prodigious
and monstrous if <hi>that</hi> wherein my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is resolv'd and satisfied, should not
have such an Influence upon my Mind, as
to establish me in Life accordingly, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56135:40"/>
to be a Rule both in Temper and Practice.
That which we call in Morals <hi>against the
Order of Reason,</hi> is so much more horrid,
unnatural, and prodigious than in infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Nature, for <hi>Sensitives</hi> to go against
the Guidance of Sense, * <hi>or</hi> for <hi>Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi>
against the Force of Nature; * <hi>it
is, I say,</hi> so much more unnatural; as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Agents</hi> transcend, in Perfection,
<hi>Sensitives,</hi> and <hi>Inanimates:</hi> Reason being
as proportionable to its Effects, as any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
in inferiour Nature.</p>
                  <p>There are two Orders, or Ranks of
Creatures in this visible World: the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Sensitives,</hi> and of <hi>Inanimates:</hi> The
World of Sensitives, they are true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible:
they are true to that which is
their <hi>predominant Principle;</hi> that is, <hi>sence;</hi>
and they never vary: And <hi>Inanimates,</hi>
they certainly tend according to their
Nature. Now the Principle in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Order of Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> of Rational
and Intelligent Agents, is <hi>Apprehension of
the Reason of things.</hi> Now the Reasons of
things are Eternal: they are not subject
to any Power: we practice not upon
them: It is our Wisdom to observe them;
and our Goodness to comply with them:
but they are as much our Rule, as <hi>Sense</hi>
to Sensitives; and the <hi>Impetus</hi> of Nature
to Inanimates. Now you would think it
Monstrous, Prodigious, and Unnatural,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56135:41"/>
for the Sun to give over shining, for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
things to ascend, for light things to
descend, for Fire not to burn: yet it is
more prodigious for any one that is an
Intelligent Agent and Voluntary, not to
comply with the Reason of things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is a Creature of a higher Order;
and his Principle is more excellent. By
which you may see the Degeneracy of us
Mortals: in that the State below us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in the same Principle it was created
in: but we Men, do neither find out the
Reasons of things, nor comply with
them. Our Deformity is more; because
our Perfection is more, and the Order of
our Being is higher; and we were made
more sufficient to our Con-natural Acts,
than either Sensitives, or Inanimates to
their proper Acts; and we use to say, the
Fault is greater in him that is in a higher
State.</p>
                  <p>This is to awaken Men to understand
the Reason of the Gospel, and to consider
it; that it may become the Reason of our
Mind: And if it be the Reason of our
Mind; it will be <hi>a Vital Principle</hi> of
Life.</p>
                  <p>The Intent of the Gospel being such as
it is, (<hi>viz.</hi> the greatest <hi>Good</hi> possible:)
and it being the Inquiry of all Mortals,
<hi>Who will show us any Good?</hi> it is Matter
of great Astonishment, that it should be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56135:41"/>
so neglected; so much being done <hi>on
God's part</hi> towards Man's Salvation, and
so much Reason for it <hi>on Man's part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1<hi>st.</hi> So much being done on God's
part. For, Man's <hi>Salvation</hi> doth import
<hi>Man's Happiness.</hi> Salvation from first to
last, doth include the several Stages and
Progressions in the passing from the Death
of Sin, from the Carnal Mind, from the
Corrupt Nature, into a Spirital State and
Divine Life. This is the Salvation of this
State: and the Consummation of this, is
the Salvation of the other. Do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how much God hath done upon
this account. Consider the many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and pathetical Invitations God
hath made to Sinners; Promises to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them; Promises to enable them;
Promises to reward them. How did our
Saviour mourn over <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> How did
God by the Prophets every where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
upon Man's Remissness?</item>
                     <item>2<hi>dly.</hi> Considering there is so much
Reason for it on Man's part; that it is
not only just, and fit in it self; but Good
for us. It is just and fit, <hi>to repent:</hi> for
can any one think that it is reasonable, by
an after-Act, to justifie an Act of Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance?
If he doth not; he must repent:
for whosoever commits a Sin, and doth
not repent of it, he lives to justifie it.
—Repentance is good for us; for
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56135:42"/>
without it, we are self-condemn'd, and
in an Incapacity of Happiness. Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
I take to be the very Life of
Hell: and a Man must be self-condemn'd,
unless he repent, after the committing of
Sin.—Repentance doth ease a Man's
Mind. He that doth repent would make
Satisfaction, and doth recal it, what he
can. It is not possible for a Man to be
made happy, by putting him into a <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Place,</hi> unless he be in a <hi>Good State.</hi> A
Man is not happy in the State wherein he
is not qualified. We are not capable of
Happiness, unless we be restored to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
by Repentance. The Gospel is
the Restitution of us to the State of our
Creation, to the use of our Principles, to
our healthful Constitution, and to Acts
con-natural to us: and, under the Grace
of God, is not only possible; but a thing
of easie and fair Performance: For tho'
without God, we are unsufficient to do
anything; yet through the Grace of God,
we are enabled to do all things that the
Gospel requires. In this way, the Mind
of Man may have Assurance and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
It is a compassionable Case for
him that is Supream and Sovereign, to
pitty an unavoidable Necessity and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and to pardon so far as the Case is
compassionate. Now we are in the hands
of him that is Primarily and Originally
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56135:42"/>
Good: And he will certainly commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
every Case, so far as it is compassion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Now the Case of a Sinner is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionable,
if he be penitent; because
he was never better than finite and falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Nothing is more credible than that
the first and chiefest Goodness will save
to the utmost Extent of Disposition in
the Subject.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>On the other side, consider we God
as the first and chiefest Goodness; it is
worthy of him, and in it self good, that
Evil be controuled. Therefore I cannot
conceive, but that the Goodness of God
must engage him to punish obstinate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
Parents think it becoming, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
an obstinate Child.—Consider we
him also in a Relative Capacity, as he is
the Governour of the World: He is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to maintain Order, so it is not
comely in God to pass over Contumacy
in Sin, without challenging or controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
So that as I do easily see, that the
Case of a Sinner that is penitent, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionable:
So on the other side, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive that a contumacious impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Sinner can be pardon'd: Since it is
in it self good, and also worthy God (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consider'd <hi>absolutely in himself,</hi> as the
first and chiefest Good; or <hi>relatively,</hi> as
the Governour of the World) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56135:43"/>
and challenge wilful and pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Transgressors.</p>
                  <p>Consider we, the Unreasonableness of
Sin in <hi>Three</hi> Particulars.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1<hi>st,</hi> In Acts of Impiety against God.
Can any Reason be imagined for these?
For, God being the Original of Man's
Being; the Center of his Soul; his ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
End, and every Way well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of him; Can any give a Reason
why any Man should be rebellious against
him? Is there any Temptation to sober
Reason unto Impiety? What can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to induce Men to affront and
offer Contempt to God?</item>
                     <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> What can be alledged for Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance;
since Nature is content with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few Things? Why should any one
over-do in this kind? A Man is better in
Health and Strength, if he be temperate.
We enjoy our selves more in a sober and
temperate Use of our selves. What Aches,
Diseases, Pains, and Sicknesses doth a
Man bring upon himself, if he be intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate?
How many of these are founded
in Excess?</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:56135:43"/>3<hi>dly,</hi> Sins of Unrighteousness,—
whosoever doth an unrighteous Act, he
doth justifie all the Villanies in the
World, even Highway-men and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
For it is the same thing: You are
Sinners in the same kind; for all is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness;
there is difference only in
degree. One may offend more in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws: But the Offence is the same
in righteous Laws.—Besides, what
Confidence can we our selves have in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of others? For no Man will think
better of others than of himself. He that
is guilty of Unrighteousness, cannot but
be jealous, and think the same of others.
So that he can have no Confidence in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Thus you see the Unreasonableness of
Sin. Yet because of ill Use, Custom, and
Practice; Difficulty is pretended, * <hi>and
it is thought hard,</hi> to be vertuous. Do
not Beasts observe the Rules of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
—That which Religion requires,
is to find out the Reason of Things, and
to comply with it; to move according
to the Dictates of Reason; and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Order of the End; to avoid such
things as will do us harm; in short, to
live according to the Difference of Good
and Evil; to do the <hi>one,</hi> and to avoid
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56135:44"/>
the <hi>other:</hi> Which are not positive and
arbitrary Impositions; but they arise
from Conveniences, and from Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of our Natures, States, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
So that the Sinner is a Person
of violent Practice, and one who doth
unnatural Acts. And an Impenitent is
one of a senceless and stupid Mind.</p>
                  <p>The Things that are the Bane of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and that do alienate us from God,
are <hi>Sensuality, Worldly-mindedness,</hi> and
<hi>Wickedness.</hi> The two former of these do
sink the Creation of God below it self;
so that it doth not continue the same that
God made it. A Man, by <hi>these,</hi> is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
utterly unfit for Converse and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with God. For, by <hi>these,</hi> he
sinks himself below his Kind, and makes
himself equal to the Beast that perishes.
And by the latter (* <hi>viz.</hi> Wickedness)
Man passeth into a clean contrary Nature,
becomes an Enemy to God, and makes
God an Enemy to him.</p>
                  <p>Against Sensuality and Worldliness, I
propose for Remedy, the Application of
the Principles of Reason and Vertue, and
the applying of our highest Faculties to
their End and Object. For while the
Mind is employ'd in Heavenly Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or in extracting Spiritual Notions
from material Things; it is employ'd
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56135:44"/>
worthy of Intelectual Nature: And our
proper Business is to be thus employ'd:
By which the Concerns of the Body will
be either laid aside, or moderately enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in, and regarded. Whereas this
Power of our Souls is, as it were, lost,
where Men use themselves as if they had
no Spirits, but were altogether Body;
or as if the Body were the principal or
governing Part. And in such a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are they, who cannot understand
what we mean when we bid them <hi>lift up
their Hearts to God.</hi> For the Candle of
God's lighting within them, whereby they
are qualified to find God out in his
Works, and to follow him in his Ways,
either it burns so dim, that they cannot
see by it, or it is quite put out. For it
is found by Experience, that the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Heart doth blind the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
And true Wisdom will never
abide in a malicious and wicked Soul.—
There are indeed Souls that are * <hi>so</hi> active
and so well acquainted with Heavenly
Meditation; that they very well know
what is the Food of Souls; and have the
fore-taste of the Delight and Pleasure of
the other World. And certainly, these
Men have the greatest Satisfaction in their
Lives of any other Persons. For there
is more of Satisfaction in Meditation, in
Reading, in Conference about Divine
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56135:45"/>
Things, in Application to God by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and other holy Exercises, than in
any bodily Pleasure whatsoever. For all
<hi>bodily Exercise</hi> comes off with disquiet of
Spirit: Whereas in the other Way there is
Refreshment every Moment: There is
new Acquisition: For if there be any
thing like Infinite in the Creation under
God, it is in Invention, and the Power
of Thinking. This is the Advantage
of <hi>Intelectual</hi> Exercise, above <hi>Bodily</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.
The one works inwardly; is still on
the getting hand; and is still in use; for
what this Man gets, he hath still in store;
and that which is got in this way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telectual
Employment, will still improve
by Use; and what we get, we always
keep; for Knowledge is no burden:
Whereas in things of the Body, <hi>Use, and
Want: Spend, and be ever after without.</hi>
But it is no wonder, that they who never
acquainted themselves with retiring from
the World, know not what these Things
mean: Who mind only Worldly Things,
and know no more than what belongs
to the Animal Life. But, on the other
side, if a Man make Application to God;
he acts with all his Might; he recollects
himself, and gathers himself into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that he may receive from God, what
God hath to communicate. And the
Things that God hath and doth offer, are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56135:45"/>
so great, and glorious, that our narrow
Vessels had need be wholly emptied to
make room for them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Minds Substraction from
the World is necessary, by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
and holy Meditation, to beget in
us such a Disposition, by which we may
receive from God. A Man that can enjoy
himself alone, by Consideration, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
his Faculties, may run through, as
it were, all times: For a Man may live
<hi>before</hi> he lives, and <hi>after,</hi> in this way: He
may, by Reading, acquaint himself with
what was in former Times; and by what
Things are, he may guess what are to
come. If he reflect upon Things past,
and view Things that are present, and
take a Prospect of Things to come, as
the Effect of Causes that are in being;
in this way Rational Faculties have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Employment: Whereas they that
are always drudging in the Affairs of the
World, and never enjoy themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
will find little Satisfaction in these
Things.</p>
                  <p>It is the proper Work of Reason in
Man, to find God out in his Works, and
to follow him in his Ways. It is the
proper Employment of our intelectual
Faculties, to be conversant about God, to
conceive aright of him; and then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
and imitate him. Religion is an
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56135:46"/>
Obligation upon us to God. The <hi>first</hi>
Motion of Religion is to understand
what is true of God: And the <hi>second</hi> is
to express it in our Lives, and to copy it
out in our Works. The <hi>Former</hi> is our
Wisdom: And the <hi>Latter</hi> is our Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
In these Two consist the Health and
Pulchritude of our Minds. For Health
to the Body, is not more, than Vertue is
to the Mind. A deprav'd and vicious
Mind is as really the Sickness and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
thereof, as any foul and loathsome
Disease is to the Body. And as really as
these tend to the Death and Dissolution
of the Soul and Body; so the Vices of
the Mind tend to the Separation of God
and the Soul.</p>
                  <p>What is short and inferior to <hi>Converse
with God,</hi> doth require a Recess from
Worldly Business and Employment. A
Man can hardly compose an ordinary
Poem without this. But for the noblest
Employment <hi>receiving from God,</hi> and
<hi>making Acknowledgment to him,</hi> is a Man
fit for this, in the Hurry of Business, and
Confusion of Things? It is also obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that this Life of Privacy, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement,
is either the best, or the worst
Life: For, in it, we do as God doth;
or we imitate the Devil. He who can
be alone to his own Content, in Measure
and Degree, is as God is: For what other
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56135:46"/>
Employment had God from Eternity, but
satisfying himself in his own Goodness?
But as * <hi>this</hi> may be * <hi>the best;</hi> so it may
be the worst Life: For a Man may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in contriving Mischief as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is, whose Work is said to be to bring
Men into Condemnation. If therefore
* <hi>we are</hi> alone to ill Purposes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;
then, Solitariness and Retirement
do make the worst Life. * <hi>But</hi> if * <hi>Man</hi>
be retired and alone, and not intelectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
employ'd; then through Stupidity
and Dulness, he sinks down into the
State of a Beast. For take it for a certain
Truth; to be <hi>Well,</hi> and <hi>Unactive,</hi> do not
consist together. No Man is well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Action; nothing is more irksome
than Idleness. A Man must use his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and put himself upon Action.
Therefore, if he be alone, and unactive;
he cannot be well. In all honest Labour
there is Satisfaction: Whereas Sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Neglect are unaccountable, and
unsatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>The Mind diverted from God, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in Darkness and Confusion: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directed to him, soon finds its way,
and doth receive from him in a way that
is abstracted from the Noise of the World,
and withdrawn from the Call of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
having shut the Doors of our Sences,
to recommend our selves to the Divine
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56135:47"/>
Life, which readily enters into the Eye
of the Mind that is prepar'd to receive
it. For there is Light enough of God
in the World, if the Eye of our Minds
were but fitted to receive it, and let it
in. It is the Incapacity of the Subject,
where God <hi>is</hi> not; for nothing in the
World is more knowable than God.
God only is absent to them that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed,
and disaffected: For a Man
cannot open his Eye, nor lend his Ear,
but every thing will declare more or less
of God. It is our Fault that we are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged
from him: For God doth not
withdraw himself from us, unless we
first leave him: The Distance is occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
through our unnatural Use of our
selves.</p>
                  <p>They who live the Life of Sence, are
apt to be beaten off from all regard to
God, by those Occurrences that discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their Minds. * <hi>But</hi> they who are
separated from Body, who sit loose to
Earthly Things * <hi>which</hi> obstruct the Mind,
do easily receive the Divine Light. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
those that are in Prison in gross Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
need the Fire of Divine Affection to
quicken them. And this I understand in
the Language of the Scripture, to be
<hi>Baptizing with Fire,</hi>
                     <note>Mat 3. 11.</note> when Divine Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
burns up all contrary Principles in the
Soul, and brings the Soul into a Likeness
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56135:47"/>
and Similitude to God. For, the Divine
Light received into the Mind, doth first
irradiate and clear the Mind from its gross
and thick Darkness, whereby it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exercised
and unemploy'd about God:
And this is the first Work; <hi>Mental Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
raising right Notions of God,
and Things in our Minds; scattering</hi> * the
<hi>Mists of Darkness.</hi> * <hi>Yet</hi> Light alone
works not a Change: But there must be
<hi>Holy Affection.</hi> Knowledge is the <hi>first</hi> step
to Vertue: But <hi>Goodness</hi> * is not but <hi>by
Delight and Choice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a mighty unequal and unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Distribution of Time, for a Man to
lay out himself for his Body; and to
neglect his Mind, to feed the <hi>Beast</hi> (for
so the Body * <hi>is,</hi> in respect of the Mind:
* <hi>It</hi> is but <hi>the Beast</hi> that carries the Soul:)
And this for these Reasons: Because the
Mind is so much annoyed and disturbed
by Body: I speak not now of the Body,
<hi>as sinning and distemper'd:</hi> But in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Cases, take the Body in all its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages;
'tis an Incumbrance to the
Mind: For when the Mind raiseth it self
to Contemplation of immaterial Things;
the Imagination doth suggest the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Corporeal; which are Things of
an inferior Nature. Bodily Sence reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
but a little way, whether by the Eye,
or by the Ear, or any other Sence. That
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56135:48"/>
which is equal, just, * <hi>and</hi> fit; * <hi>that</hi>
wherein we are most concerned, in Point
of Goodness, Wisdom, and Happiness; these
are all imperceptible Notions to every
Thing of <hi>Body.</hi> What is Fit, what is
Just, what is Equal, what is Good and
Excellent, what is Reasonable; of these
no bodily Sence doth judge. And, yet,
these are the Things that we are most
concern'd in, upon account of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
                  <p>A Mind subdued and subordinate to
God, in all its Actions and Motions, is
as the fublunary Bodies here below,
which are subject to the heavenly Bodies
above; as Wax under the Seal, or Clay
in the Potter's Hand. The Motion is a
great deal more noble and generous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is in a higher Order, by Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Conviction; by Perswasion,
and mental Satisfaction: But it is not less
effectual to * <hi>its</hi> Intent and Purpose. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
puts the Soul in a right Posture
towards God: For we are thereby <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
in the Spirit of our Minds.</hi> The
Soul of Man to God is as the Flower of
the Sun: It opens at its approach; and
shuts when it withdraws. Religion in
the Mind, is as a Byas upon the Spirit,
inclines it in all its Motions: Tho'
sometimes it be jogg'd, and interrupted;
yet it comes to it self. It is a Rule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56135:48"/>
a Law written in Man's Heart. It
is the Government of his Spirit. We
say, Men shew their Spirit, by their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
Behaviour and Words: And it is
true. The good Man is an Instrument
in Tune: Excite a good Man, give him
an Occasion; you shall have from him
savoury Speeches out of his Mouth, and
good Actions in his Life. Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and comprehends in it all good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Dispositions of Mind. It doth
take in, all the Vertues that Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is capable of, which are the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
and Ornaments thereof, and
which are the Mind's Instruments for
good Actions. Religion is rational, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable,
and intelligible. The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is not more sensible between a Man
that is weak and strong, a Man that is sick
and in health, * <hi>than between a Man that
is truly Religious, and one falsly so.</hi> You may
observe it, if you put them upon Action.
So, a Man that is truly Religious, if you
put him in Motion, he will acquit and
approve himself so: If he be false in his
Religion, you will see it by his Failing
and Miscarriage of Life.</p>
                  <p>Such is the Christian Religion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Nature and Quality of it,
all the Principles of it, all the Exercises
and Performances that it puts Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it is so Sovereign to our Natures;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56135:49"/>
so satisfactory to the Reason of our
Minds; so quieting unto, and of such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
against the Molestations of our
Consciences; so Sanatory, so full for our
Recovery: that none who knows, or doth
seriously consider, would chuse to have
his Obligation to Religion either released,
cancell'd, or discharged.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; How unexcusable, how
unaccountable are they who have turn'd
the Doctrine of the Gospel, or <hi>the Grace
of God into Lasciviousness;</hi> and to use St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Phrase, <hi>have made void the Law
through Faith.</hi> He represents it as the
most sad Miscarriage, to disoblige a Man
in Morals; to set a Man at liberty * <hi>as</hi> to
those things that are reasonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
For the Law of God's Creation
is no way damnified, but restor'd, and
secured, by the Doctrine of the Gospel.
Yet these excuse themselves from strict
Morality, and Conscientious Living;
which the better sort of Heathens thought
themselves obliged unto.—We preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
our selves miserably by Mistakes.
Some think that the Hellish State is the
Product of Omnipotency, and Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Effect of God's Power; and they
think of God, that he useth his Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<hi>as he will;</hi> giving no account of any
of his Matters, to Principles of Reason,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56135:49"/>
and Righteousness. But certainly the
Ways of God are most accountable of any
thing, to Rules of Righteousness. These
are injurious Apprehensions of God, and
dishonourable to him; and are discaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him every where in Scripture; and
God owns no such Power; neither doth
he look upon it as a <hi>Priviledge;</hi> nor doth
he cloath himself with such a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
—Here is the Truth of the Case:
<hi>Misery doth arise out of our selves:</hi> and
Misery and Iniquity have the same Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
Hell (for the main of it) is our
Guiltiness and Conscience of it: So that a
Sinner is in a self-condemned State, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Relief.—These <hi>two</hi> are the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
of the Hellish State; Self-condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Guilt of a Man's Conscience,
that is not removed by Repentance: and
God's Refusal, upon a righteous Cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Sinner would not come within
the Latitude of a Compassionate Case.</p>

for he that is employ'd in an Evil Work,

Wherefore let the Declaration of
God in Scripture be acknowledg'd as
true; <hi>Thy Destruction is of thy self. Why

For God, of his great Goodness
and Compassion to Men, doth graciously
begin: but we often find Men wilful,
obstinate, and rebellious. God is ready
to pursue his Good Beginning; and, if
they answer his Call, further to carry
them on: for you have an express Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<hi>To him that hath shall be given.</hi> All
Grace is help;<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 12.</note> and where God is, there
is Strength. Therefore cannot any one say,
his Miscarriage is of God. It is not want on
God's part: but failure on ours. It is not
that God fails in what is becoming him,
in the relation he stands to us, as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but we are wanting to our selves.
What is all the Misery that befalls Sinners,
in their most forlorn Condition, but the
Fruit of their own Sins? Not any thing,
that proceeds from God's Arbitrary Will
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56135:53"/>
and Power: But they contract Guiltiness
of Conscience, Impenitence of Mind,
Hardness of Heart, and an Incapacity
to act God-ward, or to receive from
God.</item>
                     <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> The Scripture doth suppose, that
ungodly Men are <hi>self-condemn'd.</hi> For
this super-addition, <hi>Who hold the Truth
in unrighteousness,</hi> is, as rendring an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
not making a Distinction: As
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>endring an Account how it comes to
pass, notwithstanding all God's Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and Declarations, that Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ungodly Persons: The Reason is;
<hi>Because they offer Violence to Truth, go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Light, and neglect the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of God:</hi> Not, as if it distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
between <hi>ungodly</hi> and <hi>unrighteous</hi>
Persons.—All that in any Scripture are
branded for Sinners, they are Men that
sin against their Knowledge, imprison the
Truth of God, and hold it in Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
In the Language of Scripture,
none are nominated Sinners, but such as
<hi>now</hi> we are representing. The Scripture
doth never fasten the Title or Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
upon them that mean well, but
are in something mistaken; who now
and then are under an Error, having Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Imperfections, and Shortnesses;
that miscarry upon a violent Temptation,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56135:53"/>
or sudden Surprizal. You never find
these Men are call'd <hi>Sinners.</hi> Neither are
the Infirmities of the Regenerate, call'd
<hi>Sin:</hi> Tho' these are Sins that require
God's Forgiveness, and are a true Cause
for us to be Humble, and Modest, and to
depend upon God: But they do not
break our Peace with God; neither do
they havock Conscience, or denominate
a Person <hi>a Sinner.</hi> The Scripture tells
us, That <hi>those that are born of God do not
commit Sin;</hi> that is, in this Sence; no one
that is regenerate, doth pass into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Nature: It is unnatural: They may
have Shortnesses, Failings, Imperfections:
But voluntarily to consent to known Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
or wilfully to controul the settled
Laws of Heaven, of Piety to God, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to Men, and Sobriety to our selves;
this is unnatural. These Persons have
the Guilt of evil Practice lying upon
their Minds. They have their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Sence reproving them, challenging
them, condemning them. For the Cause
of all Creatures Misery is <hi>rational,</hi> and
<hi>accountable;</hi> and Men do dishonour God,
and misrepresent him, when they say that
any Creature falls into Misery <hi>by the Use
of God's Sovereignty:</hi> It doth really arise
<hi>from within us:</hi> And there is no Danger
in respect of God, (notwithstanding his
great Priviledge,) if Men be innocent, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56135:54"/>
not self-condemn'd.—Misery and
Harm do not proceed from <hi>abroad;</hi> but
do arise from <hi>within.</hi> If Omnipotence
it self should load me with all Burthens;
If I am innocent within, I shall be able
to bear it: But if I am guilty, I have a
Wound <hi>within;</hi> and have nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me true to my self.—All Misery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
out of our selves. It is a most gross
Mistake; and Men are of dull and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
Spirits, who think that that State
which we call <hi>Hell,</hi> is <hi>an incommodious
place,</hi> only; and that God, by his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,
throws Men therein. For Hell
arises <hi>out of a Man's self:</hi> And Hell's
Fewel is <hi>the Guilt of a Man's Conscience.</hi> And
it is impossible that any should be <hi>so</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
as Hell makes a Man, and as there
a Man is miserable, but by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
himself: And on the other side,
when they think that Heaven arises from
any <hi>Place,</hi> or any nearness to God, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
This is not principally * <hi>so;</hi> but
* <hi>it</hi> lies in a <hi>refin'd Temper,</hi> in <hi>an internal
Reconciliation to the Nature of God, and
to the Rule of Righteousness.</hi> So that both
Hell, and Heaven, have their Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>within</hi> Men. Evil knowingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
is our Burthen: For all Evil is
forcible, violent, and unnatural: And a
Sinner wrongs his own Principles.—
This might be made appear in respect of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56135:54"/>
God; in respect of one another; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of our selves.</item>

                  <list>
                     <item>1<hi>st, In respect of God.</hi> For, consider
him as the Father of our Beings, and that
we are derivatively from him; or that
our State is Dependency; or that we are
sinful; or that we are under his Love;
or that he is to be our Judge; all these,
will cause Acts of Piety. So that all Acts
of Impiety are contrary to the Light of
our Reason. And whosoever is impious
in any Degree or Particular whatsoever,
he doth <hi>hold the Truth in Unrighteousness;</hi>
he confounds his Principles, acts contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his Nature, and contradicts the
Principle of God within him. * <hi>For</hi>
this is Fundamental to all Religion; that
Man in the Use of his Reason, by Force
of Mind and Understanding, may as
well know, that there is a God that
governs the World, as he may know,
by the Use of his Eyes, there is a
Sun. For are we not <hi>made</hi> to know
there is a God? If we were not <hi>made</hi>
to know that he is; we could never
know. For this we can never be taught:
For upon whose Credit shall we believe
it? It is not <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> unless
it be grounded on Divine Authority:
All else, is either <hi>Reason,</hi> or <hi>Human Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
Credulity,</hi> or <hi>Experience.</hi> We are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56135:55"/>
not capable of <hi>Faith,</hi> unless we know
there is a God: For if there be Faith in
God; we must suppose, that He <hi>is.</hi> For
Faith is <hi>a receiving something upon Divine
Authority.</hi> * <hi>And</hi> if there be not a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Knowledge, that God <hi>is;</hi> there is
no Possibility of any Faith. Men know
by the Use of their Reason, that there is
a God: And then when a Man receives
any Proposition from God's Authority;
<hi>that,</hi> is <hi>Faith.</hi> Natural Knowledge, you
see, is anticedent and Fundamental to
Faith.—It is as natural and proper for
Mind and Understanding to tend towards
God, as for heavy Things to tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Center: For God is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of immortal Souls. All Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
seek after God, and have a Sence and
Feeling of God. If Reason did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
God; Religion could not be
learn'd: For there would be nothing in
Nature to graft it on. Besides, we know
in Reason, that first Principles are self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident,
must be seen in their own Light,
and are perceived by an inward Power of
Nature. For, as we say, <hi>out of nothing
comes nothing;</hi> so, grant nothing; and
nothing can be proved. Wherefore it
must be within the Reach of Reason, to
find that there is a God: For upon God's
Authority, supposing his Being and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity,
we admit and receive all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56135:55"/>
of his Will.—If God had not
<hi>made</hi> Man to know there is a God; there
is nothing that God could have demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him; nothing wherein he might
have challenged him; nor nothing that
he could have expected, Man should have
received from him. Therefore the Make
of Man, the natural Use of Mind and
Understanding, this is enough to satisfie
any one concerning the Being of God,
and his essential Perfections: And if so;
whosoever is impious to God, whosoever
is not subject to all his Commands, this
Man doth certainly sin against his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and doth practise against his
Light, and is guilty of <hi>holding the Truth
in Unrighteousness.</hi>—Thus, every one
that is Impious, Ungodly, Prophane, or
a Despiser of Deity, is self-condemn'd;
sins against his Light, and goes against
his Conscience; goes against his very
Make; and doth that which is violent,
horrid, and unnatural.</item>
                     <item>The second Species of Sin, is <hi>Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
Now Righteousness refers to the
Duties we mutually owe one another:
<hi>To do as we would be done by. To do equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and justly; not arbitrarily.</hi>—How
doth Violence and Fraud perplex and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
Humane Affairs? How settledly
do Men live, where Love and Justice do
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56135:56"/>
take place; in comparison of Places Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,
and Lawless.—There is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Harmony in the Soul, with the Rule
of Righteousness; there is no Displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
Offence, or Reluctancy: And there
is an Antipathy arising at the Appearance
of Evil, as unnatural to it: But a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
in Good, as the eldest and first
Acquaintance. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9. <hi>How can
I do this Wickedness?</hi> We see that the
Mind of a good Man takes Offence at
Evil, is grieved at it, not at all fitted to
it? There arises a Displacency, as in all
Force and <hi>Contra-natural</hi> Impression.—
Iniquity and Sin in the Conscience, are
of * <hi>the most</hi> mischievous Nature and
Quality. Should all the World agree
and concur to sink a Man into a State of
Lowness, Beggary, and Misery; it would
not be brought about so effectually by any
other Means, as by Sin and Guilt. Where
there is a pure Mind, and an upright
Conscience, Innocency, and Integrity;
there, consequently, are internal Peace,
Satisfaction, Composure. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side; if a Man have Sence of Guilt
on his Mind; where a Man knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
faulty; he fears uncertainly, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
He fears every thing that appears,
yea, that which doth not appear; as the
Poet expresses it; for Guilt is always
Prophetical of what is mischievous. A

Mind, than an ill dispos'd Body. It
is so much the worse, as, the Mind of
Man is better than his Body. We find
that Nature hath given Faculties: And
Industry and Study acquires Habits. A
neglected Mind is, according to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
Observation, <hi>A Sluggard's Field grown
over with Thistles and Thorns.</hi> We may
say of such a Man, that he hath his Mind
only for Salt: But can any Man that is
rational, or sober, think that God gave
him an immortal Spirit, but as <hi>Salt,</hi> to
keep his Body from Stench and Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
The Mind being Superiour, is
not to be subjected to the Body, nor to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56135:57"/>
the things of the Body; neither ought
there to be an unequal Distribution of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance;
but according to the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Worth and Value. We ought
to improve our Minds so far, as much over
and above, as our Minds do transcend the
Body.</item>

                  <p>Whosoever is proud and conceited,
whosoever is intemperate, lascivious, or
wanton, he doth <hi>hold the Truth in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness.</hi>
For these things have Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and are grounded in Man, * <hi>viz.</hi>
Sobriety, Modesty, and an humble Sense,
the Desires of Nature are moderate, and
do keep within bounds: So that in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Vertue,</hi> in every kind, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Sense of Humane Nature,
the Dictates of Reason and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the Sense of Man's Mind. And
<hi>Vice,</hi> in every kind, is grievous, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous,
and unnatural. A Man forces him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
when he is vicious; and a Man
kindly uses himself, when he acts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rules of Vertue. And this is so
true, that all those that have abused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
all but habituated Sinners, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<hi>that Vertue is conservative to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man;</hi> and that all Evil Practices
<hi>destroy it.</hi>—Vertue is conservative to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56135:57"/>
Reason of Man's Mind by Sobriety and
Modesty; for these keep Men in their
Wits. And then it preserves the Health,
and the Strength of our Bodies, by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity,
and by Temperance.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I shewn you the <hi>three</hi> Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of Religion; the three great
Materials of Conscience, which are immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
unalterable, and indispensible; that
are settled in the very Foundation of
God's Creation. I have also shew'd you
that Vertue is connatural, and well-found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and * <hi>that</hi> Vice is unnatural and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to the Nature of Man. So that
there is no Man hath internal Peace, that is
either neglective of his Duty to God; or
that is unrighteous; or that is intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
as to the use of the things <hi>of the
Body;</hi> or intoxicated by fond Conceits
<hi>in the Sense of his Mind.</hi> For as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
and comely that <hi>Sobriety</hi> be the
Mind's Temper; so * <hi>it is,</hi> that there be
a moderate and sober use of the things of
the Body. For Nature is content with a
few things. That which is violent, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.
That Excess which is unhealthy
for the Body, doth also stupifie the Mind.
So that upon this account also, Vice is
unnatural.—* <hi>What is</hi> contrary to the
Order of Reason, is contrary to the
State of Nature, in Intellectuals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:56135:58"/>Those that are ungodly or unrighteous
in these <hi>three</hi> great Instances: that bear no
Reverence to God; that do not act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their fellow-Creatures according to
the Rules of Justice; that abuse their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
do not govern their Minds, * <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
improve them in Knowledge, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
them by Vertue: All these, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
their Natural Light, and are <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemn'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if the Unrighteous and Ungodly
are <hi>self-condemn'd;</hi> can it be imputed to
God, as Severity, to condemn them?
That Judge will be excused from all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
who passes Sentence of Execution
upon a Malefactor, * <hi>whom</hi> his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
accuses. This will be the World's
Condemnation: that where Men either
<hi>did</hi> know, or <hi>might</hi> know, they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Light: that Men put out the
Candle of God in them, that they may do
Evil without Check or Controul; that
Men take upon them to controul the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
and immutable Laws of Everlasting
Righteousness, Goodness, and Truth;
which is the Law of Heaven; that Men
are bold to confound Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in God's Family, (for <hi>so</hi> the World
is;) that Men do Evil, <hi>knowingly,</hi> in the
use of their Liberty and Freedom: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God himself, in whom there is the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of all Liberty, doth declare of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56135:58"/>
that all his Ways <hi>are Ways of Goodness,
Righteousness and Truth.</hi> And can God by
Power or Priviledge, do that which is
not just? Is there any Unrighteousness in
God? God forbid. Yet those that have
Liberty but by Participation; pretending
the Use of Liberty; do <hi>that</hi> which is not
fit to be done. This will be the World's
Condemnation. In the case of Sin, there
is internal Guilt: a Man doth wrong the
Principles of his Mind: he breaks his
Internal Peace; and will rue it to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
The Judgment of God at the last
day will be easie: for there will be none
to be condemn'd, but what were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
before. For Man's Misery arises
<hi>out of himself;</hi> and is not <hi>by Positive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</hi>
Men run upon Mistakes, the
Wicked and Prophane think, that if God
<hi>would,</hi> they may please themselves, and no
harm done: and that it is <hi>the Will</hi> of God
only, that limits, and restrains them: and
they think, that they were out of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
if God would forbear a Positive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
This is the Grand Mistake. Hell
is not <hi>a Positive Infliction:</hi> but the Fewel
of it, is the Guiltiness of Mens Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and God's withdrawing, because the
Person is uncapable of his Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Sin is an Act of Violence in it self.
The Sinner doth force himself: and stirs
up Strife within himself; and in a Sinner,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56135:59"/>
there is that <hi>within,</hi> which doth reluctate,
and condemn him in the inward Court
of his own Conscience.<note place="margin">1 John 3. 20.</note> For if our Hearts
did not condemn us, all <hi>without,</hi> might
be avoided: all else would fail, if this
Internal Guilt, and Self-Condemnation,
might be removed. But this Naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Disposition, and Incapacity of
Repentance, is <hi>that</hi> which continues the
Subject in Misery. Hell * <hi>therefore</hi> is
not a Positive Infliction, but doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
follow upon Guiltiness, and a spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
devilish, naughty Disposition unto
God and Goodness.</p>
                  <p>There is something in every Man, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which we may work, to which we
may apply; to wit, <hi>the Light of Reason
and Conscience;</hi> to which the Difference
of Good and Evil may be made appear.
If we, therefore, declare Godliness, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and Truth; Men have a <hi>Voice</hi>
to give Testimony; and <hi>Conscience</hi> in
Men, will yield; notwithstanding the
power Lust hath over them. If Reason
may not <hi>command;</hi> it will <hi>condemn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly; <hi>Here</hi> you may have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
what it is that gives a Check and
a Stop to the Motion of the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
There is an Error in the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
which is hardly remedied:
which is want of Advertency, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
Men do not awaken their
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56135:59"/>
Principles, but give themselves leave to
do what they cannot justifie themselves
in. Now there is no place for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Motion of the Divine Grace, where
the <hi>former</hi> Grace is neglected, and * <hi>ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd</hi>
ineffectual. It is <hi>self-neglect,</hi> and
<hi>voluntary allowing of our selves in Evil,</hi>
which brings us to Misery. For there is
no <hi>Invincible Ignorance,</hi> in respect of
things good in themselves, and necessary.
No Ignorance excuses <hi>Immorality,</hi> in any
Instance whatsoever: but, invincible Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
doth excuse <hi>Infidelity,</hi> in the
chiefest Point. The Reason is, because
the high Points of Sobriety, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Temperance, God hath <hi>made</hi>
every Man to know: but, for the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of his Will, Man must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of God; and if God do not
make Application to him; where he doth
not <hi>give,</hi> he doth not <hi>require.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take notice, then, of the Boldness and
Presumption of these obstinate, rebellious,
and contumacious Sinners; who having
this Proclamation from the Majesty of
Heaven, that the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> &amp;c. yet
will dare to continue in Practices of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,
and assume to themselves
power to controul the establish'd Laws
of everlasting Goodness, Righteousness,
and Truth; and to vary from t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

of things, to gratifie their own
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56135:60"/>
Sence, and to please their own Humours,
and to serve their own Ends, and take
upon them to over-rule all things that
are holy, settled, and establish'd from
Eternity. What shall a Man say to such
Persons? Yet the Atheistical and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
are guilty of this Contumacy. But
as the Apostle says,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Their Condemnation
is just, and their Judgment lingers not.</hi>
We seem agriev'd at God's Plagues and
Judgments which do so much disturb our
Peace and Settlement in the World: but
we do greater Acts of Violence. For we
imprison Truth, and give God true cause
of Offence, and take upon us to controul
the Establish'd Laws of Heaven, and to
do other things than the reason of things
dictates to us, and directs us to do. For
the Text tells us, that those that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to God's Wrath, <hi>are Persons of
ungodly Practice; so that they are, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
condemn'd:</hi> They cannot give an

For, whereas here is exprest
only his POWER; it is a usual <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche;</hi>
instancing in <hi>one,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

use no other Arguments to prove there is

Revelation supposes it;) therefore I shall
forbear all other Reasons. For tho' I
might produce many <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Things;
yet, because they are abstract from Sence,
they shall not be nam'd. Therefore I

Substances, and intelligent Agents,
that shew there is a God. For they do
far transcend Mind and Understanding
in Man: Therefore they must be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of some higher Being. And if we
bring a Man to acknowledge a Being that
is abler and wiser than himself, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
<hi>Deity.</hi>

We our selves are intelligent Agents: We
can do many things: We can disarm the
Creation below us, and turn them to our
own defence; but for the Sun, Moon,
and Stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We cannot produce these
things. But, we, that are intelligent Agents,
do many strange Effects in Comparison of
what the Beasts below, do: <hi>They</hi> cannot
take Cognizance of <hi>our</hi> Actions. But
there are Operations beyond our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
* <hi>and which surpass our Wisdom:</hi>
Therefore, because we * (<hi>who are able to
do such things our selves,</hi>) are Intelligent,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56135:64"/>
and have Understanding; we must as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
that there must be an intelligent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
that is higher and nobler than our
selves; upon whose Power and Skill these
surpassing Effects depend. This is a true
Knowledge of God, and where more is
not reveal'd, God will not require more.
This is <hi>Tully</hi>'s Argument: And this comes
home to the Apostle in the Text, for
the Apostle says, his BEING, his POW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER
(<hi>one,</hi> for <hi>all</hi> his Perfections) they are
understood in a Way of Reason, <hi>by the
Effects of God in the World.</hi> The Height
and Excellency of Man, in the Use of
his Reason, is over-born and transcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Effects</hi> in Nature. Therefore
they are the Effects of an Agent more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and more <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>kilful, more knowing and
more powerful; and he is abundantly
good.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto, I have only shewn, that it
is knowable, by the Use of Reason and
Understanding, that there is a God:
ALL THINGS BEING MADE IN
SUCH PROPORTION AND SUCH
FITNESS, ONE TO ANOTHER: And
Man's Reason is transcended: For we go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after God, are at a Loss; there is so
much of Wisdom, and Knowledge, and
Curiosity, in the Things that are made.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56135:64"/>
We cannot therefore but Reverence an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
that is higher than we <hi>are.</hi> For, an
Account is not be given of them, in way
of Human Understanding.—Now I
will give <hi>Four</hi> Arguments, that it is more
knowable there is a God, and what God
is, in some measure, than any thing
else.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>(1<hi>st,</hi>) God is more knowable, <hi>in respect
of the Amplitude and Fulness of his Being;</hi>
because of that Ocean of <hi>Entity,</hi> that Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Being, that is in him. * <hi>This is
as</hi> the Sea * <hi>in Comparison to</hi> a small Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet.
Every Creature is <hi>a Line</hi> leading
to God. God is every-where, in every
thing. So we cannot miss of him. For
<hi>the Heavens declare the Glory of God,</hi>
                        <note>Psal. 19. 1.</note> and
every Grass in the Field declares God.
Man's Understanding is every-where
* <hi>transcended.</hi> He cannot give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how several Varieties of Colours
are in a Flower; how the same Juice or
Glebe of Earth should produce such Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Colours. We say in Natural
Philosophy, we know not the <hi>Modes</hi> of
any thing. No Man knoweth the <hi>Mode</hi>
how his Soul and Body are united: How
the several Particles of Matter meet. We
are puzzled to know what Motion is:
We can give no Account of these Things.
Now there being an <hi>Amplitude,</hi> and <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56135:65"/>
of Being</hi> in God, he is the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.
He hath all <hi>Being</hi> perfectly in
him. He is therefore more knowable than
Creatures, that are of limited, confin'd,
narrow Beings. The divided, separated,
scatter'd Perfections of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are united in God; and, with that
Advance, and Improvement, extended to
infinite Perfection.</item>
                     <item>
                        <p>(2<hi>dly,</hi>) The <hi>Ways of our knowing,</hi> do
more truly hold of God, than of any
thing else.</p>
                        <p>* <hi>There are</hi> two Ways of coming to
the Knowledge of Things: The Way of
<hi>Perfection,</hi> and the Way of <hi>Negation:</hi>
By these <hi>two</hi> Ways we come to a more
full Knowledge.—(1.) In the Way
of <hi>Perfection;</hi> we cannot exceed; we
need not fear to add to much. If you
speak of Man's Soul; you may say too
much: But speaking of God, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
transcend Divine Existence, in the
Enumeration of any Perfections. If we
would express a Notion of our Maker,
we should employ our Mind and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
to find out what is best, and
what is most perfect; and, then, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
and ascribe it to God. And this is
the best Way to come to the Knowledge
of God.—(2.) In the Way of <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                           <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56135:65"/>
we are also certain: For we cannot
remove Imperfection, Contraction, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
far enough from him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we say, that Words and Phrases
are all to be purg'd and purified from
their Contraction, and Limitation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we can ascribe them to God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
where, in Scripture, God is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the Eyes, or other Parts of our
Body; we must not understand these
things formally, but in a Way of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
So that <hi>our Ways of knowing,</hi> do
more truly hold <hi>of God</hi> than <hi>of any thing
else.</hi> For in the Way of <hi>adding Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
we cannot do too much: And in the
Way of <hi>Limitation,</hi> we cannot take away
too much.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>(3<hi>dly,</hi>) <hi>Our Relation to God.</hi>—We
stand nearer related to God, than we do
to any thing in the World. Our <hi>Souls</hi>
and <hi>Bodies</hi> are not nearer related, than
our <hi>Souls</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> God is more inward
to us than our very Souls. In him we
live, move, and have our Being. God
is nearer to us than what is most our
selves.—Also it is the natural and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Employment of Mind and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
to make Search and Enquiry
after God. The wise Man says, God is
known <hi>by the Fitness and Proportion of one
thing to another,</hi> Mind and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56135:66"/>
in Man, is given on purpose, that
Man should search after God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him. So that there is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Propriety of Man's <hi>Rational Faculties</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> than there is of his <hi>Eye</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi>
or his <hi>Ear</hi> to <hi>Sound.</hi> And it is of greater
Deformity for a Man to be <hi>void of Sence
of Deity,</hi> than for any Man to be <hi>blind,</hi>
so as not to see.</item>
                     <item>(4<hi>thly,</hi>) <hi>Our Dependance upon God;</hi>
his Conservation of us; and his Co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
with us; this leads us to know
him.—Universal and general <hi>Causes</hi>
have ready Acknowledgment: Because to
them so many things are beholding. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
well observes, the Sun which is
the universal Cause, doth concur with
every particular Cause to every Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note>Psal. 19. 6.</note>
So the <hi>Psalmist, Nothing is hid from
the Heat of it.</hi> For, tho' the Earth be
not perceptive of the Light of the Sun,
because of its Grossness and Opacity; yet
it hath the Vertue of it. So God is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd.
God's concerning himself
in our Affairs, and our Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, hath a kind of <hi>Universal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.</hi>
Take any Man of any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
of Mind, if he relate any thing that
befals him; he will interpose, <hi>as God
would have it:</hi> If he escape any Danger;
he will say, <hi>as God put it into my Mind,</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:56135:66"/>
and give God the chief Place. Thus in
several Cases: As in Distress, <hi>O God!</hi>
our Undertakings, <hi>in the Name of God:</hi>
Our Protestations, <hi>in the Presence of God.</hi>
Tho, these, in the Mouths of many, be
but Words of course, spoken without
inward Sence of God in the Mind; yet
the Custom of them proceeds from a good
Original. They carry Reason in them,
and shew Nature's Sence. What is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Ground, is not of any long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance:
But <hi>these</hi> meet with no Reproof;
gain Credit, give Assurance, find Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and become Religious Persons,
when us'd in weighty Cases, and with
serious Minds and due Intention. Since,
therefore, there is such a Dependance of
our Souls upon God; it is impossible but
that we should know him. They who
are in any degree Spiritual, or Intelectual,
and are not altogether sunk down into a
brutish Spirit and sensual Affection; find,
and <hi>feel,</hi> within themselves, Divine Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,
Motions and Inspirations. Any
Man that hath obtain'd any Degree of
the Perfection of Reason; that doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Divine Governour of Man's Life,
<hi>Reason;</hi> he doth find that there are <hi>Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions</hi>
and <hi>Inspirations;</hi> and that, many
times, when he was resolv'd another way,
there comes <hi>a Light</hi> into his Mind, a <hi>still
Voice;</hi> he hears, and he is better direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56135:67"/>
Except the Atheistical, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
and those that are Diabolical, all
others, <hi>feel</hi> God, in his Motions and Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions.
—Thus, is God most know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of any thing in the World.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Here, you have an Account of the Use
of Reason, in Matters of Religion: The
Natural Knowledge of God: And the
Knowledge of the Revelation of his
Will.—The <hi>Natural Knowledge</hi> of God,
<hi>that,</hi> is the very Issue, Effect, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Reason. <hi>Revelation</hi> is the other
part of Religion: And Reason is the
Recipient. What doth God give his
Commands to, or his Councels, but to
the intelligent Agent, and the Reason of
Man? So that <hi>Reason</hi> hath great place in
Religion. For Reason is the <hi>Recipient</hi>
of whatsoever God declares. And those
things that are according to the Nature
of God, the Reason of Man can disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
It is either the <hi>Efficient,</hi> or the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient</hi>
of all that is call'd Religion, of
all that is communicated from God to
Man. The Natural Knowledge of God
is the Product <hi>of Reason:</hi> The Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Will, for our further Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
are proposed and communicated
<hi>to Reason:</hi> and, * <hi>in</hi> both these ways, we
are <hi>taught of God.</hi> In the former, we
are <hi>made</hi> to know: And in the latter,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56135:67"/>
we are call'd to be made Partakers of
God's Councel. By <hi>the former,</hi> we know
what God is, his Nature, that he is: By
<hi>the latter,</hi> what God would have us to
do. So here you see the Use of Mind
and Understanding in the Way of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
God teaches us in his Creation,
in giving us such Faculties; he teaches
us further, in the Resolution of his
Will; because he satisfies us in what he
doth impose upon us. Therefore <hi>the Use
of Reason in Matters of Religion,</hi> is so far
from doing any Harm to Religion; that
it is the proper <hi>Preparatory</hi> for Men to
look out to God. Reason may say, <hi>I
did expect it, I did believe such a thing,
from the first and chiefest Good:</hi> Now, <hi>I
am told it is so.</hi> Man in the true Use of
sober and impartial Reason, knowing
that he hath not perform'd his Duty to
God; is put upon laying out, for God's
Pardon, in the Way of the Grace of the
Gospel. Man knows he is of limited
Perfection, he is not good enough to his
own Satisfaction: And therefore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he hath fail'd, his Reason leads
him to look abroad, to look out, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good Word that comes from the
Mouth of God: And when he reads in
the Bible, <hi>that God will pardon Sin;</hi> that
which he expected in the Use of Reason,
he may be satisfied is true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:56135:68"/>Thus Scripture represents the State of
Man's Creation; that it is the proper Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of Mind and Understanding,
to seek after God, to act our Faculties,
<hi>to feel God.</hi>
                     <note>Acts 17. 27.</note> Therefore it is the Depth
of Degeneracy, to be without God in
the World; to have God far from our
Remembrance. There is a natural and
indelible Sence of Deity, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Religion, in the Mind of Man.
Neither is there any Plea or Apology *<hi>for
the want of this.</hi> For there is no invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Difficulty; no Ignorance: We are
not <hi>taught,</hi> but <hi>made</hi> to know. There is
no Impotency: For every one can use
the Parts of Nature; at least, when at
Age. *<hi>There is</hi> no Impediment: For it
is transacted <hi>within ones self:</hi> Not subject
to the Controul of any Usurper. For,
an internal <hi>Elicit</hi> Act is exempt from all
the World: And may be done by the
Mind, which is at liberty; when the
Person is under restraint. For, unless
you can keep him perpetually from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
you cannot keep him from Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon God, or from other internal
Acts.</p>
                  <p>God's Communications awaken to this.
Now all we have are such * (<hi>viz. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
from God.</hi>) What have we that
we receive not?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:56135:68"/>Man's Principles incline: For, all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
tends to God. God is the
Center of reasonable Souls, and Spirits.</p>
                  <p>Things about us, contribute objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God.</hi>
Man cannot look abroad; but something
of God offers it self; something sounds
in his Ear. No Voice in Nature so loud:
No Language so easie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
                  <p>To the Christian World, there is God's
superadded Instrument, <hi>the Scripture;</hi>
which contains Matters of Revelation
from God; whereby, also, the natural
<hi>Notices</hi> of God, are awaken'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven'd.</p>
                  <p>To Sum up all. The Language of our
Souls <hi>within;</hi> the Impressions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom throughout the Creation;
the objective Acclamations of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
carry us on, strongly, to Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God. <hi>All thy Works praise thee, O
Lord.</hi> Holy Scripture comes in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of these, to repeat and reinforce
them. So that <hi>He</hi> must of Necessity be
very dissolute, and profligate, in respect
of his Manners; of a havock'd Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and confounded Understanding;
who being Partaker of intelectual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
intelligent, by Vertue of his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
living in the midst of <hi>Speaking Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>
(for Things <hi>speak,</hi>) doth not spell
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56135:69"/>
God out, in the Variety or Curiosity of
his Creatures; nor understand the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                  <p>I must needs tell the loose, prophane
World; *<hi>those</hi> who being harden'd by
Custom and Practice, do controul Grounds
and Principles of sober Reason and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
thinking all to be lawful that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do, and the Guise of the World an
account of Action; pretending the Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and Uncertainty of Reason, from
the several Opinions of incompetent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(which is the only Defence and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology,
for exorbitant living, such cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
Persons have;) willing to believe
what their Lusts lead them to, and what
they would fain have to be true; * <hi>I must
tell them, that</hi> if ever they come to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd;
to have serious Thoughts; to
reflect upon themselves; comparing what
they have done, with Principles of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and impartial Reason, not born to
gratifie Sence, or to comply with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
they will prove burthensome to
their Conscience, and to the Sence of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
so that they will be confounded in
themselves; ready to call on Mountains
and Hills to fall upon them, and cover
them from the Face of their Judge; and
will be found Speechless. Man cannot
be at ease, till all he hath sinfully done,
be undone; till <hi>right Judgment,</hi> which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56135:69"/>
hath been violently forc'd, be renew'd;
and regular Life and Conversation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd.
All this must be done by mental
Illumination, Conviction, and Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture-way of Dealing with
Men, in Matters of Religion, is always
by Evidence of Reason and Argument.
In Conversion, there must be a Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the whole inward Man. The
Sence of the Soul must incline to God:
The <hi>Reason of the Mind, * must be</hi> the
same with the <hi>Reason of Things.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Religion,</hi> indeed, is openly contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

nauseous, fulsome Principles, of
the Superstitious: And I reckon that <hi>what</hi>

Application to him, by any of his
Creatures, in any Case of Necessity and
Misery. For God is known to us, by
<hi>Good.</hi> And there is no true Notion of
God, unless the full Form, Essence, and
Substance of <hi>Good,</hi> be fully in it: For
there is no absolute Perfection but in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with Goodness: wherefore God
magnifies his Mercy, Goodness, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
fair compassionate equal Dealing,
above all other his names. But those that
are of malignant, spightful, envious,
naughty Dispositions, they think it is the
Excellency of God to be revengeful, and
to drive Designs of Ill upon his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. <hi>Thou thoughtest I was
such an one as thy self.</hi> And, really, do
we find Men of narrow Spirits, that are
ready to malign the Good of their
Neighbour; you may be confident what
Apprehensions they have of God: a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to one, but the Excellency of these
Mens Divinity, is <hi>Soveraignty</hi> to ruin a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56135:72"/>
great part of his Creation, to show his
Power. But nothing is more certain,
than that Infinite Goodness doth to the
full, what is Good. Nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
than that God doth answer the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he stands in, to his Creation: and
where we see Indulgency of Fathers; this
Goodness of Disposition in them, is but
a Communication from God, a Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of his Affection to his Creatures,
in some measure: for is there any thing
of Perfection in all the World, that doth
not derive from him, who is <hi>the first, and
chiefest Good?</hi>—When you have done
all you can; the best Notion you can
have of Deity, is <hi>Goodness.</hi> God, and
Good, are best known by one another.
He that came from God, came <hi>to seek and
to save.</hi> It is, therefore, not a Divine
Work, to make havock and spoil.—This
is the first thing in Religion: <hi>to have true
Suppositions concerning God.</hi> And if we
have not these; we may <hi>dread</hi> and <hi>fear</hi>
him, as an Enemy; but * <hi>not love him:</hi>
we shall withdraw from God, yea <hi>hate</hi>
him, and seek Happiness other-where.</item>
                     <item>3<hi>dly.</hi> For Men to assume to themselves
Power, and Authority, to assign <hi>a Mode</hi>
of Divine Worship; to make some mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
thing, a Representation of God to us,
or exhibitive of his Influence, to make
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56135:72"/>
an <hi>Instrument</hi> in Divine Worship, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
warrant from God, or * <hi>as</hi> accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in way of Reason. This is <hi>not to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
God, as God.</hi> For <hi>this</hi> is to limit and
confine him. This hath been done pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously
in the Heathen World. And
this is that which God took so much Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at, in the Jewish State. And there
is the same thing in the use of the Roman
Worship. In former times God did make
some material things a Testimony of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
as the Temple was the place of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinah,</hi>
or Divine Habitation. There should
be no <hi>Shecinah,</hi> but by Divine Assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
God may do what he pleases: but,
for us, to take upon us, is <hi>to change the
Glory of the incorruptable God into an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi>
&amp;c. and to turn the Truth of God
into a Lye; and serve the Creature, more
than the Creator. This, the <hi>Israelites</hi> did.
For, when they made <hi>a Calf;</hi> they would
have something of Divine Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
which tho' the Text <hi>so</hi> calls, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
yet they, by the name of <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</hi>
And this is also, in Popish-Church
Images. It is not reasonable to imagine
the Heathen World did otherwise. The
Idolatry of the World hath been about
the <hi>Medium</hi> of Worship, not about the
<hi>Object.</hi> Can any one think the Jews were
so stupid and sottish as to think that what
they made, did make them? or that their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56135:73"/>
Calf did bring them out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> The
Calf was <hi>Loco Mosis, non Dei.</hi> These
* <hi>things</hi> are prohibited in the second
Commandment; the Reason of which is
moral, and perpetual.</item>

—It is expected (and nothing is more

endeavour to be, in our measure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
what God is, in his Height and

<hi>to think that all the Ways of God are Truth,

<hi>Religion</hi> in us, to bring forth the Fruits
of <hi>Truth, Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Goodness.</hi>
We glorifie God, therefore, in the fullest

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56135:74"/>
Divine Institution, and choice things, are
represented as things most infamous and
abominable.—How comes this to pass?
—Because they <hi>have chosen their own
Ways,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 66. 3.</note> and <hi>their Souls delight in their own

Nature that cannot be corrupted: <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>

and corrupted; they may be in an ill
Conjunction; and they will be looked
upon as <hi>Bribes</hi> to satisfie God for Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.
—That God who is of purer

pleas'd with any thing that may pretend,
by way of recompence, for any impure,
filthy, immoral Acts.—So <hi>Isaiah</hi> 1. 11,
12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these things were instituted
by God, and required under great Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
What work doth this Prophet
make, to cry down all Religion among
them? If he lived in our days, he would
cry down a great deal of Formality; yea
things really Good; if in Conjunction
with Immorality.—If Men be immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
in any way whatsoever; if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to any Iniquity; if they allow
themselves in any evil Practice; if they
admit any such thing; it doth spoil all
their Religion.—We may conclude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
all our Devotions, and all those
things that are but <hi>the Ministries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56135:74"/>
of Piety,</hi> (which are good in
their right use;) if they are performed
to be glorified in, to be boasted of; it is
but <hi>as magnifying the Name of God, and
not departing from Iniquity:</hi> If there be
any Act of Unrighteousness; it doth not
only blemish, but marr, and spoil all. And
is it not plainly said, <hi>the Sacrifice of the
Wicked is an Abomination to the Lord?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 15. 8.</note>
as also <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8. Wherefore Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,

Sacrifice; <hi>that</hi> is what is worthy of the

tho' it be Divine Institution, is to God
unacceptable, if in Conjunction with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality.</p>

—<hi>Galen,</hi> the famous Physician, having
occasion to observe the Curiosity that is in
the Make of Man's Body, doth make a
Hymn to God. <q>This, *(<hi>says he</hi>) is
the truest Worship of God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
and this is far more acceptable,
and better in it self; than if I were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bring a thousand Sacrifices, or
should offer the choicest Incense and
Perfumes; if I my self be sensible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge;
and, upon occasion exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
and represent the <hi>Power</hi> of the
Creator, the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Creator,
and his <hi>Goodness:</hi> His <hi>Power * and
Wisdom,</hi> for that he hath contrived, in
Mode and Figure, so many Fitnesses;
and <hi>his Goodness,</hi> in that he hath so
fully communicated himself. For, what
are Creatures, but Divine Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
and this do I understand to be
the best Worship of God, and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of that Sacrifice which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
of Hecatombs of Beasts, and of the
purest Incense.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:56135:76"/>One thing we have, and but <hi>one</hi> thing,
which we may call <hi>our own:</hi> I mean the
<hi>Consent of our Minds:</hi> and <hi>that</hi> must be
<hi>ours;</hi> or else it is not <hi>our Consent:</hi> it is
not <hi>what it is,</hi> unless it be our own. And
yet we must acknowledge the Grace of
God, that it is our own, by Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence.
Now let us by our own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Act, addict and determine our
selves to God. Let us afford him the
Consent of our Minds; <hi>i. e.</hi> make him
our Delight and our Choice; take Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
Content, and Satisfaction in him.
This is the fullest way of <hi>Thankfulness</hi> to
God; out of sence of his Excellency and
Goodness, to reckon all our Happiness to
consist in our Enjoyment of him, our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and living in Communion and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him. So that we have
where-withal to sacrifice to God: We
have the <hi>Consent of our Minds.</hi> We have
this, from God, to be <hi>our own Act.</hi> We
may make him our Choice, breath after

                  </p>
                  <p>* <hi>Thus</hi> I * <hi>have</hi> made Explication of
Unthankfulness.—We owe Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to God, because we live by his Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
It is most natural to make Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56135:76"/>
and to make thankful Returns
to God.—Their Accusation is, that
<hi>they did not glorifie him as God; and were
unthankful.</hi> The Argument of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Aggravation of the Fault, is,
<hi>because God made them capable of knowing
that God is,</hi> and <hi>that willingly and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
they were thus wanting, and so did
transgress.</hi> That Person is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable,
* <hi>and</hi> self-condemned, who
knowing that he hath a Creator that is of
infinite Power, Goodness, and Wisdom;
and having Sense and Knowledge that
there is a God, (as God hath <hi>made</hi> Man
to have) doth not adore him, fulfil his
Will, is not observant of him, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
toward him, doth not rejoyce, and
delight in him. * <hi>So that</hi> Irreligion is the
most unnatural thing in the World.</p>
                  <p>Truth is <hi>a seminal Principle</hi> with which
the Mind of Man being impregnated,
ought to bring forth: and in this case
* <hi>there should be</hi> neither <hi>Barrenness,</hi> nor
<hi>Abortions.</hi> For, Rational Nature is as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
and proportionable to its Effects,
as any vital Principle besides in the
World. If hurting a Woman with Child,
so as Mischief followeth, be so punisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
(<hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 23.) what is this case of
Destroying the <hi>Seed</hi> of God <hi>in Man's
Minds.</hi> For so it is called 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56135:77"/>
Seed is accounted lost when, * <hi>being</hi>
sown in the Ground, it never comes up.
So are Notions of things in Minds, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their Acts and Vertues. Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the Mind by Knowledge, is
to the Soul, as Leaven put into the Meal.
It is as natural that <hi>Will</hi> should follow, as
that <hi>Understanding</hi> should go first. We
first receive from God by mental Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
<hi>there Judgment passes into Victory.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 20</note>
God enlightens the World, <hi>by the Sun,</hi> in
reference to Actions of several Creatures:
He doth not illuminate the intellectual
World of Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> Angels, and Souls,
<hi>by the Influence and Communication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
to less purpose. Wheresoever God,
who is the Father of Light, and God of
Truth, sends his Rays and Beams into the
Souls of Men; there he expects the Mind
to be purified, as well as enlightned. And
in case of failure, he will severely chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the Impediment.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>imprisoning and controuling of
Truth,</hi> is an Action of the highest Injury,
and Offence to God, that a Man can
commit; beyond what we can easily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
For whosoever hath received any
thing from God, by Mental Illumination,
if he doth not pursue it, to the Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Spirit; he doth <hi>counter-work</hi>
God. He who stifles, or goes against his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56135:77"/>
Knowledge, doth in effect, give a Check
to God's working in him. For us, thus
to do, would be to reject God, where we
most find, and <hi>feel</hi> him; to strike at <hi>the
Image of God</hi> in our selves. What would
not this naughty Disposition of Heart, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Heart, carry Man out to, if he had
Power and Opportunity against God?
For, doth it not declare a Displacency
and Antipathy against God, for Man to
run from <hi>that</hi> in himself, which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
comes from God, beares his Image,
hath his Stamp upon it? Where the Truth
of God is inwardly disgusted, disrelished,
so as not to be concocted, and turned into
Spiritual Nourishment; is not there an
exasperated and implacable Spirit against
God?</p>
                  <p>Truth is connatural to a Man's Soul,
and, in Conjunction with it, becomes the
Mind's Temper, Complexion, Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
therefore must be kindly used. <hi>What</hi>
Health and Strength are to the Body, <hi>that</hi>
Truth is to the Mind and Understanding.
The <hi>former</hi> makes Men strong, vigorous,
Bodily active; the <hi>latter</hi> clears the Sight,
cures all Infirmities of the Mind.—<hi>What</hi>
Obstructions are in the Body, which are
mischievous to Operations of Nature; <hi>that</hi>
violent Detensions of <hi>Notices</hi> and <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of Action, or Contradictions to the
Reason of the Mind, are, in intelectual
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56135:78"/>
Life.—What we eat and drink, if it be
not first subdued, by the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and then convey'd to the several
parts of the Body, for their Sustenance
and Nutriment, becomes matter of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
and Sickness. Knowledge is the Mind's
* <hi>Sustenance and Nutriment;</hi> therefore is
not ultimately to rest in <hi>Understanding;</hi>
but in <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections;</hi> should become
<hi>Goodness;</hi> and, in Conversation, and
Actions of Life, produce <hi>Obedience;</hi> and
is the same thing under several Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
and in respect to different Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudes,
and distinct Functions, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses;
as the Sea which is one and the
same, is one-where called the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,</hi>
in another place the <hi>German Ocean,</hi>
and the like. The Understanding is not
enlightned finally for <hi>it self;</hi> but * <hi>is</hi> as
the Eye, * <hi>which</hi> receives Light for the
Use and Service, Guidance and Direction
of the Body. In intelectual Nature, first
<hi>the Understanding</hi> satisfies it self in the
Reason of things; then <hi>the Will</hi> gives
consent; and the Notion forthwith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
matter of Action, Life, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
The <hi>Understanding</hi> in the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Knowledge, and the <hi>Will</hi> not in a
Disposition of Goodness, makes no Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
but are vastly disproportionable.</p>
                  <p>As it is the most unsafe; so it is the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56135:78"/>
most uneasie Condition to any Person,
to KNOW, and not to BE; <hi>to know, and
not to do;</hi> to have <hi>Judgment of Right,</hi> and
<hi>Conscience of Iniquity.</hi> And were I <hi>to tell</hi>
Men what is <hi>Hell,</hi> on this side Hell; I

—A refractory Will, exorbitant Lusts,
and strong Passions and Affections, are
unruly things, under the single command
of Judgment. Men were as good to be
exposed to the Fury of <hi>wild Horses. Elihu</hi>
speaks of <hi>the Notions of the Mind</hi> as things
which do <hi>elevate and transport.<note place="margin">Job 32. 18.</note> The hollow

It is as easie for a Man to carry
Fire in his Breast, as to offer Violence to
Truth, within one's self, and not to be in a

                  <p>I, now, come to make Inquiry, since
such a thing <hi>is;</hi> so deformed and ugly;
so horrid and monstrous; so unnatural
and violent; how comes it to pass that
such a thing is found in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of Mankind, who is made and
constituted by God <hi>the Governour of this
World?</hi> whereas there is nothing of this,
in inferiour Nature: But all inferior Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
keeps its Order.—* <hi>To give Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this in</hi> Four Particulars.</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:56135:79"/>
                     <item>1<hi>st,</hi> The least that is be said in the
Case, is; a great part of Men <hi>live in a
Hurry, and are seldom at leisure to consider,
or attend.</hi> There are Avocations, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions,
and other Employments, that
make Men * <hi>of no Ability,</hi> as to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or discerning of Truth. For its a
true Maxim, <hi>A Man's Parts and Wit is
where 'tis used and employ'd.</hi> A neglected
Faculty may shrivel up to nothing. But,
to be nobly and generously employ'd,
and to use the Faculties of God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in us, according to the Intention,
for which they were given; <hi>this</hi> is both
conservative to our Nature, and agreeable
to Truth. We give too little Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to Truth, entertain it too slightly,
to have it at command. We live in a flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and worldly Spirit, and at the World's
Call; hurried on by every Lust; being
distemper'd and disaffected <hi>within,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
and interrupted <hi>from without.</hi> We
are not at leisure to attend upon Truth,
to receive it, to obey it.—Men drudge
in the World; debase their Faculties;
make their intelectual Faculties very <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites;</hi>
employ them about base, mean,
and worldly Employments: They are
not in a Disposition to receive and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Truth. Men have abused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56135:79"/>
brought themselves, by unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Practice, into an unnatural State; so
* <hi>they</hi> disgust and disrelish Truth. Men
give themselves up to worldly Drudgery,
the mean Avocations and Distractions of
the World: So they are never at leisure
to mind these things. And no Man is
valuable, sufficient, or competent to give
a Judgment, to make a Report, wherein
he is not exercised, wherein he is not
greatly considerative.—Man, unless he
sometimes take himself out of the World
by Self-reflection and Retirement, he will
be little <hi>himself</hi> in the World, and in
danger of losing himself. He will have
very poor Enjoyment of himself; and
little Use of his Powers, and Faculties,
especially as to Spiritual Acts, wherein he
is <hi>most concerned,</hi> and <hi>most perfected.</hi>—
This is out Temptation, and hereby we
come to be deceived; because things <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally</hi>
consider'd, are within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of lawful Imployment; therefore
we little doubt, or fear: Whereas <hi>altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
they rob us of our selves, and snatch
us from what is <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Principal.</hi> We
are apt to be troubled about many things;
while we omit the <hi>one thing</hi> necessary.
Men of any * <hi>sort of</hi> Religion think it
necessary to observe the Difference of
Good and Evil; and therefore they will
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56135:80"/>
not be employ'd in that which is not
<hi>Honest:</hi> But there is something further:
Let Men consider, that things of lawful
Employment, if <hi>too many,</hi> may snatch a
Man away from himself, and keep him
from attending upon God; by which he
may be happy. Therefore we should not
too much <hi>charge</hi> our selves, nor be over
<hi>busie</hi> in the World.</item>
                     <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> Men are apt, <hi>in the first place, to
save themselves harmless, in this hurtful
and dangerous World. * It</hi> was St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<hi>Master, save thy self; this Evil shall not
befal thee;</hi> who might have undone him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and all the World besides; if his
Councel had been followed. A great
Man of our Nation hath observ'd in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;
and it is so in this Case; <hi>he that
follows Truth close at the Heels, may chance
to have his Teeth struck out.</hi> As the World
may go; to hold forth Truth impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and severely to keep to the Practice of
it, may prove the difficultest and costliest
Service. Truth may carry us into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests,
where <hi>other Mens</hi> Principles clash,
and interfere with <hi>ours.</hi> Truth allows
not base Compliance with Fancy, Lust,
Will, Humour; but requires us to keep
in the Way, and to walk in it, with all
Simplicity, Integrity, Sincerity, Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Open-heartedness. We must
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56135:80"/>
neither desert nor betray Truth, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite
our selves out of Difficulties, or to
open a Way to escape. Man must walk
in his Integrity through the World, and
must maintain his Truth, and Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as <hi>Job</hi> did his Righteousness: So that
By-standers may rectifie themselves by
comparing with him; and so find out,
how much they have departed from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> distinguisheth between
a <hi>Friend</hi> and a <hi>Flatterer.</hi> 
                        <q>The former
stands as steady as an Oak, and he doth
not at all yield to humour Will or
Fancy; so that the other, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
from his Exorbitancy, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
himself and finding where he
left him, may know how far he hath
departed from his Integrity. Whereas,
the <hi>Flatterer</hi> accomodates himself to
Humour, and Fancy; applauds all
Deeds, and Sayings; will do every
thing to gratifie; and will admire what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is said: But a true Friend hath
Truth for a Rule to his Life and Spirit.</q>
But as the World goes, a Man of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Truth, and Uprightness, shall be
laid aside, as not conversible, but as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
and Cynical.—But here I super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>add,
for Explication; that all that I
have said of <hi>adhering to Truth,</hi> is to be
understood <hi>of the undoubted Principles of
Piety, Sobriety and Righteousness:</hi> For,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56135:81"/>
saving in <hi>these</hi> Cases; to please every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to give every one Satisfaction, to go
as far as you can with Men; to live in a
Universal Reconciliation, if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
with the whole Creation of God;
this is <hi>Evangelical</hi> and <hi>Divine.</hi> This is
not to be limited, but with Conscience to
the great Rights of <hi>Sobriety, Temperance</hi>
and <hi>Justice.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3<hi>dly, Men gratifie their Sences; steep
themselves in Worldly Delights and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi>
Sensuality makes <hi>the Pallate</hi> of the
Soul so dull and gross, that it cannot
perceive that which is sincere and true.
Wisdom is not in the Way of <hi>Epicurism;</hi>
but in the Way of <hi>Sobriety, Righteousness</hi>
and <hi>Temperance.</hi> For, Knowledge will
not be relished, till the Soul be purified
by Abstinence, by Mortification, by Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
from gross Matter, and by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from Sense, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.
5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 3.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25. These places represent the
State, when Men become brutish, and
sottish, and fail in the Species of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Agents; go downward; grow less,
by steeping themselves in worldly, bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,
and carnal Pleasures. The <hi>Sensualist</hi>
is no capable Recipient, nor meet Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner
of Divine and Spiritual Truth.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:56135:81"/>4<hi>thly, By long abuse of themselves,</hi> Men
come into a Temper that is wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
to Truth. He that doth Evil,
hates the Light; comes not to it, least his
Deeds be reproved. This is most certain,
universally; <hi>We have our selves, as we use
our selves.</hi> He that doth accustom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Divine Meditation and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
and to Thoughts of God, raises
his Soul, and doth daily more and more
ennoble his Faculties: But he that lives
wickedly; the longer he lives, the more
limited and confined his Soul will be.
Every Man is, for his Intelectuals, and
for his Principles, according as he doth
accustom himself, according as he is in
use. <hi>Sui cuique mores fingunt fortunam.</hi>
This is most true of <hi>internal</hi> Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as well as of other things. No
Man knows what he may be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
by ill Use, Custom and Practice. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
is a Safe-guard, and gives Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
The <hi>first</hi> base Act is <hi>against the
Hair:</hi> And, as <hi>Saul</hi> forced himself to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Sacrifice; so the Sinner, at first, forces
himself; he doth it, at first, with Dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
he apprehends he doth himself
Wrong. A Man that hath been brought
up vertuously, ingenuously, and hath
maintain'd the Tenderness of his Soul,
and his Innocency; he will stick at a
base Proposal, and abhor it. Had many
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56135:82"/>
Men imagined, when they began, how
far they should have gone on, where Sin
would have carried them; they would
have consider'd better of it. But the
breaking in of Sin, is like a Torrent of
Water; which is easily stopt, before the
Way over the Banks be found: But if
once it hath found the Way over, it bears
all before it. There is a Modesty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to our Nature, till a Man hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
it. But when once a Man hath
done a base Act; he hath lost that which
would restrain him. Therefore, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that no Man comes to be outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
bad, all on the suddain: But he
brings himself to it by havocking Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
by confounding his Principles,
and putting away the Ingenuity of his
Nature.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Thus have I shewn you how it comes
to pass, that Men do live so unanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to their Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>* <hi>Now to make some</hi> Observations from
the whole.</p>
                  <p>We <hi>see</hi> the Course of this World;
and, in it, we may <hi>foresee</hi> the State of Men
in the other World.—Can they look
God in the Face <hi>hereafter,</hi> with any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
who <hi>here,</hi> like not to retain God
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56135:82"/>
in their Minds? Will not the Issue of
<hi>holding Truth in Unrighteousness,</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
the Reason of our Minds, of
forcing our own Judgments, of making
Havock of Conscience, be <hi>Confusion</hi> and
<hi>Astonishmont?</hi> What can a Man look for,
when he is not true to himself? when he
hath every thing rising up against him?
his Conscience condemning him? This
cannot but end in Confusion and Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
For things hold a Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one to another: Force in <hi>one</hi> way,
brings on Force in <hi>another.</hi> Consequents
answer foregoing Principles. So that the
Business of the Day of Judgment may
be plainly foreseen. * <hi>It</hi> may be <hi>here</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for, by the Things of this State.
Men will be <hi>fill'd with the Fruit of their
own Ways;</hi> and they cannot think, that
things will <hi>finally</hi> prove otherwise; if
they at any time of their Lives think
with Reason. But if Men presume, and
be regardless, and disorderly, and do not
consider <hi>Consequents</hi> by their <hi>Antecedents;</hi>
they may flatter themselves, and go on
in a State of Stupidity. But if ever a
Man be Rational in his Religion; if he
do use Reason at all worthy his <hi>Make;</hi> he
will foresee future Mischief in a wicked
and naughty Course of Life. In this
Case, every one hath within himself,
what will foretel, and what will fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56135:83"/>
what doth daily reprove, and
condemn him. He carries Arguments in
his Breast, contrary to his Suppositions.
No Husband-man expects a Crop in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
but according as he sows his Seed.
No Man that is in a Spirit opposite to
God, Goodness, Holiness, and Truth;
that lives in a State of Inconsistency to
Religion; can expect to be Happy in any
Enjoyment of God, in a future State;
unless he can believe Impossibilities and
Absurdities.</p>
                  <p>* <hi>And</hi> as <hi>hereby</hi> we may have Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of <hi>the future State</hi> of Men; so,
hence also, is the Account, how it comes
to pass, that some Men are of a most tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
distracted, confounded Condition,
at least, at Times and Seasons, <hi>in this
Life;</hi> having Hell kindled in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;
Hell-fire flashing in their Faces;
Hell <hi>on this side Hell.</hi> So it is with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
They are compounded of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistencies:
They have more <hi>Knowledge</hi> of
God, than <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> for him:
They have more <hi>Light</hi> in their Minds,
than <hi>Goodness</hi> in their Souls. By <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
they are one way; by <hi>Affection</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. And these Men when they
are apart, out of worldly Distraction,
they must be in a tortured, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
Condition.—When they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56135:83"/>
consider; they conceive within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
things that are monstrous, violent,
and unnatural; things which are Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starts,
Traytors to Humane Nature.—
Lust, Humour, Will, Passion, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned
REASON, Man's <hi>Natural Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi>
and have usurped the Government
of Man.—Where <hi>These</hi> are not subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to Reason, and Judgment; where
<hi>These</hi> have dispossest <hi>the natural inbred So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign;</hi>
where <hi>These</hi> have usurp'd the
Government, and dethroned <hi>Reason;</hi>
what a State is it! No Society so distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
and confounded: For none of these
<hi>Four</hi> were made to govern; but they
were to be regulated.—Where Men will
have their Will, and live by their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and in Passion; and Lust hath
Dominion over them; they must needs
be in a State of great Confusion; because
there is so much of Disorder within them.
The <hi>Dictates of Reason</hi> calmly guide us:
But <hi>Will, Humour, Lust,</hi> and Passion, are
Incendiary Principles.—We see the
very best of many Men by what is <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi>
who put a good Face on it, when
they come abroad; but are very ill wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed,
when they come to their <hi>inward
home.</hi> Therefore Persons of bad Lives
and evil Consciences, love not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
They had rather be in any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
than that of Self-reflection, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56135:84"/>
considering themselves. Few Men would
envy these Mens Conditions, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they have some worldly good
Circumstances, notwithstanding they make
a good Show in the World; if they were
acquainted with their <hi>inward Aches, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Wrackings,</hi> and <hi>Vexations.</hi>—
It is observ'd by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> concerning <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>
the Emperor; that being conscious
to himself of horrid Wickednesses, and
unnatural Practices; he could have no
Quiet of Mind, notwithstanding his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements:
And he writes, <hi>That if all
the Deities should conspire to make him mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable;
they could not torment him half so
much as the Torment of his own Mind.</hi>—
Inward Perplexities, Confusion of Mind,
and Thoughts, occasion'd by Guilt of
Conscience, and Naughtiness of Mind;
these transcend all the Tortures of the
Gout, or Stone, of which Men have such
dreadful Apprehensions.<note place="margin">Pro. 18. 14.</note> For <hi>the Spirit
of a Man can bear his Infirmity: But a
wounded Spirit, who can bear?</hi> Who hath
a Man to direct, comfort, or uphold him,
if he hath not <hi>the Reason of his own
Mind?</hi>—Therefore, tho' ignorant
Persons represent the Ways of Religion
and Conscience, as Melancholy, because
Men are kept within the Compass of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Sobriety; it is the greatest Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
in the World: Because, in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56135:84"/>
are <hi>joyful Apprehensions:</hi> Men fear not
God <hi>slavishly:</hi> They do not think he will
do them any harm: But if a Man be in
a malignant Disposition, and have Naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness
of Mind; he is, upon all Self-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
troubled with inward Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Fears.<note place="margin">Isa. 57. 20.</note> The wicked <hi>are like the
troubled Sea.</hi> As Violence in the World
Natural, is attended with Conflagration;
so in the World Moral, it is attended
with Exasperation of Mind, and with
Fury.</p>
                  <p>* <hi>In the next place, then,</hi> observe, That
we are to have God excused, in respect of
the sharpest of all his Judgments.—
There are Sins of Men * <hi>that</hi> are far high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the Rank of Sins, than any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, in this State, are great,
in order of Punishment. For there are
Sins in this World, of which we have
Reason to think, that they must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<hi>go before-hand into Judgment,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 24.</note> upon
account of God's Honour, and the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Righteousness.—Also they who
lie under the greatest Violence in this
World, Men of profligate Lives and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
Spirits, suffer less by <hi>the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God,</hi> than from <hi>within themselves.</hi>
It is intolerable to suffer as a guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Malefactor. It is intolerable for
a Man to suffer the Torments of his own
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56135:85"/>
Breast; because he is guilty of his own
Iniquity. If I suffer under a Power that
cannot be resisted, * <hi>and</hi> for no Fault;
I suffer either as a Martyr for a good
Cause; or under an unavoidable Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
being under no Demerit or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to the Reason of my Mind: And
then I have all the Strength of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
all the Courage that is in my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to support me: But if I suffer as a
guilty Person; I am not then <hi>true to my
self;</hi> I shall have the Reason of my own
Mind against me: For, Guilt is the Sting
of Punishment.—Judgments are to
awaken sleepy Consciences. Those that
are guilty are very shye, apprehensive and
sensible, till by Use, Practice, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
<hi>seardness</hi> be contracted. So that
the Judgments of God are little; if
Men be not guilty. For, <hi>Self-condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is founded in Man's Guiltiness and
Faultiness. So true is it, <hi>thy Destruction
is of thy self;</hi> and, that the Judgments
of God in this World, <hi>in the Order of
Judgments,</hi> are not so great, as some Sins
are, <hi>in the Rank of Sins.</hi>—Wherefore,
O Man! whosoever thou art, that suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
wouldst thou effectually ease thy
Condition? put thy self upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Motion of Repentance:
This will alter the Case: And all the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56135:85"/>
World cannot give thee Heart's-Ease,
save in this way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> This <hi>Text</hi> is to be read in the
Ears of Atheists; <hi>wherein</hi> are <hi>Two</hi> Things
for them to consider. <hi>What</hi> it affirms, as
proved by Effects, <hi>that God made Man
to know that he is,</hi> and <hi>his essential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
(so that his Opinion is against
his very <hi>Make:</hi>) And <hi>how</hi> it describes,
explicates, and declares the Atheist's State
and Temper, <hi>viz. Vain in their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
Nothing is sincere and true that
he thinks: He is a Fool, and hath wrought
himself into Darkness; pretending to
Policy and Wit, to release himself from
all Obligations to Reason and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that he may be loose to the World,
and free to his Lust: A Fetch of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Wit, and no Product of Wisdom;
but <hi>what</hi> in the Issue will prove Madness
and Folly.</p>
                  <p>As there is the fullest Satisfaction in the
World, in the inward Sence and Feeling
of Reconciliation with God, and a frame
of Mind tinctured with Goodness; so there
is the greatest Unquietness of Mind, where
there is an internal Displacency and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at the Being of God, and a Desire
to believe that he <hi>is not;</hi> and to think all
things alike: for, <hi>the former</hi> thinks he hath
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56135:86"/>
all Strength for him; and that he, that is
well able, takes all care of him: <hi>The latter</hi>
doubts, and fears uncertainly, suspects
there is <hi>one</hi> that hath made, and governs
the World; and fears <hi>that Power</hi> to be
engaged against him. And, if all things
be not alike subject to Will and Power;
he knows not what will become of him,
who hath taken upon him to remove
<hi>Landmarks,</hi> to controul the most famous
<hi>Rights</hi> that are fundamental to the Safety
of the Universe.—Irreverence and
Disrespect towards that <hi>Being</hi> on which
we depend for what we are, and have; is
an ununiform, incongruous, unequal, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion'd
Carriage.—Now follow
the dismal and sad Consequents.</p>
                  <p>BUT BECAME VAIN IN THEIR
IMAGINATIONS.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where</hi> there is not honest Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the great Truths of Religion, and
Conscience; hearty Compliance with, and
Obedience to them; but a failure in the
main and principal Points of Life and
Practice; as where Men knowing there is
a God,<note place="margin">V. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>do not glorifie him as God;</hi> do not
<hi>like to retain God in their Knowledge,</hi>
(which is the Atheist's <hi>Temper</hi>) <hi>do things
which are</hi> filthy,<note place="margin">V. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>and take pleasure in them

                  <p>The ingenuous use of Truth is a great
matter: To receive it in the Love of it;
out of Judgment and Satisfaction of its
Conveniency and Fitness to bring Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature to Perfection: to act out of
Love to Righteousness; not as the unjust
Judge; not to lay other Designs: not to
practice upon it,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 2.</note> for other Ends: not to
place it in the place of <hi>a Mean,</hi> but of <hi>an
End:</hi> not to make Godliness a Trade,
Traffick, and Device <hi>for Gain.</hi> Hence so
much, so ridiculous, contemptible, and
unreasonable stuff passes for Religion, in
so many parts of the World: Men look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not after <hi>Rational Satisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is very strange that any thing should
be admitted for <hi>Religion</hi> in the World,
which for its Shallowness, Emptiness, and
Insignificancy, falls under just Reproof
and Conviction of Reason: <hi>Religion</hi>
which makes us less Men: <hi>Religion</hi> unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible;
not able to give Satisfaction to
the noble Principles of God's Creation.

Such have been the cruel and impure
Rites of <hi>Heathenism;</hi> dissatisfactory to
true <hi>Reason; * and</hi> such are the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>additions
of <hi>Popery,</hi> founded neither in
Nature, nor Grace. How hath the World
been scandalized, by things pretended to
be matters of Faith, which are Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
to Reason, if Reason be able to
tell us any thing that is true?—Were
I to take an Estimate of Christianity from
hence; I should be tempted to say, with
<hi>Averroes, Sit anima mea cum Philosophis.</hi>
What rational Man, almost, is not tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to say after him, rather than so to sin
against his Nature, as to admit things of
such Disproportion to all his Faculties?
Can we think we shall prevail with Men
to put out their Eyes, to disbelieve their
Senses, that they may become Christians?
—The Turkish History relates a King
of <hi>Persia</hi>'s Inclination to Christianity,
* <hi>who</hi> was diverted by such like Reasons.
When as, how well are Men satisfied in
the <hi>great Materials</hi> of Religion, which
are entertain'd with Reverence and high
Regard? * <hi>As for instance;</hi> To live so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
righteously, and godly; and
* <hi>where</hi> Men fail, to repent, and ask God
Forgiveness; <hi>in the name of Christ</hi> (* <hi>that
is to say,</hi> for all <hi>those</hi> that have heard of
it.) These * <hi>Matters</hi> have general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but great Neglect. And Mens Zeal
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56135:87"/>
is employ'd in Usages, Modes, and Rites
of Parties: By <hi>these,</hi> Men are constituted
and denominated Christians, and rank'd
in Order and File.—It is recorded that
the Strifes and Contentions, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of Christians, have irritated some
of the so Heathenish Persecutions. The
ill Lives of Christians, and their absurd
Opinions, have kept Nations off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Christian. Whereas in the true
Christian Religion, there is nothing which
may not be represented lovely, in the Eyes
of all who have Principles of Reason for
their Rule.—The State of Religion
speaks the Mind's Freedom from impotent
and unsatiable Desires; from eager, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and impetuous Lusts; from all those
infinite Passions, foul Fiends, unruly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
in Mens Souls, which makes the
Minds of evil Men to <hi>boyle</hi> within them,
as with the Fire, and Pitchy Fumes of
<hi>Hell.</hi>—There is a Harmony between the
Principles of Reason, and Christianity:
the <hi>latter</hi> acknowledges the <hi>former;</hi> rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces
them, advances, and highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
them; secures the common <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts</hi>
of <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Just;</hi> and polishes
Humane Nature. This may be undertaken
and easily perform'd; notwithstanding
the hard Conceits, Men, who are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd,
have of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:56135:88"/>The Knowledge of God, <hi>* which</hi> Man
is <hi>made</hi> to; which fairly lies before him,
and he may easily attain to; is by Men
neglected, unemploy'd, not improved:
whereupon (as in the <hi>Text</hi>) Men run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ways of <hi>fond Imagination, Folly,</hi> and
<hi>Self-conceit:</hi> misrepresenting God to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

                     <hi>Nature</hi> is Sovereign (to them that use

The Words taken in a Conjunction

That it is not the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of Men,

to do in Religion, without Reason, or
otherwise than as they have Direction
from God.—There is no grosser Folly
in the World, no greater Wrong to one's
self, than upon account of Religion, to
come under Obligation to any thing, in
point of Judgment and Conscience, which
is not materially true, as verified in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or Scripture. All <hi>such</hi> is the Persons
<hi>Superstition;</hi> which, tho' it be not imputed
as a Crime to the Person who means well;
yet, is not a Foundation of reward. <hi>Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

—Man enslaves himself; parts with
his Liberty, which is a dear and choice
thing, * <hi>when he</hi> subjects himself to that
which made him not, to that which is not
soveraign to him, as <hi>Reason</hi> is (which is
his natural Perfection, his <hi>Home-informer,</hi>
and <hi>Monitor</hi> within his Breast) neither is
restorative to him in his Lapsed State, as
the Principles of Religion are.—He lays
stress upon that, which will bear no
weight; therefore will deceive him. As
the Superstitious <hi>imagines,</hi> so things <hi>are</hi> to
him: but things attain not Effects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56135:91"/>
to our Fancies, but their own Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stencies,
and what they are in Truth and
Vertue. This other where, is accounted
Weakness, * <hi>and</hi> Shallowness. Nothing
betrays Men more, than lying Refuges,
and false Confidencies.—Religion is that
which attains <hi>real Effects,</hi> worthy what we
mean by Religion: <hi>viz.</hi> it makes Men
<hi>humble,</hi> not conceited; <hi>Mild, gentle,</hi> not

                  <p>Lastly, let us not run on in a Mistake.

* <hi>the</hi> Cause of it; I will shew, that
neither the Evil of <hi>Sin,</hi> nor the Evil of
<hi>Punishment,</hi> can be attributed to God.
For if <hi>God</hi> be the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chiefest Good;</hi>
then, Evil is not from him; it is not
<hi>that</hi> which he hath designed, decreed, or
appointed: But it is <hi>Consequential, Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
Fatal;</hi> and by Consequence, <hi>Insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
from the Miscarriages of Sinners.—
In the Sixth of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> v. 10. it is said,
<hi>Make the Heart of this People fat, and make
their Ears heavy, and shut their Eyes;
least they see with their Eyes, and hear with
their Ears, and understand with their
Heart, and convert, and be healed:</hi> Which
place is referr'd to,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 15.</note> six times in the New
Testament:<note place="margin">Mark 4. 12.</note> And the Scripture never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
the forlorn State of Sinners,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 10.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 12. 40.</note> but
it refers to this place.<note place="margin">Act. 28. 27.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 8.</note> It is not, that God
hath such an Intention; or that God will
have it so: But it is <hi>Consequential;</hi> so, it
comes to pass; so, it falls out: This, is
the natural Issue of not dealing ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with Truth; they are the worse
for their Knowledge, if Practice be not
answerable.—* <hi>Now</hi> to give you an
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56135:93"/>
Account, that Evil is not to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God: Tho' we find Scripture doth
frequently * <hi>seem to</hi> attribute it to him.
You must understand, that the Scripture-Notion
is this: Because God is the first
and general Cause of all things; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Scripture doth attribute all
things to God; but with great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Distinction: Some things as
his Efficience, such as he doth by himself
immediately: Some things which he doth,
by commissioning others, <hi>i. e.</hi> by second
Causes: And some things by his Permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
With this Difference, we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
Scripture attributing things to
God: For, certainly, we must resolve;
<hi>that God is no Cause of Evil.</hi> For, nothing
is more certain than that Holiness, and
Righteousness, are the Divine Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And Holiness, and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
make it altogether repugnant, and
morally impossible for God to have a
Hand in Evil; such Evil, where-to Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and Deformity is annexed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we will conclude, that whatsoever
God doth, by <hi>himself</hi> immediately, or
in Conjunction with any <hi>second Cause;</hi>
it is, in it self, <hi>Good;</hi> and worthy the
<hi>first,</hi> and <hi>chiefest Goodness.</hi> And, if that
be not true; let any one give an Account

                  <p>
                     <hi>Antecedently</hi> to the Being of Evil, God
doth that which infinite Wisdom doth
direct, for the preventing of it; to wit,
he doth warn, he doth admonish, he doth
declare against it; tho' he doth not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hinder, by his Almighty Power.—
<hi>Subsequentially</hi> to the Being of Evil; when
Evil is done by a defective and malicious
Cause; God, if he pleases, turns it into
Good, when he pleases, and as he pleases.
And in this Sense, St. <hi>Austin, It is very happy
that a proud, arrogant, self-conceited Man, fall
into a Sin; that he may see himself:</hi> That
is, if God make such a Sin as shames a
Man, a Means to humble him.<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 6.</note> Else it is
expected, that God should <hi>resist the Proud;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 14.</note>
and that <hi>the Back-slider in Heart, be filled
with his own Ways.</hi> This is the Goodness of
God, when he will bring Good out of
Evil, and turn that which is a Man's Sin,
and great Fault, to tend to his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56135:95"/>
* <hi>But God</hi> is not challengable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any Account for his not <hi>hindring:</hi>
For, he would counter-work the Design
of his Creation: For, Man by his Make
is a free Agent; is both intelligent, and
voluntary; <hi>Positus in aequilibrio;</hi> else
could not sin: Counterpois'd one way by
that which is <hi>Honest;</hi> the other way by
<hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Pleasure:</hi> The Delightfulness
of Sense is <hi>corrival</hi> to that which is in its
Nature just, and holy. God, in his just
Indignation, high Displeasure, at Man's
foolish Affectation, and wilful Choice,
in so unequal a Competition; doth not
hinder, unless he please; but saith, <hi>Then
let it be according to Hearts Lusts;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 31.</note> and <hi>be
filled with thy own ways.</hi> Wherefore let
no Man say when he is tempted,<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>He is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God;</hi> but <hi>drawn aside by his own Lust.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then let us be careful, and cautious,
how we attribute Evil to God, or entail
Sins of Men upon him. We cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
God more than by so doing;
since his moral Endowments of Holiness,
Righteousness, and Goodness, are his
prime Perfections: His Will and Power
are always in Conjunction with them,
and guided by them. Even when he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
Impenitency and Contumacy in
Sin, it is an Act of Goodness. As it is
Goodness <hi>to pardon Penitents;</hi> so it is
Goodness, <hi>by Chastisements, to reduce the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56135:95"/>
Lawless, and Rebellious.</hi> There is a good
Intention in Chastisements: For, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
our great Boasts of our
Free-will; we should be too great Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to Duties of Piety and Vertue, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
God should, now and then, exercise
us with Sicknesses and Afflictions, as a
Counterpoise to our Propensions to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Lusts and Pleasure of Life, and
the ordinary Allurements of the World.</p>
                  <p>Now, since we impute not Murthers
and Robberies committed under a well-established
Government; which rules by
Laws, and punishes such Offences; much
less ought we to impute the Miscarriages
of Men to God: Since Men sin at their
own Peril. God gave no such <hi>Power</hi> to
Men: For, <hi>Power</hi> is concluded within
Bounds of Reason, and Right. Lawless
and exorbitant Acts are Impotencies and
Deformities.</p>
                  <p>If we attribute Evil to God; these
Mischiefs are likely to follow.—We
shall think of God, contrary to what he
<hi>is;</hi> worse than he deserves of us: So,
shall less love him. <hi>The Fountain of Good</hi>
is highly lovely: But not <hi>the Author of
Evil.</hi>—We shall not think aright of
Evil; * <hi>nor hate Evil, as we ought.</hi> For,
what harm is there in that which God
doth?—We shall excuse our selves
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56135:96"/>
more than there is Cause for; and shall
abate, in our selves, Sence of our own
Faultiness: We shall think our selves but
God's Instruments.—We shall take but
little care to repent. Who will trouble
himself about <hi>that</hi> which he thinks is <hi>the
Will of God?</hi> Who can resist his <hi>Will?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why should we expose our selves to
Temptations, by attributing external E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
to God, more than we have Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of?—It is not true, that God
doth whatsoever Evil befals us: * <hi>Or</hi> that
all the Evils which befal us, are the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of some Sins; as was the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,</hi>
the <hi>Destruction of</hi> Sodom, the <hi>Death
of Nadab and Abihu,</hi> of <hi>Ananias and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Evils do fall out from the State
of the World:—Some we bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our selves, by Neglect or Abuse of our
selves (as Diseases which follow upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:56135:96"/>This gives us great Advantage to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
this Truth, <hi>that God is not to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the Creatures Sin:</hi> Or with the
Creatures <hi>Misery.</hi> For whosoever is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
doth but <hi>receive within himself the
Recompence of his Error.</hi> Whoever says
otherwise of God (that he is either the
Cause of his Creatures <hi>Sin,</hi> or of his
Creatures <hi>Misery;</hi>) doth not say so well
of God, as a Man would think it fit to
speak of a Man of common Honesty and
Uprightness.—The greatest Suffering
that <hi>is,</hi> is not by any <hi>positive Infliction</hi> of
God; it is not God's <hi>Creation:</hi> For God
did not <hi>make</hi> Hell; but it is the natural
Issue of Creatures Miscarriage, being want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to themselves, and contradicting the
Principles of God's Creation. And if
this be true; this is a sufficient Defence
for God's Goodness, Righteousness, and
Holiness: And I have said enough to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
all the Principles of Religion.
There is a Foundation laid of <hi>Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi>
to all evil doers.</p>
                  <p>It is a Form of Words, that, when I
well considered them, I could not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
them; <hi>that Sinners do receive in</hi> (or
FROM) <hi>themselves the Recompence of their
Error.</hi> No one that fails, or miscarries,
comes to Misery by any <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> any
<hi>Pleasure,</hi> any thing that is <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> any
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56135:97"/>
thing that is, in it self, <hi>unavoidable:</hi> But
Misery <hi>arises from within:</hi> The Sinner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
<hi>himself.</hi> But I am well aware that
it hath been the Practice of old, to charge
God with the ill fare of Men, * <hi>that they
might</hi> excuse themselves, and lay the Fault
upon God.<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 2.</note>
                  </p>

God with that which is the natural <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent,
the Punishment that follows.</hi> For,
this is most certain; that the greatest
Punishment of Sin, is <hi>inherent in it self:</hi>
For, tho' Almighty Power let the Sinner
alone; he will be his own Destroyer. In
this Case, it may be said, <hi>Let God be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,</hi>
as the Lover of his Creatures,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note> as
the Friend of Souls; and every one that

INORDINATE APPETITE IS A PU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISHMENT

that we lie under.—<hi>Guilt in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                     <item>I<hi>st, Guilt in Conscience:</hi> This hath
driven Men to cruel Practices upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
put them upon Despair, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them, by their own Hands, into <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
Hell, to avoid <hi>internal</hi> Hell. We
are not sure of the <hi>Reason of our own
Minds</hi> for own Preservation: * <hi>Nor can
we depend on this,</hi> which is our greatest
Security under God; * <hi>either</hi> when our
<hi>Reason</hi> is not satisfied in our Religion
(which makes a very uneasie Condition,)
* <hi>or,</hi> when our <hi>Practice</hi> is not justified by
our Reason and Religion.—Now,
Guilt in Conscience, is only consequent
upon knowing, and voluntary Acts,
when they are irregular, unnatural,
monstrous, contrary to the Order of
Reason, contrary to the Nature of Man.
For no Foreign Power whatsoever;
not the Almighty Power of God, nor
the Power of Angels, nor the Power of
all the Men in the World, can make any
Person in the World <hi>Guilty;</hi> unless he
doth consent to an evil Action. No Man
can be guilty, but by his own knowing,
and voluntary Act: For if we consent
not, it is not <hi>our</hi> Act. Guilt befals only
moral Acts. Guilt in a Man's Conscience
is his own Production.</item>
                     <item>2<hi>dly, Malignity and Naughtiness of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
is a second Misery of Man. <hi>This</hi>
                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:56135:98"/>
hath made Mens Conditions very tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and uneasie to themselves, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Power and Government of their
Minds, so having no true Self-enjoyment
which can abide Reflection, and after
Consideration. As also, * <hi>this</hi> hath made
them Pests, and Plagues, to the Places
where they live; as being Disturbers of
the Quiet of Persons with whom they
have their Habitation. For, their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Rancour and Naughtiness of Mind
still puts them upon plotting and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Mischief, and makes them greedy of
Opportunity to practise it.—* <hi>Now,</hi>
This Malignity and Naughtiness of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is moral Pravity, Deformity,
and Privation. And therefore it cannot
be natural; but must be acquired. For
this is a certain Rule, nothing Moral can
be by Generation, but must be by Acts,
Use, Custom and Practice. Nothing but
what is purely natural can be in a Man by
Traduction and Propagation. We are
not born with <hi>Habits;</hi> but born only
with <hi>Faculties.</hi> This is so far true, that
any bodily Disposition, or Inclination,
which is not acquired; tho' it be to
Good, or to Evil; it is neither a <hi>Vice,</hi> if
it be a Tendency to Evil; nor a <hi>Vertue,</hi>
if it be a Tendency to Good. For, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is <hi>Vertue,</hi> but what is <hi>the Product of
a Mind actually considering; and a Man's
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56135:98"/>
Choice, upon Deliberation, and Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
And, so, nothing amounts unto
the Degree of Vice, * <hi>but in the same
manner.</hi> Only, a Man may be wicked
by Failure, and Neglect: Because a Man
is to use the Principles of God's Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he is to consider, and he is to make
use of his Reason; and <hi>that</hi> is first to be
set on work, to discover the Way, and
to discern the Difference of Things. It
is most true in respect of every Man's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
State; <hi>every Man hath himself, for
Temper, for Disposition, for Complexion, and
Constitution of Soul, according as he hath
considered, examined, and used himself.</hi>
Now if a Man <hi>hath himself</hi> as he <hi>uses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi>
then, whosoever is in Perverseness
and Malignity of Mind, he hath brought
himself into it, by abuse of himself. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is in a naughty and malignant Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Mind, there is no Creature
under Heaven, nor nothing that is in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that brought him into that Temper;
but either his gross Self-neglect, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Self-abuse. And if there be gross
Self-neglect; he hath not acted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Principles. That which is not
of a Man's self, it may be his <hi>Burden,</hi> but
never his <hi>Fault;</hi> nor never is charged
upon him on a moral Account.</item>

Matter of Offence, to this * <hi>Temper.</hi>
If a Man will be offended, he shall be
offended every day. The Proud and
Conceited Man never hath Respect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
he is not valued by others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he esteems himself. No Man
thinks so well of him, as he thinks of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56135:99"/>
himself: And therefore he is necessarily
agrieved at every Man, and he lives in
Discontent: He is seldom satisfied; but
apt to interpret every Man's Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him <hi>Neglect</hi> at least, if not <hi>Affront.</hi>
You have all this verified in the Temper
of <hi>Haman</hi> to <hi>Mordecai;</hi> who is dispossest
of all his Enjoyments, because <hi>Mordecai</hi>
offends him; so is in perpetual Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
And if a Man is in Discontent, he
doth not only marr the Temper of his
Mind, but hurts his Body. The Envious

the great Evils. <hi>We,</hi> and <hi>We</hi> alone, cause
Guilt in our Consciences. <hi>We,</hi> and <hi>We</hi>

<hi>We,</hi> and <hi>We</hi> alone are the Causes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
and the marring of our Bodies;
when * <hi>we are</hi> intemperate.</p>
                  <p>Further, to prove, that MISERY IS
OF OUR SELVES; I shall take Two
Grounds from the Apostle.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1<hi>st, Man is a Law to himself.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14.</note> That is;
the Effect and Purport of the Law, is
written in his Heart: So that Man is felf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned,
if he transgress; he himself
being Judge: And <hi>Self-condemnation</hi> is
the Life of <hi>Hell.</hi> What the Apostle saith
of the Word of Faith of <hi>After-Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
We need not ask who shall ascend,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 6.</note>
                        <hi>But the Word of Faith which we preach, is
nigh thee, even in thy Heart;</hi> the same,
also, may we say of <hi>the Principles of God's
Creation in us,</hi> which belongs to our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Make. For Man, by Vertue of his
Nature and Principles, is as sufficient and
proportionable to Acts of Reason and
Understanding, as any inferiour Nature
is, to Acts Homogenial and Con-natural.
And we observe that inferiour Nature
fails not, if it meets not with Foreign
Disturbance and Impediment. Man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56135:101"/>
out of the Way of right Reason,
is a Monster, a Prodigy, in a State of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency,
and Deformity; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
not to himself, but by Revocation
of what is unduly done, and renewal by
Repentance: Otherwise he remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Self-condemnation: So cannot but be
miserable.</item>

Now the Propensions and Inclinations of
the Powers and Faculties of our Natures,
are not controuled, without great Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to our selves, and Affront given to
God. As to instance,—it is horrid,
monstrous, degenerate, and unnatural,
<hi>to live without God in the World;</hi> because
Mind and Understanding are God's pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Reserve in Man, given to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about him: So that it is Alienation,
and Sacriledge, to divert them from
him.—It is unnatural to be <hi>Intemperate.</hi>
The Desires of Nature are Modest, and
within Bounds and Compass: And all
Excess is burthensome.—It is Devilish
to be <hi>Spiteful</hi> and <hi>Revengeful:</hi> For, Man,
by Nature, is <hi>Sociable;</hi> and wishes well
to them in whose Company he takes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
This must be understood of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
before it be abused by unnatural Acts,
ill Use, Custom, and Practice. For, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any thing is in its Constitution and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56135:102"/>

                        <note place="margin">Job 36. 3.</note> and <hi>ascribe Righteousness to him;</hi>
and not entertain such Thoughts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of God, as will not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him to us, nor encourage our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
to him. For it is the leading
Point in Religion, to have in our Minds,
right Suppositions of God.</item>
                     <item>(2.) If this were duly considered;
Men would not allow themselves to be
Lawless, Arbitrary, Licentious, Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant;
tho' they might avoid the Danger

                     <item>(3.) If <hi>this</hi> were duly considered;
Men would not be agrieved at the Shews
and Appearances of this vain World, so
as to envy the Condition of the Fond,
and Foolish, who intoxicate themselves
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56135:102"/>
with Fancies, and are Self-flatterers. The
<hi>seeming</hi> Prosperity of the Wicked, hath
been a Stumbling-block to good Men, in

till they have bethought themselves, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd,
and considered: But <hi>that</hi> is well,
which ends well. The <hi>Tempter</hi> abuses
credulous Persons; suggesting the Day
of Vengeance to be a long time hence:
Whereas, the Sins of Men do not stay
for all their Punishment till the Day of
Judgment. But whether external Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be <hi>sooner</hi> or <hi>later,</hi> Wickedness car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Misery <hi>in its own Bowels.</hi> Were we

that Guiltiness gives occasion to; the

—A discomposed Mind, doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect

                     <item>* <hi>Therefore, to obtain</hi> this Composed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

that we do not attempt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
and make things stand together,
that are of a contrary Nature and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
as <hi>Worldly Policy,</hi> and <hi>Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
These <hi>two</hi> things are as distinct as
any things in the World: the <hi>one</hi> is, for
compassing Ends, by all Ways and Arts:
the <hi>other</hi> is, for all Ways of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Peaceableness, and Universal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.
* <hi>Thus,</hi> for a Man to resolve to
get an Estate, by any Ways or Means, <hi>to
haste to be rich;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pro. 28. 22.</note> and, with this, to retain
Innocency, Uprightness, and Integrity,
(than which, nothing is more impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:)
—For a Man to compound inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Self-love, with the Love of God
and his Neighbour.—For a Man to
make * <hi>it</hi> the Employment of Mind and
Understanding, to gratifie Sense, and
serve Brutish Lusts; and yet think that
he may * <hi>be</hi> acted, and guided by the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56135:103"/>
good Spirit of God:—These * <hi>things</hi>
will not consist together.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly.</hi> I propose, that in all the Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Difficulties, and Uncertainties of this
World, (which is subject to so <hi>many,</hi> and
<hi>various</hi> Changes) a Man resolve <hi>to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi>
as to the great things of Humane
Life.—Let him be <hi>the same</hi> in respect of
his End, both intermediate, and ultimate;
the next, and the last; that is; let his
immediate End be warrantable and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and the ultimate End be <hi>that</hi> which
is universally good: as <hi>the Observance of
God,</hi> and <hi>his own Happiness.</hi> For <hi>these</hi>
are the same, and concur together.—
Let him be <hi>the same,</hi> in respect of his
Aims, Designs, and Intentions. Let
these be always worthy, and let him hold
to them.—Let him be <hi>the same,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of his Rule and Principle of Living
and of Acting. Tho' he fail in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Action; yet let him hold to his Rule;
and, as soon as he can, recover himself to
his Rule, and Law.—Let him be the
same in respect of his Contentment and
Satisfaction. Let not a Man take up, and
applaud himself, in any Attainment, or
Acquisition, that is short of <hi>that</hi> which
will finally accomplish a Man, and make
him happy.—Let a Man always <hi>be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
in respect of his Engagements, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56135:104"/>
Undertakings.—Let a Man conjoin
with his Natural Powers (as doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him,) a due Acknowledgment of
God, in respect of whatsoever Ability or
Sufficiency he hath. Let him duly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
God, and be apprehensive
that he derives from him, and therefore
ought to submit to him, and depend upon
him, and finally refer to him. For, a
Life that is not acted, govern'd, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled
by a <hi>determinate End;</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on, by a certain <hi>Purpose;</hi> it is both
exorbitant, weak, and inconsistent. Such
Men <hi>live by chance,</hi> and do what is next;
and not what they should, and ought:
such Men live as if their Body had swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
up their Soul. These Mens Lives
are very uncertain things. They <hi>live a
kind of Lottery,</hi> the Rules, and Methods
whereof, no Body is acquainted with:
but things are, as they fall out. Such
Men are guided by nothing else, but a
confused multitude of Fancies, jumbled
together, as the things of this World
were, at the first Creation of them. And
this is true of all those, whose Lives and
Conversations are not made steady, and
directed, by a right intended <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>a
true Purpose of Life.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>In the <hi>third</hi> place, I propose, that we
consider this; that we are not to depend
on <hi>Things without us;</hi> as worldly Spirited
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56135:104"/>
Men do. If we have as many of these
things as are for use, and as the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Life require; we have enough. For
what are these things, out of their use?
or, beyond their use? what are they <hi>then,</hi>
but Burthen and Cumber? or, at least,
the Gratification of Fancy and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Now, for a Man to affect a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of things, and all Varieties, it is but
to discompose his own Mind. For as we
multiply Objects, we multiply Thoughts;
and have more things to manage, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
we multiply our Care; which
makes us <hi>less our selves;</hi> and less free to
<hi>Self-enjoyment.</hi>—This is the Temper
of some Men, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6.) <hi>who will shew us
any Good?</hi> it matters not who is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent:
* <hi>they are</hi> wholly undetermin'd as
to Choice, and undirected as to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
This is the Voice of a Man in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion;
a Man without Notion, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
a Man that hath not thought, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
and considered. But the good Man
is determined. Worldly things soon sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
and cloy us: they make a thick, and
gross Apprehension: Their Variety doth
occasion Distraction to the Mind; and
their Emptiness and Penury doth occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Dissatisfaction. In pursuit of worldly
things there is <hi>certain</hi> Care, and very <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi>
Success. No one that is in pursuit
of Earthly things, can assure himself of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56135:105"/>
Success. And if he be in pursuit, and do
not prevail; Disappointments will break
him. Nothing is more grievous than <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I propose, that we awaken in
our selves an intelectual Sence of <hi>Divine</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual Things;</hi> which, as they are
in nearer relation to our Souls, so they
are more fitting and satisfactory. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is so satisfactory to the Mind which
is improved, or any way polished, as the
letting in of Light; and the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Truth. This is more pleasant to
such a Mind, than any Pleasure of Sence
whatsoever. There is great Satisfaction
in the Enjoyment of Mental * <hi>things.</hi> By
this means, our Thoughts will stay at
Home: but if a Man wander from Home,
he shows his own Weakness. Extravagant
Appetites shew inward Poverty. He that
knows <hi>Better,</hi> hath no Greediness after
that which is <hi>Worse.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>These are the things I propose to you,
for the obtaining of this Unity of Mind,
and Composedness of Spirit. * <hi>Without this,</hi>
we shall have very little Enjoyment of
our selves. None think they <hi>are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
when they are in Confusion of
Thought, Perplexity of Mind, doubtful
in Resolution, and under sad Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
* <hi>Without this,</hi> there will be no
Ability for the Discharge of our Duty, in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56135:105"/>
the World. Till a Man hath well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
his own ill-govern'd House; till
he hath cooled and calmed his heated
and disturbed Fancy; till he hath reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
himself from Mind-confounding,
and darkening Thoughts; he will be in
no Capacity or Disposition to act Abroad.
Is <hi>he</hi> fit to act in the World, to direct and
govern others, that hath nothing but
Darkness and Confusion, Disorder and
Distemper in his own Breast? All his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in conspiracy one against another?
Is this Man fit to act <hi>Abroad,</hi> that hath not
done his work <hi>within himself?</hi>—
* <hi>Therefore</hi> let every Body take himself to
task; watch over himself; and think,
that his best Discharge of Government, is,
<hi>of himself,</hi> and that <hi>there</hi> he ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
                  <p>* <hi>And,</hi> that a Man keep himself in
Temper; and the better govern his
Thoughts, and Apprehensions; let him
have a Sence of the Majesty of God. <hi>The
Moralist</hi> gave this, for a Rule; to set some
great and worthy Person before a Man, if
he would do worthily. Think, saith one,
of <hi>Cato,</hi> (a Man that was exact according
to the <hi>Moralist's</hi> Rule.) He thought that
if a Man did but think of such a Person as
<hi>that</hi> was; it would keep him from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to Iniquity. But how much more,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56135:106"/>
then, the thinking of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty?
—We never do any thing so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
but in the presence of two Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
GOD, and OUR OWN CONSCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCE.</p>
                  <p>* <hi>Lastly,</hi> to add more to your Thoughts
concerning the necessity of SELF-GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNMENT.
It is * <hi>but</hi> little to say,
<hi>that I am placed in Authority;</hi> or, that I
can command either Legions, or Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
unless I have <hi>Free dispose</hi> of my
self. Tho' a Man could say of himself,
as the Centurion did,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>I am a Man in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and I have Servants under me;
and to this Man I say go, and he goeth;
and to another, come, and he cometh,</hi> &amp;c.
yet he is not a FREE <hi>Man,</hi> unless he be
<hi>Master of himself.</hi> Unless I can bid my
self <hi>do this; and I do it,</hi> without Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
Interruption, or Disturbance; my
<hi>Command of others</hi> is insignificant; unless
I am intirely <hi>my self,</hi> and can keep out
all foreign Violence and Opposition, from
a hand without. To have Thoughts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
things injected, when they are
wholly inexpedient, and we our selves
otherwise better employ'd; to have Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
thrust upon us, neither to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
nor commanded: to have a Fire
in our Breast, which we cannot put out:
to be at every Beck and Call: to have a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56135:106"/>
Mind disquieted, and discomposed; and
Meditation confounded, or interrupted:
to have Thoughts running madly, or
snatched away from us: If <hi>this</hi> be our
case; then, I add, * <hi>that</hi> for any seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Glory from without, or any vain Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
to compensate this home-bred Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
a Man may as well be eased of the
Pain of the Gout or Stone, by being laid
in a Bed of Down; or of the Fit of a
Burning-Feaver, by the cool Air fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him, as he may be relieved, in this
internal Discomposure of Mind, by world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Application. The true Remedy ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<hi>from within.</hi> Admit Principles of

be not, through thine own Indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<hi>Tinder</hi> to every Temptation; as
he that is not settled in the habit of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
For, Happiness is not, from <hi>without.</hi>
To the chearful Spirit, must be a richer
Contribution, than a Joint Concurrence
of worldly things; <hi>internal Peace, Ease,</hi>
and <hi>Satisfaction of Mind; Rational Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions;
calm</hi> and <hi>quiet Thoughts; a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
Heaven within:</hi> which are the true
Ingredients of <hi>Self-Enjoyment.</hi> There is no
Man <hi>Free,</hi> unless he be <hi>Wise:</hi> and there is
no Man <hi>Wise,</hi> who hath not <hi>the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of himself.</hi> For this Man is <hi>a Slave.
Solomon</hi> hath told us, that <hi>he who ruleth
his Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>is greater than he that taketh a

City.</hi> And he that doth not this, doth
not enjoy himself. Wherefore let us
have <hi>clear Perceptions</hi> of the Reason of
Things; and <hi>Power,</hi> within our selves,
without Distraction, to do, and resolve
accordingly: And <hi>then</hi> I account a Man
<hi>a good Man, a wise Man,</hi> and <hi>well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd.</hi>
And he that arrives not to this,
lives <hi>at Peradventure,</hi> and acts like a Fool:
He doth nothing worthy his own Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
or the Rank, and Order, of a
rational, and intelligent Being. For we
are bound, by Vertue of our Creation,
to act out of a Fore-sight of the Reason
of Things; as inferior Beings act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Con-natural Qualities:
And it is monstrous and horrid if they
do not. In like manner, it is ugly, and
degenerate, for <hi>Man,</hi> that is indued with
Reason, to act <hi>at Hap-hazard,</hi> and not
out of Fore-sight of the Reason of
Things. This is as monstrous, as it is,
for the Sun not to shine, and to fill the
Air with Stench and Putrifaction.</p>
                  <p>The Irreligious * <hi>therefore</hi> leave <hi>natural
Use;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 27.</note> which, till Nature be put out of
Course; and, by Custom, habituated to
the contrary; cannot but be grievous.
Things easily go on, in Nature's way;
but being interrupted for a while, at least
<hi>strive</hi> to return to their natural Course.
Nothing doth well under Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>

The World hath an ill Opinion of

                  <p>IN these words, you have the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Issue of the horrid, monstrous,
degenerate State of Mortals. This
Catalogue of Vice is enough to star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and awaken any one; make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate,
and apprehensive of his Danger;
* <hi>so as</hi> to betake himself to Religion;
and to come within the Confines of it:
that he may be delivered from such Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.
—One would wonder that
Humane Nature should so degenerate,
that these Villanies should ever be report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of any, who <hi>by their Institution,</hi> are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Agents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:56135:109"/>
Of this Catalogue I have singled out
<hi>one</hi> (and that is COVETOUSNESS,)
which, because it is a subtle Evil, and
very mischievous, I shall endeavour to
discover it.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing in all the Scripture
that is put in worse Company than this:
for it is reckon'd with all the horrid Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Degeneracy and Apostacy. Yet,
<hi>Covetousness</hi> shelters it self under honest
Names. It is sometimes thought to be
<hi>Diligence, Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Forecast; Good-Husbandry,
Cautiousness, Weariness.</hi> So
often do Men ruine themselves by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
this Viper under gilded Names.—Tho'
I cannot discover it in <hi>all</hi> its
Practices and Degrees; yet I shall do you
some Service in discovering that which is
in any degree <hi>gross,</hi> destructive to <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
and against <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Conscience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Covetousness</hi> is much branded, and
spoken very ill of, in Scripture. It is put
in adequate opposition to all Religion. It
is a Principle of the basest Practice: for it
hardens it self to any purpose. Through
Covetousness <hi>Men make Merchandize of
the Word of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 3.</note> and * <hi>it</hi> is amongst the
things <hi>that defile a Man.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 7. 22.</note> The Covetous
<hi>God abhors.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 10. 3.</note> The Apostle saith it is <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 51. 13.</note>
Nothing is more threatned in the
Bible.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 9, 10.</note> We are specially warned against it,
and told, <hi>it is the root of all Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:56135:109"/>
But it is a cunning subtle Sin. No Man
doth so justifie himself, or is so hardly
brought to repent, as he that hath a touch
of <hi>Covetousness.</hi>—I am of opinion,
that our Saviour hath in his <hi>Beatitudes,</hi>
ONE, that he doth direct expresly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Sin of Covetousness, (tho' <hi>it</hi>
hath been alienated from the Sence, by
the generality of Interpreters) viz.<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are the poor in Spirit:</hi> for, that which
the Interpreters do fasten upon this, hath
place otherwhere, (and, * <hi>therefore,</hi> if it
be here; it is supernumerary:) They un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by it, <hi>Dejection, Humility of
Mind,</hi> and <hi>Contempt of our selves:</hi> so,
they make it to comply with these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
<hi>the Lord is nigh to the broken Heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ps. 34. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>and contrite Spirit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 57. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>To him will I look
who is of a poor, and contrite Spirit.</hi> I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
close with <hi>their Sence:</hi> but find <hi>it</hi> in
another place; for, <hi>that</hi> which they call
<hi>Poverty of Spirit,</hi> viz. <hi>Humility;</hi> may be
referred to another Beatitude; <hi>Blessed are
the Meek,</hi> which doth not only import
Gentleness, Affability, and Sweetness of
Behaviour towards Men; but also, every
degree of Humility, and Subjection to
God. And, for <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> thus I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it. He may be poor <hi>in Spirit,</hi> tho'
he hath an abundance of Wealth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
who is a Man of moderate Desires,
and is satisfied with those things which
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56135:110"/>
God hath given him; and may be poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
in this respect, than the lowest Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
* <hi>who</hi> hath unsatiable Desires of
Riches, and an Affectation of <hi>Power, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>
and <hi>Wealth:</hi> for he is <hi>poor in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
tho' he hath an Affluent Estate, and
can command the <hi>World;</hi> if his Mind
stand right, and he be loose to <hi>it,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<hi>it,</hi> as to any Trust and Confidence
in <hi>it.</hi> And <hi>he</hi> that hath but from Hand to
Mouth, yet if he hath inordinate Desires;
tho' he be a Beggar, he is covetous.—By
<hi>Poverty of Spirit,</hi> I do understand, a kind
of want of Affection to the World: A
Disposition of Mind spiritually steered, so
as not to decline to the Wealth and Pomp
of the World: looking upon them, as
<hi>Means;</hi> and not giving them the Honour,
nor at all placing them in the room of
<hi>Ends.</hi> So that if a Man hath the World's
Goods, and yet in his Heart, he doth not
lean to them; and, if having them not,
he doth not thirst after them, nor hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Desires to them; he is <hi>poor in
Spirit.</hi> He may be rich <hi>in outward Wealth,</hi>
and poor <hi>in Spirit,</hi> if he love them not:
and he may be poor <hi>in outward Estate,</hi>
and yet <hi>covetous,</hi> if he desire them. <hi>Poor</hi>
he may be, and have but little in the
World, and yet not <hi>poor, in Spirit:</hi> not
poor, with <hi>a holy Will.</hi>—Those that are
<hi>poor in Spirit</hi> are so, upon Consideration;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56135:110"/>
having considered that few of these
things are necessary in Life; that the
Happiness of Man consists not in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of these things; and that <hi>these</hi>
have but the place of <hi>Means,</hi> not of <hi>Ends:</hi>
and therefore, will not be under the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to them. For, no good or wise Man
will be subject to any thing but what hath
the rank and order of <hi>an End.—* I say
it again:</hi> He that hath the World's Goods
in his hand, (and doth abound in Wealth,
Honour, Power, and Authority,) as a
<hi>Mean</hi> in order to <hi>an End;</hi> this Man, tho'
he be rich, may be poor <hi>in Spirit.</hi> And
another, tho' poor, is covetous; if he
maintain greedy Appetites, and do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in the Providence of God. For,
it is not a Man's external Condition that
makes him righteous, or wicked: but the
Temper of his Mind, and the Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Soul. He that hath inwardly,
in his Soul, and Will, concluded <hi>that
Riches and Honours are but superfluous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments,</hi>
(so far as they are beyond
Accommodations, or the Notion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments;)
* <hi>He</hi> who hath, in his Soul,
the Sence our Saviour expresses, that <hi>the
Life of Man consists not in the abundance
of things to be enjoy'd;</hi> this is the Man
that is <hi>poor in Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that, whereas <hi>Covetousness</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
cast upon Men of Estates; yet we
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56135:111"/>
find, upon Examination, that the lowest
sort of Men are as apt to fail and miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as Men of Estates. For it lies in the
Temper of a Man's Mind, and in the
Frame and Disposition of his Spirit. He
that hath in his Soul a Sence <hi>that the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of Man consists not in what he posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi>
and considers that <hi>Nature is content
with moderate things;</hi> and that these
things are but Means and Instruments to
an End; and that the Virtue of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
lies in the Use and Exercise of
it; therefore Desires to have neither Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
nor Riches; this Man is not Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.</p>
                  <p>But this we may observe, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
upon Discontent, Men that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Power of <hi>Covetousness,</hi> will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to high Nobleness and Generosity,
when the World offends them; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
in haste, bid defiance to the World.
So <hi>Charles</hi> the Vth. Emperor of <hi>Germany;</hi>
who had done mighty things, and won
many famous Battels. But, when by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
many things, he had plunged
himself into Multitudes of Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and brought himself into a Maze
which he knew not how to get out * <hi>of;</hi>
then he resolves to resign up all: which
he doth: The <hi>Empire,</hi> to his Brother;
and the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> with the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
to his Son: and, to a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56135:111"/>
he goes. In such case, <hi>We</hi> forsake
not the World; but the World, rather,
forsakes <hi>us.</hi>—The great Power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the World, being loose to the
World, being above the World; is shewn,
when Men do it <hi>voluntarily,</hi> upon <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi>
not <hi>in Anger,</hi> not in the <hi>Spirit
of Revenge.</hi> If we would approve our
selves to be <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> and <hi>out of Love
with the World;</hi> let us do it while the
World follows us, and as it were, <hi>courts</hi>
us; not when it's grown froward, and
turns its Back upon us.—The Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> perswade Men, that they enter
into a State of Perfection, <hi>who</hi> enter into
Religious Orders, by making a triple
Vow; one, is, <hi>of Poverty;</hi> but how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of choice is it? One of their Authors
calls it, <hi>the terrible Vow of Poverty. * Now
he</hi> who dedicates himself to God; must,
in Heart, leave the World; and pass
through Combates, and Temptations; and
must not cast a languishing, favourable
Eye, upon Wealth, Honour, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>External</hi> things do very differently,
and uncertainly affect the Minds of Men.
No Man knows what may be the Effect
of worldly <hi>Prosperity</hi> or <hi>Adversity.</hi> No
Man knows whether if he should be rich,
he should be merciful: or, if he should
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56135:112"/>
be afflicted, whether he should be patient.
Worldly Prosperity, or Adversity, each
of them, will comply with the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>Happiness</hi> and <hi>Misery.</hi> As they are
us'd, they either tend to <hi>one,</hi> or the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
but the Operation of them is very
uncertain. Therefore, let us value things
equally, according to their degrees of
Goodness. It is true indeed, Worldly
Prosperity hath an Advantage; because
he that is rich hath great Opportunities
of glorifying God, and doing Good;
having Tools to work with, if God give
him a Heart. But if he hath not a Heart
to improve this Advantage; he is not
regenerated and sanctified; he is not led
into a Divine Spirit by it. And he that
is in a State of Adversity, and expos'd to
Necessity, is subject to be envious, base,
and sordid. But if Adversity, and a
streight Condition in the World, make a
Man <hi>patient, humble,</hi> and <hi>modest;</hi> it's
well: His Poverty will end much to his
<hi>advantage.</hi> So that you see, both of the
one, and the other, the Operation is very
uncertain. Therefore let no Man make
himself <hi>a Slave</hi> to that which is <hi>no part of
his Happiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Men are thought to talk of strange
<hi>Riddles,</hi> that tell Men they must not have
inordinate Desires to <hi>Wealth,</hi> they must
not estimate and value themselves by <hi>it,</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:56135:112"/>
nor by <hi>State, Dignity, Place,</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi>
He that talks thus, will be in danger to be
looked upon as <hi>Lot</hi> by his Sons in Law,
to speak <hi>as one that mocked.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>* <hi>He</hi> who finds in himself <hi>Inclinations</hi>
towards the World, <hi>Desires</hi> to grow
rich, to raise himself in <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment;</hi>
let him suspect himself. It is
great Wisdom, in matters of Danger, to
fear even things that are safe. For it is a
good Rule <hi>Casuists</hi> go upon, in the Court
of Conscience, that <hi>it is safer for Men to
suppose a Fault, than no Fault.</hi> In the
Court of Conscience, censure and search
the <hi>Passages</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi> of the
Heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riches</hi> are often mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but seldom spoke well of. Nor
ever * <hi>do we find</hi> that the Rich are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be <hi>Blessed;</hi> but, that they <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enter into the Kingdom:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 23.</note> which if we
did consider, would make us suspect, and
look about us. Scripture warns us, <hi>not
to trust to uncertain Riches;</hi> not to heap
up superfluous parts of them: but to lay
a good Foundation; that our Hearts be
not over-charged with the Cares of this
Life. St. <hi>Austin</hi> says, <q>That if it had
been Happiness to have loved the
the World, and the things of it; <hi>That
Man</hi> would have loved them, who
was the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                     </q> But, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56135:113"/>
worldly Circumstances may make
us * <hi>think</hi> the worse of secular Pomp and
Bravery: * <hi>For, that he was in such Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
was</hi> not by Chance but Choice.
We find that the Apostles writ after his
Copy. For, what one Act of theirs did
discover looking towards the World, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
only * <hi>as to</hi> Provision for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Maintenance?—The Heathen
Philosophers profess'd, and greatly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
Contempt of the World. * <hi>Now</hi>
it is a horrible Reproach, and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to us, if the <hi>Faith of the Gospel</hi>
should not attain such Effects as the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Nature,</hi> through Reason, have
attain'd.</p>
                  <p>If, through the Help of Divine Grace,
we do not alienate our selves from the
Love of the Things of the World; the
Love of them will certainly alienate us
from God. What is * <hi>it,</hi> that is the
Height, Excellency, and utmost Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that which we call <hi>the Worship of
God?</hi> Is it not <hi>to take him for our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and utmost End? To make him the
Center of our Souls? To have all Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from him, and Dependance upon him?</hi>
And can we do <hi>this,</hi> and impatiently
thirst after <hi>Riches?</hi> Confidence, and trust
in God, is the worthiest part of Divine
Worship: For none acknowledges God
more than he that relies upon him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56135:113"/>
on him, commits himself unto
him, trusts in him, and is not anxious
what the next Day may produce. Now
if we give any of <hi>these * Affections</hi> to our
<hi>Estate,</hi> to <hi>Riches, Honour,</hi> or the like;
we put <hi>them</hi> in the place of <hi>God.</hi> And
upon this account, <hi>Covetousness</hi> is called
IDOLATRY. This may well be called
<hi>an Indignity</hi> to God; if we think to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon our Estate, Power, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
Whereas we are to rest in him,
as the Center of immortal Souls. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that <hi>Desire of Riches,</hi> and that <hi>Care</hi>
which is laid out about them, which doth
debase our Dependance upon God, and
takes us off from our Affiance and Trust
in him (wherein we do truly worship
and acknowledge him) may well be called
<hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing is more base in the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> than the subordinating the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion to the Gain of the World.
For Superstition (if it be by mistake)
there may be an Apology: But when Men
name <hi>God,</hi> speak <hi>Religion and Conscience,</hi>
and mean <hi>the World;</hi> this is so far from
being Religion, that it is abominable.
What * <hi>are</hi> their Principles, but <hi>the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Revenue?</hi> What vast Sums do
they acquire by their Doctrines of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
of Indulgence, and Absolution?
This is to prostitute Religion: And, <hi>that</hi>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:56135:114"/>
wherein the Honour of God, and the
Salvation of Mens Souls is concerned, is
subordinated to the things of <hi>this World.</hi>
Whereas there is no <hi>Philosophy</hi> or <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
doth more strongly cry <hi>It</hi> down,
and endeavour to plant in Men <hi>Contempt
of It,</hi> than Christianity hath done? But,
by this <hi>Sect</hi> of Christians, <hi>Christianity</hi> is
constrained to Lackey to the World, and
to become Means of the greatest secular
Pomp and Bravery, that ever the Sun
hath seen.</p>
                  <p>Where we see Religion made a <hi>Mean</hi>
to draw on the World; out of doubt, it
is not <hi>Religion,</hi> but <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> For the
Distribution of the Things of the World,
who shall have more, who less, belongs
not to the Kingdom of Christ. We are
directed by our Saviour's Form of Prayer,
to pray for <hi>daily Bread,</hi> in contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to praying for <hi>Riches, Honours,
Pleasures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have seen in general, by way of
Explication, what this <hi>Temper of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness</hi>
is; and that a rich Man may be
freed from it, and a poor Man may be
deeply in this Vice; and that it lies in a
Man's Judgment, and the Temper of his
Mind, and his Inclinations. He that is
<hi>of ungovern'd Appetites;</hi> he that hath <hi>a
high Opinion of these Things,</hi> (viz:
RICHES, HONOURS, PLEASURES,)
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56135:114"/>
and thinks them <hi>to be other than they are;</hi>
or places them <hi>in the Room of ENDS;</hi>
this is the Man that is <hi>guilty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I consider, <hi>Generals</hi> do not affect:
And, this being a Business <hi>of Practice,</hi> and
every Man's Concern, as he would secure
the State of his Soul to Eternity, to quit
and discharge himself of this covetous
Temper and Disposition, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
represents as <hi>the Enemy</hi> of Religion;
I will instance in <hi>Five Particulars,</hi> by
which every Man may know <hi>whether he

himself, for whose sake he deprives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
This Man is wanting to himself,
pinches himself, and is wanting to <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Occasions. For <hi>the Publick</hi> is every
Man's Particular: For, if it be not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bodies Charge; it is no Bodies. * <hi>There
are,</hi> partly a Man's Friends, partly his
Relations, his Neighbours, and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
A Man must not be wanting to
all these: For they have a Share in him.
He, therefore, that allows not himself
the free and generous Use of what he
hath, this Man <hi>is a Slave to his Money:</hi>
He <hi>hath,</hi> but he hath not the <hi>Power of

his Sleep, through inordinate Care; * <hi>is</hi> so
extreamly busie, so over imploy'd, as not
to be at leisure, duly to attend upon God
in the World, to make Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56135:115"/>
to him, or to discharge himself in
Duty to him. Man's Principles teach
him, that it is <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Principal</hi> in the
Life of Man, that Intelectual Nature do
perform special Duty and Service to God.
Nothing is more horrid, than for Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Nature, degenerating into Matters
of Sense, not to take Notice or Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of God: Nor to perform Duty to
him. This Man is, therefore, <hi>sordidly
Covetous,</hi> who makes himself a Drudge
in the World, disquiets himself, is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext
in Business, that God is not in all
his Thoughts, is very little to him, in
the World. We are * <hi>indeed</hi> to use Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and moderate Care: For, <hi>He that
doth not provide for his Family,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 8.</note> is worse
than an Insidel:</hi> So that I take not any
Man off from being diligent in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
way. But we are not to make our
rational Faculties <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> nor deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them to <hi>hew Wood</hi> and <hi>draw Water.</hi>
To drudge in the World, is not the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Employment of an Intelectual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
This is not that which doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the highest and noblest Part of Man.
It is indispensably necessary, that <hi>Mind,</hi>
and <hi>Understanding,</hi> which is a peculiar
reserved Faculty <hi>for,</hi> and appropriated <hi>to</hi>
God, be employ'd about Things immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial;
making enquiry of God; tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Duty toward him; expressing it self
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56135:116"/>
in all Devotion, and Affection toward
him. There is no <hi>Happiness</hi> to Man,
but in this Relation, and in Converse
with Things immaterial, and intelectual:
Because, <hi>else,</hi> there is no rational Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
And there is no <hi>Happiness</hi> where
there is not <hi>rational Satisfaction:</hi> For,
otherwise, there is Tediousness, Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and (in over-long Use) Nauseous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
There is no such Reproach, as to
say, that a Man is wise, witty, sagacious,
for worldly Things; and yet ignorant
in Matters of Religion, Reason, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</item>

for the <hi>unexpected Contingencies</hi>
which befal Men, in the several Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Life. For, notwithstanding any

and Contingencies, which rationally
were not imaginable, or thought of; he
that hath another under Obligation, if
he make not Allowance, he is an Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor.
For, since the Government of the
World is not in our Hands; since we

are not Masters of all Affairs; since there
are Contingencies beyond Reason, or the
Power or Wisdom of any finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
it becomes every Man that hath
Advantage, fairly to consider, and to
make equal Allowance for unavoidable
Casualities, and Contingencies. For, I
am sure, this Man that doth otherwise,
doth not at all partake of God, nor write
after his Copy, who hath magnified his

fails not to commiserate, in every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionable

But falls into many Snares and hurtful

                  </list>
                  <p>By these <hi>Five,</hi> may every Man judge
of himself. I began with the least De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and still rose every Step higher.
He is not covetous, that can acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of not being guilty in these. And,
this, every Man is highly concern'd to
do.</p>
                  <p>Hence I exhort, that we endeavour to
refine, ennoble, and spiritualize our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
Let every particular Person employ
himself, as he hath Time and Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
in Things that tend to God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Glory in the World, and to
the <hi>Publick Good.</hi> Let not Men satisfie
themselves to do as Snails, that live and
confine themselves in their Shells, and
carry their House up and down on their
Backs, wherever they go. It doth not
become any Man that is indued with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telectual
Nature, to be so particular and
selfish. Every Man is to think, that the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56135:117"/>
Honour of God, the Publick Good, and
the Advance of Humane Nature, ought
to be predominant, ought to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance,
and over-rule his particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.
Let us keep from all Sordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mind, by coming under the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the World. No worldly Thing is
to exercise any Sovereignty over us:
Neither should a Man center himself in
himself.</p>
                  <p>It is greatly to the Shame of Human
Nature, that we seem rather to love God,
for <hi>what he is to us,</hi> than for what he is
<hi>in himself.</hi> We love him, because he
may be good to us; rather than because
he is the most lovely Object in himself,
<hi>the first and chiefest Goodness:</hi> Rather as
he is necessary to our Happiness; than
because of his own Loveliness, Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Beauty. Therefore we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our selves, even there, where we
mind God. Now till our Love of God
be most simple and refined, we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
in it an Allay and Mixture of
Earthliness and Disingenuity; we must
acknowledge it an Affection short and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of God, who is the first Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
the proper Object, and attractive
of Admiration, and Veneration. We
should be wholly taken with God, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
and transported with him: The
Contemplation and Thought of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56135:118"/>
Goodness, and Perfection, should
so fill our Souls, that Foreign Things
should be driven away, and be as it were
<hi>nothing,</hi> in this Order and Competition.
Our Souls should go out, in secret En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after God; should ingulph and
bottom themselves in him, by Love and
by Delight. We should dwell with him;
never fall from him; or sink below him;
or take ought else for him; or return from
him, to any Embraces. It should be the
Language of our Souls in the Ears of our
God,<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 25</note> 
                     <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee,
or what is there in Earth that I desire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Thee?</hi> Tho' a Man should <hi>love God</hi>
with an equal Degree of Affection to the
Things of this World; yet, because the
Objects are so infinitely disproportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
(and 'tis the Nature of <hi>Moral Duties</hi>
to be measured from those Motives by
which we are to be induc'd to them;)
therefore, of such a one it may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
that he doth not love God. He
that makes him but equal to any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Thing, may be said infinitely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
and undervalue him.</p>
                  <p>For the further Explication of this, I
shall suggest to you a Distinction, not
commouly (if at all) taken notice of, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
betwixt <hi>Natural Principles,</hi> and <hi>Moral
Duties:</hi> The mis-understanding of which,
is the Occasion of many Difficulties and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56135:118"/>
Confusions about this, and some other
Points.—By <hi>Natural Principles,</hi> I
mean such kind of Impressions as are
originally stamp'd upon the Nature of
Things, whereby they are fitted for those
Services to which they are designed in
their Creation; the Acts of which, are
<hi>necessary,</hi> and under no kind of Liberty
of being suspended. All things must
work according to their <hi>natural Principles</hi>
(nor <hi>can</hi> they do otherwise,) as heavy
Bodies must tend down-wards. The
Beauty of the World, and the Wisdom
of the Creation, is generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to consist in <hi>this,</hi> that God was
pleased to endue the Kinds of Things
with such Natures, and Principles, as
might accommodate them for those Works
to which they were appointed. And he
governs all things by such Laws, as are
suited to those several Natures, which he,
at first, implanted in them. The most
universal Principle belonging to all kind
of Things, is <hi>Self-preservation:</hi> Which,
in <hi>Man,</hi> being a rational Agent, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
farther advanc'd, to strong Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Desires of the Soul after a State
of Happiness; which hath the Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
over all other Inclinations; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Supream and ultimate End to
which all his Designs and Actions must
be subservient, by a natural <hi>Necessity.</hi>—
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56135:119"/>
Whereas, on the other hand, those Rules,
or Means, which are most proper for
the attaining of this End, about which
we have a Liberty of Acting; to which,
Men are to be induc'd in <hi>a Moral Way,</hi> by
such kind of Motives or Arguments as
are in themselves sufficient to convince
the Reason; <hi>these</hi> I call <hi>Moral Duties:</hi>
DUTIES, as deriving their Obligation
from their Conducibility to their promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of our chief End; and, MORAL
as depending upon Moral Motives. So
that <hi>Self-love,</hi> and <hi>the proposing of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as our chief End;</hi> tho' it be the
Foundation of Duty, that <hi>Basis,</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratum,</hi>
upon which the Law is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
yet it is not properly <hi>a Moral Duty,</hi>
about which Men have a Liberty of Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
They <hi>must</hi> do so: Nor <hi>can</hi> they
do otherwise. The most vile and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
Wretches that are, who are most
opposite to that which is their true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
they are not against <hi>Happiness it
self;</hi> but they mistake about it, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneously
substitute something else in the
Room of it. So that if Men were upon
all Accounts firmly convinced, that God
was their chief Happiness; they would
almost as necessarily love him, as hungry
Men do eat, or thirsty Men do drink.—I
have enlarg'd the more on this
Particular, the better to manifest the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56135:119"/>
true Cause, or Ground, of this <hi>Love * to
God.</hi>

                     <bibl>PHILIPPIANS IV. 8.</bibl>
                     <q>Finally, Brethren, Whatsoever things
are true, whatsoever things are
honest, whatsoever things are just,
whatsoever things are pure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
things are lovely, whatsoever
things are of good report, If there
be any Vertue, if there be any
Praise, think on these things.</q>

                  <p>A Weightier Scripture, more sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
and comprehensive of all
Perfection, I do not find any
where. It shews how compleat,
and well furnish'd, the Man of God
shou'd be; one who professeth himself <hi>a
Christian,</hi> names <hi>Christ,</hi> and pretends to
the Faith of the Gospel. Whatsoever is
Good in its Nature and Quality, shou'd
be well known to him, shou'd be his
Ornament and Accomplishment, endow
his Mind, and qualifie his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:56135:124"/>Whatsoever Things are TRUE.</p>
                  <p>And, here, we must take up <hi>Pilate</hi>'s
Question: <hi>What is Truth?</hi>—Truth is
first <hi>in Things;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 81. 38.</note> then, <hi>in our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the First; the <hi>Truth of Things</hi> lies
in this, that Things do exist, of their
own Principles. Now this <hi>Truth of
Things</hi> is no Charge of <hi>ours,</hi> it is God's
Charge; it is the Effect of God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For he hath made all Things <hi>True;</hi>
and, therefore Things must be True:
For, God cannot fail, either through Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency,
or want of Power, or through
Error of Judgment. This is Truth <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then, <hi>that</hi> that we are concern'd in,
is the <hi>Truth of our Apprehensions:</hi> And our
Apprehensions are <hi>then</hi> True, <hi>when</hi> they
agree with the Truth and Existence of
Things; when we conceive of Things,
<hi>as they are:</hi> And if we think otherwise;
then, there is a Lye in our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And here is the Occasion of all the
Evil that breaks in upon Mortals, that we
do not conceive of Things as they are;
but that all Men (except some few) either
worship the Idol of <hi>particular Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:56135:124"/>
or the Idol of <hi>Popular Superstition:</hi>
They either follow private Imagination
of their own, or general Mistakes: And
he is a Man of a thousand, that can rise
up, and quit himself of these <hi>two</hi> Idols.
<hi>Solomon</hi> observes, that the Simple (or <hi>the
Fool</hi>) believes every thing that is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.
But the State of Things is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
fixed by God, in the Moment of
Creation: And our Judgments and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
are to be conformable to the
Reality and Existence of Things: And
when our Affections and Actions, are
suitable to such a Judgment and Sense of
our Minds; we are <hi>then</hi> in the Truth,
and never else. <hi>The first</hi> belongs to a
Man's Understanding; and, that, speaks
him an able Man, a Man of Judgment, a
Man of Sense and Experience: <hi>The latter</hi>
speaks him a good Man. And, indeed,
if Mens Actions comply not with the
Sense of their Judgments, there will be
Self-condemnation, and no Peace <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Distinction is, the Truth of
Things, either upon <hi>a natural Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
to know Things in their Natures and
Qualities (and this is * <hi>Natural</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and is of great Use in the Life of
Man, and tends to the enlarging Man's
Understanding: But, this is not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
of Religion and Conscience:)
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56135:125"/>
Or else, it is Truth upon <hi>a Moral Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
And this only, is the Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Conscience. And here we do
enquire, whether Things be right or
wrong, good or evil; and accordingly
charge our selves. We are to be in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with Things that are good;
and to have a Displacency against Things
that are impure, unholy, and contrary to
the Mind and Will of God. And this
is the Concernment of Conscience, and
the Business of Religion; and is every
Body's Charge. For, both a good State
here, and a future good State hereafter,
depends upon it.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Man's Obligation to Truth (viz.</hi>
That Truth should be in all his Actions
and Apprehensions,) it is grounded upon
the State and Principles of his Creation;
Man's Capacity; Man's proper Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Man's true End; Man's Relation:
<note n="*" place="margin">See the first Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Part 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Of which there has been mention else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will * <hi>now</hi> give you certain Instances,
by which I will first show you, when
there is Truth, on our part, <hi>respectively
to God.</hi> And if I discover, <hi>when</hi> we are
said <hi>to Lye to God,</hi> I shall by the same shew
you when there is <hi>Truth towards God.</hi>
Now we put a Lye upon him, in these
* <hi>several</hi> ways.—To profess, and not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56135:125"/>
to believe (this is high Dissimulation, and
a horrible Indignity put upon God. This
represents God, as if he might be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
or imposed upon:)—To believe,
and not to do (and this is <hi>to hold the
Truth in Unrighteousness:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> Which, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is look'd upon to be an Act of the
greatest Violence, Deformity, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity:)
—To begin, and not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe.—To
pretend God, and mean a
Man's self, or the World. To make God <hi>a
Mean,</hi> and the World <hi>an End.</hi> I dread to have
to do with any Man that will make Use of
his Religion, to gain him Credit, and to
make a Bargain. Of such a Man, one had
need take double Security.—* <hi>Lastly,</hi>
to name the Name of God, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from Evil.—In <hi>these Cases,</hi> we do
not abide in the Truth: But we <hi>put a Lye
upon God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the second place: As there is <hi>a Lye
to God;</hi> so a Man may <hi>put a Lye upon
himself. * viz. Either</hi> to gratifie his Lust;
(for, <hi>Lust</hi> is a false Principle: Lusts are
Exorbitances and Irregularities: They are
false Births: They have not <hi>true</hi> Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence:)
<hi>Or</hi> to give way to found Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
It is, also, to put a Lye upon
a Man's self, <hi>to live after Temper.</hi> For, <hi>this</hi>
is below Reason, and short of Vertue:
And <hi>hence</hi> it is, that every petty Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56135:126"/>
pretends to tell Fools their Fortunes.</p>
                  <p>* <hi>There is</hi> no Man that is wise, but he is
<hi>more than Temper.</hi> A Man, by Wisdom,
doth govern himself, and over-rule all
Fate and Destiny whatsoever. For, Man,
under God, hath a kind of Sovereignty
over himself. A Man hath Power to use
Diligence, that he may attain to right
Apprehensions of Things: And then he
hath Power to execute, and perform, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Apprehensions. <hi>This</hi> also
is to put a Lye upon a Man's self, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
ones self in any thing without
warrant of Reason or Scripture. <hi>To settle
in an Opinion, without warrant of Reason,
or credible Testimony;</hi> is <hi>Impotency, and Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
CREDULITY is a Stranger to Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the very <hi>Nurse of Superstition.
* Also,</hi> a Man puts a Lye upon himself, if
he have <hi>his Will for his Rule.</hi> For, <hi>Will</hi>
is no Rule at all. Will signifies nothing;
unless it be <hi>that Will</hi> which is in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with infallible Understanding:
which is <hi>the Will of God.</hi> Some Men
think it is the highest Perfection to be <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary:</hi>
But really, if they do consider,
it is a Piece of the greatest Impotency,
and foulest Deformity.—In these
Cases, a Man puts <hi>a Lye on himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:56135:126"/>
In the Third place: To give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Truth, between Man and Man.</hi>
All our Expressions must answer our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
when we treat one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
We are not in the Truth, unless
we speak what we mean.—It is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the <hi>Truth</hi> of a Treaty, that the
Materials which make the Case, be fully
declared. For it is no Agreement, if any
part of the Matter be unknown. For a
Case is made up, of all Circumstances:
Do but diversify one Circumstance; and
it is another thing.—They that treat
together, are to take care that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and mean the <hi>same</hi> Things; (and
not * <hi>make it a Practice, for</hi> one who is
more comprehensive than another, to
make use of his Wit to over-reach:) And
if they find they did not mean the <hi>same</hi>
things; they are to release one another.
For no Man is <hi>obliged</hi> further than he did
<hi>mean.</hi>—What is meant in the Treaty,
is <hi>after</hi> to be stood to. No <hi>After</hi>-shifts.
Men must not <hi>after</hi> use Wit, or practise
upon the Doubtfulness and Uncertainty
of Words and Phrases, thereby to make
an escape.—What we have engaged,
we must perform (unless we can obtain a
release from the Party with whom we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage;)
though it prove inconvenient,
and worse to us, than is imagined.—This
is <hi>Truth between Man and Man.</hi>And
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56135:127"/>
whosoever faileth in these, forfeiteth his
Truth. And thus I have shewed you where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a Man may put a Lye upon <hi>God,</hi> upon
<hi>Himself,</hi> upon his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and by this
you may understand this Charge of the
Apostle, <hi>Whatsoever Things are True.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the whole Matter, now, let us
take up a Lamentation. For, if that
which I have said be true; how misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and deform'd is the World? <hi>That</hi>
that is the principal Thing, <hi>Wit, Reason,</hi>
and <hi>Understanding,</hi> is made ill use of, to
serve particular Interests, Ends, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
How much counterfeit Ware, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-where,
is to be found? How much
over-reaching in Bargains and Treaties?
So that, now, a Man had need to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
skill'd, to have Right in the
World. Things are generally done for
the Vender's Gain only; and not for the
Buyer's Service. Whereas, every Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
doth imply <hi>a Trust</hi> for the Service of
the Publick. And every Man, in the Way
of his Profession, ought to do things
<hi>Truly.</hi> For a Man to be false in his own
Trade, is a double Iniquity. For, the
Artist's Skill, ought to be the Buyer's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
Every Man ought to be ready to
render a Reason to any Man, as in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
so every-where else. He that is
ignorant, may demand the Help of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56135:127"/>
Skill: And if he makes use of his
Skill to his Prejudice, he deals <hi>falsly.</hi> It
is not competent to any Person, to be
universally knowing. Wherefore are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Trades, and several Professions, but
for the Good of Mankind, because no
Man is more than particularly skill'd?—This
Departure from Simplicity and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
in Profession, is a thing unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table:
But, <hi>this</hi> is nothing in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with the Cheats, Frauds and Coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
in Religion. What think ye, now,
of <hi>Divinity methodized,</hi> to sink the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
down, and gain Pomp to the <hi>Clergy?</hi>
Religion accommodate to Ends and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses?
The infinite Gain that comes from
one Doctrine! <hi>The Pope's Power to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
Sin, the Priest's Power to absolve Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners!</hi>—Now,
<hi>these</hi> Cheats, <hi>these</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenages,
are of greater Importance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Consequences are greater.</p>
                  <p>* <hi>To conclude.</hi> Truth hath always God
to maintain it.—Truth hath <hi>Defence</hi>
in it self: For, <hi>Great is Truth; and it
will prevail:</hi> It may be overborn for
a while; but it will recover.—Truth
hath <hi>Goodness</hi> to accompany it:
Therefore, none need fear <hi>Shame,</hi> or
<hi>Cause to repent.</hi>—Truth hath
<hi>Liberty</hi> consequent to it: <hi>The Truth shall
make you free.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 32.</note> He that is in the Truth, is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56135:128"/>
not thoughtful: But a Lyar had need car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
about him a good Memory.—Truth
is Con-natural to our Principles: For, a
Man forceth himself, when he departs
from it.—Truth is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Order. All things will be
in Confusion, if not order'd, united,
and govern'd by Truth. For, Falshood
puts every thing out of its place.—
Truth is the Ground of Human Converse.
No Man is sure of another, neither knows
where to have him, if he abide not in the
Truth.—It is the Bond of Union.
Where Men agree in the Truth, they are
Friendly, meet, and harmonize one with
another; and great Sympathy is between
them: But, out of the Ways of Truth,
Men run counter, cross and contradict
one another every-where.</p>
                  <p>This we are to know, that God's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-intendency
over Human Affairs, aims
at this; that Truth and Righteousness
may obtain an universal Empire in the
World. And this is an Explication of
that great Phrase, <hi>God's doing all for his
own Glory.</hi> For, it is an unexplicable
Form of Words, to say, That <hi>God doth
all for himself particularly;</hi> as if God were
a particular Agent, and sought his own
particular Interest. But, * <hi>the Sense is,</hi>
that God super-intends the World for
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56135:128"/>
this; <hi>That Truth, Righteousness and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
might take place every-where in the
World.</hi> And, for the Advancement of
this, every Man in his Sphere of Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and within his Compass, ought to
endeavour. And this is, for us <hi>to do to
the Glory of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatsoever Things are Honest.</p>
                  <p>So the Translation. But I rather keep
to the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Whatsoever things
are VENERABLE:</hi> Which Word is
put in the Margin. Neither do I forsake
the Word in the Text, without very
good Reason, because the Word <hi>Honest</hi>
doth not import the Emphasis of the
<hi>Greek:</hi> And the very Notion of <hi>Honest</hi>
you have afterwards; therefore you are
not take it here. Now, the <hi>Greek</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
whatsoever things are <hi>Honourable,
Grave, Venerable, Seemly, Comely;</hi> Things
that may raise the Esteem of the Person,
and gain Reverence and Value to a
Man.</p>
                  <p>* <hi>In this Sense,</hi> there are <hi>Two</hi> Things
requisite; <hi>Grave Behaviour,</hi> and <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Spirit.</hi>—Light Carriage, and an
ungovern'd Spirit, render any Man mean,
vile, and contemptible. A Man lays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56135:129"/>
low in the Esteem of others, by Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour:
And a Man lays himself o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
by falling into Passion; or running
out into immoderate Desires. Gallantly
doth the Poet tell us, <hi>Remember to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
thy self.</hi> There is much of God in
every Man. If a Man do justly value
himself, he will not do that that is base;
though it be <hi>in the Dark;</hi> though no
Body sees him. A Man ought not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
himself, or make himself mean, or
low, since he bears the Image of God.
But if a Man will neither regard God
<hi>within,</hi> nor the Workmanship of God
<hi>without,</hi> neither have Reverence for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi>
he will have Cause to find that he
hath been wanting to himself, when he
falls under other Mens and his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Sin and Wickedness doth equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
those that are therein engaged. There
is no Man, in the Sense of his Mind, or
in his Judgment, hath a Value or Esteem
for any one that is naught. No Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenceth
a wicked Man; no, not a
wicked Man himself. He is low and
base in Esteem: And there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                  <p>But some * <hi>there</hi> are of so comely and
grave Behaviour, that they awe Men by
their Presence. When the ungovern'd
Multitude are in a Confusion, if there
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56135:129"/>
appear a Man of Reverence, Vertue, and
Esteem, no sooner is he seen, but the
rude Multitude is overaw'd, a Rout is
brought into order.
<q>
                        <l>Tum pietate gravem, ac meritis, si forte
virum quem.</l>
                        <l>Conspexere, silent.—</l>
                     </q>
This <hi>Solomon</hi> hath observ'd, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 8.
And this is the Advantage of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and comely Behaviour. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, by Lightness of Carriage, Men
pull upon themselves Contempt. It is in
this Case, that some complain of Want of
Love. Some are very sensible they are
slighted, and not regarded as they should
be. They complain, <hi>they are not loved:</hi>
And no wonder; if they have nothing
in them, that is <hi>Lovely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is <hi>that</hi> that is below the State,
the Place, the Dignity of such or such a
Person; and if he doth it, is unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him. He that cannot justly estimate
and value himself, that doth not know
what is fit for one in his Circumstances,
cannot <hi>maintain Esteem.</hi> Not that any
one is too good for the necessary Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Life. No, it was a gallant Man
that said, <hi>Nothing that becomes a Man, or
is worthy of a Man, but I can do, if call'd
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56135:130"/>
to it.</hi> Though a Man hath Authority and
Command over others; though all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
though all Wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet, those
things that are the most unhandsome, and
the most inferior Performances of the
the Life of Man, every Man must do for
himself: As witness all Annoyances from
Diseases; all sort of Evacuation; all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
of Nature: These are all to be
perform'd by every Man, for himself.
Therefore no Reason for Haughtiness and
Presumption. No Man doth a meaner
Office for any Man in the World, than
he doth for himself. Therefore we are
not to be too coy, and think our selves
too good for the necessary Occasions of
Life. Which consider'd, wou'd abate
Pride and Conceit, and make us not to
despise others, for their Meanness of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and Lowness of Condition.
But in these Matters there is no universal
Rule to be given: But there will be a
Variation, according to the Rules of
Prudence, * <hi>with respect to</hi> the Variation
of Circumstances, Change of Times, Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Places.</p>
                  <p>And having thus declared to you the
Notion; I proceed to special Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:56135:130"/>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Therefore, I do suggest upon
this Account, that Men lay aside all <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation</hi>
or <hi>Imitation.</hi> No two things are
more ridiculous, nauseous, or fulsome.
Every Man's Mode is natural: And he
will do best in that way: And it will
best become him. It will better serve his
turn, and be more acceptable to others.
Every Man is pleased to see a Man do
<hi>that</hi> that is natural to himself. But, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
and Imitation do discover that
the Mind is empty, and the Person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited.
He hath not within himself,
whereby to direct and govern himself.
Such a Man will be importune, self-assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and imposing upon others; than
which nothing is more rejected with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</p>
                  <p>Let there be no Moroseness, Rigidness,
Censoriousness, Severity, or Stateliness in
a Man's Carriage; but all Friendliness,
Familiarity, Kindness, Harmony, and
Compliance in Converse. <hi>Stateliness</hi> is an
Eye-sore to every Body: he is look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as burthensome who is of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
For, take it for granted, that none
but those that are <hi>base,</hi> none but those that
will make themselves <hi>Slaves for Ends,</hi>
will bear another's Scorn or Neglect: And
they do it but <hi>externally</hi> neither.</p>

                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:56135:131"/>I propose, in the next place, that Men
wou'd not over-abound in Speech. <hi>Be
not over Talkative.</hi> Two things tend
mightily to Men's reproach: <hi>Much talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>much talking of a Man's self.</hi> For
the former; <hi>over much talking.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 19. 17, 28.</note> The wise
Man doth very much admonish us in this
Particular.—He spends too fast, that
talks too much: He spends faster than he
gets. For, the Notions of the Mind do
not bubble so thick. No Man is greatly
valuable where he hath not consider'd:
And no Man hath leisure to consider all
things. Men, therefore, where they have
not consider'd, should rather be patient
to <hi>hear,</hi> than forward to <hi>speak.</hi>—But
then * <hi>for</hi> the other: <hi>To talk much of a
Man's self;</hi> this is hardly capable of an
Apology. Let a Man free himself of this,
of all things: For it is very offensive and
fulsome, and doth declare a Man to be
very shallow, and empty, and not to
have consider'd. He doth thereby arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
and assume to himself; and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
others Poverty. By it, a Man's
Discretion and Modesty are call'd in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was put upon it, to speak
of himself more than he chose to do:
And when he speaks of things concerning
himself, he puts in, ever and anon, <hi>I
speak like a FOOL,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 21. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56135:131"/>
wherein soever any is bold I speak
FOOLISHLY, I am bold also,</hi> Vers. 23.
<hi>Are they Ministers of Christ, I speak as a
FOOL, I am more:</hi> Intimating, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
there be very great Cause, whosoever
talks much of himself, he talks <hi>like a
Fool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> Above all Things, stand at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from, and avoid all Immorality
and Turpitude. <hi>This</hi> God requires of us,
and this is necessary to the Welfare of our
Souls; and Fundamental to our Credit.
For, no Man hath Credit enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
the Rule of Right. No Person
hath Credit enough to countenance, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or palliate that that is Foul; to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize
that that is Filthy, or Dishonest.
Whosoever doth commit Sin, doth sink
below his own Nature. For, there is no
natural Action that is so mean, as every
sinful Action is. Whosoever therefore
sins, doth that that is unworthy of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and below himself: For, Sin is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
any Man. If a Man sins, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses
the Rule of Right; nothing is
more vile to himself, than himself. And
he can charge more upon himself, than
upon any other: Because every Man is
privy to his own Iniquity, to all the
Thoughts of his own Minds, to all his
own Irregularities and Misbehaviours.—
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56135:132"/>
                     <hi>Reverence thy self:</hi> (A great Rule of <hi>old:</hi>)
But no Man can have a due Reverence
for himself, that doth consent to Sin and
Iniquity, (for, as there is no true SELF
in Wickedness so no true <hi>Self-reverence:</hi>)
And if a Man hath no reverence for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and for his own <hi>Nature;</hi> so as to
abuse it, and disorder it; he hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
for <hi>God.</hi> There is nothing in
the World hath more of God in it, than
<hi>Man</hi> hath. For, in respect of his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and Understanding, he represents
the first intelligent Agent, the All-wise
God: * <hi>And this also</hi> in respect of his
Priviledge of Liberty and Freedom, and
in respect of <hi>Goodness of Disposition;</hi>
which certainly doth run through the
Nature of Man, till Man hath abused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Therefore let a Man reverence him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And <hi>Reverence to a Man's self</hi> is
this; that, though a Man be <hi>alone,</hi> tho'
<hi>no Eyes see him;</hi> tho' he can carry it out, or
defend it <hi>by Power;</hi> yet he will not do
that that is <hi>base</hi> or <hi>dishonourable:</hi> Because
he is made in the Image of God. And
he that will not blush because of his own
Vileness, out of the Sense of <hi>his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
because he hath done that that is
contrary to the Light of Reason and
Conscience; he will not blush out of
Respect and Reverence <hi>to God.</hi>

                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:56135:132"/>The <hi>Ingredients</hi> that are requisite and
necessary to the Qualification of that Man,
that would render himself valuable; are
<hi>these:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>First; <hi>A Constancy immoveable; so as
always to be found the same.</hi> A great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
differ, one Day and another, more
from themselves, than any two Men do.
Many Men do so little govern themselves,
that those that are acquainted with them,
do not know how <hi>Reason</hi> may take with
them, if they be out of Temper. A Man
shou'd take care to be always <hi>the same.</hi> I
know there is some Difficulty in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of our Bodies. Every Man is solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by his Body: And our Bodies are
over-ruled by the * <hi>very</hi> Temper and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
of the Air: And no Man can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his bodily Temper, but by great
Wisdom. Yet, <hi>this</hi> is attainable. For,
if Reason were (as it ought to be,) the
settled Law of Life and Action; it wou'd
be then easie. For, <hi>Reason</hi> is regular, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and always self-consistent. It is
<hi>Humour</hi> that is various, and unconstant,
and that drives a Man from himself.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, <hi>A Patience invincible; so as
never to be disturbed by things that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us.</hi> A Man doth not do himself right,
if he do not live <hi>from within,</hi> but <hi>from
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56135:133"/>
without.</hi> For, what are the Things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Man, in Comparison with his Self-enjoyment?
which lies in the Serenity of
his Mind, the Calmness and good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
of his Spirit, the Peace and Quiet
of his Conscience. And <hi>this good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
of our Spirit</hi> is attainable; if we be
resolv'd, that neither the partial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent
Opinion and Sense of By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers,
and uncapable Judges; nor
the Change of Things which are mutable,
and uncertain; nor the various Accidents
of this uncertain World; that none of
<hi>these</hi> drive a Man from himself. For, a
Man is a little World to himself: And
may enjoy himself <hi>within.</hi> If things
* <hi>there</hi> be right and streight; however
disturbed they are <hi>without.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Thirdly, <hi>A Composure of Mind and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venness
of Temper:</hi> So as not to be
sometimes up, sometimes down; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
high, sometimes low. This is to be
<hi>one day,</hi> a Man; <hi>another day</hi> no Body:
One while, more than <hi>himself;</hi> another
while, less than <hi>any Body.</hi> Who would
be so unlike himself? Certainly, every
Man in his Reason will conclude, that
<hi>this</hi> is unbecoming and unsatisfactory;
to be sometimes triumphant and full of
Confidence; and other whiles, to be
drown'd, * <hi>sunk,</hi> unactive, and deficient.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="245" facs="tcp:56135:133"/>Fourthly, <hi>Such a Gesture and Carriage
as may no ways argue a Spirit either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eager
or forward.</hi> And, truly, if a Man
consider, that there is a <hi>bitter-sweet</hi> in all
the Things of this World, a Shortness
and an Unsatisfactoriness in all our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments;
he will then find, that it is
fit he shou'd maintain an Indifferency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; and an Independency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. There is <hi>that</hi> in them, that
doth abate the Content and Satisfaction
that any Man can have in them. For
they are <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>restrained good-Things.</hi>
And therefore it is mainly requisite, for
a Man of Reason and Religion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an Indifferency towards them, and
an Independency upon them.—To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
this, I will repeat a Character * <hi>of
one in a former Age; one of whom it was
said, that he had,</hi> 
                        <q>A <hi>Constancy</hi> immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
A <hi>Modesty</hi> so well behaving it
self, an <hi>Evenness</hi> so marvellous, that he
spoke not one Word higher than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor us'd any Gesture which
might argue <hi>a Spirit over-eager, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>These <hi>Four</hi> Things I propose, as Things
whereof this gallant Temper doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist;
as Principles of it; or, as Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
with it.—Now to recommend
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56135:134"/>
all that I have said, I shall show you <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
eminent Advantages</hi> which attend
upon <hi>this</hi> I call <hi>Gravity, Sobriety,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>These</hi> prepare the Mind for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Knowledge: For, nothing is to
be fasten'd upon a light and airy Temper.
Without <hi>these,</hi> a Man will not be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Culture, Instruction, and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They</hi> are the true Companions of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Wisdom walks with such Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
in such an Equipage. <hi>These</hi> are
the proper Retinues of Wisdom. None
are truly wise, but those that are, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently
at least, furnished with <hi>these.</hi>
There is that which we call <hi>Wit;</hi> and
that which we call <hi>Wisdom.</hi> Wit, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with Wisdom, is a Fit, a Flash, a
Vapour of no Continuance. But <hi>Wisdom</hi>
is conjoyn'd with Prudence and Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They</hi> dispose the Mind to all Vertue.
In this rich and fruitful SOIL (for such
is <hi>a Mind thus qualified and govern'd,</hi>) all
the <hi>Seeds</hi> of universal Goodness, being
sown, will grow apace. For, <hi>Goodness</hi>
is really <hi>Knowledge digested,</hi> concocted,
entertain'd, submitted to, consented to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They</hi> procure, from others, Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an Esteem. It hath been shew'd you,
that Men render themselves despicable,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56135:134"/>
Men are slighted and neglected, because
they show their own Weakness, Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Vanity, and Folly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They</hi> uphold Mens Superiority, Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Authority. Whereas, Frothiness
and Vanity of Spirit, Rudeness and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Behaviour, level Persons of * <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
Difference and Distinction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They</hi> raise Mens Thoughts to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of Things that are excellent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They</hi> represent the Divine Majesty and
Presence.—Acquaintance with such
Men as these, Men of Gravity, of Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and Sobriety, doth discharge us
of that Levity, Rudeness, and Irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
that <hi>else</hi> is apt to follow us, and
accompany us in our Approaches and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
unto God. For, <hi>he</hi> that doth use
to play the Fool, will be a Fool in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Company. And <hi>they</hi> who, by Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and Tempet, and by long Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
and Practice, have brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into a Habit of Vanity and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
they are in a great Aversation and
Indisposition to Gravity and Seriousness,
at all times, and in every Presence. So
that even the Sense of * <hi>the</hi> Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of Heaven and Earth, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of his Greatness, awes them not;
neither can prevail with them, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their Minds of their habitual Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Levity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:56135:135"/>
                     <hi>These</hi> are the Considerations whereby
this Moral Perfection of <hi>Staidness of
Mind, Soberness of Spirit, Gravity, Seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyness
of Behaviour, good Carriage, and
Self-government</hi> stands recommended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever Things are JUST.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Our <hi>English</hi> Translation
is a little too short for the <hi>Greek.</hi> The
Words, in the <hi>Greek,</hi> do comprehend
<hi>Two</hi> Things, that in our <hi>English</hi> Language
we call <hi>Just,</hi> and <hi>Equal.</hi> Justice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
I know, oft-times are indifferently
used for the self-same thing: But, if we
speak strictly, and exactly, then they are
to be distinguish'd. For, whatsoever ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reason or Law will admit, <hi>that</hi> may
pass for <hi>Just.</hi> But <hi>Equity</hi> will take all
Things into Consideration, that do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
the Case: And, if the Case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
Equity will abate of what, strict
Right will afford. Therefore, <hi>that</hi> that
we call <hi>Equity,</hi> is to moderate strict
Right. And, indeed, <hi>strict Right</hi> may
be down-right <hi>Injury</hi> and <hi>Wrong.</hi> Strict
Right is not to be stood upon by Persons
of Reason and Conscience, where Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
calls for another Thing. For, when
we our selves consider what we owe to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56135:135"/>
God, how much we are beholden to
him, and how much we depend upon
his Grace; and when we think, upon
our selves as Christians, as reliev'd by
Christ, and what we are thereby enjoin'd
by our Saviour towards our Brethren;
we shall find it necessary to abate of that
that we call <hi>our due.</hi> It is this, that the
Apostle chargeth upon us in the Fifth
Verse of this Chapter: Where, the Word
that is translated <hi>Moderation, (Let your

your <hi>fair Dealing,</hi> your <hi>giving Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
to all Things considerable in a Case;</hi>
let <hi>this</hi> be known. And I am sure, if we
do not thus use this Fairness and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour;
but stand upon strict Right, and
upon the utmost Terms that possible we
may demand; we do not only part with
the Nobleness and Ingenuity of a Gospel-Spirit:

                  </p>
                  <p>JUST is determined <hi>Two</hi> Ways: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>by the Proportion of Things one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;</hi>
or <hi>by positive Constitution</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who have Right and Power.</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:56135:136"/>
                     <item>First, <hi>Just</hi> or <hi>Right</hi> is determined <hi>by
the Proportion of Things one to another:</hi> Not
by particular <hi>Fancy</hi> or <hi>Arbitrary Will:</hi> But
<hi>by the Nature and Reason of the Things.</hi>—
These Things that are determined by their
Relation each to other, are what we call
<hi>the great Rights of the World,</hi> that govern
<hi>above</hi> and <hi>below,</hi> and are never to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd,
never to yield, or give place.
For, they are a Law with God; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Nature of God. They are
as unchangeable, and as unalterable as <hi>God</hi>
himself.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, <hi>Right</hi> is determin'd <hi>by posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Constitution:</hi> And that is in <hi>Two</hi>
Cases: By the <hi>Right of Property;</hi> and by
the <hi>Right of Authority.</hi>—By the <hi>Right
of Property,</hi> every Man may do with his
own, as he will: He may keep it, or
dispose of it, as himself pleases.—By
the <hi>Right of Authority,</hi> he that hath Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
makes Laws, as he finds Cause; and
so he doth determine Right: And a Man
is wanting to his Duty, that doth not
observe those Laws: For it is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that the Law of the Place is not
the Institution of a particular Will, but
that it is in Conjunction with Right, and
agreeable with universal Reason. So, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law,</hi> in this Case, is <hi>according
to Right.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:56135:136"/>Now, for EQUAL; <hi>That</hi> is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be <hi>Equal,</hi> which gives Allowance
where the Case doth require; and where
Abatement is made, upon reasonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
But, then, there is <hi>that</hi> that
is beyond all this, <hi>that</hi> that we call <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulness,
Graciousness, Compassion, Benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
when a Person out of his own <hi>good
Nature,</hi> or in a Resentment of God's
Goodness unto him, or in the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Fallibility and Frailty of
Human Nature, will do more than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
can be demanded or expected.
There are such Men in the World; tho
the World hath been blest but with few
of them. I am sure God deals thus with
Men; though Men, with Men, deal thus
but seldom.</p>
                  <p>If a Man will observe <hi>the Rule of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
he must take the Case into Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and cloath it with all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
that belong to it; and give all
Allowance to the Person concern'd, for
sudden Surprizal, for invincible Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
for contracted Necessity, for una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
Accident: <hi>For,</hi> something which
might befal him that he cou'd not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see.
And, if you will extend your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the utmost; give something to
<hi>the Frailty of Human Nature,</hi> where there
is no other Consideration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:56135:137"/>Nothing * <hi>is</hi> deeper imprinted in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature,</hi> than <hi>Righteousness, Fairness,
Benevolence.</hi>
And, that <hi>Universal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,</hi>
which God by his own Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
did sow in the <hi>Nature</hi> of Man; and
did plant, when he made Man upon
Earth; <hi>that Universal Benevolence</hi> which
spirits the Intelectual World, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of each Man towards another, <hi>Faith,</hi>
and <hi>Truth.</hi> Now, in Resemblance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and in Participation of this <hi>Universal
Benevolence</hi> which is in the <hi>Superior World</hi>
(the Intelectual World of Soul and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)
you have the Resemblance of this, in
the <hi>inferior World (viz.)</hi> the Suitableness
and Fitness that is in one thing to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
another: As you see the whole
Creation of God is <hi>mutually beneficial.</hi>
There is nothing that is in being, tho'
devoid of the Perfection of Reason and
Understanding, but hath, as it Dowry,
<hi>a Disposition and Fitness to accommodate
the Universe to some necessary Use and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi>
And, this likewise is agreeable to
the Light of Nature. There has not been
any Noble or Generous amongst the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
but they have deeply charged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this Particular. To instance,
<hi>Regulus,</hi> a Famous <hi>Roman,</hi> being in the
Wars, taken Prisoner; he had his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
given him upon his <hi>Parole,</hi> to seek
an Exchange. He goes Home; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56135:137"/>
effect it: And, tho' it cost him his
Life, he wou'd return. The Justice of
<hi>Aristides</hi> is so eminent, that his Name is

consent to an Act of Treachery, to save

do nothing in Consideration of, or with
Respect to <hi>his private Advantage.</hi>
                     </q> Also,
the <hi>Barbarians</hi> (as they were call'd) in
<hi>Scythia:</hi> This was <hi>a Religion</hi> amongst
them. They were call'd <hi>Barbarians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had no Culture: But they

of Justice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude. Since <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
have such a Foundation in <hi>Human
Nature;</hi> since so much, in <hi>Reason;</hi>
since so much may be alledged against
the contrary; since we our selves meet
with such Usage from God, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and, since the Terms of the Gospel
are such as they are; * <hi>Let us</hi> take up
this Resolution, <hi>That it shall be the better
for every one, with whom we shall have to
do in the World.</hi>

Sincere, Uncorrupt, Unmixt, Immaculate,
Clear, Sacred.</p>
                  <p>I find in Scripture, <hi>Six</hi> several Things
comprehended under the Notion of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>—
First, by Purity, and Holiness,
is only intended the bare, simple <hi>Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Things:</hi> And it doth only declare,
in the Thing it self, Indifferency.<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 14. Tit.1. 15.</note>—
Sometimes it is taken for <hi>Uprightness, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
Integrity, and Harmlessness.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 8. 6. Prov. 20. 9. Prov. 21. 8. Mic. 6. 11. Jam. 1. 27.</note>—
Sometimes, for <hi>Sincerity, True Intention,
Honest Meaning, and Simplicity of Heart;</hi>
in Opposition to Hypocrisie,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 27 Mat. 15. 8.</note> Cozenage,
Dissimulation.—Sometimes, it denotes
<hi>Separation from Iniquity and Moral Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 26. 2 Cor. 6. 17. 1 Tim. 5. 22</note>—
Sometimes it denotes, <hi>a distinct
Use.</hi> When a Thing is set apart from a
common and ordinary Use; then, it is
said to be <hi>Holy.</hi> So, in the Time of the
Mosaical Dispensation; there were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Places, Sacrifices, Offerings <hi>Holy;</hi>

Israel <hi>was holy unto the Lord.</hi>—And,
Lastly; This is particularly and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
attributed to that peculiar Vertue of

                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:56135:138"/>I shall, now, give you an Account of
the great Distinction of Holiness: REAL
<hi>Holiness;</hi> and RELATIVE.</p>
                  <p>The Subjects of REAL <hi>Holiness</hi> are,
Agents indued with Understanding and
Liberty. <hi>They,</hi> and <hi>They</hi> only, can be
the Subjects of <hi>Real Holiness.</hi> Of such
Agents there are but <hi>Three</hi> sorts in the
whole World, to wit, <hi>God</hi> himself;
<hi>Angels;</hi> and <hi>the Spirits of Men.</hi>—Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
being attributed to God, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
God's Peerless Majesty, together
with infinite Power and Wisdom, as it
is in Conjunction with Righteousness and
Goodness. For, if you cou'd divide Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightiness,
from Goodness; you would
destroy <hi>Holiness:</hi> For, the other are <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
only as they are in Conjunction
with <hi>Goodness.</hi> There is no true Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
if Goodness be not in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with it. This is <hi>Holiness in God.</hi>—
Now, <hi>Holiness in Angels and Men</hi> doth
import their <hi>Deiformity,</hi> that is, <hi>their
Conformity to God,</hi> according to their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity;
<hi>their</hi> being in their Measure, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and Proportion, <hi>what</hi> God is, in
his Height, Excellence, and Fulness. And
by this Holiness, we bear the Image of
God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:56135:139"/>Now, for RELATIVE <hi>Holiness;</hi> That
lies in <hi>a Separation,</hi> a <hi>Distinction,</hi> or <hi>an
appropriated Use.</hi> For, <hi>Relative Holiness</hi>
doth not, at all, alter the Nature and
Quality of Things; but of the Relation,
and Use. Whereas, <hi>Real Holiness</hi> mends
the Subject, and puts it into a sound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
It gives an inward Tincture
and Colour to the Mind. It gives a right
Temper, Complexion, and Constitution
to the Soul. Things that are altogether
uncapable of <hi>Real Holiness,</hi> may be <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
Holy:</hi> But, only Persons indued
with Understanding and Reason, and
priviledged with Liberty and Freedom;
<hi>these</hi> only, can be the Subjects of Real
Holiness.—To tell you, in short;
<hi>that</hi> that we call <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Vertue,</hi> (for,
to m<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, they are all one) <hi>Goodness,</hi> and
<hi>Righteousness, these</hi> are that that we call
<hi>Real Holiness.</hi> They sanctifie the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
by their Presence: And wheresoever
they are, the Person is made good. On
the other side; Vice, and Sin, which are,
in themselves, impure and unholy Things,
<hi>these</hi> do defile the Soul, where-ever they
are. Now, Things that are <hi>relatively</hi>
Holy, <hi>are,</hi> either by God's own Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Assuming; or by Man's voluntary
Dedication. But, <hi>Real</hi> holy Things, <hi>are,</hi>
by an intrinsick and inward Rectitude
and Goodness. Relative Holiness doth not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56135:139"/>
depend upon <hi>the Quality of the Thing;</hi>
but upon some <hi>Arbitrary Act</hi> of him that
hath Power. It wholly depends upon
the Will and Pleasure of the Agent:
And, so, is mutable, and of a dispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Nature, and at the Pleasure of the
Superior. For, God may assume into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to himself, either Persons, or
Things.—God may assume a Thing to
signifie something from him; it may be
<hi>God's Instrument,</hi> and afterwards he may
lay it aside; and make it common again:
And Things relatively Holy <hi>have</hi> been
abated and omitted (* <hi>even</hi> where the
Things have been under the Command of
<hi>God;</hi> and of <hi>his</hi> Institution,) and have
return'd to their ordinary Use again. As
for instance.—<hi>The brazen Serpent</hi> in
the Wilderness: It was God's Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and, by God's Appointment, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
And it was good for the People, for
a time, and of great Use: After a while,
it is deserted of God, and returns to be
<hi>common,</hi> as it was before. It was <hi>Brass</hi>
before; and it was a <hi>Piece of Brass</hi> again.
Therefore, those Things that are <hi>relatively
Holy;</hi> that is; <hi>separate from common and
ordinary use;</hi> their Holiness may be taken
off; and they return to their ordinary
and common use again. But <hi>real Holiness</hi>
of Persons, their Principles, and their
Actions; <hi>that</hi> can never be released; is
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56135:140"/>
never to be dispensed with; in no Case,
to be avoided or discharged: Never any
Abatement or Relaxation, never any Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
to be <hi>in this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Instance, In <hi>Circumcision,</hi> that
great Ceremony among the <hi>Jews.</hi> It was
a holy Rite, because it was appointed of
God, and had its Use and Signification.
Yet, it slept for Forty Years together;
while the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were in the
Wilderness. It was suspended out of
Respect of the Conveniency of their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.<note place="margin">John. 5. 5.</note>
For, <hi>this</hi> had no internal Holiness,
neither did it make the Persons <hi>Pure:</hi>
Only it did make the Persons <hi>separate for
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Instance, <hi>The Shew-bread</hi> was
Holy: And it was not allowed to the
Use of any but to the Priests: Yet, it is
said <hi>David</hi> and his Men, when in Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
made bold with the Shew-bread:
And our Saviour justifies it.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 21. 6. Mat. 12. 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Saviour gives another Instance,
Mat. 12. 5.</hi> Have ye not read in the Law,
how that on the Sabbath-day the Priests in
the Temple profane the Sabbath, and are
blameless?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:56135:140"/>
                     <hi>The Nation of the Jews</hi> they were a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Nation, and a particular People. They
were appropriate unto God: But they
are <hi>now</hi> in an absolute Parity as to God,
and as to eternal Life. And now all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are holy as they. And <hi>Peter</hi> is taught
this, by a Revelation from Heaven. He
was in the Narrowness of Spirit: He
wou'd have nothing to do with the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi>
But he is reproved; and, when he
comes to understand the Vision, he is
made to break out into the best Words
that ever Man spake (a place of Scripture
fit to be written with Letters of Gold:)
And thus he expresseth himself: <hi>Of a
Truth, I perceive that GOD is no Respector
of Persons: But, in every Nation, he that
feareth God and worketh Righteousness, is
accepted of him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 10. 34.</note> Such a Person is holy:
And none but such a Person is holy;
neither by pretended Descent from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
nor by any other Circumstance
whatsoever. Our Saviour hath expresly
told us, <hi>Mat. 15. 11. Not that which goeth
into the Mouth defileth the Man: But</hi> that
<hi>which cometh out of the Mouth:</hi> (All Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality:)
<hi>For, out of the Heart proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
evil Thoughts, Murder, Adultery, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
Thefts,</hi> &amp;c. And these are the
Things which defile the Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:56135:141"/>Further: <hi>The Priestly Office,</hi> so far as
it was Typical, ceased. It gave way to
the everlasting Gospel; when the true
High Priest <hi>the Lord Jesus</hi> appeared. We
have indeed, now, <hi>rational Instruments,</hi>
that are Workers with God; Helpers of
Mens Faith; Preachers of Righteousness,
to edifie the Church; to admonish Men;
to help Mens Understandings, to help
Mens Memories; to satisfie disturbed
Minds; to help Men to compare Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with Scripture; to administer Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by <hi>these</hi> is the Faith of
Men greatly advantaged. Now <hi>these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
because of their Employment, Office,
State, Function, are <hi>in order to God,</hi>
and belonging to him; and may be said
to be <hi>Holy,</hi> with this <hi>relative</hi> Holiness:
For, we have Things that are also rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
holy, now, in the Christian Church;
as <hi>this Ministerial Office, the Lord's Day,
the Sacramental Elements;</hi> these are holy
because of their <hi>Ends:</hi> For, these are set
apart for Purposes Supernatural; and
therefore are not for common use.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These</hi> are several Instances that shew,
that Things that are <hi>relatively Holy</hi> have
been dispensed with, abated, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in the Times of the greatest Severity:
But <hi>real Holiness</hi> never. Wherefore, Things
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56135:141"/>
                     <hi>relatively Holy</hi> have never been equalized
with Things <hi>really Holy;</hi> but have always
been in order to <hi>real</hi> Holiness; and were
intended as subservient to it, and for its
Security: And, in Competition, have
been undervalued.<note place="margin">Hos. 6. 6. Mic. 6. 6. Isa, 1. 11. Isa. 66. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>OUR Holiness</hi> is <hi>our Imitation
and Resemblance of God:</hi> And consists of
<hi>Three</hi> Things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>First, Our <hi>Straitness, Uprightness, Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
IN OUR SELVES;</hi> in Respect of
our <hi>Temper, Make, Constitution,</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
of which we do consist.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, <hi>Our Rectitude and Uprightness
towards GOD;</hi> who is our principal
Object: By whom we <hi>were;</hi> to whom
we tend: Who stands in all Places, and
fills all Relations to us: The Object of
all Adoration, and Worship. He is to
us <hi>Original;</hi> and ought to be <hi>Final;</hi> the
Center of our Souls; and the only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
in the Enjoyment of whom we are
happy.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, It is <hi>our Rectitude and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness,
IN RESPECT OF OUR FEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOW
CREATURES.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>

                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:56135:142"/>
                     <item>* <hi>As to the</hi> First. <hi>Man,</hi> as an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
an voluntary Agent, indued with
Reason and Understanding, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
with Liberty and Freedom; having
Dominion and Government over Body,
and Bodily Sense; and having the Rule and
Government of his own Spirit; * <hi>It is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site</hi>
that his <hi>better</hi> Part be Predominant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his <hi>Inferior,</hi> to wit, that his Intelectual
Nature do govern his inferior and sensitive
Powers and Faculties. Therefore, that
a Man may be right and strait in himself;
it is requisite, that he do maintain an
Order of his Powers and Faculties; and
that there be a Subordination and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of all <hi>inferior</hi> Faculties in him, to
those which are <hi>superior,</hi> and which ought
to govern. And <hi>this</hi> belongs to our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude
and Uprightness in our selves.</hi> It
is <hi>Obliquity,</hi> and <hi>Unholiness,</hi> when the
Powers and Faculties of Mens Souls are
in Confusion, and in mutual Opposition
and Contestation: When it is with a
Man, as it is said in the <hi>Tragedy;</hi> 
                        <q>By
my Reason and Understanding, by my
Superior Powers and Faculties, I judge
and discern, that <hi>this</hi> is best and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientest:
But, my inferior Faculties

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56135:142"/>
original Appointment of Nature, the
<hi>Governour</hi> in Man, and that should, and
ought to govern, when <hi>that</hi> is dethroned,
and put out of Possession; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior

And all Things are in Hurly-burly
and Confusion.<note place="margin">

                           </gap>.</note> Impotent Passions have
the Rule: And <hi>Man's REASON</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed.—Rectitude
and Uprightness
are the Health and Purity of a Man's
Soul. A Man is, <hi>then,</hi> right and strait:
He is whole within himself; and all
Things are as they shou'd be. There
should never be any transporting Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
no Discomposure of Mind:
For, that is a Failure in the Government
of a Man's Spirit. There ought to be no
Eagerness, or Inordinacy, towards the
Things of this World. We should not
be born down towards Objects of Sense.
There ought to be Serenity and Calmness
and clear Apprehensions, fair Weather
within; that that the noble Platonist
calls <hi>Steadiness of Mind and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
an Intelectual Calmness:</hi> A just Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance;
an equal Poise of a Man's Mind:
No Perplexity of Soul; no Confusion;
no Provocation; no Disturbance; no
Perturbation. A Man shou'd not be born
off from himself, or put out of himself,
because Things without him are ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
and disorder'd: For, these * <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances,</hi>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:56135:143"/>
do unhallow the Mind; lay it
it open, and make it common. If the
Mind be thus disturb'd and discomposed,
then <hi>that</hi> whereby a Man shou'd judge
and discern, <hi>that</hi> whereby a Man
shou'd resolve and determine, <hi>that</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a Man shou'd govern himself, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seased,
and sick: And, then, a Man is
in a lost Case. This is as if a Man's Eye
were Blood-shot, and less fit for its Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
So, * <hi>in the same Manner,</hi> the Mind
not being pure, is not apt to receive, nor
able to discern the Truth of Things; it
is an injudicious Mind; not qualified
for its Operation.—Modesty, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Gentleness, are the Minds <hi>Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi>
The Rule of Equity is the Mind's
<hi>Balance:</hi> Its <hi>Temper,</hi> the Love of Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
—<hi>These</hi> Things belong to the
Health of a Man's Mind and Soul. <hi>These</hi>
are the just Temper, Complexion and
happy Constitution of a Man's Mind.—
To conclude. To the State of Rectitude
belongs Right <hi>Reason</hi> in the Throne; Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the <hi>Will</hi> hereunto; Obedience
of the <hi>Appetite</hi> to the apprehensive Parts;
Harmony of the <hi>Affections</hi> to the Mind's
Sense; Love and Delight to all known
Truth.—The contrary to these, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
untrue, unsincere; neither comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God's Creation, nor any After-Institution;
but is base-born, illigiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56135:143"/>
upstart, and maintain'd by Violence.
I will conclude this with the Saying of
<hi>Boetius; Rid your selves of transporting
Joy, and discouraging Fear; deluding Hope,
and confounding Grief.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gaudia pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, Pelle ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nubila mens est, Vinctaque; fraenis; Haec ubi regnant</note> 
                        <hi>For, the Mind is
clouded, fetter'd and in Bonds, where these
have any place.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>The Second * <hi>Thing in which Holiness
consists,</hi> is, Rectitude and Uprightness,
<hi>in Respect of God.</hi> For, the Intelectual
Nature hath special Reference and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God. All Mind and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hath Tendency towards God. It was
well said by the Philosopher, <hi>God is more
Essential to us, than that that is most our
selves; and is Supream to that which is in
us Sovereign.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Simplicius.</note> And so long as the Soul
of Man is fix'd, and and fasten'd, and rooted
in God; so long, it draws Sap and Life,
and Nourishment, and Vital Influence;
thrives, prospers, and retains all its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
Emoluments and Qualifications,
with which God did at first make it.
All its Powers, Abilities, and Faculties
remain whole, and entire. But, if any
way, the Soul of Man be torn off from
God, either by our own Act of wilful
Departure, or by Ignorance, or by any
other ways; it withers, and fades, shri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
up, and comes to nothing; till it
do again, by Regeneration and good Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56135:144"/>
return to God, and rest in him.
For, if the Mind be off from God; it is
off from its Original: And, that is Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
enough. For, <hi>that</hi> that is Original
to first being, is conservative to all after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being.
If a Man, by Degeneration, be
fallen off from God; he is deprived of
his conservative Cause; he is off from his
Center; he is cross to his End; he is in
a State of deadly Sickness, and present
Death. <hi>God</hi> is our principal Object:
And, our chief and proper Employment
is about him. And, indeed, were it not
for Man's Capacity for God; if our Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Faculties had no Employment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
God, but were intended only for
the Drudgeries of the World; it had
been better for Man to have been made
in a lower Order. Had we been to have
had our adequate Employment here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
been made to converse with the
Creatures which now we govern; we
shou'd have been more happy, a great
deal, if more equal to them. For, there is
not so free converse, where is there une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.
A Man cannot communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Creatures below him: They
cannot understand Man, as an Equal;
but as a Governour. It had, therefore,
been better for Man, had he been made
less; if he had been only to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
himself about Beasts: Because he,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56135:144"/>
and his Employment wou'd have had a
greater Harmony. It is therefore in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
* <hi>that this is founded (viz.)</hi> Our
Relation <hi>God-ward;</hi> our Motion <hi>upwards,</hi>
our Converse <hi>with separate Spirits;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Mind of Man hath no adequate
Employment in converse with Creatures
below. It had been a Blot in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, and an Imperfection, for a
Man to be so much rais'd above the
Beasts; if he were made only to converse
with <hi>them.</hi> But, in that he is so much
raised above the lower Creation; in that
a Man is capable of receiving from God;
it must be, that <hi>God</hi> is his peculiar and
proper Object. And, if there be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of him from <hi>God;</hi> all the Things
in the World are short and unsatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.—All
Indisposition God-ward, all
Aversation from him, and Contradiction
to him is Man's Obliquity and Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and it is his Impiety and Unholiness.
The <hi>reasonable Part</hi> in Man, is God's
<hi>Mansion:</hi> It hath the Impression of God
upon it: It hath a peculiar Reservation
for God; and its Happiness is in its Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
about God. And (as <hi>Seneca</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons)
<q>It is the Image of the Creator, copied
out in the Creature.</q>—This is the Force
of <hi>our Saviour</hi>'s Argument, when he was
ask'd a captious Question;<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 20</note> whether the
free-born <hi>Israelites</hi> were subject to pay
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56135:145"/>
Tribute to <hi>Caesar?</hi> And ill-intended Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:
But see what a brave Notion our
Saviour gives us, in his Solution! If he
had said, <hi>they should not;</hi> he had made
himself obnoxious to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Power: If
he had said, <hi>they should;</hi> he had, then,
betrayed the Honour of his people; the
People of the <hi>Jews;</hi> whom God had
chosen. But he saith, <hi>Bring me a Penny.
Whose Image and Superscription doth it
bear?</hi> Then, the Rule is; <hi>Let every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
have his own:</hi> Give to <hi>Caesar</hi> that which
is <hi>Caesar</hi>'s; and to <hi>God</hi> that which is <hi>God</hi>'s.
Here is our Saviour's Argument. If the
Mind of Man bears God's Image, hath
God's Superscription upon it (as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it hath;) then, give it God; use it
in the Service of God; employ it about
God, in tendering Acts of Homage to
God, and Acts of Faith and Affiance in
God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—And <hi>this</hi> for the Second
Holiness; as it doth import a Man's Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and Uprightness, in Respect of God:
—First, well constituted <hi>in himself:</hi> And,
Secondly, rightly postured <hi>towards God.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We come to consider Holiness,
<hi>in respect of a Man's Fellow-Creatures:</hi>
That a Man stand right and strait towards
his Fellow-Creatures. And this takes in,
<hi>Man,</hi> as he is made <hi>a sociable Creature;</hi>
made for Converse with those that are this
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56135:145"/>
Equals, to receive from them, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to them, to be better for them, and
to better them. Then, in respect of the
inferior Part of the World; God hath
made him the Governour: And, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of <hi>them</hi> Man is required to exercise
such Government as God exerciseth over
his Creatures; that is, not wilful * <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
not violent, tyrannical, unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful.
For, <hi>the merciful Man is merciful
to his Beast.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 12. 10.</note> It is <hi>unholy</hi> for a Man to be
furious, provoking, injurious, boisterous,
troublesome, mischievous; to lie heavy
upon the World; so to behave himself,
that those that are under him, their Souls
are sad and troublesome to them, because
he lies heavy upon them. <hi>These</hi> are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of <hi>Unholiness,</hi> and expressive of
an <hi>unholy Temper: Foul Usage, hard Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
Cruelty, Oppression, Want of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
any thing <hi>extreamly</hi> done, in the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
World of Mankind; or <hi>violently</hi> done
in the inferior World of Sensitives. <hi>These</hi> are
monstrous Effects of <hi>impure</hi> Tempers, and
<hi>unholy</hi> Dispositions. <hi>They</hi> are contradictory
to the Law of the upper World. For,
Gentleness, Meekness, Fairness, Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Tenderheartedness, Readiness to do
Good, Calmness, Benignity, Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>&amp;c. These</hi> are the Declarations of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Communication to Men; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Man's Holiness, Uprightness,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56135:146"/>
and Integrity, in the Carriage of himself
in <hi>God</hi>'s Family, towards his <hi>Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>To conclude. A Man is <hi>Holy,</hi> when
he stands so affected, as I have here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
And, I take it for granted, so
far as you fail and miscarry in any of
these; so far your Spirits are unsanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and you are in a State of Variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from God, and Contradiction to him.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever things are LOVELY, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Two</hi> things are requisite to make an
Action LOVELY: when <hi>the Work</hi> is
<hi>worthy</hi> in respect of the matter of it, <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
noble: and</hi> when it is done in a
<hi>good Mind, a noble Temper, a high Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and <hi>good Disposition</hi> of the Doer;
when <hi>the Principle</hi> of the Doer, is free,
and voluntary, without Pre-engagement,
or After-expectation.</p>
                  <p>Now this Perfection LOVELY, of
which I am to give you an account: It
doth comprehend all the former Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and doth superadd Grace and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
to them all. Therefore you have
these Scriptures, Tit. 2. 10. <hi>That you
may adorn the Gospel.</hi> To do <hi>a lovely</hi>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:56135:146"/>
Action, is to bring a good Report, and
cast Honour upon the Gospel. Rom. 13.
13. <hi>Let us walk honestly.</hi> The word in
the Greek, is more emphatical than the
word in the Translation. <hi>Let us walk with
a Grace.</hi> So, 1 Cor. 7. 35. <hi>That which is
comely.</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 40. <hi>Let all things be
done decently, and in order;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
Now that these words are
very pregnant and emphatical, I will
shew you, by the use of them in Profane
Authors. The Philosopher advising Men
to walk exactly, and according to the
Rule of Reason and Vertue, doth bid
them consider the exact order, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Motion of the Heavenly Bodies;
that thereby they may learn <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
(which are the words the
Apostle useth: <hi>what is comely, what is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,</hi>)
that is: Consider the exact Order,
and the regular Motion of the Heavenly
Bodies; which, though the Motion be
quick and constant, and without Cessation,
yet through the Regularity of them,
there is no interfering; there is no Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
tending to Conflagration, as our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>below</hi> is. We cross one another, and
so exasperate and provoke. Learn, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by the Motion of the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
what is comely in Humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
If you do fulfil this Text, you are
as beautiful, and as orderly, in your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56135:147"/>
as the Sun, Moon, and Stars; which
are known by their exact Order.—O
Divine Vertue! O Divine Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that raiseth Men to act like God in
the World! for, LOVELY is <hi>God-like,</hi>
in a high degree: No fuller Participation
of the Divine Nature; no exacter Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God; no better holding him forth
to the World. Those that call themselves
<hi>the Children of God</hi> dwell in <hi>Love,</hi> and do
<hi>lovely</hi> Actions.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 16.</note> I might hereto apply
what St. <hi>Paul Speaks,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 31. <hi>But
covet earnestly the best Gifts: And yet shew
I unto you a more excellent way;</hi> the way
of <hi>universal Charity,</hi> and of great <hi>Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:</hi>
which is not confined to a dole,
now and then, to a Beggar; or a Gift to
an indigent and necessitous Person (tho'
popular Usage have usurped the whole
Denomination of <hi>Charity</hi> to this) but,
doth indifferently respect the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and doth appear in all the Actions
of Humane Converse. It is wholly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and unconstrain'd: the Agent
<hi>taking Pleasure</hi> in the <hi>good</hi> of others; and
<hi>satisfying himself</hi> with it, as a <hi>proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense,</hi>
that he doth Good, and that
others are the better for him. For, see
how he expresseth it, in the following
Chapter: <hi>Charity, that suffereth long, and
is kind.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> What a Composition is here?
We are apt to say,<note place="margin">Ver. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Provoke we not to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56135:147"/>
Wrath:</hi> but, here, <hi>it suffereth long, and is
kind.</hi> He goes on: <hi>A Charity which envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not;</hi> but taketh Pleasure in the Good
of all Men: <hi>A Charity that vaunteth not it
self; is not puffed up:</hi> A Charity that is
conjoin'd with great Modesty and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<hi>doth not behave it self unseemly;<note place="margin">V. 5.</note> seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not her own; is not easily provoked:</hi> a
Charity that <hi>thinks no Evil;</hi> but is void
of all Jealousies and Suspicions. A Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which <hi>never fails,</hi> but shews it self at
all turns.<note place="margin">V. 8.</note> For, see how he goes on: (St.
<hi>Paul</hi> thinks he can never word it enough:)
<hi>It beareth all things</hi> by its own Goodness,
and ingenuous Temper:<note place="margin">V. 7.</note> It converts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
to Courtesies: <hi>It believeth all things,</hi>
with Favour and Advantage to the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:
<hi>It hopeth all things;</hi> It expects beyond
present Appearance: <hi>It endureth all things.</hi>
—This noble Temper and Disposition
transcends all Excellency whatsoever:
It transcends <hi>all Faith;</hi> It goes beyond
<hi>all Knowledge;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">V. 13.</note> It is beyond the Power
of <hi>Miracles:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">V. 8.</note> yea, it doth transcend the
Case of Martyrs, that is, if the Spirit of
Wrath, or Revenge be in it: for, many
that loose their Lives, do not die in <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to instance in this of LOVELY.
It is <hi>the Parents Disposition to the Child,</hi>
which meets not with <hi>Recompense,</hi> nor
<hi>Return.</hi> For, it doth not pre-consider,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56135:148"/>
nor stand upon it. The Parent consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
advises, consults, what he may do
for the Child's Good; and hath no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of <hi>Recompense,</hi> or <hi>Return;</hi> but
to make the Child happy. He doth not
look upon any <hi>advantage:</hi> but is well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the Child's Welfare: and if
he meet with Duty and Affection from
the Child; he thinks it a further Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Observe <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 31. where the
Apostle reckons up all the Departures,
and horrid Apostacies from all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Reason; and among these, he
puts in, Persons that have relation to
Children, but * are <hi>without natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:</hi>
they are the Prodigies of the
World. Now this the Scripture takes
notice of, and makes it an Argument to
Divine Affection,<note place="margin">Ps. 103. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Like as a Father pitieth
his Children, so the Lord pitieth those that
<note place="margin">Isa. 49. 15.</note>fear him. Can a Woman forget her suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Child that she should not have Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the Son of her Womb? yea they may
forget; yet will not God forget.</hi> Here is a
Representation of this <hi>Disposition,</hi> and
<hi>Parent-like Affection,</hi> that never thinks of
making <hi>a Gain;</hi> doth not consider what
the cost will be: and tho' the Parent
hath emptied himself he expects <hi>no return.</hi>
But, if he sees his Child prosper, he
thinks <hi>that</hi> is the best <hi>return.</hi> And if the
Child be but ingenuous, and thankful;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56135:148"/>
the Parent looks upon it, as an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon him, to do more.</p>
                  <p>Again: It is <hi>the Benevolence of noble
Founders and Benefactors,</hi> who live not to
know the Objects of their Charity; but
provide against future Misery; as suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>that</hi> may prove to be true, that is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 12. <hi>The Love of many shall
wax cold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again: It is <hi>the Benignity of Princes
and Potentates,</hi> high in the World; whose
worldly Advantages put them above all
Possibility of <hi>Recompense, Retribution,</hi> or
<hi>Retaliation.</hi> There can be nothing but
Acknowledgment; yet out of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness,
they do Good, and gratify. This
is expressed by the Speech of <hi>Mephibosheth</hi>
with <hi>David.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 9. 8.</note>—Now <hi>this</hi> is, as the Sun's
Influence upon these lower Bodies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Motive, or interchangeable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 45.</note>
                     <hi>He maketh his Sun to shine
on the Evil, and on the Good.</hi> The Sun
shines indifferently upon places ill affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as well as upon profitable and good
Grounds: and there is no Reflection that
can reach the Sun. <hi>This</hi> is, as the Clouds
of Heaven dropping upon dry and
parched Earth, which doth no more but
open her Mouth, and receive in, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
Drops from Heaven; and, at a
distance of time, is dry and thirsty, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and expects the like again. Here
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56135:149"/>
is <hi>high Gratification!</hi> The Effects of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
<hi>Goodness,</hi> and great <hi>Benevolence!</hi>
and, no reciprocal return: no interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Communication. The Sun that shined
<hi>Yesterday,</hi> shines again <hi>To-day:</hi> The Earth
that was refreshed <hi>Yesterday,</hi> it calls for
more <hi>To-day:</hi> and no return at all.</p>
                  <p>Further: This is <hi>the good Centurion,</hi>
building the Jews a Synagogue. A very
strange work, indeed, for one that was a
Roman Governour imposed upon them;
and * <hi>when</hi> they look'd upon themselves as
enslaved by * <hi>the Romans;</hi> and * <hi>that</hi> it
was the Expectation of the Jews, from
their Messias, to be deliver'd from the
Roman Tyranny. <hi>He loveth our Nation
and hath built us a Synagogue.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 7. 5.</note> Here was a
lovely Action.</p>
                  <p>It was the Compassion of <hi>the good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 10. 33.</note>
who set himself compleatly to
relieve the wounded Person. For, he
himself stays his Journey, takes care the
Person may be convey'd to a convenient
place, engageth his own Estate and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
when as, a <hi>Levite</hi> and a <hi>Priest</hi> pass
by, and neglect him. Whereas, this <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi>
and <hi>Priest</hi> were, by their Station, and
Profession, bound to Benignity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion:
<hi>They</hi> fail, and pass by a Person
in Misery, unconcern'd: and, this <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi>
who might have excused himself,
by a National Antipathy; he takes care of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56135:149"/>
him, sees him convey'd to a convenient
place, and engageth his own Estate and
Credit.</p>
                  <p>To proceed. It is <hi>the Love and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of</hi> Jonathan <hi>to</hi> David. And that
Affection was transcendent <hi>to the Love of
the female Sex;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 1. 26.</note> who are eminent in two
Noble Perfections, Modesty and Loving
Affection; yet their Love is surpassing
the Love of Women. For, though <hi>David</hi>
stood in his light; and, if he were not
taken away, <hi>Jonathan</hi> could never succeed
to the Crown; yet, nevertheless, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to his Friend <hi>David</hi> would not be
abated.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 20.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further: It is <hi>Uriah's</hi> Resolution.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 8. 11.</note>—
It is <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> generous Disposition.<note place="margin">Neh. 5. 14.</note>
—It is <hi>Joseph's</hi> Weeping over his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,<note place="margin">Gen. 50.</note>
and excusing their ill Fact.—It
is St. <hi>Stephen's</hi> parting with the World.<note place="margin">Acts 7. 60.</note>
                     <hi>Lord, lay not this Sin to their charge:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 24. 22.</note>
whereas, <hi>Zechariah</hi> dies with this in his
Mouth, <hi>The Lord look upon it, and require
it.</hi>—It is <hi>Moses's</hi> Sympathy with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
who, when he might have been
adopted. Heir to the Crown, <hi>chose rather
to suffer Affliction with the People of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 25.</note>
—It is <hi>that</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Scarcely for a righteous Man
will one dye; yet peradventure for a GOOD
Man, some would even dare to dye.</hi>—Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56135:150"/>
To superadd that great Example to all
the rest: <hi>The several Actions of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Life</hi> were LOVELY.<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>He took our
Infirmities, and bare our Sicknesses.</hi> And
<hi>this</hi> was <hi>lovely</hi> Condescention. But, then,
the Height of all, the Fulness of all, the
thing without parallel, that transcends all
the rest,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> was <hi>His laying down his Life for
his Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, have I given you a Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <hi>To forgive Injuries;</hi> and <hi>to lay aside all

                  <p>
                     <hi>To do Good for Evil.</hi>—Not one
Man of a hundred thinks he is bound to
it: For, no Humane Law requires it: and
it is generally thought to be just, <hi>to return

                     <hi>To have Patience invincible, in case of
Provocation.</hi>—For, <hi>this</hi> is commonly
alledged; and it is thought a good Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of a Man, if a Man have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress'd
never so much; <hi>that he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked.
Why did he provoke me?</hi> And
Men think this a sufficient Account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not to give way to Jealousie, Suspicion,
or evil Surmise,</hi> in Case of Doubtfulness,
or Uncertainty of another's Meaning, in
such or such an Action.—The Rule
of Policy, <hi>is,</hi> if any thing be doubtful,
always to suspect <hi>the worst:</hi> But it is the
Height of Religion, to imagine <hi>the best;</hi>
and to make a good Construction. It is
noble and generous to make a candid
Construction, where Words and Actions
incline to the contrary. For, this may
change the Quality of the Action, and
oblige the Party. And this is a noble Way
of <hi>overcoming</hi> a Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To overbear our Resentment of an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Action, by the Recollection of former
Acts of Kindness and Courtesie.</hi>—It is
<hi>extream,</hi> to make an old Friend, an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
for one Mistake, and Miscarriage.
But this is ordinary. For if <hi>once</hi> he fail;
if <hi>once</hi> he deny; then you account him
an Enemy, and account him false. And,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56135:151"/>
then, <hi>Never trust him that is false: Never
trust a false Friend:</hi> So, he is concluded.
This is hard Measure; for a Man to wipe
out the Sense of many antecedent Favours,
and various Expressions of Faithfulness;
because, through some Unhappiness, the
Person hath been mistaken, and hath done
an Injury in the Case. A Man should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think in this Case, that the Injury
<hi>now</hi> done, was occasional, and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
not intentional: Because of the
former good Offices. Many think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
disobliged, for abundance of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
because of <hi>one</hi> mistake of latter
date. Now, this is <hi>Lovely</hi> to let every
Man with whom we have to do, have this
Advantage: Let the Experience we have
had of his Fidelity and Faithfulness,
and many good Offices, be so minded, as
to overbear <hi>one</hi> Failing of latter Date.
Suppose it was an ill Office, a real Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
let him have the Advantage of all
his former * <hi>Acts of</hi> Friendship: And let
<hi>these</hi> be consider'd, to overbear the Sense
of his last Failure or Miscarriage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be meek, calm, and gentle, in the
Hands of fierce, furious and violent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
—In one way or other, all Men
are good for some Purpose. Now it is
highly <hi>Christian;</hi> yea, also, <hi>Prudent,</hi> in
Converse, to draw every one forth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:56135:151"/>
to his better part; and to help
him to bear that that is his Burden. For,
this is the Rule, <hi>Bear ye one anothers Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and so fulfil the Law of Christ.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 2.</note> It is
even Devilish, to provoke a passionate
Man. If you make Application to a
Man; at least, observe his Temper: If
he be under the Power of his Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he is not fit to be applied to; and
must be forborn, at that time. Therefore
observe to take him in his good Humour:
For <hi>he</hi> is burden'd by his Temper, and
Constitution; and <hi>thou</hi> art free.</p>
                  <p>To be of a pacifying, peace-making, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling

                  <p>
                     <hi>To be of a tender Disposition, ready to

This was a foul Miscarriage in <hi>Job's</hi>

                  <p>To be ready to hinder other Mens Sins,

—Now, in all Reason, these Things
should not over-bear us, over which we
have <hi>no Power.</hi> It is becoming the noble
Soul of Man, to be above the World;
loose to the World; and independant
on it: Not to be beholding to the World

A Man is not to seek himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <p>These <hi>Cases</hi> I have represented to you;
wherein, if you reach these Rules, and
comply with these Notions; you do
that that is truly <hi>Noble, Generous, Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
that</hi> that is <hi>in Resemblance and Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of God;</hi> and that doth tend to
advance the State of Human Affairs.—
And this is to do <hi>that</hi> that is LOVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>But you will say: If this be a Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
in what way is it attainable?—
Therefore I will <hi>propose</hi> something <hi>in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of God,</hi> between God and us (<hi>viz.</hi>)
a serious Consideration of what God
doth for the Universe. Consider the
Action of excellent Agents: And their
Action is the Way to affect our Minds. No
<hi>Force</hi> reacheth the Mind of Man. No
Man's Mind is changed, or better'd, but
by his own particular Consideration. If,
therefore, you will bring your selves to
this Temper, to do Things that are <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
in the first place, consider <hi>what God
is,</hi> and what his <hi>Actings</hi> and <hi>Dealings</hi>
                        <pb n="284" facs="tcp:56135:153"/>
with his Creatures, are. And, if we
propose to our selves what <hi>God</hi> doth in
the World, and how he carrieth it <hi>in his
Family;</hi> this Consideration will promote
in us, this Disposition and Temper. For,
<hi>He</hi> is the Universal Father. It is <hi>He</hi> whose
Family <hi>the whole World</hi> is. It is <hi>He</hi> that
doth maintain the Universe; and doth
settle and establish the Order, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Things. And certainly we
cannot write after a better Copy. It is
the Definition of Religion in us, <hi>Divine
Imitation.</hi> Godliness is <hi>God-likeness.</hi> Now,
see what God doth. He is universally
Good: <hi>He maketh the Sun to shine,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Difference or Distinction, on the
<hi>Righteous,</hi> and the <hi>Unrighteous.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 45.</note> He <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his Rain to fall upon the Just and the
Unjust.</hi> He <hi>giveth us Rain from Heaven,
and fruitful Seasons.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 14. 17.</note> Wherefore, to have
God in our sight; and to have right Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of him, and a Sense of his
Love and Goodness; <hi>this,</hi> above all
Things, tends to the Nobleness, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude,
Freedom and Liberty of our
Spirits.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, I <hi>propose</hi> something <hi>in respect
of our selves:</hi> That is: Be not <hi>in a worldly
Spirit:</hi> Be not in love with bodily Ease:
Give not your selves up to the Pleasures
of Sense: Be not eagerly bent upon
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56135:153"/>
Gain: But, be loose to it. For, this you
may observe; Sensuality and Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
do narrow the Soul, and limit
and confine its Reaches, and Desires:
For, <hi>Sensuality</hi> marrs the Understanding:
And he that hath mean <hi>Thoughts,</hi> hath
but poor <hi>Performances.</hi> And <hi>Covetousness</hi>
doth contract to a little and very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
point: So that there can be no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in any large Sphere of Action. God,
and Religion, and the Concernments
thereof, are nothing, where either a sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish
Spirit hath place; or a covetous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
reigns. <hi>That Rule</hi> that is common,
<hi>Every Man for himself; and God for us all:</hi>
It is the Effect of the lowest, the shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
the meanest, sorriest Spirit that is in
the whole Creation of God: And that
Frame and Temper of Mind, doth make
a Man uncapable of Self-enjoyment.—
In all Competition of Actions or Objects;
Man shou'd always prefer <hi>that</hi> that will
do him Good, and bring him to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
according to his <hi>inward Man.</hi> For
a Man is more by his <hi>Soul,</hi> Ten thousand
times, than he is, by his <hi>Body.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Thirdly, I <hi>propose</hi> something <hi>in respect
of others.</hi> Suspect no Body, before-hand;
till you have Ground and Cause from
some Experience. Take up, against no
Body, upon bare report. <hi>Impute</hi> no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56135:154"/>
to any, of whom you do not <hi>know</hi>
some. And, further: Make fair Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
in an honest Cause, to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
therein concern'd; with a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and Expectation, that he will do
what is fit: And let him perceive your
good Opinion of him. If any thing in
the World engage a Man; this pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Opinion, and right Supposition,
will * <hi>engage, and</hi> oblige him. But, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the seasonable Time of Speaking:
And allow to every Man for his Pre-pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session;
for his Anticipation, Pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and his Temper. This is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Prudence, and honest Policy: And
this will gain Advantage, and increase
Good-will: And I dare say, both Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Religion will allow <hi>this Respect
of Persons.</hi> There is another kind of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Persons,</hi> which we disallow:
But <hi>this Respect of Persons</hi> there is good
Cause for; and it may be used. It is a
great Piece of Prudence, to apply hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
to Men; and to avoid the <hi>darker
Part</hi> of Men; and take them at the best:
And, some are very good at it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These</hi> are the <hi>Proposals</hi> I make, which
tend to the enlarging a Man's Soul, and
amplifying him, and qualifying him, to
be an Instrument to advance and promote
the Good of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:56135:154"/>* <hi>Lastly,</hi> This is a Challenge to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Guise of this World; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
Practice that is in it. <hi>Do we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
our selves to be Christians?—Do we
do LOVELY Things?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How is the World apostatized from
the Divine Nature; and degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Devilish Nature? For, commonly,
our Parts are employed, and our Time
spent, in studying and contriving Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
one against another. In the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
God made the <hi>Second</hi> in order to
the <hi>First.</hi> And, if we answer the Order
of our Creation; we shou'd be so much
the more provided for, by how many
more there are in the World. It should
be; one Man <hi>a God</hi> to another: But, we,
through our Degeneracy, make it to be;
every Man <hi>a Wolf</hi> to another. For, we
see Men glory in their Cunning, and their
Craft: And a cunning and crafty Man,
he is called a wise Man: But <hi>This</hi> is no
true Wisdom.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever Things are of GOOD RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PORT.</p>
                  <p>Things may be of <hi>good Report</hi> two
Ways. There are <hi>Majora, Insigniora Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra:</hi>
The greater, the higher, more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56135:155"/>
famous <hi>Rights.</hi> And there are
<hi>Minutiora, Leviora:</hi> The lesser, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and obscurer <hi>Rights.</hi> And, there
is difference between these <hi>two,</hi> both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Matter, and of the Evidence.
<hi>The former</hi> need no external Report, no
foreign Determination; they are above
it: <hi>Loquuntur Res:</hi> The Things speak
themselves: And the Voice and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Things is more certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
then Sense of Persons liable to
Prejudice; who may be incompetent to
make Report; through Impotency, or
Partiality: But <hi>the Voice of Things</hi> is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
constant, and what cannot be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
upon. All Men acknowledge Piety,
Devotion towards God; Justice, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
amongst Men; Sobriety, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
as every Man's Measure, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to his Health, conservative of his
Life. And, we may take <hi>that</hi> to be the
Sense of Human Nature, wherein all Men
agree. <hi>Who</hi> commends not <hi>Modesty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Impudency? <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> before
Treachery? <hi>Charity,</hi> before selfishness?
<hi>Mercifulness,</hi> before Cruelty? <hi>Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
before Insolency and Usurpation?
<hi>Sobriety,</hi> before Intemperance? <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Good-will,</hi> before Malice and Envy?</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Latter Rights:</hi> In <hi>these</hi> the
Reason of the Thing is less evident, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:56135:155"/>
the Right of the Case * <hi>is</hi> of more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
and uncertain Determination;
because of Change, or Variety of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
                  <p>There is some what a different account in
this Case, in respect of the Liberty of the
interior Man, <hi>in Foro interno</hi> (as we speak)
and of the exterior Man, <hi>in foro externo.</hi>
In <hi>the former,</hi> no Creature hath Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance;
therefore doth not intermeddle.
As concerning the Acts of <hi>the external</hi>
Man; not only the Sense of one's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Judgment is to be taken into Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
but, in the Use of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
a just Regard is to be had to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
to Government, and Authority;
to the Sense of other People; to the
maintaining of Charity: For <hi>Universal
Charity</hi> is a Thing <hi>final</hi> in Religion.
Wherefore, the maintaining and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Love and Good-will, Order, and
Peace, are to be preferr'd before the Use
of <hi>Externals</hi> in particular Cases. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
Humility, Meekness, Charity, and
such Vertues, do sanctifie by their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and Operations: Which cannot be

the <hi>Instrumental part</hi> of Religion; as
<hi>Prayer, Hearing of Sermons, Receiving the

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis a Thing very desirable, to have
the World be as smooth and calm, as
quiet and tolerable, as may be. Offences
amongst Men are apt enough to arise.
Where we cannot yield <hi>internal Assent,</hi>
for want of Evidence, and assurance in

                  <p>If there be any VERTUE.</p>
                  <p>Can any thing come after so many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
* <hi>after so many</hi> Universals, such
transcendent Accomplishments? <hi>this</hi> shou'd
seem needless: For, what can be more,
or further? * <hi>But</hi> the Apostle doth not
say * <hi>here</hi> that there is any thing <hi>beyond;</hi>
any thing <hi>distinct;</hi> any thing <hi>further</hi> to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56135:157"/>
be added to what he had said before. It
is not positive: For, it is but <hi>if any Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</hi>
He seems to suppose he might not
think of all: But intimates, that * <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
were wanting,</hi> he wou'd add <hi>that</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
if it did occur; and leaves us to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Defect, by Parity of Reason. His
Mind is, that a Christian shou'd be very

contrary to Vice and Wickedness.</hi> This is,
also, the Theological Sense; and so is
used by another Apostle twice. * <hi>But</hi>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> never uses this Word but in this
place:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 3. and ver. 5.</note> Tho' he oft insists on all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Graces; and Fruits of the Divine
Spirit: All which are Vertues as * <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd</hi>
in us; and * <hi>are call'd</hi> Graces as
from God. To guess, therefore, at what
the Apostle may mean, here. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
in these Particulars. In the Skill
of several Mysteries, of Arts and Sciences,
of Tongues and Languages, of Trades
and Professions; in the Use of Gifts,
whether <hi>ordinary,</hi> and acquired by our
own Industry, and Study; or <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi>
as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. &amp;c. These are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Ways in which Human Nature may
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56135:158"/>
be perfected; and in which, it may be
employed. The Apostle * <hi>therefore</hi> would
not have Christians wanting * <hi>in any
thing;</hi> or think any piece of Morality
below them; be it as low as * <hi>meerly</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
Affability, Courtesie.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle may be understood to
have respect to the Peculiarities of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
* <hi>There is</hi> that <hi>which is peculiar to
each Sex.</hi> The proper Excellence of <hi>one</hi>
Sex, is Modesty, and loving Affection:
The proper Excellence of <hi>the other</hi> Sex,
is Judgment of the Reason of Things;
Courage, and Resolution. Some People,
besides their general Goodness, Integrity,
and Uprightness, as honest Men, and good
Christians; are singularly good and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in some particular Way, and to some
special Purpose. Some are dexterous to
put off an Abuse by innocent Wit, and
so prevent falling out. Some are dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to put another out of a Fit of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
without either speaking Untruth,
or Hurt to the Person who was the Cause
of the Provocation. (Thus <hi>Abigal,</hi> 1 Sam.
25.) Some, to put by ill Counsel, and so
to prevent Mischief (as <hi>Hushai,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.)
some, to prevent Mistakes * <hi>in Conversation;</hi>
having Wit at Hand, for better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
than the Person concern'd was
ready to make. Some are good at Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making;
excellent Arbitrators, Referrees;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:56135:158"/>
ingenious at finding out Tempers and
Terms of Accommodation. Some are
very good Company; * <hi>able</hi> to relieve,
and recreate oppress'd drooping Spirits.
Some can handsomely bring another off,
when unhappily engaged.— <hi>These</hi> are
good Effects of Nimbleness of Wit, and
Quickness of Apprehension; which are
oft found to prevent Mischief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These</hi> several distinct Excellencies, and
Perfections, are the Ornaments and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of Human Nature; and not
<hi>all</hi> usually meeting in the same Person:
But divided, and dispersed, amongst Men.
<hi>They</hi> are so many <hi>Rays</hi> and <hi>Beams</hi> of the
Infiniteness of the Divine Knowledge,
and Wisdom; the Flourishes of God's
liberal and bountiful Creation. <hi>These,</hi>
also, recommend us one to another, as
needing each other in several Ways, and
to different Purposes. * <hi>For,</hi> by a joint
Contribution of our several divided Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
we make <hi>one Body compleat.</hi>
Whereas an <hi>Absoluteness</hi> and <hi>Self-sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
is not found in any Particular.</p>
                  <p>I conclude. <hi>What</hi> is useful, grateful,
beneficial; tho' we cannot say it falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
particular Command, is here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to us, under the Name of VER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUE.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:56135:159"/>If there be any PRAISE.</p>
                  <p>PRAISE is a Note of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and a
Piece of its Reward. It follows Vertue;
as Shadow, a Body. It accompanies
worthy Action; and is an Incentive and
Spur to it. 'Tis true, Vertue <hi>is in our
Power,</hi> praise <hi>not:</hi> But, <hi>that * Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which is from Persons not competent,
and who are themselves, unworthy; <hi>that</hi>
which follows not good Action, is not
<hi>Praise</hi> or <hi>Honour.</hi> Truth is great: It may
be oppress'd a while; but will at last pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
When Men are incompetent to
judge, through their Insufficiency; or
are engaged in an evil Way; we are,
<hi>then,</hi> to approve our selves <hi>to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;</hi>
not their <hi>Humours, Wills, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi>
But where Men judge according
to the Rule of Right; their Sense is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable;
and their Commendation va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.
* <hi>Now,</hi> he that is prais'd for
something worthy, useful, or taking with
Men, hath Acceptance, is attended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Expectation; and may make
good Advantage of this. Whereas, if he
be not regarded, nor consider'd; he will
have no Opportunity to do Men good.
And where Men are forestall'd, prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd,
prejudiced, a Man loses his Labour
with them. Wherefore, Men do well to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56135:159"/>
stand upon their Credit: and this, for
their own better Security * <hi>in Vertue; as
well as</hi> for their further Advantage to do
others Good. He that despises <hi>Shame</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spises
<hi>Sin;</hi> cares not what he does; will
do any thing. 'Tis a sharp Reproof, a
pungent Argument, in few words; <hi>Are
you not ashamed?</hi> Upon this account it is
preservative, soveraign, and very condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
to the Safety of Persons in * <hi>a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
way;</hi> that Men of Place and Worth,
either declare a good Opinion; or, at
least, good Hopes and Expectations of
those within their Government. It tends
to engage, and encourage to Proficiency
in <hi>Vertue.</hi> If a Man have lost his Credit;
he will grow desperate. 'Tis an irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Evil, to take away another's Fame.
'Tis to take away his <hi>second Security</hi>
to Goodness; * <hi>as</hi> Conscience is * <hi>his</hi>
first.</p>
                  <p>Commendation, * <hi>therefore,</hi> is of use,
both to encourage Good-behaviour; and
further settle the Well-resolved. And,
he who hath the advantage of Repute, and
Credit, may more easily perswade to ways
of Goodness, and Sobriety. Wherefore, if
the good Word of others may be gain'd,
upon Terms of Truth and Righteousness:
It is a very good purchase; as tending to
our own better Security and Settlement
in Vertue; and to the enabling us to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:56135:160"/>
deal effectually with others, for their
Good.</p>
                  <p>Think these things REASONABLE.</p>
                  <p>So it is in the Original <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.
<hi>Apply to them the Reason of your
own Minds. In the Use of your Reason,
Mind, and Understanding; in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of your Natural Faculties, charge your
self with these things.</hi> It is not barely,
<hi>have them in your Thoughts:</hi> but, <hi>in the
use of your Reason, recommend all these
things to your self.</hi> Think that you do
not acquit your self; that you do not
that that becomes you; that you do not
raise a connatural Superstructure to the
Foundation of Nature; if you do not, in
the Reason of your Mind, think all these
things worthy of you. This is the Sense
of the words.—Religion exercises,
teaches, satisfies <hi>that</hi> which is the Height
and Excellency of our Nature. <hi>Our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
is not <hi>confounded</hi> by our Religion;
but <hi>awaken'd, excited, employ'd, directed,</hi>
and <hi>improved.</hi> For, this is the Faculty,
whereby we are capable of God; appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of him, receptive from him;
whereby we can make Acknowledgments
to him; make Returns upon him. The
first Operation of Religion is <hi>Mental</hi> and
<hi>Intellectual.</hi> They begin at the wrong
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:56135:160"/>
end, who set not themselves <hi>here</hi> first to
work; so are not likely to bring any thing
to Perfection. For, the Mind's Resolution
and Satisfaction, is <hi>first</hi> and <hi>principal.</hi> If
we leap over this; we shall be ever after
lame in our way. Credulity is but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency.<note place="margin">Pro. 14. 15.</note>
                     <hi>The Simple believeth every word:</hi>
but, the prudent Man looks well to what
he admits. Man is not well settled, or
confirm'd in his Religion, until his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
become <hi>the Reason of his Mind.</hi> 'Tis
Lowness, and Imperfection in Religion,
to <hi>drudge</hi> therein; to take up Duties, as
<hi>Burdens;</hi> to do them as Tasks, barely to
satisfie Conscience, that Conscience may
not trouble, vex, condemn. <hi>They</hi> who are
come to any growth in Religion, are <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirited</hi>
in it; act with <hi>inward Satisfaction,
Pleasure, Content.</hi> They understand it is
<hi>for our Good;</hi> desireable <hi>of it self;</hi> and
therefore, act with Delight. Religion, till
<hi>then,</hi> is not <hi>our own;</hi> is not settled in the
Subject; is not secured: till <hi>then,</hi> Men
will not be friendly to it; will not make
it their Adoption, or <hi>Choice:</hi> but rather
look upon it as their Exacter, Controuler
of Liberty and Will, * <hi>and look upon</hi> God
* <hi>as an</hi> Egyptian Task-Master. They will
carry it as a Burden, which they wou'd
throw off; if they might have their Minds.
* <hi>But,</hi> I dare undertake to shew, that all
true Reason is for Religion; and nothing
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56135:161"/>
of Truth against it. Religion doth us the
greatest Service and Courtesie. To our
Minds it does Good <hi>directly and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately:</hi>
to our Bodies, by the good <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents</hi>
on the Mind's Government. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
us, in case of the greatest inward
Evils (Guiltiness, Malignity, Rancour,
Malice) which, if not removed, we must
be most miserable: and, it possesses us of
truest inward Good. In this Sense, is
<hi>that</hi> verified, which <hi>Solomon</hi> says of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,<note place="margin">Prov. 3. 17.</note>
                     <hi>Her ways are ways of Pleasantness:

we are rid and discharg'd of, by this Act of

Quality of <hi>Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SIN, as it reflects upon God, is an Act
either of Neglect, or Contempt. And how
shall we answer it, if we be guilty upon
either account? if either we neglect our
bounden Duty, or cast Contempt and
Scorn upon our Sovereign? by whose
Power, we are raised out of nothing, into
Being; at whose Pleasure, we are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:56135:162"/>
in Being; and at whose Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we shall go out of these Beings that
now we have: and it will not be in our
Power to withhold our Souls from him,
one moment, tho' the State and Welfare
of them to all Eternity, did depend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                  <p>Let us also consider, what SIN is <hi>in it
self.</hi> It is a Violation of the Rule of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
the Law of Heaven; from which
God himself, (who is cloathed with Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency,
in whom is the Fulness of
Power and Liberty) never did vary, from
Eternity; nor will, to Eternity: for, <hi>the
Throne of God is established in Righteousness.</hi>
What, then, do we think it is for <hi>us,</hi> sorry
Creatures, to take upon us, to controul the
immutable and unalterable Law of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Righteousness, Goodness, and
Truth, upon which the Universe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends?</p>
                  <p>Then again SIN, in respect of By-stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
is a thing of very bad consequence,
and of ill Influence; because of the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of <hi>Example.</hi> For, we are more
apt to follow Example, than to live by
Rule: and nothing is more frequent, than
for Men to pretend Use, Custom, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
even against an establish'd Law: and
we justifie our selves, as we think, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as others do; and that we are not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56135:162"/>
and alone in what we say and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
                  <p>That which we call <hi>Moral Evil,</hi> is a
thing of the greatest Ugliness and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in the World. The Filthiness of
<hi>Sin</hi> is express'd in Scripture under the
names of those things that are of the
greatest Loathsomeness and Deformity.
Nothing is so bad as <hi>Moral Depravation.</hi>
Corruption, Rotteness, and Putrefaction

                     </gap>n <hi>Naturals,</hi> even to Stench and Nauseous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
is not so bad as the Exorbitance and
Degeneracy of <hi>an Intelligent Agent,</hi> out of
the Course of Vertue, and Honesty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Intelligent Agents</hi> act in a higher or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
than <hi>Naturals:</hi> for, in <hi>these,</hi> it is only
a Tendency to Dissolution, and <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entity;</hi>
and so it is a <hi>Negative</hi> Evil. But
all the Departures from Right Reason, are
<hi>privatively</hi> Evil.</p>
                  <p>Now, of what <hi>great</hi> Consequence must
this be to us, to be discharg'd of a thing,
of so much Malignity in the Agent? a
thing which carries so much Insolence,
Arrogance, Presumption, Self-assuming,
and Confidence; lifting up our selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
what we ought; which not only in
its own Nature and Quality, is a <hi>Privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
but a <hi>Pollution;</hi> a thing that makes
Havock, and brings all into Confusion;
turns all upside down, and puts every
thing out of order; so that no Man can
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:56135:163"/>
tell what will be next. Nor * indeed
can * <hi>any one</hi> think what that Man will
dare to do, that durst vary from <hi>Right.</hi>
For, by the same Authority that any Man
varies from Right in any <hi>one</hi> Instance, he
may in <hi>all.</hi> It is <hi>Innocency</hi> that is our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection:
and he that disrobes himself of
<hi>that,</hi> opens the way to all manner of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, SIN, in its consequence, is
<hi>Punishment. For, the Wages of Sin is
Death.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 33.</note> And, as <hi>Life</hi> comprehends Health
and Strength, with all Happiness; so <hi>Death</hi>
is perfectly contrary.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore a Matter of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
for * <hi>one</hi> of a considerative Mind,
and an awaken'd Conscience, to be able
to satisfie himself in this Matter; and to
know how he may come off from the
Guilt of his Sin, and the Punishment due
thereunto. And, I shall do you very good
Service, if I can propose to you such
Grounds and Principles as may satisfie
your Minds, in the Belief of God's <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>great Revelation</hi> that we have from
Heaven, is, above all things, satisfactory
to the Reason of our Minds, in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:

suffer'd, in his Undertaking for us, as a

very valuable Consideration for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

these Considerations and Arguments:</p>

Sin to Penitents. * <hi>And,</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>(5.) That the Evil of Punishment hath

                  <list>
                     <item>1<hi>st. From the Quality of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
GOODNESS. It is the very <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the Divine Nature. Now, Acts that
flow from <hi>Nature</hi> have two Advantages;
They are very <hi>easie and pleasant;</hi> They
are most <hi>sure and certain:</hi> For, Nature
fails not; Nature is uniform, regular,
and constant. What Nature doth, is
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:56135:164"/>
without resistance; against all Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
* <hi>It</hi> goes on readily in its course;
and doth not waste and spend it self, as
other Agents do. A Person of GOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATURE
doth <hi>Courtesies</hi> and <hi>Kindnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
with as much Freedom and Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as an <hi>Ill-natur'd Person</hi> doth <hi>Injuries.</hi>
And, by this, we may be assur'd that <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
is the Excellency of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
because all other Perfections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Divine,</hi> as they are in conjunction
with Goodness. Take away <hi>Goodness</hi>
and nothing is a Divine Perfection: For,
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wit</hi> are in the Diabolical
State, as well as other-where: and we
are apt to fear <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Power:</hi> but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there is <hi>Goodness,</hi> we have Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from it. It is not safe for Wit and
Power to be <hi>alone.</hi> Our Safety and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
is in Goodness: and it is much for
our advantage that <hi>all</hi> Divine Perfections
are in conjunction with Goodness.—Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any that had the Notion of a God,
doubted of his <hi>Omnipotency</hi> and <hi>All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency:</hi>
but, the great Question is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his WILL: For, <hi>here,</hi> our Hearts
are apt to misgive us. He, being perfectly
free, is subject to no restraint: If he hath
but a Mind to fail us; we give him cause
enough to do it; and hence arise our
Doubts. Now, to satisfie you in this;
I say, * <hi>that</hi> where there is all Perfection
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:56135:164"/>
in a Conjunction; there is no place at all
for any Uncertainty, Inconstancy, Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.
Resolution, and Performance, in
such Agents, always go along with the
Reason of Things. So that if the Reason
of Things be steady; these Agents are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
steady. For, <hi>Liberty,</hi> as a Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is quite another thing from being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious,
or lawless. <hi>He</hi> is least of all
FREE, nay he is the veryest <hi>Slave</hi> in the
World, that hath either <hi>Will</hi> or POWER
to be licentious, or exorbitant, or to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
from <hi>the Law of Right.</hi> An Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and Voluntary Agent, in his right
Constitution, does things in due and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Circumstances, as <hi>certainly,</hi> and
<hi>constantly,</hi> as any Natural Agent; and
doth as surely produce noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Effects, as any Natural Cause doth
produce Effects that are Natural. So that
notwithstanding the Fulness of Liberty
in God; and notwithstanding his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency;
yet, you are surer of him, in all
Cases of Righteousness, and Equity, than
of the Effect of any Natural Cause: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Way of Liberty</hi> in an intelligent
Agent, is a higher <hi>Way</hi> of Action, and
Motion, than the <hi>Way</hi> of Nature; * <hi>any
where besides,</hi> where there is a Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Effect. For, you are not to
think, that because you are <hi>Free;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you may act <hi>Irregularly,</hi> or <hi>Arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:56135:165"/>
You see, inferiour Nature is <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,</hi>
and never is found out of its
course: and it is to be expected, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Agents do not vary from the
Rule of Right. Nay, it will be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of them, if they do. For,
<hi>Liberty</hi> is not a Deformity, but <hi>a Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
And, a higher Agent should be as
true to its Principle, as any natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
which the Philosopher tells us is
always <hi>determin'd:</hi> for, if it were not so,
the way of <hi>voluntary Motion</hi> would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to <hi>natural Motion,</hi> which is more
imperfect; and, the higher Creation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with Liberty and Intelligence, would
be Principles of Imperfection and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
—This is the <hi>first</hi> Argument. And
this is a solid Foundation. What is <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
is <hi>Certain.</hi> What is done <hi>Naturally,</hi>
is done <hi>Easily.</hi> If God do Good <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally;</hi>
he doth it <hi>easily:</hi> for, who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that God should go against his own
Nature?</item>
                     <item>2<hi>dly.</hi> Add to this, <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi>
and you have double Security. And, for
this, you have several Texts of Scripture:
<hi>God so loved the World,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">John 3. 16.</note> From which
place, I would have you to take notice of
our Saviour's <hi>Merit;</hi> yet, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
did not merit, or by his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>procure</hi> his own Sending; but, <hi>this</hi>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:56135:165"/>
was wholly from the Love and Goodness
of the Father. Our Recovery began at
<hi>God</hi> himself: Our Saviour was not the
first Moving Cause: but, rather, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
Cause. Like to this, is <hi>that</hi> which
you read, <hi>GOD hath raised up for us a
Prince, and a Saviour.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 5. 31.</note>—We read al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that <hi>God was in Christ,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 19.</note> reconciling the
World unto himself; not imputing Trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi>
and,<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>by him we have access to God
with all Freedom:</hi> So that we may accuse
our selves before God, and not favour
our selves, (as Malefactors use to do; to
make the best of a bad Cause;) but, we
have such a Merciful Intercessour, and so
Gracious a Judge; that a Sinner may ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
his Cause before the Judge; and
fare never the worse. So that who-ever
he be, whose Heart fails him to go to
God; he doth not read these Gospel-Texts;
but is rather conversant with what
is said of the wicked Angels,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 4. Jude 6.</note> 
                        <hi>that God had
reserved them in Chains of Darkness,</hi> &amp;c.
—Now, I desire that you would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join
with the Quality of God's Nature,
<hi>that</hi> which God hath declar'd as the Result
of his Will: and can you have better As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance?
The <hi>former</hi> is a fixt Principle in
God: The <hi>latter</hi> is his Choice, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
and that wherein he hath freely
engag'd himself. And it is to do God
Right, to build upon his Promise, as good
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:56135:166"/>
Security; to think that God, of his own
Nature, is placable and reconcileable,
and, then, to think that he will pardon
Sin, upon the Terms that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
because that he hath promised so
to do.</item>
                     <item>3<hi>dly.</hi> Tho' stronger Arguments than
<hi>these two</hi> cannot be brought; yet, because
there is a further Confirmation in a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Witnesses; I superadd an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
of <hi>those Impressions of Goodness,
and Kindness, that God hath stampt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole CREATION.</hi> And <hi>there</hi> we
shall find this; that every thing maintains
its own Off-spring, and endeavours to
bring it to good, (according to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Natures * <hi>of every kind:) and</hi> if <hi>it</hi> be
capable; it bears its * <hi>Off-spring</hi> Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Even the stupid Earth that we tread
upon, maintains the Grass, and all that
grows upon it. According as things are
capable, they do express themselves; by
Communication, and careful making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for their young ones; and by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration,
in case of Misery. The most
furious Creatures will expose themselves
to Harm, for the Security of their Young.
This we observe, that all Originals to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
throughout the whole Creation, have
a lasting and continued respect to their
Off-spring; and <hi>from their own Goodness,</hi>
                        <pb n="311" facs="tcp:56135:166"/>
they comply with the Necessity of the
Case; and help and relieve, if they can.
Parents do so, to their Children: and
this is found in all inferiour Nature. Now
<hi>Humane Nature,</hi> if it be right, and be not
abus'd, is, above all other Natures below
it, most Tender and Compassionate. And,
<hi>this</hi> is the Security that all of us had, for
our Lives. For, we were all born in a
weaker Estate and Condition than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Creatures: but, coming into the
hands of Reason, and loving Affection;
no Creature is better provided for.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This that I have observ'd to you, is so
true; that * <hi>for this,</hi> you may survey the
whole Creation. It is a Truth so general
and universal, that I find but one Instance
to the contrary; and that is, where it is
said of <hi>the Ostrich,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 39. 14.</note> that <hi>she lays her Eggs in
the Sand, not considering that the Foot may
crush them;</hi> and that <hi>she hardeneth her self
against her young ones; as if they were not
hers.</hi> Now, we are wont to say; that,
where there is one Exception, the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
holds in all other things, that are
not excepted. Yet, see what may be said
to this very Instance that is excepted. She
seems to take some care of her Eggs, and to
make some Provision for her Young ones;
in that, first, she lays her Eggs in the Sand,
* <hi>that</hi> by means of the Heat thereof they
may be hatch'd; and then, she covers
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56135:167"/>
them there; so that if they meet with any
Disaster, it shall be by accident. But, if
any thing yet be wanting, see the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that God himself gives of it: 'Tis
<hi>for want of Understanding.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ver. 17.</note> If she knew
better, she would do better.</p>
                  <p>Now, whatever Perfection is found in
any Creature, it is <hi>primarily,</hi> and <hi>original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
in GOD: other where, it is <hi>by Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
and <hi>Participation;</hi> but it is in God,
as in a Fountain: nay, that which is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and confin'd, here below; is, <hi>in
God,</hi> Primarily, Originally, and Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially.
—We all commend the merciful
and compassionate Disposition, above the
cruel and malicious. And shall we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<hi>that</hi> to God, which we condemn in
any Creature?</p>
                  <p>But then, 4<hi>thly, 'Tis a thing worthy of
God.</hi>—We may well think that God
takes more pleasure in <hi>Pardoning</hi> Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
than in <hi>Punishing</hi> obstinate Sinners.
The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> says, <hi>Judgment is
God's Work:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 28. 21.</note> but then he says, <hi>it is his
strange Work:</hi> it is <hi>that</hi> in which he takes
little Pleasure and Delight.<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 33.</note> For, <hi>he doth
not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children
of Men.</hi> God's Prerogative to pardon
(if it be lawful to put these things in
comparison) is rather more, than there is
Power and Right to punish: and it is
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:56135:167"/>
more effectual, and more to the Purpose
of God's Honour and Glory. For, when
he pardons, he procures himself Love,
and gains the Heart and Soul of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but, if he punish, the Party en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
because God is stronger, and he
cannot make resistance. But, where God
pardons, the Creature is overcome; the
Heart is melted; he deprecates, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
and thinks himself for ever engag'd
to God.</p>
                  <p>This I observe, that Natures of any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
take far greater Delight in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Opportunities to shew Favours, and
to do Kindnesses; than in having Power
to punish. There are very few Persons
that take pleasure in being Executioners
of the Laws that are Penal: which makes
the Office of an Informer so odious. The
best of Men take delight to gratifie, and to
shew Kindness.</p>
                  <p>In this case, therefore, <hi>this</hi> I will say;
If God do punish Sin, he doth that which
is just: but nevertheless, God is not, by
any Attribute of his, under a necessity to
punish Sin, if the Sinner repent, depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
his just Offence and Displeasure, and
return to his Duty. God doth that which
is just, if he punish Sin: but then I dare
not say that <hi>'tis just</hi> that God <hi>should</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
or that he were unjust <hi>if he should
not do it.</hi> This, for certain we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56135:168"/>
concerning God; that he doth act
in a way of the highest Reason, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and fullest Correspondance
with the Right of the Case. Now, a true
Penitent is capable of Pardon: and, if he
fall into a merciful hand, he may receive
Mercy. No Man thinks that he who hath
right to punish, is always bound to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.
This we hold universally, that to
all Supremacy of Power, there is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
a Prerogative of Pardon: therefore
this is inseparable from the Majesty of
Heaven, who is Omnipotent.</p>
                  <p>But then, 5<hi>thly, to inflict Evil hath only
in it the Notion of a Remedy; the place of
a MEAN, not of an END.</hi> Now, we
know, that no more of <hi>a Mean</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd,
than what is necessary for <hi>the End.</hi>
This is that which makes a <hi>Mean</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<hi>the Relation it has unto the End.</hi> A
Medicine may be bitter, and costly. No
Man takes Physick, for Physick's sake; but
in order to his Health. In a <hi>Mean,</hi> we
only look how far it is available to the
End. God, therefore, inflicts Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as a means to obtain an End that is
better. Therefore, sometimes he brings
a small Evil, to prevent a greater; and a
present, to prevent a future; and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in time, to prevent suffering hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and a harder Condition in this
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:56135:168"/>
World, which is but for a while; that our
Condition may be better secur'd in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
World.</p>
                  <p>The Divine Goodness doth aim at <hi>two</hi>
things, in Punishments; the <hi>Reformation</hi>
of the Offender, and the <hi>Information</hi> of
the By-stander. And those that are in
Authority among us, inflict Punishment,
not as an <hi>End</hi> of their own Invention;
not for <hi>Revenge</hi> upon the Party: * as we
observe even * <hi>as to</hi> those who are guilty of
the greatest Crimes, as <hi>Murderers,</hi> and
<hi>Highway-Men;</hi> who must of necessity be
condemn'd for the Publick Safety, and
Defence of the Law: Yet, how much
Clemency do they shew towards them?
and what Pains do they take, that their
Souls may be saved, and their Bodily Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
prove Sanatory to their Souls? So
that <hi>Punishment</hi> is for doing Good to the
Offender, and to the By-stander; that
<hi>they</hi> seeing the Evil that Sin brings upon
Men, may be better inform'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I take it for granted, that where
there is Wisdom and Goodness in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
all Punishment is <hi>for Instruction,
Reformation, and bettering of the Offender;</hi>
or <hi>for Example to By-standers.</hi> And, I
cannot tell what is Good in Punishment,
but these two. So that <hi>Punishment</hi> hath
the place <hi>of a Mean,</hi> not <hi>of an End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:56135:169"/>
A Creature must not contradict the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will; and avow it as its Priviledge,
and stand to it: as every one that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent,
doth. Whosoever commits a
Sin against his Light, Judgment, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
if he do not repent of it, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
a Habit; and <hi>interpretatively,</hi> he
commits the Sin over and over again: and
he lives in it. For, if he did not justifie
it; why doth he not disclaim it, repent
of it, ask God's Forgiveness, and more
carefully withold his Consent for time to
come?—It is not a thing credible, that
God will pardon Sin, <hi>without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To SIN, and NOT TO REPENT;
is <hi>to speak Defiance against God,</hi> and to
usurp upon him; to deny his Authority,
and make our selves Lawless and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
than which, nothing can be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Affront to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Tis of most dangerous and mischievous
Consequence.</hi> He that sins openly, and
doth not repent; he doth <hi>invite,</hi> nay, in
a sort, <hi>warrant</hi> other Men to do the like:
and therefore, for the Safety of others, it
is necessary to punish such.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is not at all Compassionable.</hi> There is
an Incapacity in <hi>the Recipient:</hi> tho' there
be no want of Mercy <hi>in God:</hi> For, he is
infinitely, Merciful, and Gracious: but
the Subject is altogether incapable. And,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:56135:169"/>
indeed, no Man doth regard Pardon of
<hi>that,</hi> of which he doth not repent. He
slights any thing of this nature. If a Man
doth not repent, he doth not care for
God's Pardon. Nay, how can that be
forgiven, which the Committer doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to warrant, and to justifie? Such
<hi>an Act of Grace,</hi> if it were offer'd, would
be despis'd.</p>
                  <p>A Creature therefore must not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the Creator's Will; or controul the
immutable and unalterable Law of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Righteousness, Goodness, and
Truth; and avow it, and stand to it.
For, God's Righteousness <hi>engages</hi> him to
controul the Lust of Sinning, and taking
Delight in Evil: and, it is <hi>natural</hi> for
him, so to do. As God is <hi>the first and
chiefest Goodness;</hi> and as he is <hi>the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the World;</hi> it doth concern him,
to controul Evil, and to maintain Right.
He is Supream and Soveraign; therefore
must not be affronted. But, if the Sinner
leave off to sin, and condemn himself;
then, the Necessity of Punishment is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away: For, <hi>that</hi> for which Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is made use of, is obtain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Punishment. And we never make
use of a <hi>Mean,</hi> if the <hi>End</hi> be obtain'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:56135:170"/>
                     <hi>Punishment,</hi> in the hand of God, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the maintaining his Authority;
or for the Defence of Righteousness; or
for the Reformation of a Sinner; or for
an effectual Admonition to the By-stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Now, <hi>Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Amendment,</hi>
are better secur'd, by Mens Repentance,
than by their Destruction. And, also, <hi>the
Defence of Righteousness</hi> is better secur'd
by this way, than any other. For, if Men
suffer; yea, if they perish everlastingly;
they perish only on this account, because
they cannot avoid it. And there may be
in <hi>Hell,</hi> those <hi>that blaspheme God;</hi>as you
read in the <hi>Revelations.</hi>—A Sinner's
voluntary Submission to God, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Acknowledgment, hath more of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in it; and is more pleasing to God;
than either being turn'd out of <hi>Being,</hi> or
suffering Hell-Torments to Eternity. For,
<hi>the one tends</hi> to mending the Mind,
(which is a thing good in it self:) <hi>the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
to Exasperation. <hi>So,</hi> Rev. 16. 9.
<hi>Men were scorch'd with great Heat; and
blasphem'd God: and they repented not, to
give him Glory.</hi> Now, if the Sinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
you have his Consent, and his
whole Heart; you have then gain'd his
Mind and Soul; and he doth, then, all
that is in him to do. Now, it is a greater
Excellency, to win, and reconcile, by Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
and Fairness; than to vanquish,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:56135:170"/>
and overcome, by Power and Force. To
win and overcome, by fair Means, by
Reason and Argument, by Courtesie and
Gentleness, <hi>these</hi> shew Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
but, to crush and subdue, may be
done by Power, and Subtlety: by <hi>Power,</hi>
because the Person cannot make defence:
by <hi>Subtlety,</hi> because the Person was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
and taken at unawares.—The
Creature's suffering Punishment, is a very
sorry amends for Transgression. For, what
doth God gain by it? God is so far from
being recompenc'd by the Suffering of
contumacious Sinners; that I dare say, it
is more satisfactory to God, more accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Mind, that a Sinner should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and humbly acknowledge his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
in this State, in which he is; than
* <hi>undergo</hi> the suffering of the Damn'd to
Eternity. For, God gains nothing, by
the <hi>one:</hi> but he hath the Heart of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
by the <hi>other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, for Application.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>In the <hi>first place;</hi> since it is of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to us, that we have <hi>Remission
of Sin;</hi> let us dwell long upon it, by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Meditation and Consideration, till
our Minds have Assurance and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and till we come to a firm Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:56135:171"/>
in it. For, this is fundamental to
Faith; and necessary to prevent our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
when we come to die. For, then,
it will either be the <hi>poor Security,</hi> which
Sencelesness or stupid Ignorance works in
us; or else there will be <hi>Confusion of
Thought;</hi> and we shall not know what to
do, if this Knowledge by not confirm'd,
and settled in the Soul. A National Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of <hi>this,</hi> will not be sufficient
to give us solid Content and Satisfaction,
at that time; nor be a Foundation for
our Faith to rest upon. Those words that
we have read,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>that the Wages of Sin is
Death,</hi> will then run in our Minds; and
we shall be,<note place="margin">1 Kings 17. 18.</note> then, ready to say, <hi>Art thou

of Sin, will of all things be most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
to our Minds; and the want of
it, will be the most afflicting Consideration
imaginable.</item>
                     <item>
                        <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> Being well-resolv'd and assur'd of
the Way that God will pardon Sin; let us
always have it in our eye; and put it in
practice. Let us be sure that we heartily
<hi>repent</hi> of our Sins; turn to God; make
Application to him; and come under the
Terms of the Covenant of Grace; <hi>that so
our Faith and Hope may finally rest in God,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 21.</note>
                           <pb n="321" facs="tcp:56135:171"/>
as the Apostle speaks. All that is reveal'd
to us concerning Christ, and the Gospel,
is for this End and Purpose: and there
is nothing in the World that is so well
secur'd, as the Pardon of our Sins, and
Everlasting Safety, in the way of the
Faith of the Gospel: For, upon these
Terms it hath Settlement from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Divine Nature; who is the
first and chiefest Goodness; and who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fail to commiserate <hi>every compassiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Case.</hi> And I declare to you, that <hi>the
Case</hi> of a Creature finite and fallible, if he
do repent and turn to God, is sorry for
what he hath done amiss, and return to
his Duty; is <hi>compassionable.</hi> And this we
are assur'd of, not only from the Nature of
God; but from the Revelation of his
Mind and Will. For, <hi>as</hi> is his Nature,
<hi>such</hi> are the Resolutions of his Mind and
Will.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That SIN is pardonable;</hi> is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all our Religion, and Application
to God; Fundamental to Faith, and to
all Affiance, Trust, and Confidence in
God. For, tho' the Act of a Creature
may be aggravated, in respect of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against whom it is committed; yet, <hi>in
themselves,</hi> they are but <hi>Acts of Weakness.</hi>
And I shall shew you that they are so, in
God's account and esteem: and therefore
God doth not charge us so deeply for
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:56135:172"/>
them as he might, nor so much aggravate
the Affronts against his own Majesty; but
considers and allows for the Weakness of
the Creature. So, <hi>Psalm 103. 14. For he
knoweth our Frame, and remembereth that
we are Dust.</hi> Therefore, God doth not
so highten our Failings, and Neglect of
him, as he might do, from the Height and
Excellency of his own Majesty; but he
doth look upon them as the Failings
and Miscarriages of weak and frail Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
So <hi>Isa. 57. 16.</hi> These places of
Scripture show that God doth consider
what we are; and gives allowance for
our Shortness, Weakness, and Infirmity;
being <hi>the Condition</hi> in which we were
<hi>made.</hi> He considers that we are but finite
and fallible, and consist of different Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials;
<hi>a Divine and Heavenly Spirit;</hi>
and <hi>a Gross Body.</hi> He knows that we
have a great Government, <hi>the ruling of
sundry Appetites;</hi> and must subordinate
all the Motions of Sense, to the Dictates
of Reason and Understanding; which is
the greatest Performance in the World.
Yet <hi>this,</hi> Humane Nature is put upon:
and herein we have a greater Province to
administer, than even the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
they not having so gross a Body
as we have, nor expos'd to so much Evil
as we are.<note place="margin">Ps. 103. 14.</note> But God, <hi>he knoweth our
FRAME;</hi> and, upon that account, is
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:56135:172"/>
not <hi>extream</hi> to mark what is done amiss.
A Creature, as <hi>a Creature,</hi> is finite and
fallible: and yet we are not the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of God's Creation. Now, for <hi>Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
to <hi>fail,</hi> is no more than for <hi>Frail,</hi> to
<hi>be broken;</hi> and for <hi>Mortal</hi> to <hi>die.</hi> Where
there is Finite and Limited Perfection,
there is not only a Possibility, but <hi>a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency</hi>
to Fail, to Err, to be Mistaken,
not to know, and to be deceiv'd. And
where the Agent is such, there is place for
Repentance. <hi>Repentance</hi> is that which
makes a Finite Being failing, capable of
Compassion. If Repentance did not take
effect, it would be too hazardous for a
Creature to come into Being. If upon a
Laps, an Error, or Mistake, we should be
undone to Eternity, without all hope of
Recovery: Who would willingly enter
upon this State? These are Matters fit for
Consideration, and very satisfactory to
considerate Minds, and to awaken'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>Then, 3<hi>dly,</hi> Let us entertain right No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Apprehensions of God; and
conclude that he is, of his own Nature,
placable, and reconcileable. It is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
upon Sin, to commit a further E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
to delight in it; to love it, and to
live in it; and, from hence, to fear and
hate God, who is offended by it. For,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:56135:173"/>
this is certain, where Men are affraid, they
do not love: and where they hate, for
their own Preservation, if they could,
they would dissable such as are Formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and in a Capacity to do them Harm.
Now, if we look upon God as our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
(as we shall do, if we sin against
him, and do not repent:) we shall fear
and dread him: and so <hi>Hate</hi> him; not
<hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Delight in</hi> him. For, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
we always suspect that the wrong'd
Person will revenge himself, and take all
advantage to do himself Right; unless
we make our Peace with him. And were
<hi>God</hi> like unto <hi>us;</hi> there were just cause
for this Suspicion. But we may satisfie
our selves from what God hath declar'd;
that there is no cause to fear, in the way
of Repentance and Faith: for as much as
God will perform the Terms of his own
Gracious Dispensation; which is, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
all such as sincerely repent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Gospel.</item>
                     <item>4<hi>thly,</hi> It this be true, that we cannot be
rid of Sin, save only by some Act of God;
then, let us not do <hi>that</hi> which is so much
to our own Prejudice; upon such easie
Terms as commonly, * <hi>to</hi> offend: since
it is not in our power to undo it. For,
Sin committed cannot be avoided, unless
by God's Pardon, as well as our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:56135:173"/>
And our Repentance is but our
Qualification for Pardon. <hi>Pardon</hi> it self,
is the Act of God, and depends upon the
use of his Power. God hath Power over
his own Right; and may abate of it,
what he pleaseth. Now, if a Man once
sin; farewel, for ever, the Righteousness
of Innocency: <hi>this</hi> is that which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be attain'd: for it can never be made,
that <hi>what</hi> hath been done, was not done:
or, that every sinful Act did not deserve
Punishment. In this State of Sin, we are
only made whole, recover'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd:
and this Relief we have by the
Divine Grace. So that we cannot in any
Reason allow our selves to commit Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
for the time to come, or to return to
Folly: for, this were <hi>to turn the Grace of
God into Wantonness;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jude 4.</note> and to abuse the
Divine Benignity, and Compassion, and
to make void the Effect thereof; and to
do what in us lyes, that the Sins that were
forgiven before, should return upon us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
as the Debt that was forgiven did
upon the Wicked Servant that we read
of.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Let us, * <hi>therefore,</hi> admire the Divine
Mercy and Goodness; that those things
which we know we have committed,
should be made as if they never had been,
by God's Pardon and Forgiveness: that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56135:174"/>
they should be as tho' they never had
been, in respect of any Danger or Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to us. Yea, that God, to whom
Vengeance belongeth, should lay aside
Thoughts and Purposes of Revenge; and
so freely pardon what we have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss:
that God, who is our Great Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
should cancel all Obligations, and
comply with the Necessity of our case;
without which we could not be happy:
<hi>For the Redemption of the Soul is precious,<note place="margin">Psal. 49. 8.</note>
and ceaseth for ever,</hi> as to any thing that
we can do. But, <hi>here,</hi> that which was
not in our power to do, is done for us,
by God; to wit, Pardon of Sin: and he
hath provided that which was necessary
for his own Satisfaction, which was not
in our power; and hath left nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us to do, but that which we may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perform, through the Assistance of his
<hi>Grace;</hi> which he is ready and willing to
afford, that we may be enabled to repent,
and to leave off to sin. And thus God hath
made our Condition hopeful, which we
had made desperate. Insomuch that God
may with great Reason expostulate with
us,<note place="margin">Psa. 5. 4.</note> and say; <hi>why will ye die?</hi> and, <hi>what
could I have done more for my Vineyard
than I have done?</hi> What could I have
done more, * <hi>in</hi> Consistency with the
<hi>Design</hi> of my <hi>Creation;</hi> having made and
invested Man with <hi>Intellectual Nature;</hi>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:56135:174"/>
and given him Reason and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and consequently, Liberty and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>lastly,</hi> with which I will conclude;
Let us learn of God, to afford one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the like measure: for this is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Argument.<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 45. &amp; 18. 33.</note> We having been Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the Mercy of God; should show
Mercy unto others; and deal with one
another, even <hi>as God</hi> deals with <hi>us.</hi> It is
not possible for a Man to be a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and not to forgive one that asks him
Forgiveness, is sorry for his Sin, and is
willing to make the best Satisfaction that
he is able. It is not Christian to live out
of Love and Good-will; or to harbour
Envy, Hatred, Malice, Ill-will, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
or to have Thoughts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
He that doth so, doth not believe
that God hath pardon'd him his Sins: for,
if he did, <hi>this</hi> would cause him to forgive
his Brother. If we have in our Souls <hi>a
true Sense of God's Goodness to us;</hi> it will
form us into the <hi>like</hi> Disposition of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
towards Men.—Whosoever they
are that partake of the Divine Nature, do
thus: and they that do the contrary, live
in the Devilish Nature.</p>
                  <p>Let therefore all them that complain of
the Badness of their Natures, and say it is
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:56135:175"/>
a Burthen to them, come under the Power
of this Consideration; till they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
to a near Agreement with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Perfection. Reason, and Argument
are <hi>transforming Principles</hi> in Intellectual
Natures. And, it is not possible where
Men are inform'd, and satisfy'd with Good
Reason, and Argument; but it should
work upon them. Therefore, I advise those
who are sensible that they carry Coals, and
are full of Ill-will, and entertain Thoughts
of Revenge; that they do, day by day,
think upon this Argument; till they have
wrought out all Malignity out of their
Souls. For, they do not <hi>believe</hi> God's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
who <hi>cannot pardon:</hi> for, Men are apt
to think <hi>that God is like unto themselves.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 21.</note>
Now, if we justifie our selves in <hi>this,</hi> and
think it our Priviledge, and Prerogative,
to bear Ill-will, Malice, and Thoughts of
Revenge; we shall attribute the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the All-powerful God: and, if it be so
acceptable unto us, to render Evil for Evil,
and to be revengeful; we shall think that
it is pleasurable unto God also, to destroy
his Enemies; and, that he will do it, and
prosecute Revenge against his Rebels, to
the utmost: for, we are well pleas'd with
our own Disposition and Temper: and,
<hi>that</hi> which we do approve and justifie <hi>in
our selves,</hi> we shall attribute unto <hi>God:</hi>
for, if it were not * (<hi>in our opinion</hi>) a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:56135:175"/>
Perfection; we should condemn it, in our
selves: therefore * <hi>as such,</hi> we shall much
more attribute it unto God.</p>
                  <p>To conclude. Let no <hi>Anger, Rancour,
Malice,</hi> or <hi>Displeasure;</hi> let no Thoughts
or Purposes of <hi>Revenge</hi> harbour in any
Man's Breast; as he would have God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
and reconcileable unto him; and as
he desires to believe the Pardon of his own
Sins, when he goes out of the World.</p>

                  <p>THE Promise of the <hi>Messias</hi> doth
bear the most ancient Date. No
sooner was there place for it, but
he was promis'd, and declar'd:
Which was upon the Fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> And
it was not reasonable to think, that God
should declare himself for the Pardon of
Sin, before Sin was committed: For, <hi>that</hi>
would have been, to indulge, invite, or
encourage Man to Sin: But, no sooner
is Man become guilty; but the Promise
is made, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman shall
break the Serpent's Head.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> Which St. <hi>John</hi>
comments upon, in these Words,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>For this
cause the Son of God was manifested, to
destroy the Works of the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:56135:177"/>And this Promise is often repeated to
the Patriarchs successively one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Isaac,</hi> to <hi>Jacob:</hi>
As also in the Types and Shadows that
were under the Mosaical Dispensation;
as the Apostle tells us (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1.) <hi>God
who at sundry Times, and divers Manners,
spake unto our Fathers by the Prophets, hath
in these last Days spoken unto us by his
Son,</hi> &amp;c. That which is now plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
unto us by the <hi>Messias,</hi> was darkly
represented by the Prophets. But, in
<hi>the Fulness of Time (that is,</hi> the Time
that God had appointed and resolv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
he sent forth his Son, and exhibited
his <hi>Messias</hi> unto the World. Now this
is a Point of the greatest Import to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
that could be, after the Fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi>
For, Remission of Sin depended
upon it. And this is a Matter of so great
Concernment, that we are undone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. For, unless we can get discharg'd
of our Sin and Guilt, we must sink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it. See therefore how punctual and

Reason; and observe that which is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;

And yet he was present at the first Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And you know that all Laws are
most rigorously and punctually observ'd
at their first making. For, if a Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
do not insist upon a punctual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of his Laws, at their first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
he doth tacitly consent to the
laying of them aside.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor any Appointment <hi>at
what time:</hi> No set Season for the doing
of it, commanded by our Saviour. For,
they were met upon another Occasion;
not for this Business.</item>
                     <item>

that we find requir'd by our Saviour, as
<hi>peculiar</hi> to that Business. It is true, they
were taken in a Passover-preparation: but
they had no antecedent Warning, nor
knew what our Saviour was about to do;
till he did the Thing. At the <hi>Passover</hi>
there were <hi>Four</hi> Eatings; and <hi>Two</hi> Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
And our Saviour puts a new Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon one of the Cups; and one of
the Breads. It was <hi>a Religious Exercise</hi>
they came about; and so were in <hi>a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Disposition;</hi> wherein Approach was
to be made to God: Which doth inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<hi>this Notion;</hi> that <hi>they who lead Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Lives, and follow the Rule of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Doctrine, may freely and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:56135:179"/>
make Application to God, in one holy
Exercise, as well as another.</hi> Whosoever
lives according to the Difference of Good
and Evil, and governs himself so that he
may make Application to God, either by
Prayer, Reading, Meditation, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Conference, or any other Christian
Duty, is in a Preparation and Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein he may come safely to the
Table of the Lord. I know there are
many Men that think not of any Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for <hi>Prayer,</hi> or <hi>other Christian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
yet, pretend to some Curiosity in
their Preparation, when they are to come
to <hi>the Sacrament.</hi> Not that I would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
Mens Preparation for this Duty:
But, is not the Object of Worship the
same? It may be, their Apprehensions of
Danger are grounded on these Words
which tell us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 29</note> That <hi>they eat and drink
Damnation to themselves.</hi> But, is it not
also said,<note place="margin">Prov. 15. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>The Sacrifice of the Wicked is
an Abomination to the Lord?</hi> And, that
<hi>he will not hear them,<note place="margin">Psal. 66. 18.</note> when they pray unto
him?</hi> By which it appears, that it is not
safe for Men to lay all the Weight upon
<hi>one</hi> Piece of Religion; and to be triffling
and neglective <hi>in others.</hi>

but, <hi>as oft as you do it,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

11. 25. Now the Nature of the Thing
doth sufficiently secure <hi>Frequency.</hi> For,
it is a Thing <hi>grateful</hi> in the Matter, and
<hi>beneficial;</hi> so, quite another thing than
many of the Mosaical Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
were; of which it is said, that many
of them were <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>burthensome:</hi>
But this is highly grateful and beneficial.
What can be more pleasing, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
so great a Benefactour as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?
One that did undertake and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
on our behalf? They that are right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehensive of the Reason of the

and careful Attendance upon it.</item>

Posture</hi> they should communicate: For,
our Saviour takes them, as he finds them.
But we are apt to be Superstitious; and
to make our selves Rules; and to form
such Notions by which we create Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in Religion, and Trouble to our
selves and others. And it is greatly to
be fear'd, and so much of Curiosity as a
Man bestows about any Piece of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Devotion that is <hi>of his own
Formation,</hi> so much he will abate in his
Conscientious Observance of that which
is <hi>of God's Institution.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>

                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:56135:180"/>I might also shew you the very same
Thing in <hi>the other Institution.</hi> For, there
you have only <hi>the material Action,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> and
the <hi>Acknowledgment. BAPTIZING them
in the Name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Now, how hath
the World been troubl'd about the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of <hi>Time,</hi> and several other
Things about this Sacrament? And <hi>all</hi>
without Foundation. But, there is no
warrant for this, from the Institution.
And Charity hath been wanting, when
Men have gone about to make out Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
further than what hath been plainly
declar'd. So that I resolve with my self,
that GOD * <hi>having</hi> invested Man with
<hi>Intelectual Nature;</hi> and given him that
high Priviledge, and Prerogative of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and <hi>Understanding;</hi> doth expect that
he should act according to those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
And, where HE doth not consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
and appoint, limit and determine;
that <hi>there</hi> He doth refer himself to the
rational Determination of <hi>that first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi>
the Principle <hi>of his Creation.</hi> So
that, whatsoever is done throughout the
Life of Man, that <hi>there is Reason for;</hi>
it is warranted by <hi>God:</hi> Provided, still,
that a Man doth not vary from any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and express Institution of God,
in Scripture. And, if this were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
we should have the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:56135:181"/>
of Differences in the Church of
God taken away. It is but a vain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Zeal for GOD,</hi> and <hi>doing him
Service;</hi> for US to limit, appoint, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,
and determine, beyond what <hi>HE
himself</hi> hath done.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a good Notion, universally; <hi>Let
us be as FREE under God, as we can;</hi> and
resolve, with St.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul, Not to be brought
under the Power of any Thing.</hi> So far as
God doth declare, we must follow his
Direction. But it is best for us, where
he doth not limit and determine, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Reason of our own Minds, in
the free Use of our Liberty. God doth
so far acknowledge his own <hi>Workmanship,</hi>
as to refer himself to the Principles of
Creation in Man, so far forth as he doth
not limit and determine. For, <hi>do</hi> but
with Reason, and you <hi>do</hi> well. There
is no <hi>Superstition</hi> in using Things <hi>not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of God:</hi> But, in using them <hi>as
necessary Pieces of Religion,</hi> they are <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,</hi>
and offensive to God. I say
<hi>* there is</hi> no Superstition in using Things
not commanded by God, <hi>even. in the
Worship of God;</hi> if they be Comely, and
such as Reason doth allow of. But, there
is Superstition in assuming to our selves
<hi>Authority to use them,</hi> as <hi>necessary Peices of
Religion,</hi> and as <hi>sanctified</hi> by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
when they are not of God's
Appointment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:56135:181"/>
You see now, that in Matters of
Weight, wherein the Honour of God,
and the Safety of Mens Souls are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
Scripture is punctual, clear, full,
and particular: That our Faith may be
better directed, and we our selves preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
against Cheats and Impostures. But
* <hi>as to</hi> other Matters, they are left to
Christian Prudence, Discretion, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.
And God's Love and Goodness
appears to us exceedingly, in <hi>Both</hi> these
<hi>Cases:</hi>— * <hi>Both</hi> that <hi>He is clear, full,
and particular, where 'tis for our Advantage
and Security.</hi>—And, also, <hi>that He doth
not unnecessarily resolve or determine us,
where the Things themselves do not require
it:</hi>—In <hi>the Former;</hi> because if we
should mistake <hi>there,</hi> it would be to our
Loss and great Disadvantage, because of
the Importance of the Matter; whether
it relate either to Matter of Faith, or
Practice: In <hi>the Latter,</hi> where the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is not so <hi>necessary, in it self;</hi> nor our
Obligation <hi>to the Thing it self;</hi> nor any
intrinsick Value in it; <hi>here,</hi> it is God's
Goodness to us, that he will not <hi>limit</hi>
and <hi>determine.</hi> For, it is hazardous to
a Man, in <hi>Minute Things</hi> to be obliged
in Point of Conscience. If the Thing be
good in it self; I am admonished daily
how to act, by <hi>the Rectitude of my Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;</hi>
because the Thing is good, in its
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:56135:182"/>
own Nature, and Quality: But, in the
other * <hi>Case,</hi> I have nothing but <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of my Memory.</hi> This is a great Point
of Divinity; that God hath left us, in
the Christian Religion, as <hi>Free</hi> as we may
be, without Loss or Prejudice <hi>to our
selves:</hi> We being only determin'd to
Things of Weight, and to such Things
wherein if we should fail, we should great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hurt our selves. For, it is a great
Priviledge, not to be oblig'd without
Necessity; not to be under Restraint
<hi>through the Necessity of the Precept;</hi> where
there is no Necessity <hi>in the Matter.</hi> And
this I account one of the great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that we have by the Gospel. And
here, as the Apostle adviseth, (<hi>Gal.</hi>5. 1.)
we should <hi>stand fast in that Liberty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Christ hath made us free.</hi> And that
this is a great Priviledge, is clear, from
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. where the Apostle calls <hi>the
Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Observances,</hi> commanded
under the Law, <hi>a Yoak which neither They
nor their Fathers were able to bear.</hi> In this
Dispensation, there was every Thing
punctually determined, both for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and Circumstance: So that they
had need of very good <hi>Memories,</hi> to bear
them all in Mind. Whereas, it is a great
Security for my Observance of God, that
I have <hi>the Security of the Goodness of my
Temper,</hi> as well as <hi>my Memory.</hi> And thus
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:56135:182"/>
it is, in all Matters of Weight, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But, if it be a <hi>positive Command;</hi>
and <hi>that,</hi> of a Thing wholly <hi>Arbitrary;</hi>
and which (* <hi>if</hi> God had pleased) might
have been omited; then, I have only <hi>the
Security of my Memory.</hi> And this is a choice
Notion in <hi>Divinity:</hi> But, prepossest
Minds will not bear it; tho' it be never
so much for their Ease and Advantage.
But, let him <hi>that hath Ears to hear,</hi> hear.<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 15</note>
I will say it again. There is not, in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, any Obligation upon us,
but it is either one or other of these
<hi>Two:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Either, <hi>First,</hi> the Reason of the Thing
doth require it: And then it is necessary
<hi>in it self;</hi> as is <hi>Observance of God; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of Deity; and regardful Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of him;—Righteousness and
Justice between Man and Man; fair and
equal Consideration; Doing as we would be
done unto;</hi>—or, <hi>Sobriety and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Purity and Chastity, in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our selves:</hi> I say; either they
are such great Things as <hi>These;</hi> Or
else,</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Things commanded, are
<hi>Medicinal,</hi> and <hi>Supplemental,</hi> in Case of
Guilt, and contracted Impotency by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Sin; as <hi>going to God, by Jesus Christ;</hi>
                        <pb n="344" facs="tcp:56135:183"/>
and <hi>the Application of the Benefits that are
by our blessed Lord and Saviour; the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his Blood, for Pardon of Sin;</hi> and
<hi>what he hath done, engaging in our behalf.</hi>
And we shall see great Cause thankfully
to acknowledge God for this great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
if we do but consider the Occasion of
<hi>Adam's</hi> Fall; who did not fall upon a
Transgression of <hi>a Moral Point;</hi> but, in
Variation from a <hi>positive Institution.</hi> And,
for ought I, or any Body else, know;
if God had not prohibited him <hi>the Tree
of Life;</hi> he might as well have eaten of
<hi>that,</hi> as of any <hi>other Tree</hi> in the Garden:
For,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>She saw that it was lovely to the Eye,
and fit for Food: And therefore she took of
the Fruit of that Tree, and did eat, and
gave unto her Husband.</hi> Here, they had
only <hi>the Security of their Memories;</hi> and,
not of any <hi>internal Disposition.</hi> So it is
said of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> that they were
struck dead <hi>for offering strange Fire before
the Lord.<note place="margin">Numb. 3. 4.</note> One fire,</hi> to Reason, seemed
as good as <hi>another,</hi> to offer Sacrifice with:
But, because there was an Institution to
the contrary; whether they did it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
or carelesly; they perished <hi>by Fire.</hi>
Also,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 6. 19.</note> let us remember the <hi>Bethshemites,</hi> who
being transported with Joy and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<hi>looked into the Ark</hi> (a Thing
contrary to God's Appointment) to the
Hazard of their Lives.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 7.</note> Likewise <hi>Uzza</hi>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:56135:183"/>
in his Zeal, when he found <hi>the Ark</hi> ready
to fall, as he thought; put to his Hand
to keep it up, and was slain for his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
it being contrary to God's Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
When we think of these things se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously;
we shall find cause him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
thankfully to acknowledge God's
Goodness, that we are <hi>engaged</hi> only where
<hi>the Nature of the thing doth engage;</hi> and
that we are not made liable, and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to god, in things that are not <hi>Evil in
themselves, and hurtful for us.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>It is greatly hazardous, for a Finite and
Fallible Creature, to be limited and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
by <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleasure,</hi> where there is
no Reason, that the Mind of Man can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
why he should be restrained. For,
we are mightily for <hi>Liberty:</hi> And, unless
we be satisfied in the Reason of the thing;
we have a great Desire to look into that
which we are prohibited. 'Tis hard to
be subject to <hi>Will;</hi> * <hi>as it is</hi> Natural to
yield to <hi>Reason.</hi> Therefore, it is not a
thing that we should affect, to come into
Bondage, or be determined more than God
hath determined us.—Let these things
be weighed by those Men who love to
multiply <hi>Positive Institutions,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the Liberty of our Minds, in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
and Punctilio's; in things
* <hi>where</hi> God hath not limited or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
us. For my part, I will not part
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:56135:184"/>
with that <hi>Liberty wherewith Christ hath
made us free.</hi> And, this is one Part of
our <hi>Liberty:</hi> I must confess the greatest of
all, is, <hi>to free us from the Guilt and Power
of our Sins:</hi> but, the next, is this; <hi>to put
us out of Danger, and free us from the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Conscience, where Reason, and the
Matter it self, doth not oblige us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moral Part</hi> of Religion is indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably
necessary; because every piece of
* <hi>It</hi> doth sanctifie by its Presence: As
* for instance, <hi>Humility, Modesty, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
Temperance, Reverence of Deity,</hi>
and the like: <hi>These Things</hi> cannot be in
any Man's Mind but they make him Holy:
Whereas <hi>the Instrumental Part of Religion</hi>
doth not sanctifie by Presence. For, you
may <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>hear the Word,</hi> and <hi>receive
the Sacrament,</hi> and <hi>be wicked</hi> still: But
every * <hi>thing of the Moral Part</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
doth sanctifie by Presence, just as a
Remedy, or Cordial, or Diet, doth do
a Man good, by receiving it.</p>
                  <p>* <hi>But to speak,</hi> now, * <hi>of</hi> the great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
* <hi>that</hi> accrue to us, by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
being in our Nature. He doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the Right of Redeeming us; and
makes Satisfaction in that Nature that had
trangressed: And, he doth repair the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56135:184"/>
ruined Nature of Man; by dwelling in
it, and by working Righteousness in it:
by which means he hath wrought out, <hi>all
Malignity,</hi> and <hi>naughty Habits,</hi> by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Acts; <hi>the Acts of Sin and Vice,</hi> by Acts
of Vertue and Goodness; <hi>the Acts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,</hi>
by Acts of Sobriety and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</p>
                  <p>Now, let us look for the Explication
of * this, <hi>in our selves;</hi> in our <hi>Nativity
from above;</hi> in <hi>Mental Transformation,</hi> and
DEIFICATION. Do not stumble at the
use of <hi>the Word.</hi> For, we have Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the use of it, in Scripture. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.
<hi>Being made Partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
which is in effect our <hi>Deification.</hi>
Also, let it appear <hi>in our Reconciliation to
God,</hi> to <hi>Goodness, Righteousness,</hi> and
<hi>Truth;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 2.</note> in our <hi>being created after God, in
Righteousness, and true Holiness.</hi> It was
a signal Evidence of a Divine Power in
the Disciples of Christ, at the first Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Gospel; that it wrought so
great an Alteration in all those that did
receive it. The Envious, Debauched, and
Disobedient; It made Temperate, Sober,
and Religious, Humble, and <hi>Good-natured.</hi>
It converted the Embracers of it, to a Life
more suitable to Reason, and Nature, and
all Moral Vertue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:56135:185"/>
* <hi>We may</hi> observe from this, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Natural State is <hi>base</hi> or <hi>vile.</hi>
Whatsoever hath Foundation in God's
Creation, or whatsoever the Providence
of God calls any Man unto, it is not <hi>base.</hi>
For, our Saviour himself <hi>took Flesh</hi> and
<hi>Blood:</hi> and <hi>that</hi> is the meaner Part of
Humane Nature. Whatsoever is <hi>Natural,</hi>
hath nothing of Disparagement in it; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that exposeth a Man to Contempt,
and Scorn. And this may satisfie those
that are in the meanest Offices and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments;
that there is nothing base,
that hath place in God's Creation. That
which is Vile, Base, and Filthy, is <hi>unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi>
and depends upon <hi>unnatural Use,</hi>
and <hi>degenerate Practice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also, observe here, the great Honour
put upon Humane Nature; when <hi>the Son
of God</hi> came into it; when Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
did take into Consideration the Rise
and Advance of Created Nature; and to
recover and raise It to all possible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
<hi>He did take to himself a peculiar
relation to Humane. Nature.</hi>—Then, let
us take Consolation in this. For, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be thought, that God did so great a
thing, and of so deep a Consideration, as
to unite Humane Nature to his own Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
and to set it at his own Right
hand, to the Admiration of Angels, (for
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:56135:185"/>
he saith,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>let all the Angels of God worship
him;</hi>) that he did such a thing as this is,
to beget a Notion, or to raise a Talk, and
make a Wonder in the World, and put
the Creation into a Gaze and Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
God doth nothing, for so light
an end; and especially not his great
things, such as these, which call for Fear
and Reverence on our part. This we may
say, is one of the greatest Works * <hi>of</hi>
God. This, if possible, doth transcend
the very Creation of God, at first: for,
there was nothing * <hi>there</hi> to resist him:
but, in the Restoration, there was Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Sin. God did this, therefore,
for the great and unconceivable Good of
that <hi>Nature</hi> that he hath so highly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Therefore, what Consolation should
we have from it! what Declaration should
we make of it! what Thanksgiving for
it! Having this Knowledge; how should
we rejoyce in God, and be above the
World! * <hi>how should we</hi> depress the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Motions of Sense, and savour
Spiritual things! that so we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
understand this great <hi>Mystery,</hi> by which
we are so highly honoured. And this is the
proper use of this High and Noble Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, let this be explicated, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and fulfilled in us. For, <hi>this</hi> you
must understand; that <hi>Religion</hi> is not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:56135:186"/>
in Notions; but doth indeed, and
in reality, come to nothing, unless it be
in us not only Matter of Knowledge and
Speculation; but doth establish in us a
Frame and Temper of Mind, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
of a holy and vertuous Life.
Therefore, let these things take effect in
us; in our <hi>Spirituality,</hi> and <hi>Heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedness;</hi>
in our <hi>Conformity to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature,</hi> and <hi>Nativity from above.</hi> For,
whosoever professes that he believes the
Truth of these things; and wants the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of them upon his Spirit, and
Life; he doth, in fact, make void, and
frustrate what he doth declare as his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:
and so he doth <hi>receive the Grace of
God in vain;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 1.</note> unless this Principle, and
Belief doth descend into his Heart, and
establish a good Frame and Temper of
Mind; and govern in all the Actions of
his Life and Conversation.</p>
                  <p>RELIGION is not a <hi>particular Good</hi>
only; as Meat against Hunger; or Drink
against Thirst; or Cloaths against Cold;
but it is <hi>Universally Good;</hi> a Good, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Limitation or Restraint.</hi> * For <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Purity of Mind,</hi> is the self same
thing to the Mind, that <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi>
is to the Body.—It is good * <hi>also</hi> in
point of <hi>Satisfaction to the Judgment.</hi> For,
no Man that useth Reason, can otherwise
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:56135:186"/>
sit down contented, unless he be in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with God; unless there be
fair Terms between God and him.—It
is good * <hi>also</hi> upon the account of <hi>Peace
and Settlement of Conscience;</hi> upon which,
the greatest Good of Man doth depend;
for want of which, nothing <hi>without him,</hi>
can make any Compensation.</p>
                  <p>Now, to shew it in Particulars. RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGION
(which is, in substance, <hi>our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
of God in his Moral Perfections,
and Excellency of Goodness, Righteousness,
and Truth) * is that</hi> wherein our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
doth consist: And we <hi>then</hi> relish the
truest Pleasure and Satisfaction, <hi>when</hi> we
find * <hi>our selves</hi> reconciled to God, by
<hi>Participation of his Nature.</hi> They who
have not * <hi>this</hi> Sence of God, may have
a Religion to talk of, and profess; * <hi>a
Religion,</hi> to give them a Denomination:
but, they are not at all in the true State
and Spirit of Religion: nor, have they
any real Benefit by it: nor, are they any
whit enabled by it: nor have they the
more Peace and Satisfaction from it. But,
when our Minds are transformed by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
then, we feel (at least, <hi>at times</hi>)
strong and vigorous Inclinations towards
God. And, with these Motions * <hi>our
Minds</hi> are best pleas'd and satisfied: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these are most suitable to Nature,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:56135:187"/>
and the highest Use and Employment
that Humane Nature is capable of. Upon
this account it is, that there is more Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Satisfaction in <hi>Contemplation,</hi> than
in any of the Pleasures of Sense; and that
those Men that live a-part from the World,
and are taken up in Meditation, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
their Pleasures are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
and solid, than those * <hi>of the</hi> Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and * <hi>of such as</hi> please themselves in
all the Gratifications of Sense. There is
no Heart's-ease like to that which riseth
from Sence of Reconciliation to God, and
walking in Ways of Righteousness. For,
in these Ways, Mens Hearts never check
them, nor occasion them any Disquiet.
For, let the World say what they will, to
be challenged by the Reason of a Man's
Mind, goes nearer to a Man's Heart than
the Censure of all the World besides. To
act contrary to the Reason of * <hi>one's</hi> own
Mind, is to do a thing most <hi>unnatural</hi> and
<hi>cruel:</hi> it is <hi>to offer Violence to a Man's self;</hi>
and to act against a Man's truest <hi>Use</hi> and
<hi>Interest.</hi> For, all manner of Wickedness
is <hi>a Burthen</hi> to the Mind: and every Man
that doth amiss, doth <hi>abuse himself.</hi> For,
it is not possible for any Man to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from himself, or to forget what he
hath done. He must stand to the Bargain
that he hath made; and abide by the
Choice that he hath taken: And, in the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:56135:187"/>
whole World, there is nothing so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
for a Man to think of, as that, when
he did amiss, and made a mad Choice, he
went against the Sense of his own Mind:
For, in this Case, he is not Heart-whole.
There is no Man who <hi>knows himself,</hi> but
knows what I now speak is <hi>true.</hi> Tho'
I know it is common in the World, for
Men to do against Reason, and <hi>to live by
Chance;</hi> and not to pursue any true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
or follow any worthy Design:
But, as it happens; and, as Company
and Occasion leads them; so they act;
be it better or worse: Not considering
that <hi>what,</hi> Matter of Disease, is <hi>to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
(which many times is very grievous,
and so indisposes a Man, as to put him
quite out of Self-enjoyment) * <hi>the same</hi>
Is, Malignancy <hi>in the Mind,</hi> Guilt in
the Conscience. Nay, I may say, that
<hi>These</hi> are much more troublesome and
grievous to be born, than any malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Matter of Disease can be to the
Body.</p>
                  <p>They make not true Judgment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that take it to be <hi>a Limitation,</hi> and
<hi>Restraint</hi> upon Man's Liberty. Yet, some
are so foolish as to think, that, if God
would, we might have lived as we list,
and have been released from those many
Obligations that Religion seems to lay
upon us. Whereas, this is as great <hi>a Lye</hi>
                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:56135:188"/>
as ever <hi>the Father of Lyes</hi> could invent.
For, Religion is not a burthensome and
troublesome Thing; which, if God had
not commanded, might have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
and all Things have been as well.
No: There is nothing in <hi>real</hi> and <hi>true</hi>
Religion, that is of that Nature. And,
this I dare defend against the whole
World; that there is no one thing in
all that Religion which is <hi>of God's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi>
that any sober Man, in the true
Use of his Reason, would be released
from; tho' he might have it under the
Seal of Heaven. For, such a Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would be greatly to his Loss, and
Prejudice: As much as if the Physician,
instead of giving wholsome Physick to
his Patient, should give Poyson. For,
all Things in <hi>real Religion</hi> tend either to
<hi>conserve,</hi> or * <hi>restore</hi> the Soundness and
Perfection of our Minds; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
God's Creation in the true State of
Liberty and Freedom. So that if a Man
did understand himself, and were put to
his Choice; he would rather choose to
part with the Health and Soundness <hi>of
his Body,</hi> than with the Purity and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
<hi>of his Mind.</hi> For as much as the
one is his far greater Concern: And he
had much better live with a distempered
crazy Body, than with a troubled dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
Mind, and guilty Conscience.—
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:56135:188"/>
But, * <hi>on this Subject,</hi> I have many Things
to say; and therefore will digest them
into Five Heads.</p>

                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Man by his Nature and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
as God made him at first, being
an intelligent Agent, hath <hi>Sense of Good
and Evil, upon a Moral account.</hi> All in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Beings have <hi>Sense of Convenience or
Inconvenience, in a natural Way:</hi> And,
* <hi>accordingly,</hi> all inferior Creatures do
chuse, or refuse. For, you cannot get a
meer Animal, either to eat or drink that
which is not good and agreeable to its
Nature. And, whereas we call this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct;</hi>
it is most certain that, in intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Agents, this * <hi>other</hi> is INSTINCT,
at least. And, for this Reason, Man is
faulty, when either he is found in a
naughty Temper, or any bad Practice.
For, he hath Judgment and Power of
Discerning: He is <hi>made</hi> to know the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
* <hi>of Things:</hi> And he acts * <hi>as a</hi>
mad Man, that knowing what is <hi>better,</hi>
chuseth <hi>the worse.</hi> This is the Ground
and Foundation of Man's being truly
<hi>miserable:</hi> For, to be happy, or mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
is mainly in his intelectual Nature.
Inferior Natures may suffer Wrong: But
they are not capable of Happiness or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
as intelectual Agents are; because
they are not acquitted or condemned <hi>from
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:56135:189"/>
within;</hi> nor have any thing to challenge
or reprove them.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Man being <hi>made</hi> to know
God; hath Sense of his own Privation,
in the Loss of so great and universal <hi>a
Good</hi> as GOD is. For, he is made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
* <hi>in the</hi> Enjoyment, and miserable in
the Loss of Him. And, tho' Diversion,
and other Enjoyments, may give some
Entertainment, for a while; yet when a
Man stays at Home, or returns to himself
by Consideration, he feels inward Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
in himself; because some necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Good is wanting to him. His own
Knowledge makes him capable of Good
and Evil; and sensible of being misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if he be depriv'd of that Good which
God made him capable of. Such is the
Nature of our Souls, that they cannot be
happy, but in * <hi>this way,</hi> and by the Use
of their intelectual Faculty. * <hi>Otherwise, the
Soul</hi> will be sensible of its own Privation
and Loss.—VERTUE, and VICE,
are the Foundations of <hi>Peace and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
or <hi>Sorrow and Misery. * There</hi> is
inherent Punishment belonging to all
Naughtiness: And no <hi>Power</hi> can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
or separate them; but they will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
one another. For, tho' God should
not, in a <hi>positive Way,</hi> inflict Punishment;
or any Instrument of God punish a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:56135:189"/>
yet he would punish <hi>himself:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he cannot be satisfied in what he
doth contrary to Reason, and the Sense
of his own Mind. There is no Security
to a Sinner: The least that will attend
him, is <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Suspicion</hi> of <hi>Danger.</hi>
Diversion (which is the Way that many
Men take,) going to some Pleasure, or
* <hi>into</hi> Company; is but a <hi>Put-off,</hi> for a
while; and when they retire, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
upon them, with greater Force and
Violence. For, all <hi>Moral Evil</hi> is against
the Nature of Man; and condemned by
the Reason of the Mind: And can no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way be prevented but by the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Repentance, and Application to
God.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our Souls acting upon God,
discover their Vertues; and display their
Powers; and show their Mettle and
Sprightfulness. Whereas, if a Man be
diverted from God; the <hi>Reason of his
Mind</hi> is as much without Employment, as
the <hi>Eye</hi> which is <hi>in the Dark:</hi> For, it is
the Presence of the Object, that puts the
Faculty upon acting. So, if <hi>God</hi> be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn;
our Minds cannot be drawn
forth; for, they are without their <hi>proper
Object:</hi> For, other-where, save only <hi>in
God,</hi> our Souls are not matched, so as to
make Proof of themselves. We know
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:56135:190"/>
not our Powers and Faculties, but by their
<hi>Acts:</hi> And we cannot act, but in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the <hi>Object.</hi> If a Man be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from God; his Mind and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
are without their proper
Object; and, so, are as little to him,
as his Sight is to him, when he is in
the Dark. I am apt to think, that in
the Heavenly State hereafter, when God
shall otherwise declare himself to us, than
now he doth; those Latent Powers which
<hi>now</hi> we have, may open, and unfold
themselves; and thereby we may be made
able to act in a far higher Way, than we
are at present. <hi>Now,</hi> we have many Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
and Diversions: But, <hi>when</hi> we
shall come to have nearer Approaches to
God; we shall have more <hi>Use of our
selves;</hi> and shall find our selves more
<hi>able,</hi> than we are at present, in this limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and contracted State. For, this we
have present Experience of; that if we
give our selves up, to Meditation upon
God; and employ our Minds in sincere
Intention of Him, and his Service; we do
thereby ennoble, and enlarge our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
which otherwise would shrivel up,
and grow every Day less and less. I am
very confident, that by Religious Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Men are a Thousand times more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
than by any Worldly Drudgery
whatsoever.</item>

                        <pb n="359" facs="tcp:56135:190"/>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because of the vast Desires
that are in Man, there is great Dissatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in all Things <hi>below a Man's self:</hi>
And <hi>that,</hi> all Worldly Things are. The
Mind of Man is greater and larger than
to be satisfied with any Thing in this
World. So that when Application is
made to him by <hi>Riches, Honour, Pleasure,</hi>
and the like; it is but all in vain: For,
<hi>they</hi> will all, say, <hi>Content is not in me:</hi>
And, that they are not able to do what
Men expect. And from hence will arise
great Dissatisfaction and Discontent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of <hi>Frustration</hi> and <hi>Disapprovement:</hi>
For, here, a Man must call himself a
Fool; to doat upon any Thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Grounds; and * <hi>for</hi> making an ill
Choice; and conceiting as a Fool. This
will make him uneasie, and ashamed of
himself.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> Every State, and Temper, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its Quality, whether Good or
Evil, is to have a suitable Portion of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
or Misery. Now the State of Sin,
is the worst State in the World; and
therefore it is meet that it should fare the
worst: And the State of Goodness, is
the best State; and it is meet that it should
fare accordingly.—As I said before:
If God should let a Sinner alone, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:56135:191"/>
and Unhappiness would arise <hi>from
himself.</hi> And should a good Man fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
never so many Troubles and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
yet he would have <hi>Satisfaction in
himself,</hi> and Peace in his own Soul; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was not Conscious to himself of
any Evil, nor had contracted Guilt in
his Mind.</item>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Have shewn you * <hi>formerly</hi> that the
Design of these Words, is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
our Minds of all <hi>Ill-will</hi> and
<hi>Displeasure</hi> one against another. And
I am now to give you Reasons, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
in pursuit of this Exhortation.
I began as high as Heaven; and told you,
that it was in Conformity with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and in Compliance with his Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-kindness
to Men, and his Usage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us. And, certainly, <hi>Religion</hi> in us,
is <hi>our Imitation of God, and Resemblance
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:56135:192"/>
of him.</hi> For, in respect of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
Perfections; as Goodness,
Kindness, Beneficence, Clemency, Mercy,
and Compassion: We ought to imitate
and resemble him: and, I am sure that
God is not known by any thing <hi>more</hi> to
us, <hi>than</hi> by these. And what is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
than that we shou'd be <hi>that</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
one another, that God <hi>is</hi> towards
us all?</p>
                  <p>That which the Text pleads for, and
presseth upon us, is the Tenor of the
Christian Doctrine: whether you take it
as laid down in Prophesie; or as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
it self in Precept and Command;
or as it is made out in the Temper of those
that entertain it. In <hi>the Old Testament,</hi>
nothing is more decryed than Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
Cruelty, Oppression: and in <hi>the
New Testament,</hi> nothing more call'd for,
than Mercy, Kindness, Compassion. 'Tis
<hi>that</hi> which was required in <hi>all</hi> Times, in
<hi>all</hi> Cases, of <hi>all</hi> Men: Never any <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi>
in this Matter: Never any <hi>Allowance</hi>
to the contrary. 'Tis a Matter of full Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
and required with a general <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obstante.</hi>
And, this cannot be said of very
many Points in Divinity.</p>
                  <p>* <hi>Now,</hi> this <hi>Disposition</hi> is requisite, <hi>for
our own Ease, and Safety.</hi> A Man would
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:56135:192"/>
live in <hi>Love,</hi> if it were but for his own
Peace and Quiet. For, that Man is at
Hearts ease that neither <hi>is,</hi> nor <hi>hath</hi> an
Enemy: Whereas, he that <hi>is</hi> an Enemy,
is never quiet, if he carry Displeasure in
his Breast: so, if he have justly <hi>made</hi> an
Enemy, he looseth the Liberty of his own
Thoughts, the Freedom of his own
Mind; he feareth, and is feared. So that
the Peace, Quiet, and Security of our
selves, depend upon the Composure of
our own Minds. If a Man live in <hi>Love;</hi>
he is devoid of Fear: for, there is no
Fear in Love: whereas Fear hath Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But <hi>perfect Love casteth out Fear.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">I Joh. 4. 8.</note>
If a Man hath an Enemy; he is either
meditating <hi>Revenge,</hi> or <hi>Defence:</hi> and a
Man had better be asleep in his Bed, than
thus employed.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>a due Consideration of one another,</hi> we
shou'd live in hearty Love, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.
For, such is the Condition of Man
in this World, that we stand in need of
one another's Help. For, we are all of
us very weak, and exposed to many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
<hi>from within,</hi> and <hi>from without:</hi> and
every Man finds that he hath enough to
do, to govern his own Spirit, and to bear
his own Burden. Let us not add to it,
by Offence, and mutual Provocation of
one another. It may be, did we but
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:56135:193"/>
know, and were acquainted with the
Condition of others; we our selves would
think it very hard measure, to add to their
Sorrow: and we would rather help to
bear their Burdens.</p>
                  <p>'Tis but <hi>a just Allowance for the Frailty
of the present State.</hi> For, no Man's <hi>Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Constitution</hi> is the Matter of his own
<hi>Choice;</hi> or within his own <hi>Power.</hi> If it
be <hi>Choler;</hi> that exposeth a Man to Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Fury: if <hi>Melancholly;</hi> to Sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Severity: if <hi>Flegmatick;</hi> that
exposeth a Man to Dullness, Heaviness,
and Sleep: if <hi>Blood;</hi> to Frowardness,
Petulancy, and Wantonness. And our
Minds are tempted to comply with Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Temper.
'Tis only by <hi>Vertue</hi> that a
Man doth bear up against Bodily-Temper
and Constitution. It is very apparent,
that the Material Part of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi>
have a Foundation in Bodily-Temper:
* <hi>tho'</hi> it * <hi>be</hi> neither Vertue nor Vice as it
is the effect thereof: but Vertue and Vice
are constituted by the Consent of the
Mind. Yet this I say, that our Souls pay
the dearest Rent in the World, for their
Habitation in these Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, to pass this; He is little
sensible of the Frailty of Humane Nature,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:56135:193"/>
who doth not make <hi>fair Allowance,</hi> and
<hi>candid Construction;</hi> who doth not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
incline to the better part; who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
over-look Mistakes; and have Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with Men a-while, till they recover
themselves out of Passion. And much more
unmindful are they, and forgetful of the
Incidencies belonging to this State, who
set themselves to exasperate, inflame, and
further to provoke, by unkind Returns
and Misconstructions, beyond and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Man's Meaning and Intention.</p>
                  <p>But, I see there is one thing that will
rise up, with a colourable Pretence
against all that I have said; if it be not
removed: and that is, in case of different
Apprehension in some things about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
in which case Men say, it is <hi>Zeal
of God, for Truth;</hi> and that they ought
to be <hi>zealous for the Truth;</hi> and think
they may prosecute their Brother upon
that account; because he is not of their
Judgment: he is in an Error, they say,
and therefore they think they ought to
bear him down, upon this account.
Therefore, this Pretence must be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.
To which end I shall suggest these
several Considerations.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> It cannot be avoided, but that
Men <hi>must think, as they find cause.</hi> For,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:56135:194"/>
this is most certain, that no Man is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of his own Apprehensions: but he
must think (and cannot avoid it) <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he finds cause.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is no Offence to another,
that any Man hath the Freedom of his
own Thoughts. By this, he doth his
Neighbour no Wrong. For, Thoughts
make no Alteration abroad; nor make
any Disturbance: and a wise Man will
enjoy these, and not expose them in a
disorderly manner. For, a generous No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not to be prostituted. Truth is too
noble a thing to be * <hi>exposed</hi> in case of
Mens Dullness and Incapacity; in case of
Indisposition and Prudence. Men may be
unqualified for hearing Truth; as I <hi>Cor.
3. 3. where there is Envying, Strife, and
Division.</hi> He is a conceited Fool that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enjoy his own Thoughts; and keep
them from such as are not capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them. This was the Notion of the
Philosophers who distinguished between
the Truths that were fit to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to <hi>those without,</hi> and to those <hi>that
were prepared.</hi> They would not cast their
Pearls before Swine.</item>
                     <item>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Serious and considerate
Persons, * <hi>such as</hi> are real, and sincere in
their Religion, do not <hi>greatly</hi> differ; to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:56135:194"/>
wit, <hi>not in those things wherein the Honour
of God, or the Safety of Mens Souls are
concerned:</hi> (for, these are <hi>the substantial
things</hi> in Religion:) neither do they see
that <hi>that</hi> follows which one that doth
dissent from them, doth infer to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of either. Yea, they are so far
from admitting any such Consequence;
that they will much rather renounce their
Opinion, than hold any thing that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prejudicial to <hi>God's Honour,</hi> or <hi>the
Safety of Mens Souls.</hi> This I dare under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
is really true of all that are sincere and
hearty in their Profession of Religion.
And therefore to these there is due, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Charity. I am much of <hi>his</hi>
Mind that did thus apologize for those
that did dissent, tho' they were in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
<hi>
                           <q>They do not err in their Affection to
God, Religion, and Goodness: tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they are mistaken in their Choice.</q>
                        </hi>
But, then, 'tis far better for Men to have
some Mistakes in their way; than to be
devoid of Religion. 'Tis better for Men
to be in some Mistakes about Religion,
than wholly to neglect it. These very
things argue that the Persons are awake;
and are in search after Truth; even
there, where they have not attained to
it.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="368" facs="tcp:56135:195"/>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whatever private Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are in other Matters; wise and good
Men do observe the Measures of Peace and
Order <hi>in foro externo.</hi> For, they go by
this Rule, <hi>that Peace and Good-will among
Men, is of greater consequence than any
private Apprehension.</hi> Therefore, wise and
good Men do so moderate themselves, that
they will observe the Rules of Peace and
Order.—<hi>Zeal</hi> in defence of Truth; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
in observation thereof, are high
<hi>Titles;</hi> Things of <hi>great Name:</hi> But
greatest Mischief follows, when Passion
and Interest are <hi>so cloath'd.</hi> The <hi>Priests</hi>
and <hi>Pharisees</hi> were <hi>our Saviour's</hi> Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers:
<hi>The Zealots</hi> were the Destruction
of the City and Temple (as <hi>Josephus</hi>
gives account:) The <hi>Jesuits</hi> denominated
from <hi>Jesus,</hi> are the Incendiaries of the
World. The more of our Fancy there
is in that we take up, for our Religion;
the more warm we are in defence of it.
We love our own Creatures, and doat
on our own Notions. Who hath Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
on his side, satisfies himself that the
best is done that can be done, when
Reason is shewn: he trusts to it, sits
down, expecting that Reason shou'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="369" facs="tcp:56135:195"/>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We are all, whether we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
or agree one with another in <hi>some
Matters,</hi> agreed about <hi>this;</hi> that we all
ought to be guided by Scripture. Now
<hi>Scripture</hi> is clear, full, and perspicuous,
in all Matters <hi>of Life;</hi> and absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
* <hi>in</hi> all Matters of <hi>necessary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi>
But, in other Things; we being
removed above Sixteen hundred Years
from the Apostles; and, since in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate
Ages, many Things have been
agitated by the several Parties, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and yet not agreed
about; and since it doth hardly appear,
what was the <hi>Apostle's</hi> Judgment in those
controverted Matters; since they are * <hi>what</hi>
we cannot certainly determine by their
Writings; and no Application to be made
to any Person inspired since * <hi>that time</hi>
in the Succession of Ages; if we do err
in these Matters, it is much less than if
we had lived in <hi>their</hi> Times. They that
are settled in the great Matters of Life and
Faith, will out-wear Mistakes in lesser
Matters: Or, if they do not; I dare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake,
from the Warrant of Scripture,
that if they hold the Head, <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi>
such Mistakes shall not hurt them. For
this, see <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:56135:196"/>Therefore I do resolve, that by that
time we have made due Allowance for the
different <hi>Tempers</hi> of Men; for the different
<hi>Make</hi> of Mens Parts; for <hi>Mistakes</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
from Company and Converse; as
also for those that have been occasion'd
from our Education; and for <hi>Conceits</hi>
rooted in Men, and become natural to
them, because they have so long thought
after this or that Manner; we shall * <hi>in
the End</hi> find little Reason for Anger and
Displeasure towards one another upon
this account. The different <hi>Make</hi> of Mens
Parts is such, that <hi>ab origine</hi> without any
Affectation, Contrivance, or Design (which
are the Things that make Men culpable)
Foundation is laid of disagreeing Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions.
* <hi>For</hi> some Mens Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cannot possibly hit, in any Thing:
They are, as it were, cast in different
Moulds: * <hi>And</hi> they can no more help
this, than they can make their Faces to be
alike. We may look at this, as an Effect
of the various Wisdom of the Creator.
'Tis no more faulty, than that <hi>one Star
differeth from another, in Glory:</hi> Since the
Wisdom of God appears in the several
Dissimilitudes and Diversities that are in
the World; different Makes, Shapes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
as to the Body; different
Senses, Imaginations, Choices, Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as to the Mind; Varieties and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:56135:196"/>
above us, and beneath us.—I
say it again; that by that time we have
made a just Allowance for our different
Tempers and Constitutions, which are
not <hi>subject to our Choice;</hi> for our different
Makes, where upon such Variety of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
depend; since there are Men
of such different Makes, that in nothing
they think alike (or, at least, they do not
express themselves alike, where they mean
the same Thing;) by that time we have
made Allowance for the Error and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
of our own Age, and the Ages that
have been before us; when we shall have
made Allowance for the general Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which oft take place; for pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Opinions from Education, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and Converse; for Conceits root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Men, and become natural to them,
because they have long thought so; by
that time we have made a just Allowance
for all these Considerations, and Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
proportionable; we shall find little
Reason for Anger and Displeasure with
one another, upon occasion of these Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
                  <p>I add, further; that since <hi>Religion</hi> is a Bond
of Union, and lays an Obligation upon us
to God, and to one another; it ought not
to be a Ground of any Difference or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure:
And, Religion is <hi>in an unnatural
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:56135:197"/>
Use,</hi> if it doth disunite. Neither are we
qualified to pursue Truth, or to find it
out; unless our Minds be discharged of
all Ill-will, Anger, and Displeasure. For,
Envy, Ill-will, Strife, and Contention,
are as prejudicial as any other inordinate
Affection whatsoever. Sublime Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
cannot dwell in an unquiet Spirit.</p>
                  <p>'Tis wholly an Unchristian Temper
that is given to Strife and Contention:
As might be shewn by several Scriptures,
1 Cor. 1. 10. <hi>I beseech you by the Lord
Jesus Christ,</hi> (See what an Obligation is
here! And for <hi>what</hi> is it! Namely this)
<hi>That you all speak the same Thing, and that
there be no Divisions among you,</hi> &amp;c. So
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. the Apostle tells them that
they were <hi>Carnal,</hi> because there was among
them <hi>Envyings, Strife, and Divisions.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doth more unqualifie a Man for
Divine and Heavenly Knowledge than
this Temper. So <hi>Jam. 3. Ver.</hi> 13, 14, &amp;c.
—If Men value themselves by their
Opinions, and different Apprehensions
from others; and so far arrogate to
themselves, as to reprobate other Men for
not entertaining their Opinions; there
must of Necessity be high Provocations,
great Exasperations. Whereas, if Men
do calmly propose, with a Submission of
their Sense to an impartial Examination;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:56135:197"/>
then, the Things that are offer'd will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into Consideration: And Men may
be either better inform'd; or else they
will be further confirm'd in what they
thought before; if they find that other
Persons Grounds are inferior to theirs.
Upon which account it is true Kindness,
to impart <hi>what</hi> one finds Cause to believe;
and <hi>what</hi> the Grounds are of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion:
Leaving the Party to judge, as
he finds Cause. Yea, I account it the
greatest Kindness that one Man can do to
another; better to inform his Judgment;
and, then, leave him to consider. For,
he that is Wise, when he is apart, will
call into Examination what he hath
heard: And, if what hath been offer'd,
be that which he had not consider'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or taken notice of; so that he finds
that what was declared was Weighty; he
will hereupon find Cause to alter his
Judgment.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Lastly,</hi> PASSION is so exorbitant
a Thing, that it is not to be confined to
any Measure of <hi>Reason.</hi> For, it is in our
Minds, as Fire in our Houses; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and destroys all that stands before
it: And the more it goes on, the more
Harm it doth. So it is with <hi>Passion,</hi> if
not presently allay'd: It will break
forth, as Wild-fire. <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi>
                     <pb n="374" facs="tcp:56135:198"/>
are Things that have Bonnds and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits:
But <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> are bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
                  <p>The Work of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Government</hi>
in every Degree, is, <hi>the maintaining of
Peace; preserving every Body in his Right;</hi>
and <hi>the continuing Friendship, general Love,
and Good-will amongst Men.</hi> He who hath
the Advantage in any Association or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Men, is chiefly bound to
maintain general Good-will, Friendship,
Love. 'Tis the Life of Society. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of Men each with other, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
it, and depends upon it. In CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSE
the Rule is, <hi>Give and receive:</hi>
Wherefore * <hi>this is</hi> call'd Intercourse; * <hi>as
implying</hi> a Communication by way of
Exchange; Notion for Notion; Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
for Apprehension; one Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Affection, for another. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
better never <hi>meet</hi> (as much as it is
desirable in it self,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 16.</note> or recommended * <hi>in
Scripture;</hi>) than to come together to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke,
inflame, exasperate one another.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 25</note> It
is a Charge on every one who comes into
Company, not to misbehave himself:
That neither he himfelf, nor others, part
the worse <hi>for having met.</hi> Whatever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
is not peaceable, tending to Love
and Good-will, and govern'd thereby;
is to Loss; is no good Expence of Time;
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:56135:198"/>
is not accountable. If we will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted;
let Friendship be between us:
Else we should remain Strangers. One
wou'd wonder, when one thinks on it,
that Persons who meet to converse toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
shou'd fall out, and quarrel; and
that, all shou'd end (as it does <hi>sometimes</hi>)
in a Duel, and Thirst after one another's
Blood: That instead of Pleasure and
Satisfaction of Conversation; there shou'd
be Provocation, Exasperation: That where
Acquaintance began, for a Foundation of
Love, and Good-will, mutual Kindness
and Beneficence for the future; there
shou'd be Seeds sown of Ill-will, and
lasting Displeasure, sometimes entail'd on
Posterity. But, on the other side: How
well pleas'd Persons are severally, when
they part in Love? How uneasie, if in
Displeasure? What different After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts
in these two Cases? other Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,
Purposes, Intentions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions:
<hi>And this,</hi> according as Carriage
has been in Company.</p>
                  <p>I conclude; one wou'd not live out of
Good-will, for ones own Ease and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Whosoever bears not Good-will,
hath <hi>that</hi> within himself which tempts
him to ill Offices. His Thoughts run out,
on defence of himself, and disabling the
other; as if he were his Enemy. Sense
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:56135:199"/>
of his own Ill-will in himself, makes
him jealous and suspicious of the like
from the other. For, who suspects, thinks
himself suspected. We do not think
them our Friends, to whom we are not
Friends. We think not better of others,
than our selves: Nor impute to others,
the good Disposition we have not.—
Now after all this said, and shewn, for
general Love, and mutual Good-will;
how grievous wou'd it be, to come into
any of your Company, where any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Offence were either given, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
any unkind Word spoken; any Cause
of Provocation, or Ground of Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
or any thing contrary to Peace,
hearty Affection, mutual Love, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will?
Things, the Foundation whereof,
are laid in the Nature of Man (who was
made sociable) and which the Gospel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
and doth reinforce.—
From all that hath been said, I shall
make some <hi>Inferences,</hi> and so conclude.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>In the <hi>First Place;</hi> acknowledge we
the Excellency of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whose Doctrine and Practice are such
as you have heard. <hi>Religion</hi> was given
us by God, for the Good of Men, both
severally, and jointly. 'Tis for a Man's
Security, for his Benefit, and Advantage.
It gives a Man Heart's-ease, and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:56135:199"/>
of Mind: Sets him right, in the
Government of himself; and also enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
him to good Behaviour to all other
Men. Therefore, I may say; whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he be, that hath heard, read, or
consider'd the Doctrine and Principles
of the Christian Religion; if he wish
well to Mankind, he will stand up, and
bless that Doctrine; and say as <hi>Solomon</hi>
doth, of his excellent Woman:<note place="margin">Pro. 31. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>Many
Daughters have done vertuously; but thou
hast excelled them all.</hi> The very Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of ordinary Philosophy, if put in
Practice, do abate the Fierceness of Mens
Minds, and will not suffer them to be
Exorbitant, Furious, Wild and Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.
But, Christianity roots out the
very Foundation of all Ill-will; and
doth bind a Man absolutely to good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour:
And engage him to all the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Love, Good-will, and Charity.
So that, did any Man rise up amongst us,
and act Christianity to the Life, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Notions, Rules and Principles
of it; it might be said of him, as of
<hi>Noah;</hi> that he was <hi>a Preacher of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 5.</note> Tho' he held his Tongue; tho'
silent; he shou'd yet speak, and appear
most admirable to all the World; and
be the most effectual Preacher. But, <hi>here</hi>
is the Unhappiness: We do not live up
to our <hi>Christian Profession;</hi> nor do that
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:56135:200"/>
Good which we might: And, tho' we
are Orthodox in our Judgment, and
speak well; yet we speak and profess
more than we practise: And upon this
account, it comes to be prejudiced; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are not in Temper and Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor in Life and Practice, <hi>what</hi> we
profess.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> From hence we learn how
unnatural to the Temper and Spirit of
Christianity are our brave <hi>Warriors,</hi> and
mighty <hi>Conquerors,</hi> that over-run Nations,
and put all into Hurry and Confusion,
to enlarge their Bounds and Territories.
How unnatural are these Things to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity!
Never any Thing in the World
so contrary to Christianity, as <hi>Wars,
Commotions, Exasperations,</hi> and <hi>Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we profess out selves to be
<hi>Christians;</hi> then let us take Care to govern
our Spirits, and rule our Tongues, and
to direct our Actions, according to <hi>our
Profession.</hi> For, we have no Religion,
if we do not these Things. At least, let
us take Care to be Innocent, and Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less:
And especially, how we use our
Tongues. For, St. <hi>James</hi> hath told us,
what a World of Mischief comes by the
Tongue; that it is a <hi>little Member; but
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:56135:200"/>
full of deadly Poyson;<note place="margin">Jam. 3. 8.</note> and doth set on fire,
and is set on fire, of Hell.</hi> But, this is the
Mischief too; that the Tongue doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the Sence of the Mind: For, <hi>Out of
the Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth
speaketh:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 34.</note> And Men shew their Spirits by
their Words and Actions. If the Heart were
free from Rancour, Malice, and Ill-will;
the Miscarriage of the Tongue wou'd be
very rare, and * <hi>would be much</hi> less: For,
then, there wou'd be no Ill intended. But,
Men do greatly disparage themselves by
sudden, rash, and inconsiderate Speeches.
By nothing can a Man sooner discover an
Unchristian Frame of Spirit, than by an
ungovern'd and unbridled Tongue.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let us still remember, when
there is any occasion of Dispute, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
that we are under the Obligation
of Christians: And let any Man rather
choose to abate of his <hi>Right,</hi> than to
lose his <hi>Charity.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> From hence we see that <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers</hi>
and <hi>Reconcilers</hi> are the Men that
do truly Christian Offices; and that * <hi>the
contrary sort</hi> are the Devil's Instruments
in the World.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="380" facs="tcp:56135:201"/>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Government, <hi>we see,</hi> hath a
good Foundation: For, it keeps all in
Peace, and binds Men to fair Carriage,
and good Behaviour: Upon which Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>it</hi> is of mighty Use in the World.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> Whosoever hath not a Penny
to bestow, whereby he may express his
Charity; yet he may be more charitable,
than if he gave Pounds. For, it is the
choicest Piece of Charity; to make fair
Interpretations, and to give Allowance;
to make candid Construction of Mens
Actions; to afford civil and courteous
Behaviour; to be Conversant and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent.
These Things tend to maintain
<hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Good-will</hi> among Men; than
which there is nothing more creditable
to the Christian Religion; nor any thing
more subservient to the great End of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Edification. So that this Argument
doth extend it self to all Persons: And
a Man may be transcendantly charitable,
as to the most sublime Acts thereof, tho'
he have not one Penny; if he be a Man
of a fair Carriage, one that affords equal
and candid Construction, and takes
Things in good part; is Affable, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
in all things Accountable, and ready
to give Satisfaction; and one that does
all that lies in him, to maintain Love,

and Good-will in the World. This Man
is of a most Christian Temper, and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable</hi>
in the most excellent Sense.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>You see how many Arguments I have
suggested, to engage Men to Humanity,
Courtesie, and Universal Charity; * <hi>so as</hi> if
it were possible, to promote a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
in the whole Creation of God.
—* <hi>Now</hi> by Humanity, fair Carriage, and
Suitableness of Disposition, a Man doth
gain a general Interest; and this is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to a Man's self. Also, * <hi>in acting thus,</hi>
he doth act according to the true <hi>Genius</hi> of
Human Nature. For, there is in Man, a
secret <hi>Genius</hi> to Humanity; a <hi>Bias</hi> that
inclines him to a Regard of all of his
own Kind. For, whatsoever some have
said; <hi>Man's Nature</hi> is not such an unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Thing (unless it be abused,) but
that there is a secret <hi>Sympathy</hi> in Human
Nature, with Vertue and Honesty; with
Fairness and good Behaviour; which
gives a Man an Interest even in bad Men;
* <hi>and</hi> whereby they are even before they
are aware, inclined to reverence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
such a Person. And tho' through
Passion, and Interest, and bad Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
they are put off from the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of <hi>It;</hi> yet they cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<hi>it,</hi> and <hi>them</hi> that practise it: Upon
which account, it is observ'd by the <hi>wise
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:56135:202"/>
Man;</hi> that they who retain their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and live according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Humane Nature; they are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the Judgment of such Persons,
from whose Humour, and Practice, they
do altogether depart. Wherefore, we
may detest and reject that Doctrine
which saith, that God made Man <hi>in a
State of War.</hi> Undoubtedly, Man, if
he have not abused himself, is the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Creature under Heaven. <hi>Man</hi> is a
sociable Creature, delights in Company
and Converse: and, by Conception of
Notions, and Power of Utterance, is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Conversation. It is delightful
for <hi>one</hi> Man to see the face of <hi>another:</hi>
for, a Man sees another <hi>self,</hi> another of
the same * <hi>kind,</hi> (all being made by the
same <hi>Exemplar;</hi> after the Image of God:)
and, a Man wou'd not, on any terms, be
in the World, with Creatures below him:
* <hi>which wou'd be</hi> Presence; * <hi>but</hi> not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
It is not more pleasurable to see
the Sun, after a cold dark Night; than
it is chearing and reviving, in the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Confusion of our Thoughts, to
refresh our Mind by Presence and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Person we love. * <hi>But,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
spoils the Nature of Man, as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
more than <hi>false ZEAL.</hi> What can
we think of the Uncharitable, Envious,
Malicious, Spightful? Of <hi>those</hi> who are
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:56135:202"/>
Quarelsom, Contentious, Litigious? Of
<hi>those</hi> who are Revengeful, Implacable?
—Cruel, Burdensome, Intollerable?
—Selfish; who care for no Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
themselves?—Given up to Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Wrathful, Furious?—Traducers,
Defamers of others, Back-biters? Who
plot, contrive to destroy <hi>for Religion's
sake;</hi> are Barbarous, Inhumane, Bloody,
to serve Ends of Religion?</p>
                  <div type="part">

                     <p>Is this the Religion of Christ? Is such
a Religion worth having? Is not <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature</hi>
which Man is born to, a better
Thing? Is not the Vertue Heathens have
applauded and practised, far more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?
—Yet some who pretend to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
are <hi>such.</hi>—But they must change
their Nature; or lay side the Profession.
If <hi>this</hi> be Religion; <hi>what</hi> is worse?—
Common, <hi>Good-nature</hi> makes Men inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
harmless, inoffensive, conversable.
If the Party's Religion doth not this, at
least; it is something else in the place of
Religion. We say * <hi>it</hi> of some, <hi>that they
are the worse for their Religion;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<hi>Good-natur'd Persons.</hi> How strange
is it, that any shou'd be so mistaken, as in

things as <hi>Reason</hi> is against, and <hi>Nature</hi>

Now to draw up all in a Conclusion.
We are all of us, in respect of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
free, absolute and independent;
having our own proper Employment, and
Concernment, both for Time, and for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity:
and it may be said of us all, in
this respect, we are our own Masters; and
must stand or fall by our own Actions:<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4.</note>
But we have not liberty <hi>to judge, and pass
Sentence upon our Fellow-servants:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have we ought to do with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
save only to do for one another all
the Good we can; and to receive from
each other, what Good we may. We
have nothing to do to usurp Authority,
and tyrannize in God's Family; or <hi>to
beat our Fellow-servants.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 45</note> Yea, our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Relations each to other, lay a new
Foundation of mutual good Offices,
and payment of Respect. And we may
do Good, and receive Good from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more ways than one. That is true,
which God said to <hi>Moses: I have made
thee a God to</hi> Pharaoh; <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 1. A
Man, to a Man, is, in a Sence, <hi>in the place
of God.</hi> When God made <hi>a second,</hi> it
was (in his Intention) to be a Help to
<hi>the First.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may, and ought to be <hi>helpful to
each other;</hi> and if we were as we should
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:56135:203"/>
be, we shou'd be the better provided for,
the more People there were, and the
more Men we had, in the World. * <hi>As
Particularly:</hi>—By <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Advice;</hi>
in case of Ignorance, Uncertainty, and
Inexperience: for, some have Knowledge
in <hi>some</hi> things, and others in <hi>other.</hi> And
herein we may be greatly profitable each
to other:—By administring <hi>Comfort,</hi> and
<hi>Incouragement * to one another,</hi> in case of
Entanglement, and Suffering:—Also,
<hi>in a way of Supplement,</hi> where we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient,
either to bear our Burden, or
discharge our Duty: upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it is said, <hi>Woe to him that is alone:<note place="margin">Eccl. 4. 10.</note>
for, if he fall, there is none to help him up.</hi>
'Tis well spoken of <hi>Seneca</hi> in this case:
<q>A Man is so made for Society; and it is
so useful for Men, to join themselves to
each other; that there is no Man (<hi>he
says</hi>) to whom it is not better to be
with <hi>any Body,</hi> than always <hi>by himself,</hi>
alone.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, <hi>to do one another Harm;</hi> and, <hi>to
receive Harm from each other,</hi> in any kind
whatsoever. I say <hi>this.</hi>—It is violent,
and unnatural, in respect of the Purpose
and Intention of God's Creation. For,
the Apostle tells us, that <hi>God made, of
one Blood, all the Nations of the Earth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 17. 26.</note>
We are as Members of <hi>one</hi> Family; and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:56135:204"/>
proceed from <hi>one</hi> Stock. And from hence,
there is a Foundation laid, of mutual
good Offices: and to do otherwise, is
violent, monstrous, and unnatural.—
It is to break through, and cast off the
superadded Obligation that is laid upon
us, by the Christian Religion.—It is
to make <hi>the World</hi> less tolerable, habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and passable, than it is <hi>of it self.</hi> For,
do we the best we can; the World is bad
enough. And we shall contribute to
make Times and Places worse; if we do
not discharge our selves in mutual good
Offices one towards another; or, at least,
if we be grievous one to another.</p>
                     <p>From this which I have now super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
to all that went before, you may
understand that it is with very great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that the Apostle doth call upon us, to
be <hi>kind; full of Bowels and Compassion;
read to gratifie and forgive:</hi> that so we
may be <hi>mutually helpful</hi> one to another;
and, by the Comfort that we afford to
each other, make the <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> we
live in, <hi>the better.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, could I perswade to <hi>this;</hi> It
wou'd be as <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> coming down
from Heaven; and the very Angels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
among us: Even those <hi>Blessed
Spirits</hi> that give God Thanks for his Grace
and Goodness towards Men; and cry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
<hi>Glory to God on high, Peace on
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:56135:204"/>
Earth, Good-will to the Sons of Men.</hi>—
O Blessed Spirits that are free from that
Canker of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Malice!</hi> Who, tho'
they see Man's Nature advanced above
theirs, in the Person of our Saviour; yet
they are not agriev'd at it; but rejoyce,
and bless God, for his Goodness to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind!
—It is Divine, Heavenly, and
Angelical, <hi>to take delight in the Good of
others.</hi> Certainly, we are not well settled
in our Judgments, as to <hi>this Point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
which makes us so negligent in our
Duty. It is too much the Practice of the
World; <hi>every Man</hi> to be <hi>for himself;</hi> and
to leave <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>for us all.</hi> We general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practice so weakly and uncertainly in
this Matter; as if we had not consider'd
the Obligation that Christianity lays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us to <hi>this Duty.</hi> Whereas, it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and indispensibly necessary, that
whosoever professeth the Faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
* <hi>should</hi> live in <hi>universal Love</hi> and
<hi>Good-will.</hi> And, if any Man find himself
averse hereto; and hard to be satisfied, in
case of Offence, and Provocation; I will
yet further superadd <hi>three</hi> great Mischiefs
that will follow upon it.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>First,</hi> We do not at all express <hi>our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of the Goodness of God,</hi> in
Christ.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we carry in our Breasts,
any Ill-will, Malice, or Displeasure, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:56135:205"/>
any one; it is an Argument that we
our selves <hi>are.not forgiven of God.</hi> For, did
we believe that we our selves were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
of God; we shou'd afford to do
the like, and to forgive our Brother.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By this means we do unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and indispose our selves for Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and <hi>to believe the Pardon of our Sins</hi>
at the Hand of God. For, that which
the Psalmist saith,<note place="margin">Ps. 50. 21.</note> 
                           <hi>Thou thoughtest that I
was altogether such a one as thy self,</hi> proves
often among Men. And <hi>that</hi> which a
Man approves and allows in himself, he
will attribute and ascribe unto God. No
<hi>ill-natured</hi> People think well of God. If
a Man allow himself to live in Ill-will,
and to entertain Displeasure, and Thoughts
and Purposes of Revenge; he will think
that <hi>God,</hi> having all Power; and being
more offended by <hi>us,</hi> than we are by <hi>one
another;</hi> will certainly be avenged of us.
And, I will never believe that an <hi>ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd</hi>
Man, one that lives in Malice and
Displeasure, one that hath Thoughts of
Revenge, and one that aggravates Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
can think <hi>that God will pardon HIM.</hi>
For, if we do believe that God hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
<hi>us;</hi> it will engage us to pardon <hi>one
another.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>And, further: Let it be considered, that
we, that are sometimes prejudiced by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:56135:205"/>
may at other times do a Prejudice
our selves; accidentally, if not designed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And, as we wou'd desire that a Man
shou'd either wholly forgive, or set down
with moderate Satisfaction; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
shou'd we deal with our Brother that
hath offended us. For, who is it that hath
not at some time or other transgress'd and
given an Offence? Therefore, let us not
too long insist upon an Injury, nor too
long remember it. The noble Philosopher
saith, <q>'Tis a more generous thing <hi>to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
and take no notice</hi> of an Injury, than
to pardon it.</q> And, if we wou'd secure
our selves; it is best so to do: for, if we
seem to resent an Injury; we make a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
our Enemy: whereas, if we overlook
it; or turn it off, by a candid Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
we shall win and engage him: and
he will think that we are better natur'd
than himself.</p>
                     <p>Nay, further yet: By <hi>Candid Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
or by <hi>overlooking an Injury,</hi> we shall
frustrate the Ill Design of him that intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us ill. Such a Man must think with
himself, how base a thing it is, to design
Harm towards so innocent, so harmless,
and worthy a Person, that will by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
and Candour, interpret an Injury
into a Kindness. Whereas, if we be too
quick in our Resentments; we may make
<hi>that</hi> an Injury, which was none: and so
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                           <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                        <pb n="390" facs="tcp:56135:207"/>
disturb our selves, when we might have
been quiet. For, certainly, if a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
his own Ease, Quiet, and Satisfaction;
and will keep himself in <hi>a God-like Frame</hi>
and <hi>Temper;</hi> he will not live in Malice,
and Ill-will; nor continue Displeasure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And thus I have done with this great
Argument,</hi> Let all Bitterness, and Wrath,
and Anger, &amp;c. be put away: And, be ye kind
one to another, tender-hearted; forgiving
one another, even as God, for Christ's sake,
hath forgiven you.</p>

That I may not loose my Labour; I now

give me the Man, of whom I may * <hi>say;</hi>
                     <q>This is the Person, who in the true

hath brought himself
into such a Temper as is con-natural
to those Principles, and warranted
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:56135:208"/>
thereby.</q> Of all other Men, I may
say; that they have neglected their chief
Business; and have forgot the great Work
that was in their hand; and what ought
chiefly to be done in the World. For,
the greatest thing that lies upon every one
to do; is the Regulating of his own
Mind, and Spirit. And he that hath not
done this, hath been in the World to little
purpose. For, this is the Business of Life;
to inform our Understandings; to refine
our Spirits; and, then, to regulate the
Actions of our Lives: to settle, * <hi>I say,</hi>

of Appetite:</hi> but * <hi>so as</hi> always * <hi>to be</hi>
governed according to the Measures, and
Rules, of Reason and Vertue.—<hi>No
Partiality, or Self-flattery. * One of</hi> a meek
Spirit, does not over-value himself. * <hi>Those
of</hi> the contrary Temper, are always put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves into a Fool's Paradise;
conceiting above what there is Sense or
Reason for.—<hi>No impotent Self-will.</hi> He
that gives way to <hi>Self-will,</hi> is an Enemy
to his own Peace, and is the great Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the World: He is an <hi>Anti-God;</hi>
imposeth upon God himself; and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
no Law.—* And, (in the last place)
<hi>No fond Self-Love.</hi> All these are Verities
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:56135:209"/>
of this <hi>MEEK</hi> and <hi>quiet Spirit.</hi> And these
are great things, and tend to Happiness;
are suitable to our State; becoming the
Relation we stand in, to God, and to one
another. The <hi>Meek in Temper</hi> are freed
from all those internal Dispositions that
cause a great deal of Unquietness in the
World. For, as mischievous as the World
either is, or is thought to be; our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<hi>from abroad,</hi> all the Injuries that
we meet with <hi>from without,</hi> are neither so
great, nor so frequent, as the Annoyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that arise from <hi>the Discomposure of our
own Minds,</hi> and from <hi>inward Malignity.</hi>
I say, that they who complain * so much
<hi>of the Times,</hi> and <hi>of the World,</hi> * may learn
<hi>this;</hi> that the Sufferings from injurious
Dealings from any <hi>without us,</hi> are nothing
in comparison to those we find <hi>from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
For, this inward Malady doth alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
disable the Fences and Succours of
Reason. This is a constant Malady: and
* <hi>by this,</hi> Self-enjoyment is * <hi>made</hi> very
uncertain.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This is the</hi> First <hi>thing; that through</hi>
MEEKNESS OF SPIRIT, we are always
in a Calm; have fair Weather within our
own Breasts; and do arrive to a good State
of Health, and Settlement.</p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Through this <hi>MEEKNESS
OF SPIRIT, there is good Carriage and
Behaviour towards others.</hi>—The <hi>Meek</hi>
are never injurious, or censorious: but
are ready to take in good part, and make
the best Construction that the Case will
bear. They will account other Mens
Faults, rather their Infirmity, than their
Crime: and they look upon the Harm
done them by others, to be rather Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency,
than Design; rather contingent
ill Accidents, than bad Meaning.—The
<hi>Meek</hi> Man, is a good Neighbour; a good
Friend; a Credit to Religion; one that
governs himself according to Reason;
makes no Injury by any Misconstruction;
and in case of any Wrong done, sits down
with easie Satisfaction.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>How much do Men differ, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Moderation, Meekness,</hi> and <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi>
We find, upon our ordinary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to some Persons, that they will
admit any reasonable and fair Proposal;
be ready to hear, and take in good part;
are of easie Access; fair conditioned;
easie to be intreated: but others * <hi>there
are,</hi> of so bad a Condition, that you may
come twenty times to them, before you
find them in a good Mood, or fit to be
dealt withal. They are seldom in so good
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:56135:210"/>
a Disposition that an indifferent Proposal
may be made to them. But, * <hi>for those</hi>
that are of <hi>Meek</hi> and <hi>quiet Spirits,</hi> I may
say of such Persons, either that they are
very ready to grant what is desired: or
else, if they do deny; it shall be upon
such Grounds of Reason, as will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie.</p>
                  <p>But, because things are best known by
their Contraries; I will shew you WHO
those Persons are, of whom it cannot be
said, <hi>that they are OF MEEK AND
QUIET SPIRITS:</hi> to wit, <hi>the Proud,
the Arrogant, Insolent, Haughty, Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
Self-confident, and Assuming.</hi> For,
these are Boisterous, Stormy, Tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Clamorous. These Persons wil put
themselves and others, as much as they
can, into a Flame. These are the Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Mankind: and their Neighbours
are rid of a Burthen, when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.
What <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Tempests</hi> are
in the World Natural, <hi>these</hi> are in the
World Moral. Earthquakes, Storms, and
Tempests, do not lie more heavy upon the
World Natural, than these Men do upon
the World of Mankind. But, <hi>Meekness</hi>
doth so qualifie the Soil, where it is;
that all the <hi>Moral Vertues</hi> will * <hi>there</hi>
thrive and prosper: such as <hi>Humility, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
Patience, Ingenuity, Candour.</hi> But,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:56135:211"/>
                     <hi>Malice,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> are the worst of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
being the greatest Degeneracy, and
Participation of the Devilish Nature. <hi>These</hi>
have no place in this <hi>Meek</hi> and <hi>quiet
Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> I add, that an <hi>ILL-NATU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RED
Person, is altogether uncapable of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</hi>
If, therefore, it hath been any
one's Lot, either to have been born, or
bred, to <hi>an Ill-nature;</hi> I say in this case,
He is more concerned to apply a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
than he that hath received a Deadly
Wound, or is Bodily Sick, hath to apply
himself to the Chyrurgion, or to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician;
least his Wound or Disease should
prove Mortal. For, these inward Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
will otherwise prove fatal to his
Soul: and the only Remedy to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is <hi>Self-Reflection, due Consideration,
Self-Examination,</hi> and <hi>the Exercise and
Practice of Vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Observe, now, the Incompetency of
the World's Judgment. How fond and
partial is the World; who do applaud
the <hi>Great Disturbers</hi> of Mankind, such as
make Havock and Desolation in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of God; bring in, Confusion; and
turn all into Hurly-Burly! giving * <hi>to
such</hi> as these, <hi>Titles of Honour:</hi> naming
them <hi>Conquerors,</hi> and <hi>Victorious</hi> Persons!
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:56135:211"/>
* <hi>How fond,</hi> (I say) <hi>and partial is the
World;</hi> who do so magnifie the Fame of
high-spirited, turbulent, self-will'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons!
thinking them Men of Courage and
Resolution: And, on the other hand;
accounting the Innocent and Harmless, to
be Persons of no Spirit or Activity.
Whereas, the greatest <hi>Sign of Power,</hi> and
<hi>bravest Performance</hi> in the Life of Man, is
<hi>to govern his own Spirit;</hi> and <hi>to subdue his
Passions.</hi> And, <hi>this,</hi> if the Scripture may
give Judgment, is the greatest <hi>Ornament</hi>
belonging to a Man; and that which is
the most valued by God, from whose
Judgment there is no Appeal. <hi>The Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in
the sight of God of great price.</hi> And, good
old <hi>Jacob</hi> when leaving the World; when
about to bless his Posterity, he came to
<hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi;</hi> remembering their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Cruelty, * <hi>it</hi> puts him to a loss, <hi>O my
Soul come not thou into their Secret, for
Instruments of Cruelty are in their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
&amp;c.<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 5, 6.</note> Things are very differently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<hi>above</hi> and <hi>below.</hi>—* <hi>And</hi> by
this, it appears that the Guise of the
World, and the Fancy of Men, are the
most impotent and fond things imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:56135:212"/>* <hi>And, further yet, as to the Judgment of
Scripture, in this case.</hi> This is the true
<hi>Temper</hi> of Religion, and prophesied of
the <hi>Gospel-State.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 11. 6. &amp; 65. 25. Matt. 5.</note> Our Saviour, in his
<hi>Beatitudes,</hi> begins with this Spirit. And,
that this is the Temper that shall rule, and
prevail, in the <hi>Gospel-State,</hi> consult these
Scriptures: <hi>Ephesians 4. 2. 1 Timothy</hi> 6. 11.
A Man cannot speak a good thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Meekness.</hi> If he speaks of <hi>God,</hi> of
Matters of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> he spoiles
that which he meddles with, if he be not
<hi>Meek.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 25.</note> For, we must <hi>IN MEEKNESS
instruct those that oppose themselves.</hi> No

will vanish; if it be not settled by thi<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

and indued with Knowledge amongst you;
let him shew, out of a good Conversation, his

Wisdom</hi> is not, but in Conjunction with
<hi>MEEKNESS.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15.</note> There is no Religious
Disposition, or good Conversation, where
it is not. <hi>Meekness</hi> must accompany all

or a Man's <hi>own Interest.</hi> Without this, we
are out of God's Way;<note place="margin">Psal. 25. 9.</note> and have not his
Blessing: and this is that Qualification
that makes us capable of the Promises of
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:56135:212"/>
the Gospel: tho' this Temper be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the incompetent World, a kind
of Sheepishness; and, such as these, are
thought to be Persons of no Mettle nor
Spirit: yet <hi>the Holy Spirit</hi> reckons other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
See how the Scripture reckons of
<hi>Moses:</hi> Of whom it is said,<note place="margin">Num. 12. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>He was the
MEEKEST Man upon Earth;</hi> and yet a
Person of great Courage and Resolution.
How doth he appear to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to his
Face? tho' threatned by <hi>Pharoah;</hi> who
was a Man of the greatest Power. How
did he act, in the greatest Dangers? Yet,
of this <hi>Moses,</hi> of whom the greatest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
are recorded; it is said, that
<hi>He was the MEEKEST Man upon Earth.</hi>
We read of the MESSIAS, <hi>that the Spirit
of the Lord shall rest upon him; the Spirit
of Councel and Might. With Righteousness
he shall judge the Poor; and reprove with
Equity, for the Meek of the Earth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 11. 2. &amp; 61. 1.</note> These
are Acts of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power:</hi> and
thus is the <hi>Messiah</hi> declared. Consider al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> useth the <hi>MEEKNESS</hi> of
<hi>our Saviour</hi> for an Argument to perswade
others to that Temper. <hi>I beseech you by
the Meekness and Gentleness of Christ.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 1.</note> And
<hi>Matthew</hi> 11. 29. our Saviour saith, <hi>Learn
of me; for, I am meek and lowly in Heart.</hi>
—From all that I have said, it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
very reasonable, that we should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
from the Judgment and Sentence of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:56135:213"/>
Worldly spirited Men, who applaud Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that are of <hi>venterous Undertakings,</hi>
of <hi>fierce Resolutions,</hi> of <hi>impotent Passions,</hi>
and <hi>unreasonable Affections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore let every Man, in the first
place, look after his <hi>Home-work;</hi> what
he hath to do <hi>at Home:</hi> to establish <hi>in
himself</hi> a due Frame and Temper of
Mind: for, till this be done, he is not fit
to walk <hi>abroad,</hi> or to have to do with <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
When this is done, then there will
be <hi>patient Forbearance,</hi> and <hi>making Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
This is that which the Apostle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth,
<hi>Galatians 6. 1. Brethren, if any
Man be overtaken in a Fault; ye which are
Spiritual, restore such an one, in the Spirit
of Meekness; considering thy self, least thou
also be tempted.</hi> If any one do us an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
and transgress, let us make him that
Allowance that God makes <hi>us:</hi> let us
make him an Abatement for <hi>the Weakness
of his Nature;</hi> and for <hi>the Multiplicity of
his Principles;</hi> for <hi>that Government that he
is charged withal.</hi> It may be, he may be
at odds with himself; and his inferiour
Appetites in Rebellion, and Confusion:
and it must be some time before he can
recover himself, and bring things into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
again, in his Family. God allows for
this; and we should allow for it, in one
another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:56135:213"/>'Tis necessary, whenever we have to do
with one another, that there should be
given <hi>fair Allowance,</hi> and Consideration
of Mens Infirmities, Tempers, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions.
For, it is a very hard thing,
for a Man to work off <hi>these.</hi> The <hi>Cholerick</hi>
are of quick and hasty Apprehension;
and readily do resent. The <hi>Flegmatick</hi>
are more dull and slow; and do not so
readily consider: they must have leisure,
and time: and what is said must be often
repeated; and * <hi>you must</hi> represent what
you have to say, with all advantage. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
they that are of <hi>Sanguine,</hi> and <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi>
Constitutions, do not fit * <hi>each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
That which is pleasing to one, is
grievous to the other. The Pleasantness
of the one, is not suitable to the Serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the other. The <hi>Melancholy</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
must have time and leisure: the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine</hi>
Temper doth all presently. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must bear with one another, in
those things wherein we differ; if no
Moral Evil be there. Take every Man
<hi>at the best,</hi> and you will find him good
for <hi>some</hi> Purposes. Therefore bear with
him, wherein he is weak. 'Tis <hi>Unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
to take any one at a Disadvantage; and
very <hi>Unchristian</hi> to take any Man at the
worst.—There are <hi>incident Offences.</hi>
Sometimes things fall out so crosly, that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:56135:214"/>
one could not have imagined. Tho' the
thing might be well intended, yet it may
happen for the worse.—* There are
<hi>ordinary Mistakes;</hi> sometimes <hi>of the Things</hi>
(* <hi>in</hi> taking one * <hi>thing</hi> for another:)
sometimes of the <hi>Agent's</hi> part; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of the <hi>Patient's</hi> side. We our selves
are often mistaken; and we acknowledge
it, and say we would not have done <hi>this</hi>
or <hi>that,</hi> if we had once thought, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
as things are fallen out. Therefore,
we must give Allowance, when Men <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.</hi>
—There are <hi>sudden Apprehensions,</hi>
which should be allowed for. Some are
too quick; and conceit, before they have
duly weighed, and considered: and, 'tis
a hard matter, to rectifie a Misconceit.
<hi>Job'</hi>s Friends failed, at first. They were
rash in their first Apprehensions; and
therefore they ran on, in their Severity,
Censure, and harsh Dealings; till God
interposed. Therefore, take heed of the
first Stumble; for, 'tis <hi>ominous:</hi> or, at best,
<hi>a good Step is lost.</hi> He is a Person
very ingenuous that, upon shewing, will
vary from his first Thoughts: for, if once
Men have taken up an ill Opinion, 'tis
hard to satisfie them: By reason of which,
many Men run on, in an Error, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
their first Fault.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="405" facs="tcp:56135:214"/>These are Considerations that I offer,
for <hi>fair and equal Consideration, one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
for <hi>mutual Patience,</hi> and <hi>fair Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
And, these things never were, but
in this fixed Frame and Temper of Spirit,
recommended in the <hi>Text.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>* <hi>But, now, on the other hand:</hi> There
are some Persons that are always Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Complaining, and Finding Fault:
never Pleased themselves, nor Pleasing
others; that either are <hi>Provoking,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked;</hi>
both which are to be condemned.
I will not Provoke, because I will leave
no Body less himself than I found him;
he shall not be so much the worse for my
Company, and Acquaintance: I will not
be Provoked, because I will not disorder
my self, nor loose the Composure of my
own Mind; than which, nothing <hi>without
me</hi> can be more valuable.</p>
                  <p>There seems to be an Enmity to Peace
and Quietness in some Dispositions.
* <hi>These are</hi> malicious, and turbulent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
whose Pleasure is, to make Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance:
who were never taken with <hi>the
Beauty of Order;</hi> nor ever tasted <hi>the Sweet
of Peace;</hi> nor framed themselves to <hi>Duty,</hi>
and <hi>Obedience.</hi> What should such do in
Heaven, where all is Order, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?
* <hi>They are</hi> only fit for the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Hurry; Company for Fiends and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:56135:215"/>
Devils, whom they exactly resemble. In
HELL is <hi>Darkness, Perplexity, Confusion.</hi>
They lead a HELLISH LIFE, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
are <hi>Quarelling, Contradicting, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing.</hi>
Yet, some applaud themselves in
this. And, can they delight in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of a Good and Merciful God; of
a Compassionate Saviour; in the Harmony
of a Heavenly Quire; who have not been
acquainted with Charity, nor exercised in
Love, and Good-will? No. They will
not relish such <hi>Company;</hi> nor endure their
<hi>Employment.</hi> They must, first, be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of their Malignity; alter'd in
Temper; reconciled to Righteousness;
naturalized to things of the Heavenly
State; before that Place can make them
happy. For, <hi>Place, Condition,</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,</hi>
unsuitable to <hi>Disposition,</hi> are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome,
and cannot afford Content, or
Satisfaction: * <hi>Since</hi> to Hearts-ease and
Settlement, all things must be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,

abuse themselves, who think of Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
into God's blissful Presence hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or into the Society of blessed Angels,
and glorified Souls, whose Minds are not,
in this preparatory State, discharg'd of
SELFISHNESS and PARTIALITY,
which make Men <hi>importune, troublesome,</hi>
and <hi>very unpleasing Company.</hi> * <hi>For,</hi> the

Pleasures of Eternity, are Mental and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telectual;

                  <p>Man, is, in a sort, <hi>Felo de se,</hi> by har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Displeasure in his Breast. He
makes himself uneasie, by evil Surmises,
and Discontents. If one designed to do
a Man the greatest Mischief imaginable,
one would contrive to raise in him <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie</hi>
and <hi>Suspicion;</hi> to beget in him <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
Ill-will, Displeasure;</hi> provoke him <hi>to

(chap. 4. ver. 9.) I do well to be angry.</hi>
This is the Case of <hi>Ungovern'd Minds,</hi> and
<hi>Cholerick Constitutions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those who transgress in their Rage and
Fury; when they return to themselves,
and to the use of sober Reason; either
find cause to be ashamed, and to wish
they had kept in better compass (which
is the Recovery of <hi>Good-Nature,</hi> or <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;</hi>)
or else, loose themselves upon this
occasion, and become more immodest,
and unreasonable, and more settled and
confirmed in Naughtiness. For, <hi>Good-Nature,</hi>
and the <hi>Effects</hi> of it, in Man, are
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:56135:216"/>
the SOIL wherein the Seeds of <hi>Vertue</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sown, will grow and thrive. But,
let a Man degenerate into Hard-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or Cruelty; <hi>Vertue</hi> becomes a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to such a Constitution. We have wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Examples <hi>what Monsters of Rational
Agents, on a Moral Account,</hi> some Men
become, by unnatural Use of themselves;
wrought quite off, from all Ingenuity,
Candour, Sweetness; unlike themselves,
what they were formerly known to be.
There are indeed many ways of Miscarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
for, there are SOILS of <hi>Vices:</hi> But,
if a Man would at once spoil his Nature,
raze his very Foundation, and absolutely
indispose himself to all Acts of Vertue;
let him allow himself in <hi>Frowardness, Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness,
Male-content:</hi> Let him conceive
<hi>Displeasure</hi> in his Breast; let him bear
<hi>Ill-will,</hi> live in <hi>Envy, Malice,</hi> and <hi>out of
Charity.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 8.</note> For, since GOD is <hi>Love;</hi> this
Temper is most abhorrent to him. So as
that <hi>he only can dwell in God, who dwells in
Love.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Discomposure of Mind,</hi> a Person is
unfit to attend upon God; and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of enjoying Him. The Mind that
doth contemplate God, must be <hi>God-like.</hi>
'Tis only the <hi>Quiet</hi> and <hi>Serene Mind</hi> that
can contemplate God, and enjoy Him:
For, God will not dwell where Violence
and Fury is. We read that <hi>God</hi> was not
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:56135:217"/>
                     <hi>in the Fire,</hi> nor <hi>in the Whirlwind,</hi> nor <hi>in
the Earthquake;</hi> but, <hi>in the STILL
VOICE.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 19. 11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, as we are not fit to attend upon
God, nor to enjoy <hi>Him;</hi> so likewise,
not to enjoy <hi>our selves.</hi> In such a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
we have not the free Use of our
Reason, nor any true Content. For, what
is all the World to a troubled and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed
Mind? Therefore, give me
<hi>Serenity</hi> of Mind, <hi>Calmness</hi> of Thought:
For, these are better Enjoyments than
any thing <hi>without us.</hi> Therefore, for
<hi>these</hi> Things, will I daily praise God:—
For upholding the Foundation of <hi>Reason</hi>
and <hi>Understanding;</hi> which are so much
in Danger, by the Distemper of the
Mind:—For continuing me in the
Priviledge of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> (for,
hereby I can present God with a <hi>Free-will-Offering,</hi>
and bring unto him <hi>the Consent
of my Mind.) * And,</hi> for giving me
<hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Self-enjoyment,</hi> and of <hi>taking
Content in my self.</hi> One may have much
in the World <hi>as to Right</hi> and <hi>Title;</hi>
and yet, have nothing <hi>as to Power of Self-enjoyment.
* For,</hi> in the Case of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government,
by Lust, Passion, and Self-will;
we dispossess our selves of <hi>our
selves,</hi> and all that we may call <hi>OURS.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:56135:217"/>'Tis a sinful Temper, to be <hi>hard</hi> to
Please; and <hi>ready</hi> to take Offence. It is
grievous to those about us: And we shall
soon suffer for it: For, Men will soon
withdraw from <hi>unquiet</hi> and <hi>turbulent</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
<hi>Solomon</hi> hath observed, that he that
would have <hi>a Friend,</hi> must behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>Friendly.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 18. 24</note> But, these Men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable
every-where; especially to
those that are <hi>under them</hi> (for, as for
<hi>Equals,</hi> and <hi>Superiors,</hi> they will soon
withdraw:) But every <hi>good Man</hi> will
take Care of <hi>those that are under him.</hi> And,
upon this Head, I shall observe <hi>Three</hi> or
<hi>Four</hi> Things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That we ought to make the
Lives of all those that live with us, as
happy, and comfortable as we can; and
their Burthens as easie as may be. Let
our Advantages be never so much above
theirs; and our Power over them never
so great; yet, we should equally consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Things, and do as we would be
done unto, if in their Circumstances.</p>
                  <p>Consider * <hi>also</hi> that Things may as well
be done with <hi>Gentleness,</hi> and by <hi>fair
Means,</hi> as otherwise: And, that Things
that are <hi>so</hi> done, are done with Pleasure
and Satisfaction, and will better hold:
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:56135:218"/>
For, Things that are done by <hi>Force,</hi> and
<hi>with Offence,</hi> will no longer last than
<hi>that Force</hi> continues.</p>
                  <p>There is more <hi>Care, to please;</hi> when
Men are not Captious, Peevish, Froward,
or easie to take Offence. Men that are
often <hi>Angry,</hi> and for every Triffle; in a
little time, will be little regarded; and so
loose the Advantage of giving <hi>grave Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</hi>
They will say, <hi>'Tis the Manner of
the Person;</hi> and, <hi>no one can help it:</hi> And,
so these Persons will be less considered,
when they reprove with Reason. <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure</hi>
(when there is weighty Reason
for it) may prove to the Offender, a
Principle of Reformation and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But, hasty, and passionate Men,
are not considered. Their Fury is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon, as a Clap of Thunder: And
no one will much regard it.</p>
                  <p>Take notice what <hi>Care</hi> God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
for the <hi>Welfare</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> of
those that are <hi>Inferiors,</hi> and <hi>under the
Power of others.</hi>—The Parent <hi>must not
provoke his Children to wrath.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 4.</note> Parents,
that have all Authority over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
must take Care how they use it.—
<hi>The Husband</hi> must not be bitter against
<hi>his Wife.</hi> He must give her no harsh
Language; but <hi>give Honour to her, as the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:56135:218"/>
weaker Vessel.</hi>—Masters <hi>must render to
their Servants that which is</hi> Just <hi>and</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7.</note>
                     <hi>Forbearing Threatnings:<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 9.</note> Knowing
that they have a Master, in Heaven.</hi> —
Then, for those <hi>that labour for us,</hi> that
are but <hi>for a Day,</hi> and are gone again;
<hi>God</hi> hath required, <hi>that their Wages be
payed them:</hi> Otherwise <hi>their Cry will come
up, into the Ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 5. 4.</note>—
Then, for <hi>Strangers,</hi> that are without
Friends, Relations, or Acquaintance;
What Care doth God take for them? <hi>Be
not forgetful to entertain Strangers.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 2.</note>—
Then, for <hi>the Widow,</hi> and the <hi>Fatherless</hi>
Persons, that are most helpless; What
Care hath God taken for them? So great,
that <hi>He will be revenged on those that wrong
them;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 22, 23, 24.</note> and, on the contrary, will reckon
those to have <hi>pure Religion and undefiled,</hi>
that shall <hi>visit the Widows and Fatherless
in their Affliction.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 27.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the RULE. The <hi>lower</hi> any ones
Condition is, in the World; by so much the
<hi>more</hi> he his pitiable; and so much the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
Care should we take, to ease him: <hi>He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Burthen enough upon him; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other Addition to his Misery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will conclude this Discourse with
<hi>Three</hi> Rules. Whosoever will do his
Work, with fair Words; I would not
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:56135:219"/>
have him chid into it. I would never
blame any one, for common Incidencies,
such as might befal my self, or any one
else: * <hi>Nor</hi> ever blame any one, for not
doing <hi>that,</hi> wherein he had not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Direction.—You will say <hi>these are
LOW Things,</hi> to be spoken in <hi>a Pulpit.</hi>
But, let them be as <hi>Low</hi> as they will; the
<hi>Disorder of our Minds,</hi> many times, is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
for want of them: And, great
Disquietness is occasioned in many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
for want of that <hi>peaceable Temper,</hi>
which my <hi>Text</hi> speaks of.</p>

                     <q>
                        <p>For I have kept the Ways of the

                        <p>For all his Judgments were before
me: And I did not put away his
Statutes from me.</p>
                        <p>I was also upright before him: And

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Am, now, to give you an Account
of the <hi>Effect</hi> and <hi>Demonstration</hi> of
<hi>RELIGION in the Subject.</hi> If we
would not be imposed upon, let us
take just Measures. The <hi>Text</hi> tells us, what
Judgment we are to make of <hi>Religion,</hi>
and <hi>Religious Persons: * And</hi> by it, we may
learn how to guide our selves with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in a Matter of the highest Nature;
* <hi>viz.</hi> if we proceed by the Rule which
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:56135:220"/>
in the Schools we call <hi>a Demonstration by
the Effect;</hi> which I take to be the best: As
for instance, if you come to prove there
is a God; the best Account is <hi>from the
Effect:</hi> Prove the <hi>Cause,</hi> from <hi>the Effect:</hi>
Prove <hi>the Being of a GOD,</hi> from <hi>the World</hi>
that he hath made, and is his <hi>Work:</hi> so,
prove RELIGION, from <hi>its Operation;</hi>
a Religious Person, from <hi>what he does.</hi>
And this is the Way which our Saviour
hath taught us: <hi>A good Tree bringeth
forth good Fruit,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 17.</note> For, we are in
great Danger of making false Judgment,
both concerning <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Things.</hi> This
we often find; that the World esteems a
Person of a pleasant Humour, and that
hath a good * <hi>Assurance, a good</hi> Put-off,
and value for himself; especially if he
be a Man of a ready Wit; * <hi>and,</hi> that
such a Man shall meet with Respect and
Reputation much above what there is
Ground for; and more a great deal than
those that are of far greater Worth, of
higher Improvements, and better Spirits.
Thus are Men esteemed, not so much
from <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Simplicity;</hi> not from
<hi>Pureness of Mind,</hi> and <hi>exact Walking,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Difference of <hi>Good</hi> and
<hi>Evil;</hi> but as they comply with several
Mens <hi>Fancies</hi> and <hi>Opinions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="417" facs="tcp:56135:220"/>Now, I will make use of my <hi>Text,</hi> to
describe, and lay out <hi>a truely GOOD Man;</hi>
one that is <hi>real</hi> in his Religion; one
that <hi>keeps the ways of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and
that <hi>keeps himself from his Iniquity.</hi> And,
the better to explain my self, I must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
* <hi>to you,</hi> in the first place, a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
State of Men: <hi>a State of Wickedness,
and Sin;</hi> when Evil prevails: And <hi>a
State of Religion;</hi> when Goodness, and
Vertue take place. And, these <hi>two</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
in degree, as <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> (For
it is a great Mistake for us to think, that
all of Heaven, or Hell, is <hi>hereafter;</hi> for,
both <hi>the one,</hi> and <hi>the other,</hi> is, in measure,
and degree, begun <hi>here.</hi> For, <hi>Heaven,</hi> and
<hi>Hell,</hi> are not so much <hi>a Place,</hi> as <hi>a State.</hi>
They that are reconciled to God, in the
<hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Temper of their Minds;</hi> and
that live according to the <hi>Law of Heaven,</hi>
the everlasting and immutable Rules of
<hi>Goodness, Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> may
truly, be said <hi>to have begun Heaven, while
they are upon Earth.</hi> But, they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the Difference of Good, and Evil;
and who care not to approve themselves
to God; but <hi>do</hi> without difference, or
distinction: These are <hi>Partakers of the
Devilish Nature;</hi> and are <hi>in the Hellish
State.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>There may be Weaknesses, Failings, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
Misapprehensions, some Errors in
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:56135:221"/>
Judgment and Opinion; there may be false
Conceits, in some things about Religion;
and all these, <hi>within the STATE OF RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGION;</hi>
where Men are substantially
honest, and mean <hi>GOD, Goodness,</hi> and
<hi>Truth;</hi> and live in all good Conscience
towards God. We read (<hi>Genesis</hi> 20.)
how God did apologize for <hi>Abimelech,</hi>
tho' he was not altogether without fault:
for, he ought to have taken more care:
But, yet, he was innocent, as to <hi>the great
Transgression:</hi> and, therefore, God saith,
<hi>I know thou didst it in the Integrity of thy
Heart.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 13.</note> So, St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth alleviate his
Persecution of the Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9. <hi>I
thought that I ought to do many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Name of Jesus of</hi> Nazareth.
And, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. he saith, <hi>he obtain'd
Mercy, because he did it ignorantly,</hi> and <hi>in
Unbelief.</hi> Therefore, we must conclude,
that none of those things that I have
named, come within the compass of
<hi>wickedly departing from God:</hi> But, all those
that are sincere in their Religion, may yet
say <hi>I have kept the ways of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.
And thus it is reported of those good
Men and Women that are upon Record
in Holy Scripture. <hi>Zechariah,</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
are both said to <hi>walk in all the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
and Ordinances of the Lord, blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lake 1. 6.</note>
Neither is this, particular <hi>to them;</hi>
but unto <hi>all good Men.</hi> This is the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:56135:221"/>
of all the Worthies in the Old
Testament, <hi>that they walked before the Lord
in Integrity.</hi> And, this is RELIGION,
not in the <hi>Notion</hi> only, and <hi>in Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
but <hi>in POWER and in TRUTH.</hi>
Wherever it is <hi>less,</hi> or <hi>otherwise;</hi> it is
<hi>with a double Heart,</hi> not with <hi>a whole Heart,</hi>
as you read <hi>Psalm</hi> 12. 2. So in St. <hi>James,</hi>
we read of <hi>a double-minded Man.</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is not satisfied with a bare <hi>Profession,</hi>
and <hi>partial Reformation.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 8.</note> This may be for
other Ends, and Purposes; and not out
of Love to God, and Righteousness. But,
we must harmonize with the Nature,
Mind, and Will of God; and find a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
and Animosity in our Souls, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Evil: and this, <hi>from the Love of
Righteousness and Goodness.</hi> And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to bring <hi>this,</hi> home; being a matter
of the greatest consequence; even <hi>that,</hi>
by which we must stand, or fall: I will

IGNORANCE,</hi> in answer to

encouraging of Vertue, and Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Vice, and Wickedness.</p>
                        <p>This is the <hi>first</hi> thing. Those that are
ignorant of the things that are <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
necessary to RELIGION,</hi> cannot say
<hi>that they have kept the ways of the Lord;
and have not wickedly departed from God.</hi>
For, these have <hi>wickedly departed from
Him;</hi> altho' they have no more than
<hi>Natural Knowledge;</hi> and those <hi>Principles</hi>
with which at first, God created <hi>Man.</hi>
For, these things are manifest to all Men:
And <hi>all Men</hi> are <hi>A LAW unto themselves</hi>
in these Matters.<note place="margin">See the first Sermons of Part 1.</note> And, therefore, <hi>the
Apostle</hi> saith, that <hi>God is not far from

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> They who are greatly <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>
and <hi>neglective</hi> of God, cannot say
<hi>that they have kept the ways of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.
For, <hi>two</hi> things are absolutely necessary
to the State of Religion; and wherein
we ought to take great care; to wit,
<hi>Judgment of Right,</hi> and <hi>Conscience to do
accordingly.</hi> The Judgment of what is
<hi>Right,</hi> and <hi>Wrong;</hi> True, and False;
Good, and Evil; do require great Care,
Diligence, and Pains. Nay, let me ask
you, what there is in the whole Life of
Man that is valuable, or worthy, but
doth require <hi>Care, Pains, Industry,</hi> and
<hi>Diligence?</hi> Go over the several Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the World. The <hi>Husbandman</hi>
plows, and sows; and doth every thing
necessary to his Land, before he expects
a Crop. Take <hi>the Merchant</hi> in the way
of his Trade; He walks from <hi>East,</hi> to
<hi>West;</hi> and sends his Goods far and near,
for the increase of his <hi>Wealth.</hi> What Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and Care, do Men take, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Life;</hi> and to maintain themselves
in <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Strength;</hi> and provide
for their <hi>Families?</hi> To get an <hi>Estate,</hi>
and to keep <hi>it?</hi> We see, in every thing
that is to be done for the Concerns of
this Life, there is <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Caution</hi> to be
used. And, shall there be no <hi>Care,</hi> no
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:56135:223"/>
                           <hi>Pains,</hi> no <hi>Diligence,</hi> nor <hi>Industry</hi> used, to
<hi>govern our FACULTIES;</hi> to <hi>moderate our
APPETITES, for the several Uses and
Purposes of Religion;</hi> which is of the
highest Concernment of all others?</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, in the first place, <hi>to THE
STATE OF RELIGION,</hi> and * <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
to uphold and maintain the same;
there must be Care taken, to discern the
Difference between <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Evil;
True,</hi> and <hi>False; Right,</hi> and <hi>Wrong.</hi>
For, these are the great Points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
At the Knowledge of these, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<hi>begins.</hi> And, this is every Body's
Charge, according to his Capacity, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and Ability. And this is as
necessary to preserve us from <hi>Cheats,</hi>
and <hi>Impostures;</hi> as to know our <hi>Liberty.</hi>
Our first Work, is to establish in our
selves <hi>a Throne of Judgment,</hi> throwly to
know and understand our Duty; and
what is to be done, what to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And, then, in point of <hi>Practice,</hi>
and <hi>Choice,</hi> to observe this Difference.
And, if this be not done, our Religion
is to little purpose. For it comes all to
one; <hi>not to make any Difference in things,</hi>
or <hi>not to observe that Difference.</hi> The
<hi>first</hi> thing in Religion, is, to refine a
Man's Temper: And the <hi>second,</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
his Practice. If a Man's Religion
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:56135:224"/>
do not * <hi>this;</hi> his Religion is a poor
slender Thing, and of little Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
'Tis, then, only a naked Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and fit to give him a Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
I say, such a Man's Religion is
but of little value: For, it hath no Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy;
but, falls short of the very <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
of Nature. For <hi>they</hi> do certainly
and constantly attain their several Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
The Sun, the Moon, the Stars;
Fire, Air, Earth, and Water; these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fail to act <hi>according to their several
Principles;</hi> and to attain their several
Effects. The Sun hath not fail'd for
Six thousand years: insomuch, that we
are surer of its Rising, and Setting,
than we are of our selves. Now, shall
all <hi>the Principles</hi> in <hi>Inferiour Nature,</hi>
throughout the whole Creation, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
constantly, and certainly attain
their Effects? And, shall there be only a
Failure in <hi>the Principles of Reason, and
Religion?</hi>—But to proceed.</p>

                     <item>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whosoever doth <hi>voluntarily
consent to known Iniquity;</hi> I am sure,
this <hi>Text</hi> cannot be verified of such a
Person. Men that do wittingly, and
willingly, consent to that which their
Judgment tells them, at that time, is
<hi>Evil;</hi> are represented in Scripture as
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:56135:224"/>
                        <hi>sinning with a high hand,</hi> and <hi>with a
stiff neck;</hi> and <hi>to resist the Holy Spirit;</hi>
and <hi>to commit the great Transgression.</hi>—
Now, of these, <hi>the First * sort</hi> never
made any entrance into Religion.<note place="margin">Jer. 17. 23. Acts 7. 51. Psal. 19. 13.</note> As
for <hi>the second,</hi> if they do any thing
worthy of Religion; 'tis rather by chance,
than of choice. As for <hi>the third,</hi> they
pass into a clean contrary State.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these, to wit <hi>those that are
Fundamentally Ignorant,</hi> they stumble at
the very Threshold: because <hi>Religion,</hi> in
every degree, begins <hi>at some measure of
KNOWLEDGE:</hi> For, can a Blind Man
judge of Colours? No more can a Man
that is <hi>Fundamentally Ignorant</hi> be said to
be <hi>Religious.</hi>—And, as for those that
are greatly <hi>Careless,</hi> and <hi>Neglective;</hi> it is
uncertain what they will do, that do not
act by Rule, and upon Consideration.
—But, as for <hi>the Third sort;</hi> Those
that give their <hi>Consent to that which is
Evil;</hi> These pass into the <hi>Contrary State:</hi>
and take a course to root out of their
Minds the very Seeds of Goodness that
were sown: For, <hi>so,</hi> contrary Acts are
apt to do. No <hi>Habit</hi> doth absolutely
determine the Act: tho' it doth greatly
dispose and incline to the Action. Yet
<hi>a HABIT</hi> may be utterly lost. If a
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:56135:225"/>
Man do, for a long time, forbear all
<hi>Acts</hi> of Religion; he is wanting to that
which should continue <hi>the Habit.</hi> And,
if there be <hi>Contrary Acts;</hi> the <hi>Contrary
Habit</hi> will be begun: and the more they
are, the more will the contrary Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be increased. So that, in time, the
<hi>Habit of Vertue</hi> shall not only be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but wholly wrought out; and the
contrary * <hi>Habit</hi> brought in.</p>
                  <p>This is the Course of things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Every Habit begun, is greatly
weakned by a bare Forbearance of Acts;
For, every thing must be conserved in
the way it was produced. A <hi>Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is first introduced by some Acts:
and, if you do not introduce Act upon
Act, the Disposition will fail. For,
things that are not brought to a <hi>State</hi>
of Perfection, will return back again;
if they be not maintain'd in the same
way that they were produc'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the <hi>Towardliness</hi> of some Persons
to Vertue, is, by Intermission of Acts,
abated: and, when they come to put
forth contrary Acts, it is quite expelled.
And this is the Ground and Foundation
of <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s Counsel to <hi>Absalom.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 23.</note> He
bids him do a Lewd Act, that he might
be confirm'd in his wicked Design he
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:56135:225"/>
had against his Father. Therefore, let
us close with that Good Advice which
<hi>Jesus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> gives, <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticus</hi>
21. 2. <hi>Flee from Sin, as from a
Serpent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The least that can be expected from
Religion, and Conscience to God, is,
that by means thereof, Men be kept
from giving their <hi>Consent</hi> to <hi>known Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi>
and be enabled to escape the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of the World. If the Creation
below us, by their Natural <hi>Instinct,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
do those things that are Regular,
and attain their End; shall not these
<hi>higher Principles</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
do the like, and always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
us from known <hi>Evil,</hi> and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
us to that which is <hi>Morally Good?</hi>
The Principle of Reason, Knowledge,
and Judgment, is the highest Principle;
and transcendent to all others. The
Principle by which the Sun doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
the World, is not to be put in
competition with <hi>the Reason of Mind and
Understanding:</hi> To which if we add,
the Aid of <hi>God's Grace,</hi> which doth
never fail, (for, He doth <hi>prevent us</hi>
with his <hi>Grace;</hi>) it is a Shame and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to us, if we <hi>vary</hi> from the Rule
and Measure of Vertue; <hi>sin</hi> against our
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:56135:226"/>
own Light and Conscience; and <hi>do</hi>
worse, when we <hi>know</hi> better.</p>
                  <p>I shall now proceed to declare the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>
and <hi>Intent</hi> of <hi>RELIGION: What</hi> It
aims at, and how It doth affect <hi>the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
And that I will do, in these Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p>I will consider Religion, <hi>in its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towards God:</hi>—What it doth <hi>in
the Person</hi> in which it is:—How it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<hi>* and carries it self</hi> towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
even <hi>to the whole Creation;</hi> but
more especially, towards <hi>them</hi> with whom
we daily converse:—How Religion
stands affected towards the Things that
are <hi>without us,</hi> or <hi>about us;</hi> either the
<hi>Necessaries,</hi> and <hi>Conveniencies,</hi> or <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities</hi>
of Life:—* <hi>And</hi> what Religion
doth, when it is <hi>finally Victorious,</hi> and
overcomes the World.</p>
                  <p>Of these I shall treat; but not several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and distinctly. Nor will I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to give you a particular account of
these, in the Order I have now laid
them: for, <hi>this</hi> would be, to make <hi>this
Text</hi> the whole <hi>Bible.</hi> I will, therefore,
speak of them, in Conjunction; as
things offer themselves; because these
things run one into another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:56135:226"/>
                     <hi>RELIGION</hi> makes us live up to our
<hi>Highest Faculties;</hi> so as becomes Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Beings, that are indued with Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Nature. It enables us to live and
to act suitably to our Height and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency:
so as to keep up <hi>the Grandure</hi> of
our Being; <hi>as Those</hi> that bear the Image
of <hi>the Immortal GOD,</hi> and are exalted
above the Inferiour Creation; * <hi>as Those</hi>
that represent <hi>HIM</hi> in the World, not
only in respect of <hi>Intelligence;</hi> but, in
respect of <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and govern. It makes us to scorn
all Actions that are base, unhandsom, or
unworthy our State, and the Relation we
stand in, to God.</p>
                  <p>To have <hi>GOD</hi> in our sight; and, to
have right Apprehensions of <hi>Him;</hi> doth,
above all things, tend to the <hi>Nobleness,
Amplitude,</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> of our Spirits:
For, <hi>this</hi> we observe; that <hi>the Greatness
of an Object,</hi> and <hi>the Excellency of the Act
of any AGENT about a transcendent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
doth mightily tend to <hi>the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>Improvement of HIS Faculties.</hi>
Whereas, those who are employ'd in
mean Businesses, and are conversant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>little Objects,</hi> have nothing in them
that is excellent; but are of limited
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:56135:227"/>
and narrow Spirits. It hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that Men that have been of mean
Parts, and ordinary Perfections, after
they came to be <hi>truly RELIGIOUS,</hi> their
<hi>Parts</hi> have grown upon them; and they
have appear'd to be other kind of Men.
The account of this is easie: It is to
be imputed to their Application to <hi>God,</hi>
(who is the noblest <hi>Object</hi> in the World)
and to their Attendance upon <hi>Him.</hi> For,
there is no Motion in the World so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and tending to the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>the Agent,</hi> as the Motions of <hi>Religion</hi>
are.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>our RELIGION,</hi> we are preserved
from those things that would sink us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the order of Beasts; by <hi>Sensuality,</hi>
and <hi>Carnal-Mindedness:</hi> or that would
transform us into the Likeness of Devils
by <hi>Pride, Presumption,</hi> and <hi>Self-Conceit.</hi>
By Religion we come to imitate the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Perfection; become <hi>God-like,</hi> in
Wisdom, Righteousness, Goodness, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Compassion; in forgiving Injuries,
pardoning Enemies, and doing <hi>Hurt</hi> to
None; but <hi>Good</hi> to All, as we have Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Opportunity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RELIGION</hi> doth restrain the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy
of Mens <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Appetites;</hi>
and regulates the Exorbitancy of Mens
<hi>Wills.—IT</hi> is the most conducive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:56135:227"/>
in the whole World, to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Mind, and Body. Our Misery
and Infelicity ariseth from our undue
and naughty Practice. And all that which
we call <hi>Punishment</hi> is let in upon us, by
Sin. Religion permits us the Pleasure
of our Body; as far as it is for our
Health, and not destructive of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
of our Mind, nor the Indolency
of the Body.—<hi>Religion</hi> produceth a
sweet and gracious Temper of Mind;
<hi>calm</hi> in its self, and <hi>loving to Men.</hi> It
causeth a <hi>Universal Benevolence</hi> and <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
to Mankind. For, these are the
Things of which it doth consist; <hi>Love,
Candour, Ingenuity, Clemency, Patience,
Mildness, Gentleness,</hi> and all other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of <hi>GOOD-NATURE.</hi> It
hath such a Quality in it, as will make
them <hi>Good natur'd,</hi> that it finds <hi>bad.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
makes Men <hi>Humble, Affable, Meek</hi>
and <hi>Charitable; Modest,</hi> and <hi>Prudent;
Tender,</hi> and <hi>Compassionate.</hi> It detests
nothing more than * <hi>either</hi> a Peevish,
Froward, Passionate, Furious, or Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Temper; a Morose, or Churlish
Disposition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RELIGION</hi> begets in us <hi>a true Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Freedom of Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Largeness of
Soul.</hi> It causeth the greatest Serenity and
Chearfulness to the Mind; and prevents
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:56135:228"/>
groundless Fears, foolish Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
needless Suspicions, and dastardly
Thoughts. It takes away from us, all
bad Thoughts of <hi>God;</hi> or jealous Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicions
of <hi>Men.</hi> Religion makes us not
suspect Evil from <hi>God;</hi> but to look upon
Him as the most Gracious, and Benign
Being; that designs nothing more than
the Happiness of his Creatures. It is not
<hi>Religion,</hi> but <hi>SUPERSTITION</hi> that
<hi>dreads</hi> God: Religion makes us <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
him, and <hi>delight</hi> in him. It makes
us to entertain good Thoughts of <hi>God,</hi>
and to conceive aright of him: that He
doth transact all things with Mankind,
<hi>as a Loving and Tender Father, with his
Child.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I further add, that <hi>RELIGION</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth
the Soul to its just <hi>Power</hi> and
<hi>Soveraignty:</hi> enabling the Mind to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
all Bodily Appetites, and Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Desires: and this, not only because
of the <hi>intrinsick Baseness</hi> of Brutish and
Sensual Lusts, in a Nature that is indued
with transcendant Faculties; but also,
because of the <hi>mischievous Effects</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon it. <hi>Intemperance</hi> doth, by a
natural. Necessity, weaken our Reason,
and thwart the very End and Purpose of
Religion. For, Intemperance doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>stupifie,</hi> or <hi>enrage</hi> our Spirits. We
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:56135:228"/>
see, sometimes, that Persons of a good
Constitution; well inclined to Vertue;
fair, and conversable; whose Company
is pleasant, and delightful; that these
very Persons are made Cholerick, and
Ungovernable, when they are disorder'd
by Intemperance: And so they are not
what they were; but emptied of all
those things to which their Constitutions
did lead and incline them. Our Work,
therefore, in the World, is to maintain
the <hi>just Authority</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
against the Assaults of rude, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
and boisterous Passions: And,
so to tame <hi>that rude Beast THE BODY</hi>
(which, by the Divine Providence, is
ty'd to our <hi>Souls,</hi> in this State) that it
may not prove a constant Temptation,
and Provocation to our Mind; but, that
it be kept in Subjection.</p>
                  <p>I add further; that RELIGION is a
most <hi>lively, vigorous,</hi> and <hi>sprightly</hi> Thing;
satisfying to <hi>the Subject;</hi> and putting <hi>it</hi>
upon all good Employment. Worldly
Men, Persons of no Experience, may
think otherwise: As that <hi>Religion</hi> would
make a Man <hi>Morose,</hi> and <hi>Soure;</hi> and fill
him with <hi>Discontent.</hi> Whereas, Religion
drives away <hi>sad</hi> and <hi>gloomy Melancholy;</hi>
and begets in us <hi>a rational Confidence;</hi>
and gives a Man great <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Pleasure,</hi>
in the Divine Goodness. And, if any
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:56135:229"/>
that are Religious, think otherwise; and
are otherwise affected; I must tell them,
that it doth not arise from <hi>Principles of
Religion;</hi> but, from <hi>Bodily Temper</hi> (in
respect of which they are troubled;) or,
from some occasion <hi>from without:</hi> And,
that their Religion is <hi>their Relief.</hi>—
Of all the the Things in Religion, none
is so much suspected to tend to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
and Sadness, as is the Motion of
<hi>Repentance.</hi> So that if I can vindicate
this Piece of Religion; you will be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
for all the rest. But, to think
that this is accompanied with <hi>Sadness</hi> and
<hi>Melancholy</hi> is the greatest Mistake in the
World.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10</note> True, indeed, <hi>Worldly Sorrow,</hi>
as the Apostle saith, <hi>causeth Death.</hi> This
hath no Life in it; because it hath no
Respect to God; but, is rather an Act of
Rebellion against him: For, <hi>here,</hi> the
Unquietness comes from <hi>Want of Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to God.</hi> The Person is discontented,
because Things are not to his Mind, and
as he would have them. Such was the
Temper of <hi>Jonah.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jon. 4. 9.</note> He was displeased,
and angry to Death, because he was not
gratified, and had his Will; tho' it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
never so much to the Ruin of others.
But, the Ground of <hi>SORROW for SIN,</hi>
is, <hi>the Love of GOD;</hi> * it is, <hi>because we
have done amiss, varied from the Rule of

we have <hi>done that which was base,
and disingenuous to our loving Father, and
best Benefactor.</hi> Now, this doth quite
alter the Case, * and makes a Change;
<hi>which WORLDLY SORROW,</hi> tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much, doth not. For, if we tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>repent;</hi> we <hi>undo</hi> the Action; and
morally <hi>disclaim</hi> it: And, upon this,
God doth pardon. But, <hi>Things without,</hi>
are not altered by <hi>Worldly Sorrow:</hi> But
go on, as they did, in their Course;
whether the Man be pleas'd, or displeas'd.
But, REPENTANCE doth afford us
<hi>Heart's-ease,</hi> and removes the Malady
that did affect us: For, <hi>by our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
and <hi>God's Pardon,</hi> THAT which
<hi>hath</hi> been done, is, as if it <hi>never had</hi> been
done: So that in effect, <hi>the Penitent</hi> may
say; <hi>I, that was the Sinner, am not the
same Person. And, That which I have done
amiss, is, as if I had never done it.</hi> This
is <hi>that Repentance</hi> which <hi>the Apostle</hi> calls,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10</note>
                     <hi>Repentance to Salvation, never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of:</hi> For, it produceth good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
<hi>Love to God,</hi> and <hi>Thankfulness to
Him:</hi> And in <hi>These,</hi> there is Heart's-ease,
and Satisfaction. I will appeal to the
Experience of any Man that hath ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<hi>repented;</hi> if He do not find more
Satisfaction, Heart's-ease, and Pleasure;
in one Hour that he has spent <hi>in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,</hi>
and in <hi>Retirement from the World,</hi>

And it must be so. For, in <hi>one</hi> Case,
there is Satisfaction <hi>to the Reason of the
Mind,</hi> which is Fundamental to inward
Peace: But <hi>in the other,</hi> the Pleasure of
the Sin is soon over; and the Memory
of it is grievous, and remains. All that
Pleasure which worldly and ungovern'd
Persons take in <hi>Sin,</hi> has no Solidity in
it: But, we may truly say of it, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>

of <hi>Mirth;</hi>

                     <hi>What doth it?</hi> But, in the
Motion of <hi>Repentance</hi> there is ease to a

                  <p>I have now spoken of <hi>Religion</hi> in its
<hi>Use,</hi> and <hi>Exercise,</hi> in this State, whilst
we are <hi>here;</hi> the <hi>Advantages</hi> that we have
by it <hi>at present.</hi> I am now to speak of
it, in <hi>its Issue;</hi> when it is Victorious,
and Triumphant; what it shall be in
Souls, when they have made their escape
out of Time; and finally conquer'd the
World.</p>
                  <p>And, here, I shall declare the Effects
of Religion, partly as to Mens <hi>Bodies;</hi>
but chiefly, as to their <hi>Minds:</hi> As to
Mens <hi>Bodies,</hi> in <hi>this</hi> State, and the <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:56135:231"/>
—In <hi>this State,</hi> the greatest Work
is <hi>Mortification.</hi> Colossi. 3. 5. <hi>Mortifie
therefore your Members,</hi> &amp;c. And, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
9. 27. <hi>I beat down my Body.</hi> And 1 St. <hi>John</hi>
2. 16. The Apostle saith, <hi>All that is in
the World, the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust
of the Eye, and the Pride of Life,</hi> must
be subdued.—Then, <hi>hereafter,</hi> our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
shall be <hi>Spiritualized.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 44.
Nay, <hi>Tho' it be sown a Natural Body; it
shall be raised a Spiritual Body:</hi> Which
would pass for Nonsense in the Ears of
a Philosopher: But, he speaks <hi>emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally:</hi>
A Body carried so much higher,
and to so great a Degree of Perfection;
as much as <hi>a Spirit</hi> is a far more excellent
Being than an <hi>Earthly Body.</hi> This that I
now speak we cannot <hi>now</hi> fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;
because it is a State <hi>in Reversion.</hi>
For, we must know, that States are not
known by <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Description;</hi> but
by <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Feeling;</hi> and by being in the
* <hi>very</hi> State * <hi>it self.</hi> Beasts have no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>the State of Men:</hi> Neither have
<hi>we</hi> any certain Notion of the State of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;</hi>
because neither <hi>they,</hi> nor <hi>we</hi> are in
that State. And, as we do not know it,
because we feel it not; so can we do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
towards this happy Change of the
Body, otherwise than by the several <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
and <hi>Graces,</hi> in these Bodies (to wit,
in the Exercise of <hi>Sobriety, Chastity, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi>
                     <pb n="438" facs="tcp:56135:232"/>
together with the <hi>moderate Use</hi>
of the Conveniences, and Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Nature) by which we may
fit, and prepare them, for <hi>the State of
Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But our main Work in this State, is
about the <hi>inward Man;</hi> to wit, that <hi>That</hi>
be so conformable to the Law of God,
that it be brought <hi>to take Delight</hi> in it, and
<hi>to harmonize</hi> with it. We must take Care
that we do not make our highest Faculties
<hi>to cater for the Flesh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note> The inferior Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are capable of this Employment, and
good enough for it. Our great Care
must be, to subdue all inordinate Passions
and boisterous Lusts, which are said <hi>to
fight against the Soul.</hi> That gallant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
which was taken up by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
must be taken up by us: <hi>I will not,</hi>
saith he,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12</note> 
                     <hi>that any of these Things have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over me:</hi> But I will have my Mind
<hi>free from,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> all these Things. Let us
take Care that all inordinate Appetites
and Excesses be restrained; such as that
was in her,<note place="margin">Gen. 30. 1.</note> who said, <hi>Give me Children,
or else I die,</hi> For, <hi>WILL without Reason,</hi>
is a blind Man's Motion: And <hi>WILL
against Reason,</hi> is a mad Man's Motion.—
I add, that our Care must be, that we
be not only <hi>Bodily-wise.</hi> BODY indeed
is a <hi>heavy Weight:</hi> But, let us bear up, as
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:56135:232"/>
well as we can, against it. 'Tis true,
that God hath linked our <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
together: But it was always intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>the governing Part</hi> should be THE
MIND. And, a Man, by <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and
<hi>Vertue,</hi> may overcome <hi>Bodily-Temper,</hi> and
<hi>Inclination.</hi> We have had those that have
said; <hi>By my Bodily-Temper and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I am so and so; such are my Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and Temptations: Yet, through the
Power of my Mind, all these Things are
subject to my Reason.</hi> This is the Creator's
Law; that all Things in Man should be
subject to the Government of REASON
(which is God's <hi>Deputy:</hi>) And this is our
Tryal, in this State; <hi>whether</hi> by the
Weight of Body, we will suffer our
selves to be depress'd, and to sink down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by minding Earthly Things; and
so take our Portion here; and fall short
of God; or, <hi>whether</hi> by the Reason of our
Minds, we will mount upwards, mind
Heavenly Things, converse with God by
Heavenly Meditation, and make choice
of the Things that are most excellent:
Whereby we shall naturalize our selves to
the Employment of Eternity. For, this
we observe; that we readily and easily
do those Things that we have been long
accustomed unto. <hi>Use</hi> makes Men ready,
apt, and prompt. So that it is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Matter for Men to foresee what they
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:56135:233"/>
shall approve <hi>hereafter,</hi> by what they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
relish, and delight in, <hi>now:</hi> By
what they take Pleasure and Satisfaction
in, <hi>at present.</hi> For, it will be, there,
<hi>more of the same.</hi> Therefore, our Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in time, is <hi>to get the Victory over those
unreasonable Passions which annoy us;</hi> that
so we may readily ascend into the State
of Intelectual Beings. * Our Business,
here, is <hi>to qualifie our Souls, by Holiness,
and Vertue, for the Happiness of Heaven;</hi>
and to separate our Minds from the Dregs
of <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Bodily-Sense:</hi> Which will
not be, till the Mind get the Victory,
and the Soul become <hi>God-like;</hi> and, in
some Measure, <hi>partake of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
—But, <hi>here,</hi> I might lose my
self; and yet can speak but little of the
Happiness of <hi>that State.</hi> Let it be our
Care, at present; to cleanse our selves
from all Pollutions of <hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi>
For, can we be so blind as to think that
a contrary Way will bring us to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
End?</p>
                  <p>We do observe that Things are in Men,
according to their Temper. What is
<hi>Food,</hi> tho' never so wholesome; if a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be sick? Or <hi>Musick,</hi> to those that are
Melancholy? What is <hi>Exercise,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,</hi>
to Men that are weak and feeble?
What are <hi>the Things of the World</hi> to him
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:56135:233"/>
that hath no Power to enjoy them? So
it is, in this Case. They that take no
delight in the Exercise of Vertue, in this
State; if, after this Life, God should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
them into <hi>Local</hi> Heaven, they would
take little Satisfaction in the Place; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of an unsuitable Frame of Spirit.
For, Men must be suitable to the Object
in the Enjoyment of which they receive
Satisfaction. Therefore, suppose (tho'
it is impossible) that a Man * <hi>being</hi> unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate;
and not renew'd in his Spirit,
nor refined in his Temper; that <hi>God,</hi> by
Power, should remove such a Man into
Heaven; when he came thither he would
not be satisfied either in the Persons, or
in the Employment of <hi>that Place:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all these would be contrary unto
him. Tho' when we speak of Heaven,
we understand rather <hi>a State,</hi> than <hi>a
Place:</hi> A Frame and Temper <hi>Within;</hi>
rather than any thing <hi>Without.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it is absolutely necessary that we
should by Goodness <hi>here,</hi> qualifie and
prepare our selves for Happiness <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi>
For, there is no Happiness in
the Meeting of Things that are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
                  <p>Thus, now, I have given you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>the State of Religion,</hi> and its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:56135:234"/>
upon <hi>the Body,</hi> and <hi>the Mind;</hi>
in <hi>this State</hi> and <hi>the other.</hi> And this is
enough to recommend Religion, and to
make us to look upon it, not as an <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Exaction;</hi> but as a Thing highly
pleasurable, and most desirable; as that
which is effectual to purifie our Natures,
and to raise our Minds; as that which is
the Health, and Strength, and good Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of our Minds: For, as a Man knows
that he is in Health, when the Offices of
Nature are well performed and dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
* <hi>So, is he sure of his Mind's Health
and Strength, when all the several Offices
and Duties of Life are easily and well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are very little acquainted with
<hi>Religion,</hi> that look upon it as <hi>a Burthen;</hi>
as that which puts too great a <hi>Restraint
upon Human Nature,</hi> and upon <hi>Liberty.</hi>
And, therefore, <hi>the Poet</hi> wrote his Book,
to <hi>release the Minds of Men from the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Religion.</hi> I confefs, he might
well do so, * <hi>as to</hi> that which he call'd
<hi>Religion:</hi> For, <hi>that</hi> was to release the
Minds of Men from those <hi>UNNATU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL
Obligations</hi> their Religion laid
upon them. But, no such Thing can be
said of <hi>that Religion</hi> which we profess.
For, the Work of our Religion is to
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:56135:234"/>
teach Men to avoid Evil, and to do Good.
And this doth no more confine Mens
Liberty, than for Men to confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
within the Measures of Sobriety,
and Temperance; and to avoid those
Things which would do them Hurt, and
Prejudice. No Man thinks he is <hi>under
Restraint,</hi> if he be confin'd to eat and
drink only those Things that will do him
Good. For, if this were Liberty and
Perfection <hi>to do one thing as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Evil,</hi> as well as <hi>Good,</hi> without Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or Distinction; then, let me ask
you; <hi>Where is GOD's Liberty?</hi> From
hence it would follow, that of all the
World, <hi>God</hi> is most tied and bound;
that <hi>HE</hi> (in whom there is <hi>Fulness of
Liberty,</hi> having all <hi>Power</hi>) is <hi>most limited.</hi>
For, God saith of himself, that he <hi>cannot</hi>
do Evil; that he doth <hi>banish it from his
Throne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hab. 1. 13.</note> and that he is <hi>of purer Eyes than
to behold Iniquity.</hi> I conclude, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
'tis not <hi>Power,</hi> but <hi>Weakness;</hi> not
<hi>Perfection,</hi> but <hi>Deformity,</hi> for any one
to be <hi>able</hi> to do otherwise than what is
right and fit to be done. For, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said of <hi>God</hi> himself. For, all the
Ways of God are <hi>Ways of Goodness, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
and <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="444" facs="tcp:56135:235"/>
Now, the better to inforce what hath
been said about Religion; I will balance
the two opposite <hi>States;</hi> that which is
founded <hi>in Religion,</hi> and that which is
founded <hi>in Evil</hi> and <hi>Sin:</hi> That by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
both together, you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the one and the other. For, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries</hi>
are t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> best Comments one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another. And to this purpose, I
will take into Consideration <hi>these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> It doth not deserve <hi>the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Title of RELIGION,</hi> or to be taken
for the Effect of <hi>Respect to God,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to Right,</hi> which doth not refine
Mens Spirits, rectifie their Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and regulate their Actions. Even
<hi>Nature's Sense,</hi> as depraved as it is, doth
startle at any vile Practice. For, nothing
is more true, than that all Evil is <hi>against
the NATURE of Man,</hi> till it is marr'd
and spoil'd by consenting to Iniquity.
For witness hereof, take <hi>Hazael</hi> as an
Instance: Who startled at the Mention
of those Sins which the Prophet told him
of:<note place="margin">2 Kin. 8. 13</note> Insomuch that he saith, <hi>Is thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
a Dog, that he should do such Things?</hi>
For, Impudency, Immodesty, and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are not <hi>primarily</hi> in the Nature of
Man; but they are contracted by <hi>base
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:56135:235"/>
Use, Custom,</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> Of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
there is no Account to be given; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>its Self,</hi> or of the <hi>Degree</hi> of it:
For, it is contrary to Reason. And when
the Rule of Right is once broken and
violated, no Man knows where a Person
will stay.</p>
                  <p>Let us consider the open Declarations
that are from God agai<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Wickedness,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18. Prov. 1. 26.</note>
both by Denunciation, and Execution.
'Tis true, God oftentimes hath long Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
with a wicked World: But it is
in order to their Repentance. Tho' Men
are very apt to mis-understand this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of God towards Sinners. For it
is observed, <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> 8. 11. That <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Sentence against an evil Work is not
speedily executed, therefore the Hearts of the
Sons of Men are set to do Mischief.</hi> But
yet, there is <hi>a present</hi> Recompence of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
For, <hi>all Inordinacy of Mind,</hi> carries
with it, <hi>its own Punishment.</hi> All Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
carries with it <hi>Uneasiness of Spirit</hi>
and <hi>Dissatisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Thing that I would offer to
your Consideration, is, the malign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Evil,</hi> and the dismal Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenence
thereof. For, it is that which
poysons the Nature of Man; and turns
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:56135:236"/>
Angels into Devils. <hi>MAN,</hi> which by
Nature, is a loving, mild, and gentle
Creature; it makes <hi>fierce,</hi> and <hi>cruel.
The WORLD,</hi> which by the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, is a Place habitable, and
fit to live in; it turns into <hi>a Wilderness
of Tygers,</hi> and <hi>Savage Creatures:</hi> For, the
Apostle saith, <hi>Whence come Wars and
Fightings?<note place="margin">Jam 4. 1.</note> Come they not from your Lusts
that war in your Numbers?</hi> If it were not
for the Exorbitancy of Mens Spirits, and
Wickedness of Mens Hearts, and Lives,
it would be the better for every Man, by
how many the more Men there were
in * <hi>the World:</hi> Whereas, now, <hi>many</hi>
Men are formidable: And, a Man runs
a Hazard, to run into <hi>Company.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>* <hi>Another Consideration is</hi> the Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countableness
of not revoking by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>what</hi> a Man hath done amiss. For,
this <hi>Second</hi> Evil, is greater than the <hi>First.</hi>
For, not to repent; is to justifie the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
that hath been done; and, to stand
to it. For the first Evil, something may
be alledged; to wit, Ignorance, Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency,
Temptation, and the like:
But, where Men continue in Evil; and
do not revoke it by Repentance; this
tends to settle them in a wicked Mind.
—It is our contracting Guilt, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:56135:236"/>
                     <hi>God</hi> an Offence, by our Careless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and consenting to Iniquity; that is
the Cause of all that <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity</hi>
that befals us. There is no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of internal Peace, but in <hi>a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
void of Offence both towards God,
and Man.</hi> He that carries Guilt in his
Breast; hath <hi>Tophet</hi> burning within him.
The Conscience not eased by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but under Guilt, hath <hi>Horrour</hi>
and <hi>Confusion;</hi> which is <hi>a Hell,</hi> on this
side <hi>Hell:</hi> I had almost said, <hi>the worst
of Hell its self.</hi> For, if to this we add,
<hi>the Sense of God's Offence;</hi> you have the
<hi>Hell of Hell.</hi> There is no Pleasure or
Satisfaction either in Life, or at the
Hour of Death, but in living according
to the Dictates of right <hi>Reason.</hi> For,
this is the Light of God, in Men: God's
Viceroy, or Vicegerent: And <hi>that</hi>
which is Fundamental to Conscience. So
that if we approve our selves therein;
we shall not give God Offence, nor
wound our own Spirits. And, for this,
I dare refer my self to any Man who
hath not contracted Reprobacy of Mind;
that these Things <hi>are so.</hi> But, for <hi>such</hi>
Men; they can no more judge of the
Reality of <hi>a State,</hi> than Men that are in
a Fever, can relish <hi>Food.</hi>—This, in
reality, may be defended against the
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:56135:237"/>
whole World; <hi>that there is nothing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable,
Lasting, or Satisfactory, but what
is HONEST.</hi> Nothing that is <hi>Base</hi>
or <hi>Vile,</hi> can be <hi>Pleasant.</hi> Good Men,
who are under the Power of <hi>Reason</hi> and
<hi>Religion;</hi> they are <hi>FREE Men,</hi> and
<hi>Happy,</hi> in any Condition; whether sick,
or well; at liberty, or shut up: And,
<hi>Bad Men,</hi> are <hi>SLAVES in the best Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:</hi>
For, they are under the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their <hi>Lusts,</hi> which are <hi>Tyrants,</hi>
and <hi>Usurpers,</hi> that have no Authority,
nor any Right to govern. The Desires
of <hi>Nature</hi> are moderate: But, <hi>the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of inordinate Appetites</hi> are neither
to be resisted, nor satisfied. And, hence
it comes to pass, that <hi>VERTUE is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
to Happiness;</hi> and <hi>VICE to
Misery.</hi> It is <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi> that
fills a Man with Uneasiness, Disorder,
Doubtfulness, and Irresolution. And
<hi>these</hi> put a Man besides himself, and out
of the true Use of Reason; which doth
represent <hi>God</hi> to Man: * <hi>So</hi> that he is
* <hi>even</hi> a mad Man, that questions his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
or that dares to give God an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
by doing any Thing that is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
For, we account that <hi>these Two</hi> go
together; <hi>To know GOD,</hi> and <hi>the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between Good, and Evil; Right, and
Wrong.</hi> And they that have apostatized
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:56135:237"/>
from Matters of Revelation, yet
have acknowledged, that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Nature of Man, an
Inclination to, and a Perswasion of <hi>a
Divine Being.</hi> For, most certain it is,
that the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man, as to <hi>God,</hi> holds
the same Sufficiency, and Proportion,
that <hi>the EYE</hi> of Man holds to <hi>Light;</hi>
which if a Man do but open, he cannot
but see. So, if a Man do but use <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
he must see, and acknowledge <hi>God.</hi>
The wise Man tells us,<note place="margin">Pro. 20. 27.</note> That the <hi>Spirit
of a Man is the Candle of the Lord.</hi> A
Candle lighted by God, and serving to
this Purpose; to discern and discover
God. And, truly, were it not thus;
wherein would consist the Excellency
of Human Nature, above the Inferiour
Nature? What a contemptible Creature
were <hi>Man,</hi> if he could not lift up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
above these Worldy Things? * <hi>Were</hi>
it not thus, <hi>Life it self</hi> were not greatly
valuable. Take from Man <hi>this Power,</hi>
and <hi>Capacity;</hi> and there is nothing in the
World for which a Man would suffer
Pain, or Cold; or break his Sleep. For,
What is there, in Worldly Drudgery?
We, often, have little more than <hi>our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for our Travel.</hi>—Now, this is
my Argument. If <hi>Nature</hi> carry in it,
<hi>Sense of Deity;</hi> and, if to the Nature
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:56135:238"/>
of Man belong true Notions of <hi>the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Perfections</hi> that are in <hi>God</hi> (I mean
his <hi>Moral Perfections:</hi> As <hi>Truth, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Purity, Holiness,</hi> and the like;)
and that those who have had no Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from God, have arrived to a full
Satisfaction of <hi>the Existence of Deity,</hi>
and have had <hi>Sense of Good and Evil,</hi>
Right <hi>and</hi> Wrong; * <hi>then, they who</hi> fall
short of these Measures, fall under Force,
and Violence; and lay * <hi>within themselves</hi>
the Foundation of Uncertainty, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction:
Because they have <hi>a Principle</hi>
within themselves, that doth reprove and
challenge, countermand and controul.
For, it is a great Matter for a Man <hi>to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
himself to himself;</hi> and to satisfie
the Reason of his own Mind. How true
is that of <hi>the Prophet?</hi> (which, also, is
verified by <hi>Reason</hi>) <hi>there is no Peace,</hi>
* saith he, <hi>to the Wicked: But, they are
like the troubled Sea, that cannot rest.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 57. 20.</note> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more true, than * <hi>that</hi> if a Man
be <hi>Guilty,</hi> and vary from <hi>the Rule of
Right,</hi> and depart from <hi>Reason;</hi> he
wrongs himself, goes against his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the Law of his Nature; and
shakes off <hi>his Governour:</hi> Therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have Peace, or Satisfaction. For,
these Things are in Conjunction, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be separated, <hi>viz. Innocency,</hi> and
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:56135:238"/>
                     <hi>Peace:</hi> And, on the contrary, these go together,
<hi>Guiltiness,</hi> and <hi>Perplexity of Thoughts.</hi> And these
Things are not as Men will; or as they order,
and chuse; but, they are conjoyn'd <hi>in the Nature
of Things themselves.</hi> And these Things being so;
RELIGION recommends it self, from <hi>its Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
and is not to be look'd upon, as <hi>an Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
or <hi>a Burthen</hi> laid upon the Nature of Man: But,
ought to be a Matter <hi>of our Delight</hi> and <hi>Choice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, then, <hi>the last Consideration is this:</hi> That
the Perfection and Happiness of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
consists in the right Use of our Rational
Faculties, and in the Vigour and Intense Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of them, about their <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Object.</hi> And, what <hi>Object</hi> can be more <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable</hi>
than <hi>GOD</hi> himself, the Original of our
<hi>Being?</hi> Him from whom it did flow? Who is
<hi>the Pattern</hi> of all <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Goodness?</hi> If,
therefore, we find not <hi>Rest,</hi> and greater <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in <hi>HIM,</hi> than in <hi>all Worldly Pleasure, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;</hi>
it is, because we have not exerted our
<hi>highest</hi> and <hi>noblest Faculties</hi> in that Vigour which
we ought, and should dave done; or as we have
done our <hi>Sensual Appetites:</hi> But have suffered
our <hi>noble Faculties</hi> to be interrupted by Bodily
Indisposition, or Worldly Pleasure: Whence,
they become untoward to Things Spiritual:
Whereas, if * <hi>these Faculties</hi> had been inured, as
they should have been; we should have found,
more and more, that Heavenly Acts were become
suitable, con-natural, and easie. Just as in Persons
that live a Contemplative Life, and delight in
Reading and Meditation; to these Men it is
Ten thousand times more Satisfaction, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:56135:239"/>
or, in Company that will improve their
Understanding; than in any other Business
whatsoever. And, of such Men it may be said,
that they are never <hi>less alone,</hi> than <hi>when alone.</hi>
This is the great Priviledge of Men that lead
Contemplative Lives; that they never want
Employment: When other Men that sink down
into Sensuality, or that violate the Peace of their
own Minds, and Consciences, are fain to seek the
worst of Company; that they may drive away
their Time. But, if we did exert our Minds
and Understandings about <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Heavenly
Things;</hi> our Souls would be so habituated, that
upon all Occasions they would, with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and Freedom, without any Aversation, or
Backwardness, exercise themselves in Heavenly
Medication. For, Heavenly Things are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Truths and Realities in the World: And <hi>our
Life,</hi> is <hi>in them.</hi> Whereas, they that are drown'd
in Sensual Pleasures are <hi>dead,</hi> whilst they <hi>live.</hi>
—This I account: That, in <hi>Morality,</hi> we
are as sure as in <hi>Mathematicks.</hi>—<hi>GOD, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Reason,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> hath so contrived; that
if an Intelectual Being sink it self into Sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Love of this outward World; or, any way
defile, and pollute it self; then, Miseries, and
Torments, Afflictions and Vexations should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
it, <hi>in this State:</hi> This being the surest Way to
rescue, and recover a lapsing and delcining Soul.</p>
                  <p>And, so, I have given you an account of the
* <hi>several</hi> Particulars; whereby you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that <hi>this</hi> which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, is a true
Representation of <hi>the State of Religion.</hi>
