            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Hypothesis of Fire and Flame I did
about eleven years since publish in
the 16. Observation <hi>Pag.</hi> 103, 104,
and 105. of my <hi>Micrographia,</hi> which
hath so far obtained, that many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have since made use of it, and
asserted it; not have I yet met with
one considerable objection against it.
It shall not therefore be my business at present to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of, or farther explain that Theory, which any one
upon a strict inquiry into, I question not, will find cause
sufficient to confirm him in, but rather to mention some
pleasant and beneficial uses thereof, and to hint some
Mechanical contrivances, for the supplying the <hi>Pabulum</hi>
Oyl or Spirit by the same Degrees by which it is consumed
in the flame of a Lamp, that great dissolvent.</p>
            <p>I do not here design to shew a way how to make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Lamp, that being a Chimera which my Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
of flame doth seem to destroy, for the dissolvend must
in time be dissolved: But to shew a way how to make
<pb facs="tcp:98433:3"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb facs="tcp:98433:3"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98433:4"/>
the Receptacle of a Lamp in such manner as that it shall
continue to supply the <hi>Pabulum</hi> to the flame equally and
for a very long time till it be all consumed. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of which Problem first put me upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after a counterpoise for Liquors or Fluids, which
is also of very great use in Hydraulicks, as I shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
have occasion to manifest.</p>
            <p>This I can do by very many contrivances, depending
from very differing Principles, all and every of which
may be fitted so as to supply the Oyl or <hi>Pabulum</hi> of the
Lamp in such quantity, and after such manner and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as shall be desired. I shall now omit all the other
ways of performing this effect, though divers of them
are as much or more considerable than any of these I
here mention. And having promised in the 32 Page of
my description of Helioscopes to publish a Counterpoise
for Liquors, I shall only explain several ways by the help
of these Counterpoises to do whatsoever can be required,
as to the manner and quantity of supplying Oyl to the
flame.</p>
            <p>The chief design of the Counterpoise in this inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to keep the Superficies of the Liquor (whether
Oyl, Spirit of Wine, Oyl of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> or the like)
whatever quantity there be in the Vessel, always to the
same height, so that the said <hi>Pabulum</hi> shall always be
equally distant from the bottom of the flame, and the
Wick or flame being once placed at a convenient height
or distance above the Superficies of the Oyl, shall not be
deserted by the said Superficies till the whole quantity be
consumed; but it is as easie to contrive it, to supply it by
decreasing or increasing degrees, which are conveniences
that none of all the Lamps I have ever yet met with have
had, that was tolerable for use. The most ingenious is
that which is commonly known by the name of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans</hi>
Lamp, as being published and very probably inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Cardan,</hi> which doth in some manner supply the
wasting and decay of the Oyl caused by the flames Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
But then it is subject to a great many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98433:4"/>
which make it intollerable and disused: The
first is, though it doth supply the defects of the Oyl to
the Wick, yet it doth it not constantly and equally, but
by starts and gluts; for after the receptacle by the Wick
is filled, the Superficies of the Oyl continues to sink by
degrees a considerable space below the flame, before
there be any more supply added from the great Magazine
or Repository, and till the Air can break in, (which it doth
very unequally) so that there sometimes comes down so
great a quantity that the receptacle is over-filled, and
the flame extinguished, and these gluts are more unequal
the bigger the Magazine be in proportion to the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
by the flame, and the more the quantity of the
Oyl be that is suspended, and the more the Air space be
above the Oyl, and the more tenacious or sluggish the
constitution of the Oyl is.</p>
            <p>The second inconvenience of <hi>Cardans</hi> Lamp is that the
Air is apt to rarifie it with heat, so as sometimes to drive
down so much Oyl as to overflow the receptacle, and
choak the flame.</p>
            <p>The third Inconvenience is, that the Wick by the sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the oyl doth sooner decay the flame, being sometimes
a little higher and sometimes lower upon the Wick; for
if the Wick rise up into the hollow dead part of the
Cone of the flame, the streams and coals of the Oyl will
be so caked together as to dead the flame and much to
diminish the light and heat thereof, whereas if the Wick
be but short, and suffered only to go but a very little
within the under-Superficies of the flame, it will not be
so stopped and caked with those feculencies. The reason
of which is evident, for the flame, as I formerly proved,
being nothing but the parts of the Oyl rarified and raised
by heat into the form of a vapour, smoak, or steam, the
free Air that incompasseth this steam keepeth it into a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrical
form, and by its dissolving property preyeth
upon or dissolveth those parts of it that are outwards and
next to the Air, so as by the said dissolution it continueth
the heat, and produceth the light which we observe; but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98433:5"/>
those parts of the body of steams that rise from the Wick;
which are in the middle, and not contiguous to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Air, are not dissolved or turned into shining flame
by the Air till they rise towards the top of the Cone of
flame where the free Air can come to reach, and so to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
them, and thence gathering about the Wick in the
Center of the Cone of flame they choak, clog, and
quite stifle it that the flame will quickly go out. That
this is so, any one may easily find if he examine the flame
of a Lamp or Candle by the help of a piece of glass:
For by the transparency thereof he will plainly perceive
that all the middle of the Cone of flame neither shines
nor burns but only the outward Superficies thereof that
is contiguous to the free and unsatiated Air, and that the
middle parts may be collected in the form of Soot, or very
fine powdered coal dust.</p>
            <p>Take then a piece of Glass, whether Window-Glass,
Looking-glass Plate, or the side of a Viol, it matters not,
or, which is best of all, a thin Plate of <hi>Selenitis</hi> or <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
Talk, and hold it Horizontally in the middle of the
flame, so as to cut off the top or upper part of the Cone
thereof, then presently, before it be choaked with soot;
look down upon it, and you shall plainly see that all the
middle parts of the Flame and the Wick have no shining
power or light at all; nor are they dissolved by the Air,
but remain in the form of Soot, but that only the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
or outside of the said Cone doth burn, shine, and
consume into and mix with the ambient Air.</p>
            <p>In the same manner, if you hold the Glass or Selenitis
perpendicularly, and apply the side of it so as to cut the
flame <hi>per axin coni,</hi> that the Air cannot come to one side
thereof, you may plainly perceive that the shining part
of the flame is only that which is contiguous to, and
preyed upon by the free and unsatiated Air, and that
where that Air cannot come free without being glutted
and satiated in its way, there neither the consumption of
the Oyl, nor the heat and light of the flame is produced,
but only a sooty, choaking, and stifling substance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98433:5"/>
To make then the reason of the Phaenomena observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
about the lasting or stifling of the flame of a Lamp
the more clear and easie to be understood and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
give me leave to explain the manner of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
and continuation by a Scheme, delineation, and
description thereof.</p>
            <p>Let AA then in the second Table represent a body of
Oyl, or any other combustible fluid substance, the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
whereof BB is Horizontal, and pretty near plain. [I
say, pretty near, because it is always either Concave, or
Convex, more or less according to several circumstances;
to wit, the capacity and the nature of the Vessel EE, in
which it is contained; for if the Vessel be small, and that
the Oyl hath a greater congruity with it than the Air,
the Superficies of the Oyl will be very much concavated
especially towards the sides of the Vessel as at CC; but
if the Vessel be incongruous to Oyl, the Superficies will
be Convex as at DD, the reason of which I have long
since explained in another place.]</p>
            <p>Let FF then in the third figure represent the Wick,
which consists of a great number of very fine Cylinders or
hairs of Cotton fff twisted and laid very close together,
into, and between which the Oyl (having a very great
congruity therewith) doth readily insinuate it self and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here,
and is by the pressure of the Air (much greater
without than between those Cylinders or hairs) forced up
to a considerable height between them, (as to the height
of an inch and half, or two Inches) and if by any means
the Oyl be taken out at the top thereof, the remaining
part of the Oyl in the Vessel will ascend to supply the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy
of the part drawn off, which is evident in Filtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
About the sides of this Wick the Oyl will be sure
to ascend, and the Superficies thereof will be concava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as at GG, because unless there be a congruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Oyl and the Wick there will be no ascent of
the Oyl therein, and therefore that substance that the
Oyl doth not readily adhere to cannot be a fit material for
that purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98433:6"/>
Now to this Wick thus filled with Oyl apply the
flame of a Lamp or Candle, or any other substance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
hot, as a glowing piece of Iron, Copper, or the
like, and by this means the parts of the Oyl in the Wick
will be very much heated, and expand themselves in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
into the contiguous Air by the steams hhhhh, and
fill all the Ambient space of the Air HH therewith,
which vapours being very much rarified, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
lighter than the incompassing Air, are by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
gravity and pressure thereof carried upwards by the
Curve Lines hik. These at first gush out of the Wick
at Right Angles, but by the protrusion of the Air are
quickly turned into a kind of Parabolick Curve hik
The motion of the Particles in which is swiftest in kk,
that is to a certain degree of Altitude. The motion of
ascent increasing somewhat after the nature of the motion
of descent in heavy bodies, I say somewhat in that nature,
for if the ascending bodies were uniformly lighter than
the Ambient they would be the same, but because the
rarefaction and nature of them is varied by Circumstances,
therefore it hath but part of that Analogy.</p>
            <p>To proceed then with the Explication: I say, these
steams of the Oyl thus ascending, if they are heated
to a sufficient degree of heat are preyed upon, and
dissolved or burned by the Ambient Air; which dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath this effect, first, that it produceth light; next,
that it produceth heat enough to make the succeeding
parts of the steams that rush out of the Wick and follow
after it to be sufficiently heated for dissolution by the Air,
the heat of which produceth the same operation upon a
third, and that upon a fourth, and that upon a fifth, and
so successively so long as there are steams of Oyl to be
dissolved, and plenty of fresh and unsatiated Air to
dissolve. The action also of this dissolution causeth heat
sufficient to raise up the succeeding parts of the Oyl into
the Wick, and expand them into vapours, and so to make
them fit to be further heated and dissolved. It is further
observable in the flame of a Lamp, that those vapours
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98433:6"/>
that issue out of the Wick are by degrees dissolved and
not all in a moment, for the parts of the flame that are
lowermost about H have a kind of faint blew light until
they come to I, where they seem to have their brightest
and clearest light and heat, the said vapours not being hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to that degree at their first breaking out that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
acquire by the farther action of the Air upon
them. At I they seem to be in their highest degree of disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and from thence upwards are made one with the
dissolving Air, so that they are not but by other means
discernable to the eye of the observer; so that the shining
part of this Conical shaped space of the flame is only the
outside of the Cone, it being that part where the Ambient
Air preys upon the ascending eruptions of the Oyl,
namely, where the Chain of small Circles intercept the
Curve lines of the motion of the ascending eruptions.</p>
            <p>This Figure and shape of the flame and vapours may
be plainly seen by the help of a Metalline Concave
placed at a certain distance and Position, and also by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the shadow of the Candle cast by the beams of
the Sun upon a sheet of white Paper, or white Wall, but
that way of a Concave <hi>speculum</hi> is incomparably beyond
it, because it doth so very plainly shew the form and
manner of the steams rising above iiii, as about
kkkk, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Air after it hath performed the action of Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and is satiated and incorporated with the parts of
the Oyl at iii, ascend by kkk, but shine not. All the
steams or eruption of the vapours of the Oyl out of the
Wick fff shine not between the Wick ff and ii, but
begin to be dissolved, and to shine as they approach
the fresh Air at ii, where the dissolution is compleated.</p>
            <p>The upper parts of the flame shine more than the
lower, the parts having been heated to a much greater
degree by the longer space of passage they have had
through the hot Concave part of the flame, and contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or very near to the glowingsides thereof at iii.</p>
            <p>All the under parts of the Wick neither shine nor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98433:7"/>
burn, but are as it were charkd by the extremity of the
heat of the Conical Superficies of the flame, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
from burning at the bottom by the fresh access of
new Oyl from the Vessel underneath; and the middle
parts are defended from burning or shining by reason the
Air cannot approach them before it be satiated at the
Conical Superficies iii by the dissolution of the steams
of the Oyl it there meeteth with. But the upper parts of
the Wick do burn and shine, if they be high enough, into
the smaller part of the Cone of flame that the Air before
it be satiated can reach at them. And if any part of the
Wick fall into the said Conical and shining Superficies of
the flame, it doth both shine and consume, and suffers the
same dissolution into the Air as the steams of the Oyl,
and if any part of this Wick be without this Conical Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
at iii, it is presently consumed and reduced to
Ashes; as by many experiments differing ways made is
very plainly visible.</p>
            <p>This plainly gives the cause why knots and Tophus's
do as it were grow to the Wick of the Lamp like so many
Mushrooms on a rotten Tree, which as soon as they are
removed out of the middle and dead part of the flame
are immediately consumed by, and dissolved into the
Air, and shine like a coal of fire, as being indeed nothing
else.</p>
            <p>Hence we may give a plain Reason why upon applying
any cool Superficies very low into the flame of a Lamp,
there is immediately condensed upon it a great quantity
of soot, namely, that the middle parts of the Cone of
flame, being nothing but a great number of oyly steams
ascending, are not fired nor consumed by the Air, till they
can come to be wrought upon by the free and unsatiated
Air. Now if the Air be so intercepted that it cannot
come at them, and the steams be cooled by the plates
coldness that the Air is not able to prey upon or dissolve
them for want of a preparatory heat sufficient, they must
remain in the form of burnt Oyl, or Lamp-black.</p>
            <p>I have been somewhat the longer and more particular
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98433:7"/>
in this description and explanation of my Theory of the
flame of a Lamp or Candle, that so the Reader under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the nature and causes thereof the more fully and
plainly, he may the easier discover the inconveniences
that may occur in the burning, heating, shining, durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereof, and the sooner and more readily and
scientifically find a cure and prevention of those inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
which he that is ignorant of can but hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winked
grope after, and at best can but hope possibly
after long puzling himself in vain attempts and blind
trials, nothing to the purpose, he may at length stumble
upon that which had he been inlightned by the true The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory,
he would have readily gone to at the first glance.</p>
            <p>I could have further expatiated into the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of this most admirable Phenomenon of flame,
producing heat and light, the two most spirituous
and most potent Agents in Nature, and the ways of
Intending and Diminishing them, and the uses that may
be made of them, but that it is not my present design
to annex a discourse on those subjects, which doth
more properly belong to another Lecture I shall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
publish. I shall therefore at present proceed only
to shew some Mechanical contrivances for counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poising
Liquors in Vessels, so as to keep them running
or supplying a stream always with equal swiftness, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
quantity there be of the said Fluid; which as they
are very convenient for perfecting Lamps for divers uses,
which they could not otherwise perform, so in Hydrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
they are of most admirable benefit for divers
effects, hardly to be performed without them, as I shall
hereafter manifest. But first, I will explain some few
ways by which more conveniences may be obtained, and
more inconveniences prevented in the use of Lamps for
Chymical, Mechanical, and Philosophical uses than by
this way of <hi>Cardan,</hi> or any other I have met with: For
this I look upon as one of the Tools to be made use of
in the Work-house or Elaboratory of Nature, without
a good Apparatus of which, be the Workman otherwise
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98433:8"/>
never so well accomplished, he will never be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any very considerable effect; and with them, even
a Bungler otherwise, will, if well furnished, do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to such as know not the means by which they are
done.</p>
            <p>It may possibly seem very strange to some to hear, that
by the flame of a Lamp Plants may be made to grow,
bear Leaves, blow Flowers, ripen Seeds; that the Eggs
of Fowls and Insects may be hatched, and brought to
life and perfection; that Metals, even the hardest, Glass,
Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be almost in a moment melted, soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
liquified, hardned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that thousands of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of conjoyned and naturally united bodies may be
effected, and they reserved distinct; and as many other
bodies, naturally distinct, and very differing, may be
united and compounded into Homogeneous mixtures,
some scarce separable afterwards; that Glass may be
shaped and moulded like Wax; that almost all the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
qualities of bodies may be increased, diminished,
annihilated, and created; and some also of the qualities
insensible (otherwise than by the effects;) and yet even
these, and many more, may be effected by this Tool or
Instrument, if rightly used, as I could manifest if I had
now time. But I shall not here any further expatiate on
it, possibly I may hereafter but at present I shall only
proceed to the description of one sort of those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
which serve to supply the Oyl or <hi>Pabulum</hi> of
a Lamp conveniently by any degrees, and in what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
is desired. This sort doth depend upon some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of Counterpoises for the Liquor in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
that is to feed the Lamp, and may be made use of
in Hydralicks as well as Lamps to feed and continue any
running stream any time desired.</p>
            <p>These Counterpoises then of Fluids might be made to
feed the flame of a Lamp equally for any time assigned,
and consequently would make a kind of Perpetual Lamp,
but the <hi>Pabulum</hi> it self will be some ways or other unapt
for such an effect; as Oyl hath a foulness whereby the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98433:8"/>
Wick is choaked or stopped, so as that it will no longer
ascend in it; Spirit of Wine will in length of time eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
and lose much of its nature; and other Oyls have
their several defects which make them uncapable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
the flame very long. But there are none of these
that I have met with but may be in great measure avoided
by the help of some Chymical or Mechanical contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
some instances whereof I shall hereafter give,
which the Theory of Fire and Flame doth readily
hint.</p>
            <p>The first way then I shall now describe is by a round
Box, the inward Cavity of which is divided by a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm
into two equal parts, and fitted with a proper
Counterpoise, the Axis of whose motion lieth Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.
The contrivance of which will be more plainly
understood by the Delineation thereof in the first place,
where the second Figure represents the whole Instrument,
with its Globe, Frame, Pedestal, Socket, and lighted
Lamp.</p>
            <p>A represents the Pedestal or foot upon which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
stands, which may be made of Silver, Brass, Wood,
or the like. BCDEF, the Frame fastned to the Pedestal,
and shaped in the form of a Snake, perforated at B and D
to receive the Pivots or Gudgeons of the Lamp GH, and
hollow from E to F to serve to convey the Oyl or Spirit
of Wine from the end of the hollow Gudgeon H to the
Wick I, to feed the Flame K; the hole at E to receive
the end of the hollow Gudgeon; H is made a little ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering,
and the end of the Gudgeon H is ground fit into
it, so as to turn easily, and yet so true, as not to let any
Oyl there leak out, the said Gudgeon being kept close
home by the springing of the Arm B; the Superficies of
the Oyl or Spirit for the <hi>Pabulum</hi> is always kept by the
motion of the said Globe upon its Axis GH, exactly in the
Line LM, untill it be all consumed, which how it is done
will be better conceived by shewing the contrivance of
the inside of the aforesaid Globe, how the same is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
how filled, and how counterpoised.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98433:9"/>
Suppose then the aforesaid Globe cut in sunder by
the middle Line or Circle NO, and discovering the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
or Cavity thereof to be represented in the first Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
where PAHRZP represents the aforesaid Circle,
or half shell of the Globe; O represents the middle of
the hollow Gudgeon H, which is the Pole or Axis about
which the said Globe doth move. HOZ represents the
Horizontal Line or Plain passing through the aforesaid
Axis; PR the Perpendicular to that Plain. Let HZ then
represent a Diaphragm or Partition of the same material
with the Globe, by which the Concavity thereof is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into an upper Hemisphere HPZOH, and into an
under Hemisphere HRZOH. Let the under Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere
be filled with Oyl, Spirit of Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the like
fit material for a Lamp to burn; and let the upper part
be filled with some material of half the weight of the
Oyl, Spirit, or other material, or because that will be
somewhat difficult to do, let there be a counterpoise of
Lead or other ponderous matter fixed somewhere in the
Line PO, so that the said upper Hemisphere shall have
half the gravity of the under Hemisphere upon the
Center of motion O. I say, whatever quantity of the
Fluid <hi>Pabulum</hi> is in the Cavity of the said under He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere,
the Superficies thereof shall always be in the
Horizontal Line or Plain OZ, the counterpoised upper
Hemisphere keeping it always up to that height. For
instance, supposing the said Hemisphere full, there is no
doubt but that the under Hemisphere being double the
weight of the uppermost will be lowermost, and that
Horizontal Line will lie Horizontally, since it is evident,
that the Center of gravity of the whole will be below
the Center of motion O, and somewhere in the Line
OR, which is Perpendicular to the aforesaid Plain. Next,
suppose so much of the aforesaid Liquid <hi>Pabulum</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
as to leave enough only to fill the space
COZBRC, and the Diaphragm be moved from its Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal
Position HZ, and placed in the Oblique Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
COD. I say, the said upper Hemisphere
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98433:9"/>
CHAPDOC shall exactly counterpoise the said under
Hemisphere CRBZDOC, so as the Superficies of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
shall be in the Horizontal Plain OZ. Make AP
equal to PD, and draw the Line AOB through the
Center O, it is manifest then that the Wedge COR of
the Liquor doth counterpoise the Wedge ROB on the
other side the Perpendicular, and that the Wedge POD
of the upper Hemisphere doth counterpoise the Wedge
POA on the other side of the Perpendicular, so that
neither of these have any prepollency to move the Globe
out of this Posture. Next, it is plain that the Wedge
BOZ of the Liquor will be counterpoised by the Wedge
AOC, which is double the bigness of BOZ, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of equal weight, the parts of the upper He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere
being put of half the gravity or weight of the
under Hemisphere.</p>
            <p>Next, suppose half the Oyl be consumed, and therebe
only left enough to fill the quadrantal Wedge ZOR,
I say, the Superficies thereof shall be in the Horizontal
Line OZ; for since the upper Hemisphere is half the
weight of the under, the two quadrantal Wedges POH
and HOR must necessarily counterpoise the quadrantal
Wedge ROZ of the Oyl.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Suppose that more than half the said Oyl or
liquid <hi>Pabulum</hi> be consumed, and that there be only left
enough to fill the Wedge BOZ, I say, the counterpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upper Hemisphere now made the under, and placed
in the Position AHCRBOA shall exactly counterpoise
the said Wedge of Liquor, so as that the Superficies
thereof shall be in the Line OZ; for the Wedge ROB
of the aforesaid upper Hemisphere doth counterpoise
the Wedge COR on the other side of the Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and the double Wedge AOH and HOC will coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
the Wedge BOZ.</p>
            <p>Nor can the Superficies of the Liquor be any whit
higher or lower than the Line OZ, for it be any whit
higher as at EF, the Liquor must necessarily overpoise
the aforesaid Wedge AOC, by all the weight of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98433:10"/>
Liquor contained in FGOZF. And if it be any
whit lower as at IK, the Wedge KIB must be too
light for the counterpoising Wedge AOC by the
weight of the Liquor contained in the space
ZOTKZ, since I just now shewed that AOC did
just counterpoise ZOB, which was the thing to be
proved.</p>
            <p>Now though in this Instance I have chosen to explicate
I have made choice of a Globe, yet that form is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
but it may be made of any Figure whatsoever
that is turned upon an Axis or Poles, so as wheresoever
the said Figure be cut by a Plain to which the Axis is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular,
the Superficies of the said Figure shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
a Circle, the Center whereof is in the said Axis,
whether the said Figure be a Cylinder Cone, or any
other Conoeidical, mixt, or otherwise, regular, or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
figure. Such as the Figures ABCDEFG, which
represent the Section of the said Vessel through the
Axis.</p>
            <p>The second way for the poysing the Liquor, and
keeping the Superficies thereof always to an equal height,
is this:</p>
            <p>Make a Concave Receptacle for the Oyl or Liquor of
a Hemispherical, Semicylindrical, Semiconical, or of any
other half-round hollow Figure, where the turned Figure
is cut in two parts <hi>per Axin,</hi> and whereof the Axis is
placed Horizontal, and the plain Section <hi>per Axin</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Horizontally, so as it may be filled with any Liquor
up to that Plain; and that the Liquor may not be apt to
dash, be shaken, or filter over, it will be convenient to
extend the brims of that Receptacle somewhat above
the half-Round, that there may be about half or three
quarters of an Inch of space above the Superficies of the
Oyl vacant or empty. And that upon whatever Plain the
foot stand, the Plain <hi>per Axin</hi> may stand Horizontal, it
will be good to suspend the Receptacle in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as a Sea-mans Compass is suspended, within a frame:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98433:10"/>
Fix this Receptacle, or the Frame that is to keep the
Receptacle, Horizontal upon a convenient Pedestal;
and fit within the Hollow or Concavity of the Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
a half-round solid poise, turned of the same form
with the hollow of the Receptacle, and cut exactly
through the Axis in two equal parts. Let this solid
poise be made exactly half the weight of the Liquor that
is to be poised, and fit to it two Pivots or Pins at each
end of the Axis, which may be exactly in the Poles of
the half-Round, and fit to those Pins make two holes in
the Centers of the Ends of the Concave Receptacle, in
which the Pins may freely move, and suffer the half-Round
poise to move round within the hollow of the
Receptacle, according as the quantity of the Oyl or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
is increased or diminished. Fit to this Receptacle
a neck and socket fit for the Wick and flame of the
Lamp, and the same operation will be performed by this
as by the first contrivance; to wit, the Oyl will be kept al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to the same height in the Receptacle.</p>
            <p>This will be easier understood by explaining a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
thereof which is shadowed forth in the fourth
Figure: Where</p>
            <p>AAA represents a Pedestal, which may be made with
three claws or toes to make it stand the steadier and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
upon any Plain or Table.</p>
            <p>BB represent one of the Semicircular Arms that are
fix'd to the top of the Pedestal, this hath two holes in it
at the ends or extremities, as at C is one, the other hole
being in the other arm which goes behind the Globe,
and therefore cannot be seen, is supposed to be Diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
opposite to this at C. These two holes are the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
holes in which two small Pins or Centers, fastned into
two opposite points of the Hoop or Frame are made fit
to move, by which means the said Hoop is preserved in
an horizontal Position.</p>
            <p>DD is this Hoop or Frame, which is made to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
the Vessel or Receptacle of the Oyl, and is shaped
exactly like it. This is made strong enough of Brass,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98433:11"/>
Iron, Silver, or other material to bear the Receptacle,
Poise and Oyl without bending, and hath, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
two Pins or Gudgeons at C, and opposite to it Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametrically,
or Semicircularly, upon which the said
Hoop always hangeth Horizontally. It hath also on each
side in the middle between the aforesaid Pivots, two
Centers as at F and E to receive the ends of the Axis of
the Receptacle appearing at F and E, by which the said
Receptacle is always free to hang plumb or in its Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularity,
so as that the upper edge thereof at FF will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
lie Horizontally.</p>
            <p>One of these Pivots, namely, that on the Right hand
is the Pipe to convey the Oyl to the Socket of the Lamp I,
in which is fitted a Wick of Cotton to serve for the
flame, KGG represents the Vessel or Receptacle of Oyl,
which is here described Hemispherical, that being the
most capacious uniform Figure, but may be of any other,
qualified as those I mentioned in the first contrivance.
The Brims of this are extended somewhat higher than a
Semicircle, namely, to FF, to keep the Oyl from flashing
or filtring over. This is always kept full with Oyl or
other Liquor to the Horizontal prick'd Line LL, which
passeth through the Center or Axis of its Cavity by the
Counterpoise moved on the Center C.</p>
            <p>HHH represents that Counterpoise which is made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
half the weight of the Oyl or Liquor, and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of gravity of it must be somewhere in the Line MM;
and it ought to be fitted as exactly into the hollow of the
Receptacle as it is possible, that there may be left as little
space as may be between its convex sides and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
of the Receptacle, but yet so much must be left
that it may move very freely upon its Center C a whole
Semicircle. This done, and the Receptacle being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Oyl, the same effect will follow as in the first
contrivance, and the Demonstration of it being much
the same, I shall not now spend time to explain it. But
rather proceed to the description of a third way of
keeping the Liquor counterpoised to the same level.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98433:11"/>
The third way then is:</p>
            <p>Take any round Vessel, whose Concavity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity
is turned upon an Axis, and suspend that Vessel
upon two small Pivots (but yet big enough to bear the
said Vessel filled with Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> fastned in the Poles of
that Axis; and leave or cut open a sixth part more or less
as you please of the side thereof, that thereby any thing
may be put into or taken out of the Cavity of the Vessel;
then poise the Vessel exactly on those Centers, that no
side be heavier than the other; then fit into it a float of
Brass, Silver, Tin, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Convex on the under side,
so as just to fill to the Cavity of the Vessel. And on the
upper side, Plain, or Convex, or any other convenient
Figure, it matters not much. Make this float as heavy as
you can at the bottom, and as light as may be at the top,
but yet of such weight as may well float upon the top of
the Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let one end of this be fastned by a wire or
string, so as that end thereof may always touch that
point of the Concave of the Vessel to which it is tied,
and that the rest thereof may turn and follow the sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Oyl; and through the end of it, near the place
where it is fastned, let a Pipe go through it to receive the
Wick, which Pipe hath no communication with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the hollow float. This done, fill the Vessel as full
as convenient with Oyl, and light the Wick, and you
shall find that as the fire consumeth the Oyl, the Vessel
will turn upon its Poles and keep the Superficies of the
Oyl always at the same distance from the flame that it was
put at at first till the whole be consumed.</p>
            <p>This will be made more conceivable by a figure and
explanation thereof, which therefore take as follows
in the fifth figure.</p>
            <p>ACBB represents a hollow Vessel, the Cavity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is very exactly turned upon an Axis whose Poles are in
P, the space between A and B in the side thereof is left
open into the Cavity of it. This Vessel is suspended
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98433:12"/>
upon its Poles at P, so as to be free to move round upon
them, and exactly poised as no one side thereof be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
than another. To the hollow of this Vessel is fitted
a float D of Brass, Latton, Silver, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whose under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
is made of a Convexity just fit for the Concavity of
the Vessel, as may be seen at KDI, and the upper straight
or Plain. Let this float be made somewhat lighter than
the Oyl or Liquor on which it is to swim, so that a part
thereof may float above the Superficies thereof. Let one
end thereof E be fastned to the side of the Vessel a little
below the Brim B; through the end of this float is put a
Pipe and Wick h, for the flame i, then pouring in Oyl
by the open side AQB, fill the same till it carry the float
up to touch the hollow of the Vessel; then light the
Wick, and you will find that the Lamp will consume the
Oyl, and this contrivance will continually supply it till
the whole be consumed, and the Poise be moved to
touch the Concave of the aforesaid Vessel; for when the
Vessel is filled up to fg, the float D will touch at O and
E, and the Cavity above fg being empty, the Vessel will
be as is described in the Figure, the open part AB being
upwards. And as the flame consumeth the Oyl, the side
of the Vessel B will descend downward towards B1;
and so by B1, B2, B3, to B4, where the whole quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Oyl will be consumed, and the bottom of the float
will touch the hollow side of the Vessel; in all which
gradual wasting of the Oyl the Superficies thereof will lie
at the same distance below the upper side of the float D
that it had at first, and consequently at the same distance
from the bottom of the flame. The reason of all which
will be very easie to be understood by any one that shall
seriously on this Delineation consider that the float D must
necessitate the Vessel ACB to move on its Axis B ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as its Oyl wasts, because one end thereof E being
fastned to the brim of the Vessel B, the other end O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
loose will as the Oyl wasts descend towards N, whence
the end E must hang heavier on the brim B, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
must move it down towards B, till the upper
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98433:12"/>
side fg of the float be reduced to a Parallelism with the
Superficies of the remaining Oyl, and the end E have no
gravitation on the brim B, which motion will be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as the Oyl wasts; and the brim B will be moved down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by the points B1, B2, B3, to B4. I shall not
therefore spend any more time in the Geometrical demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
thereof, but proceed to explain a fourth way by
which the Flame and Superficies of the Oyl keep always
at the distance they were first put at.</p>
            <p>The Fourth way then is, the making the Socket of the
Wick to swim upon the top of the Oyl, so that the
Socket may sink as well as the Oyl, by reason it is sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by that, and by that only. The Vessel or Receptacle
is generally made of Glass, and it is best of a Hemisphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Figure, the light casting itself through the body of
the Oyl as well as of the Glass. This is so plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and so commonly used and practised, that I need not
spend more time in the explanation or demonstration
thereof, but proceed to describe a Fifth way.</p>
            <p>The Fifth way then is much upon the same principle
with the Fourth, but avoids several inconveniences to
which that is subject: For whereas the Flame in the
Fourth is necessitated to be within the capacity or the
Receptacle in this Fifth, it may be at any distance, and
so is made much more convenient to be come at, and to
be dressed and trimmed. Take then a Vessel of Glass, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrical
is best, as a Glass Bottle, and fit to it a Siphon, long
enough to draw the Oyl from the bottom of the said Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
make the one end of this Siphon extend at what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
you think convenient for the placing the flame of
the Lamp, and so order it that it may always draw from
the Receptacle by its arms to feed the flame, which it
will do if the end of the Siphon be made where the
Socket of the Lamp is placed to return or bend upwards
again. So that the Plain of the upper Superficies of the
Oyl may cut that end of the Siphon where the flame is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98433:13"/>
between the top of the mouth of it next the Socket and
the return thereof upwards; then by a counterpoise so
suspend this Siphon that it may follow the Oyl as it wasts,
and fit into the return of the Siphon a Socket and Wick
for the flame to be continued. A contrivance somewhat
of this kind you have in divers Authors, and therefore I
shall spend less time in the description thereof. Let
AAAA in the Sixth Figure then represent a large Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical
Viol of Glass through the mouth B of which the
Cavity thereof may be filled with Oyl, and also the end D
and float C of a convenient Siphon may be put in. This
Siphon DDDPG must be made long enough that the
float C may reach the bottom of the Vessel when the
Oyl is spent, and the other end thereof must be so curved
that the knee of the Siphon P may be below the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
of the Oyl EF, and yet that the Socket H made for
holding the Wick for the flame I may be somewhat above
it, this Siphon DDDPG with its Socket and float
should be so counterpoised with a weight M, hung over
a Pulley K, by a string L, that the float may not sink deep
into the Surface of the Liquor, but swim as it were at
the top. This done, if the Wick I be lighted, the Surface
of the Oyl will be kept always at the same distance below
the flame that it was first put at.</p>
            <p>In the first, third, fourth, and fifth ways the flame of
the Lamp descends equal spaces with the Superficies of
the Oyl in the Vessel, and therefore though for some uses
it be very convenient, as in annealings, where things are
to be cooled by degrees, yet for many other it is not;
Especially in Lamp Furnaces, where the same heat is to be
continued, and in some cases gradually increased. For
such cases therefore the first and second ways will be
very convenient. In some other cases the sixth and seventh
ways, which do much the same thing.</p>
            <p>The sixth way then is this: Through an arm or Siphon
(like the Branch of a Lamp hung against a Wall) fixed
in any convenient place, the Oyl from the Receptacle is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98433:13"/>
continually and equally supplied to the flame of the
Lamp by the raising of the Receptacle as fast as the Oyl
wasts, so as to keep the Superficies of the Oyl alway in
the same Horizontal Plain. The Receptacle is raised by a
Counterpoise hung upon a Fusey, which Fusey is a part
of an Archimedean Spiral.</p>
            <p>Let CC then in the seventh Figure represent the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
for the Oyl, being a Cylindrical or Prismatical
Vessel, of what Bigness or Length you please; to this
by two Ears at LL fasten two Lines or Ropes KK, the
ends of both which are fastned to the Wheel or Pulley G,
though one of them do run over the Pulley F. Fit into
this Receptacle is made a Cylindrical or Prismatical
Plug AA, which is fixed in some convenient place, so as
not to rise or sink, and through the middle thereof pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
a Siphon BBB, the one end whereof extended like
the branch of a Candle or Lamp sustains the Socket D
for the Flame E, which is fed with Oyl through the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon
BBB by the rising Receptacle CC.</p>
            <p>To the side of the Pulley G is fastned a Fusey H,
made with very great care of one Revolution of an
Archimedean Spiral, not beginning from the Center, but
from some convenient distance from it, where the
weight I hanging, may just counterpoise the Receptacle
CC, when quite empty of Oyl, the other hanging coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
(Tangent to the largest part of this Spiral) must
be so far distant from the Center of the Wheel G, that
the same weight I may just counterpoise the said Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
filled top-full of Oyl, and the Fusey must be
filed true to a Spiral, drawn with great care of one
Revolution between those two points. I say here of
one Revolution, because I have supposed the Wheel
or Pulley G big enough, by one Revolution of it to
draw up the Receptacle the whole space it is to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
for if the said Pulley be so small as to require two,
three, four, or more Revolutions, then must the piece
of the Spiral between those points be drawn of two,
three, four, or more Revolutions proportionably, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98433:14"/>
being very Artificially and Mechanically performed, the
Receptacle CC will be raised by the same Degrees by
which the Oyl is consumed at E, and the upper Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
thereof shall always be in the same Horizontal
Line MM. The Geometrical and Mechanical Reason
of which being so very plain, I hope I shall not need to
spend any more time in the explication thereof than only
to say, that by means of the Archimedean Spiral-Fusey
the Power of the weight I upon the Pulley G decreaseth
in the same proportion as the weight of the Oyl in the
Receptacle CC is diminished by its consumption.</p>
            <p>The seventh way then is, by a Cylindrical or Prisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Plug fitted into a Cylindrical or Prismatical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle,
and let down into it by a Counterpoise, hung
upon a Spiral Fusey, the Oyl is so raised in that Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
as always to stand Brimfull, or to the same Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
height till the whole Oyl be consumed.</p>
            <p>The contrivance of this way will be very easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by any one that shall peruse the Delineation in the
eighth Figure, and examine it by this following descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
            <p>Let AA in the eighth Figure then represent a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical
or Prismatical Receptacle, standing fixt upon a
Table or Pedestal, from the side of which issues a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Arm or Branch BB, bearing the Socket for the
Wick C, where the flame D is continued. Into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of this Receptacle is fitted a Cylindrical or Prisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Plug EE, big enough to fill the whole capacity
thereof, and yet not so close but that it may freely slip up
and down the Cavity of the said Receptacle without
sinking. Let this Plug be made considerably heavier than
the Oyl of the Receptacle; that is, let the Counterpoise
L, hanging upon the little Wheel M just reduce its gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
to be equal to that of the Oyl; then let the point I,
where the Perpendicular toucheth the Spiral, be so far
removed from the Center of the Wheel H, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98433:14"/>
L may just take off its whole gravity, and suffer
it to have no degree of gravity or pressure downwards.
Then draw the Spiral nop according to the direction I
gave in the former way, and the effect will be produced.
The Geometrical and Mechanical Demonstration of
which is very plain to any one that shall consider, that, As
the Plug EE by sinking into the Receptacle AA so far
as to raise the Oyl to the Horizontal Superficies MM
will lose its gravity by the same Degrees by which it
sinketh into the Receptacle, and that is alway propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to the diminishing of the Oyl in the Receptacle
by the flame: So the weight L will lose its power upon
the Wheel H, by the same degrees by which the Plug de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth,
by reason the Line by which it is suspended
becomes a Tangent to a proportionately shorter Radius
of the Spiral, of the Rays of the Spiral.</p>
            <p>I know indeed that both in this and the former Fusey
there lies an objection against the true form of the Spiral,
because the Line KK of the weight L doth not touch the
Spiral in a point level with the Center, but in one some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
above it, and in this latter somewhat beneath it;
but though that be a seeming material one, yet as to
practice it signifies very little. For first, it will not be
difficult to prove that this may be Mechanically drawn
true enough, that there shall be no sensible error, and if the
error be not sensible, it is no error in practical Mechanicks.
Next, were it the true Spiral, yet it would not be more
Geometrically Delineated than this which is here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and at best it would prove but a Mechanical ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
which is sufficient for the effect to be produced
by it.</p>
            <p>These two last contrivances do keep the flame of the
Lamp always in the same place, and of the same strength
and fulness. But the succeeding ways, though they
maintain the flame in the same degree of strength and
nourishment, yet by their motion upwards they may be
made to increase, and intend the heat produced by them
in the bodies posited above them, which is of great
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98433:15"/>
use in many Chymical and Philosophical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The eighth way then is this: Make a Cylindrical or
Prismatical Receptacle for the Oyl exactly like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
with its Arm, Socket, Wick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and fit into it a
Cylindrical or Prismatical Plug, as in the former, that
may be able to fill the said Receptacle. Fix this Plug fast
into some Wall or Standard, so that it shall not be able to
stir; Then by the help of two Lines fastned to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
at one end, and the other to the Ears of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle,
so counterpoise the said Receptacle that it shall
have no weight or gravity downwards, but hang in a
perfect equilibrium; I say, whatever quantity of Oyl
there be in the said Vessel, the Superficies thereof shall
always be in the Plain which is equal to the top of the
Oyl when the Vessel is filled as high as is desired, which
will very plainly appear to any one that shall examine
and consider well this following description, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it with the Delineation of the Instrument in the
ninth Figure, where AA represents a Receptacle for the
Oyl of any convenient capacity, made Cylindrical or
Prismatical, to which is fastned a hollow Neck or Arm
BB for bearing the Socket C, to which through its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
(being made hollow) is conveyed the Oyl or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum</hi>
for the continuance of the Flame D; into this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
fit a Cylindrical or Prismatical Plug, so as it may
pretty equally fill the said Cavity of the Receptacle,
yet not so as any ways to hinder the sliding on upon it of
the Receptacle. Let this Plug then be fixt by the top in
any convenient place Perpendicularly, and setting the
Receptacle underneath it, Counterpoise the same when
filled up with Oyl by a Counterpoise I, which is fastned
to the two strings FFFF, by which the Receptacle is
to hang, which two strings for their more easie sliding to
and fro move upon the two Pulleys or Truckles GG,
that are fixed to the same frame to which the Plug EE
is fixed; which being so adjusted, as fast as the flame D
consumeth the Oyl out of the Receptacle AA, the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98433:15"/>
Counterpoise I raiseth the said Receptacle on upon the
Plug so far till the top of the Oyl be equal to the height
it was at first counterpoised at, to which height it always
keeps it till the whole be consumed.</p>
            <p>This last way of poising the Liquor or Oyl doth make
the Superficies thereof run higher and higher as the
quantity thereof is more and more consumed, which
for divers Expedients in Mechanicks, Natural Philosophy,
and Chymistry is of excellent use, as I may hereafter
have opportunity to manifest upon many occasions
where I shall make use of them; and it would be, I fear, too
tedious to the Reader to have them here enumerated.</p>
            <p>But because it may not possibly be ungrateful to him
to have some uses of this Principle here hinted, I shall
now specifie a few, and hereafter add many more, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a great number of other Poises for Liquors
which serve for very differing effects in their kinds,
not less considerable, but rather somewhat more strange,
as being yet farther removed from the common practices
and discourses of Hydraulicks.</p>
            <p>The first use then that I shall mention of this Liquor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise
shall be in Hydraulicks, <hi>viz.</hi> to make a Cistern of
whatever bigness and depth is required to deliver all
its water at the top, or so near unto it as it shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired:
By which means nothing of the Descent of the
water falling into the Cistern is lost, but without any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
or trouble the whole quantity of water that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
at the top into the Cistern is re-delivered again
out of the Cistern at the top. This may be done by the
first, second, and seventh ways of poising Liquors; this,
that, or the other, of which may be more convenient
to this, that, or another effect or operation to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by it, which must be chosen and applied with
judgment, according to the occasion, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of it. Every of the three, though they all agree
together in the producing the effect of keeping the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98433:16"/>
of the water to the same Level, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
it, have yet each of them their several proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which maketh some one of the three more proper
and adapted to one design than either of the other two,
and each of the other two in some other effects and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
may be much more usefully applied than the
first. By this means the whole depth of the Cistern is
gained, and all that water that was used to be delivered
at the bottom is now delivered at the top, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
gains the advantage of the Perpendicular height
of the Cistern to be imployed, for any use, for turning an
Automaton, or conveying the Stream farther, or to a
higher level.</p>
            <p>A second effect performable by these Poises may be
for delivering any quantity of water with an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of swiftness, so as to continue an equal supply of
water till the whole Cistern or Receptacle be emptied,
the spending of the water in the Cistern not at all
abating the stream without, the Counterpoise always
keeping the Cistern full, and maintaining the current till
the last. This may be useful for sawing or grinding
stones by an Engine; for gauging of Glass Tools, or
grinding glasses by an Automaton, in all which cases
there is need of a constant and equal supply of water
and sand; as also for washing and Fulling of Cloth; it
may also serve for various sorts of Clepsydras, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
the quantity of time by the quantity of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of water, as I shall by and by shew. And thirdly,
for maintaining any slow and constant motion, as that
of a Jack, or Clock; an Engine for continually stirring
of a liquid body, or shaking, tumbling, and turning of
dry Solids and powders, of which sort there are a
great number of uses in Chymistry for the operations of
Digestion, Calcination, Pounding, Grinding, Trituration,
Searcing, and the like; which operations being certainly,
evenly, and constantly performed by an Engine supplied
by such a stream of water will far exceed the same kind
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98433:16"/>
of work done by the hands of men, especially in such
operations where the Labour and Diligence is to last
divers days and nights together without any intermission,
which are Requisites not at all strange to Chymistry, and
which will weary the diligence of the best Laborant and
his Attendants.</p>
            <p>A third effect performable by these Poises is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a perpetual and constant stream in imitation of that
of a natural Spring or Fountain in the Earth. This may
be done if the Cistern be once in twenty four hours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruted
and supplied with a new access of water from
some Pipes, which is usual enough here in <hi>London,</hi> and
elsewhere, where there are Waterworks and Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of water. For as the wasting of the water in the
Cistern does no ways abate or diminish the stream of the
water from the Cistern, so the new access of other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for a supply to refill the Cistern does not at all accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it, but the stream remains equal; And hence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
constant, and, as it were, perpetual.</p>
            <p>A fourth effect is, the delivering any quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to any degree of swiftness, and the whole quantity
of the water by the same degree. This is performed by
tapping the Cistern at any part of the depth thereof, for
according as the Vessel is tapp'd lower under the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
so will the motion of the water be swifter; and
here the depths must be in a duplicate proportion to the
Velocity desired: As for instance, the Cistern being tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with a hole of a quarter of an Inch bore, at the
depth of an Inch below the Surface, is found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
a certain quantity of water in a minute; if it be
desired that through a Tap of the same bore there should
be delivered twice that quantity, the Cistern must be
tapp'd at four Inches deep; and if thrice that quantity in
the same time, it must be tapp'd at nine Inches deep; and
so forwards, as is already demonstrated by <hi>Mersennus,</hi>
and other Authors. For since the pressure of Fluids
upon the parts thereof increase, in the same proportion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98433:17"/>
with the depth below the Surface. And since the forces
requisite to accelerate motions must always be in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
proportion to the Acclerations, it follows, that
the perpendicular depths of the Tap under the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
of the water must be always in duplicate proportion
to the Velocities required.</p>
            <p>The plainness and certainty of this truth in Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staticks,
long since so fully and excellently demonstrated
by <hi>Stivinus</hi> of all Fluids, and so highly improved of
late in the particular applications thereof by many more
modern Authors, who have writ most learnedly and
clearly thereof, as well as experimentally and practically,
makes me much admire at the learned Doctor <hi>More,</hi>
who in his <hi>Enchiridion Metaphysicum,</hi> in the 11, 12, and
13 Chapters, and in a Book, newly published, called,
<hi>Remarks upon two late ingenious discourses,</hi> &amp;c. does not
only deny this Gravitation in the parts of Air, but of
Water, quicksilver, and other Liquors. And instead
thereof, to solve the Phenomena, would introduce into
the World a Principle, which he terms an <hi>Hylarchick
Spirit,</hi> which at command acts and performs whatsoever is
necessary to solve all the Phenomena of Mechanical, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drostatical,
and, in a word, all Physical motions and effects.</p>
            <p>In answer to whose Doctrine about Hydrostaticks I
shall only urge this one Experiment of the Velocity of
the current of Fluids, tapp'd and running at several
depths under the Superficies of that Fluid; which can no
ways be solved by the Hylarchick Spirit, and we must be
fain to come to the Mechanical and plain Rules of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to allow every particular of that Fluid to press
with its own gravity where ever placed. And this I will
prove from his own words in his <hi>Enchiridion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicum,</hi>
pag. 113. where explaining very ingeniously the
Hypothesis of Gravitation of the parts of Fluids one
upon another by the similitude of six men standing in a
Line, and pressing against a Wall, (which men he marks
with ABCDEF, and the Wall with G) He says, that
A the first man cannot press F the last against the Wall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98433:17"/>
G, but by pressing B against C, and C against D, and D
against E, and E against F; nor can A press B against C,
nor C press D against E, nor E press F against the Wall
G, but at the same time it must be understood that B
presses D towards F, and D presses F towards the
Wall G, for AC and E, says he, are here put for <hi>Des Cartes
Materia Coelestis,</hi> pressing the parts of the water within
the pores, and BD and F for those parts of the water
pressing the bottom of the Vessel. But, says he, that B
presses D, and D presses F appears from this, that casting
out E and F, D doth run to the Wall G, and casting out
CDE and F, B also will run to the said Wall. And so,
says he, the state of the matter would be if Gravity did
proceed from the meer Mechanical motion imparted to
the Terrestrial parts of the Fluid by the <hi>Materia Coelestis</hi>
of <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> to wit, the Elements would actually gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
in their proper places. But since there is no such
thing, it is a sure sign that Gravity doth arise from a
higher cause, which higher cause he elsewhere supposes
to be an Hylarchick Spirit. This from so plain reasoning
is a strange Conclusion, and contrary to all experience.</p>
            <p>Now though, I confess, I suppose Gravity to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
performed than as <hi>Des Cartes</hi> has supposed, yet do
I believe his Suppositions so Rational and Ingenious, and
so much above the Objections brought against them, and
so much better than any other I have yet met with, as no
wise to deserve to be esteemed <hi>feda deliria,</hi> as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Doctor is pleased to term them, <hi>pag.</hi> 125.</p>
            <p>It shall not be my business to defend <hi>Des Cartes</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
at the present, nor to set up any new Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
instead thereof, but only to urge this Experiment of
the running of a Liquor swifter and swifter, according
as the hole through which it runs is deeper and deeper
placed below the Surface of the said Liquor or Fluid,
and that the Velocities of those streams are always in a
subduple proportion to the Altitude of the Fluid above
those holes; whence it is evident, that the force that
makes that Fluid run is always in the same proportion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98433:18"/>
with the Altitude of the fluid parts above those holes;
and consequently, that the motion of them is exactly
according to the plain and obvious Rules of Mechanical
motions. And consequently for the solving all the Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
of Hydrostaticks there is no need of any other
Principles than the plain Mechanical Principles, which
supposeth every Terrestrial Body to have a Gravity in it,
which is always the same, and always communicates its
Gravity to the Terrestrial Bodies subjected under it,
and not only its own, but the Gravity of all other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
above it, which have communicated their Gravity
to it, and that this Gravitation is always the same, and
acteth continually by continual repetitions indefinitely
swift. And that this gravitating or communicating of
its weight, together with the weight of all other Bodies
communicated to it, is no ways differing from all other
communications or propagations of motion, which the
Doctor must confess to be meerly Mechanical, if at least
he will admit of any such thing as Mechanical motion.
For I cannot conceive any Reason why the Doctor
should not allow for instance the parts of a Cylinder of
Lead to press upon one another as much when they are
kept melted in an Iron Cylinder into a Cylindrical form
part over part as when the Lead is cold and divided
into several parts, and laid one over another in the
same form that they were kept in by the incompassing
Iron Cylinder. Since if the Iron Cylinder and melted
Lead, and the Iron Cylinder and cold Lead be weighed,
it will be found that they have both the same weight
or gravity downwards, and do communicate continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the same force, pressure, indeavour, impetus, strength,
gravity, power, motion, or whatever else you will
call it to the Scale. And I suppose the Doctor will grant,
that if the cold Cylinder of Lead, weighing ten pounds,
be divided into ten shorter Cylinders, that are each a
tenth part of the whole, and do each weigh a pound
alone, every one of the upper shall gravitate upon every
one of the lower; and that the tenth, with the other nine
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98433:18"/>
upon it, shall press the Scale with ten pound weight,
and consequently, that the tenth doth not only commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
its own gravity of one pound, but the gravity of
all the other nine above it, which is nine pounds; and,
if the tenth be taken away, and the ninth be put to
touch the Scale, with the other eight upon it, it is certain
that the ninth will not only communicate its motion, or
press the Scale with its own weight of a pound, but will
communicate the motion to, or press the Scale with the
weight of eight pounds more, or of all the eight Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linders
superincumbent, and the like Ratiocination may
be upon the eighth, seventh, sixth, fifth, fourth, and
second, but the last will only press the Scale with its own
weight, unless we take in the consideration of the weight
of the Air, which in this Ratiocination is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
Since then I think it cannot be denied but that the
whole ten standing in a Cylinder one over another, the
tenth is pressed by nine, and presses with ten pound
weight; the ninth presses with nine, and is pressed with
eight; the eighth is pressed with seven, and presses with
eight, and so onwards, and that the pressure of the
lowest downward is always proportionable to the height
of this Cylinder. Supposing these to be all melted in an
Iron Cylinder, but kept in the same position and situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and finding the whole to keep the same weight,
why should we not believe that each of those parts will
exert the same effects, as to gravity, on those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
it as the same parts cold, and in the same posture
did; since if the Cylinder of the Fluid be shortned by
1, 2, 3, or 4, tenths of its height, the same abatement of
weight or gravity will appear. Having seriously perused
all the Ratiocination that the Doctor hath produced,
both in this late Book, and in his <hi>Enchiridion Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
I cannot find any convincing reason against it, but
what seems grounded upon some pre-conceived Notions
and Hypotheses which I cannot understand; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see how he can avoid acknowledging this to be a
Mechanical motion, if at least he will allow any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98433:19"/>
motion at all, since it doth so perfectly, and in
all circumstances so exactly conform and agree with the
Laws of Mechanical motion, that I do not know any
difference, nor any one Phenomenon of Hydrostaticks or
Gravity but what may be clearly solved by the common
Rules of Mechanicks.</p>
            <p>But to pass by all other Mediums to prove this Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
or pressure of the parts of Fluids one upon
another, I shall only insist upon this one Experiment of
the Velocity of Fluids, vented or running at several
depths below the Superficies of that Fluid. In which it
is observable, that the quantity of water running with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a certain space of time is always in a Subduple propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the height of the pressing Fluid above the hole.
That is, the quantities of water are in proportion to
one another as the square Roots of the several Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.
As for instance, it is the observation of <hi>Mersennus</hi>
in his Hydraulicks, that a Tap of an Inch bore, four
foot under the Superficies of the water will yield a
pound or pint of water in 13 Seconds of time; now, if
it be desired to make the water run through a Tap of the
same bore twice as fast, that is, to yeild a quart or two
pounds of water. This new Altitude must be made to
the former Altitude, as the square of two to the square
of one, that is, as four to one; whence it will follow, that
the Altitude of the water above the Tap must be made
sixteen foot to make the Tap run a quart of water in 13
Seconds of time. And if it be desired to have the Tap run a
Gallon or eight pints in 13 Seconds, the proportion of
the new Altitude to the first must be as the square of
eight to the square of one, that is, as 64 to 1, whence
the Altitude of the water must be 256 foot, and the like
for any other quantity or Velocity desired. As if it be
desired that the Tap should only run half a pint in 13
Seconds, the Tap must be placed at one foot under the
Superficies, which is a quarter of the former Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
Now this is exactly according to the General
Rule of Mechanicks. Which is, that the proportion of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98433:19"/>
the strength or power of moving any Body is always
in a duplicate proportion of the Velocity it receives
from it; that is, if any Body whatsoever be moved
with one degree of Velocity, by a determinate quantity
of strength, that body will require four times that
strength to be moved twice as fast, and nine times the
strength to be moved thrice as fast, and sixteen times the
strength to be moved four times as fast, and so forwards.
This is most certainly true in the motion of Bullets shot
out of Cannons, Muskets, Pistols, Wind-guns, Cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows,
Spitting-Trunks, and the like; as likewise in the
motion of Arrows shot with Bows or Ballistae; of Stones
thrown by the hand, or with Slings; of Pendulums mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Gravity or Weights; of Musical Strings; of
Springs, and all other vibrating Bodies; of the motion
of Wheels, Flies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> drawn and turned by Weights
or Springs; of the motion of Perpendicularly or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
falling Bodies; and in a word, of all other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
and Local motions, allowance only being made
for the impediment of the Air or other Fluid Medium,
through which the Body is moved. Now if the
Doctor will contend for an Hylarchick Spirit to perform
all these, he may plausibly enough contend for it also in
the Experiment of the Gravitation of the parts of Fluids
one upon another.</p>
            <p>We see then how needless it is to have recourse to an
Hylarchick Spirit to perform all those things which are
plainly and clearly performed by the common and known
Rules of Mechanicks, which are easily to be understood
and imagined, and are most obvious and clear to sense,
and do not perplex our minds with unintelligible Idea's
of things, which do no ways tend to knowledge and
practice, but end in amazement and confusion.</p>
            <p>For supposing the Doctor had proved there were such
an Hylarchick Spirit, what were we the better or the
wiser unless we also know how to rule and govern this
Spirit? And that we could, like Conjurers, command this
Spirit, and set it at work upon whatever we had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98433:20"/>
for it to do. If it were a Spirit that Regulated the
motion of the water in its running faster or slower, I am
yet to learn by what Charm or Incantation I should be
able to incite the Spirit to be less or more active, in such
proportion as I had occasion for, and desired; how should
I signifie to it that I had occasion for a current of water
that should run eight Gallons in a minute through a hole
of an Inch bore? If the Doctor should tell me, that I must
make the Tap at such a depth under the Superficies of
the water, and then the Hylarchick Spirit will make the
water run as I desire, I would then inquire how he
comes to call that an Hylarchick, or matter-governing
Spirit, which is rather commanded by matter, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to its Laws, and is necessitated to act exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the quantity and position of matter, by what
means soever it be so placed? This Principle therefore
at best tends to nothing but the discouraging Industry
from searching into, and finding out the true causes of
the Phenomena of Nature: And incourages Ignorance
and Superstition by perswading nothing more can be
known, and that the Spirit will do what it pleases. For
if all things be done by an Hylarchick Spirit, that is, I
know not what, and to be found I know not when or
where, and acts all things I know not how, what should
should I trouble my self to enquire into that which is
never to be understood, and is beyond the reach of my
Faculties to comprehend? Whereas on the other side,
if I understand or am informed, that these Phenomena
do proceed from the quantity of matter and motion, and
that the regulating and ordering of them is clearly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the power and reach of mans Industry and Invention;
I have incouragement to be stirring and active in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
and scrutiny, as where I have to do with matter
and motion that fall under the reach of my senses, and
have no need of such Rarified Notions as do exceed
Imagination and the plain deductions of Reasons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
            <p>For what is clearer to be seen and tried by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98433:20"/>
and what more easie to be imagined and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
than that a Cylinder of water, or any other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous
substance of twice the height should have
twice the gravity or pressure: of thrice the height, thrice
the pressure: of ten times the height, ten times the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
of 100 times the height, 100 times the pressure,
and consequently, to imagine that as in all other Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
motion, four times the pressure will double the Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
nine times the pressure will treble it, sixteen times
will quadruple it, and 100 times will decuple it, and so
forward; So in this Experiment the same pressure will
perform the same effect, and a proportionate pressure a
proportionate effect. And since we find that the effect
does most exactly answer the Theory (as most certainly,
evidently, and undeniably it doth) why should we
doubt of the cause which is so certain and Regular a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant,
that it is always present when the effect is
performed? And where ever it is present, (if other
Circumstances hinder not) the effect certainly follows.
I could have gone over all the other Ratiocinations of
the Doctor for an Hylarchick Spirit to perform the
effects which do clearly belong to Mechanical motions
and powers, and are performed and regulated exactly
according to the quantity and quality of matter, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the general and universal Laws of motion;
and not otherwise. But that is not my present business,
but rather to explain how this contrivance of Poises
doth serve to make a Cistern or Vessel to run any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water required in any space of time. And that to
run the whole quantity either with an equal Velocity or
stream, or by any desired degrees to be accelerated or
retarded from the beginning to the end, which for some
occasions in Mechanicks is of great use, and hath not
been explained by any Writer of Hydraulicks hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.</p>
            <p>I should have here left this Digression, but that I find
a little further in the aforesaid Doctors <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> to
wit, in the nineteenth Chapter, in the fifth, sixth, seventh,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98433:21"/>
and eighth Sections, continued from the 246. to the 256.
Page, some Animadversions upon an Explication of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
which I did formerly publish in my <hi>Micrographia,</hi>
from the confutation of which he endeavours to assert
this <hi>Hylarchick Spirit.</hi> But in this he doth <hi>Canere trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phum
ante victoriam,</hi> and seems to make very slight of that
which he neither hath hitherto by all he hath said in his
<hi>Enchiridion Metaphysicum,</hi> nor can by all other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he can produce answer. For if the Doctor had
pleased to have considered the Objections I made against
the Hypothesis of the Rotation of the <hi>Cartesian Globuli,</hi>
with a little more seriousness and deliberation, he would
not, I conceive, have believed that one that understood
the Objection would be satisfied with so slight and insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
answers, as he is pleased to make to them. His
Answer then to the first Objection which I brought
against this Hypothesis, which was raised from Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
made with thin plated bodies, producing colours,
though the refracting Superficies were parallel, is no
more but this: That it is not every second Refraction of
the Ray in a Parallelipiped that doth destroy the Rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
generated by the first, but only that which entring
at one side, passeth through, and goeth out again with
the same refraction it entered. In which case only, says
he, the Rotation of the <hi>Globuli,</hi> generated in the first
Superficies, is destroyed in the second. But, says he, a
Ray falling upon a Parallelipiped, and being reflected
from the second Superficies, suffers a double Refraction
in the same Superficies, the one at entring, and the other
at going out again; both which Refractions, says he, do
promote the Rotation of the <hi>Globuli</hi> the same way.
This he says very positively; but gives no reason for it.
Nor indeed could he, since it is expresly contrary to
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> Principles, and to all the Phenomena of such
Parallel sided bodies until they come to a certain degree
of thinness: For if his Affirmation were true, then must
all Reflections from the Quicksilver, or foil of Looking-glasses,
especially if a little oblique, make the Object
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98433:21"/>
spread, and become coloured in the same manner as Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
do which are look'd at through Prismes. But this
is contrary both to Experience, and the Laws of Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for the Refractions in the Parallelipiped B are the
very same with the Refractions in the Parallelipiped A,
the Reflection at D making the Ray to be refracted at F,
in the same manner as if it were refracted at G by GH,
and the Parallelipiped were twice as thick, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the colour generated in E must be destroyed in
F, and consequently produce no colours, as really it doth
not in plates beyond such a thickness; whereas if the
Refraction at F did promote the Rotation, as he affirms,
then must the reflected Superficies IK not be Parallel to
EF, but inclined to it with an Angle at LM. Then GN
would represent FO, which is impossible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Laws of all reflection, as he might have
understood if he had considered my Demonstration
about the Reflections of a Globe. Nor will the Doctors
adding, <hi>Sed de hac prima objectione non est quod sumus adeo
soliciti, cum sit in materia magis incerta ac inequali cujus
interna contextura videatur Globulorum motus variis modis
posse mutari.</hi> For since all transparent bodies whatsoever
produce the same effect, that Subterfuge of supposing
some strange invisible texture in the body of <hi>Muscovy</hi>
Glass, differing from that of other transparent bodies,
will prove but a lame help, for this <hi>interna contextura</hi>
must be common to all transparent Bodies. And why it
should do it at one time, and not at another, the Doctor
doth no where shew, nor seems to understand.</p>
            <p>Next, whereas in the seventh Section of the said nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapter he says, <hi>Verum in materia illa idonea
Gutta scilicet Pluvia, si nullus Demonstratio is Scopo subsit
error, actum est de Globulis Cartesianis. Sed videtur</hi> (says
he) <hi>ingeniosus demonstrator non satis intellexisse scopum
quo collinneare debeat ipsius Demonstratio.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that I perceive by the Learned Doctors endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to refute it, that he neither understood that,
nor the Laws of Reflection and Refraction according
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98433:22"/>
to <hi>Des Cartes</hi> Hypothesis. <hi>Neque enim satis erat probare
(quod agnosco eum fecisse scite &amp; eleganter) Refractiones in
gutta pluvia ita fieri, ut si in duobus pellucidi Parallelipipedi
Lateribus oppositis, factae essent, sed oportebat praeterea evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisse
quod eodem modo refringatur radius in utrisque Locis
quo in Parallelipipedo</hi> A <hi>refringitur, hoc est ut Radius</hi> BC
<hi>quamvis oblique, perpetuo tamen currat versus eandem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitatem
tam in</hi> F <hi>quam in</hi> D <hi>Parallepipedi</hi> A <hi>puta versus
extremitatem</hi> E, <hi>nam in hoc casu Rotatio ad</hi> D <hi>dissolvitur
iterum ad</hi> F <hi>ut supra dictum est; sed Demonstratio Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niosi
Micrographi huc non attingit; sed probat secundam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractionem
in opposito Latere fieri ad modum refractionis in
Parallelipipedo</hi> C <hi>ubi Radius</hi> BN <hi>primo refringitur in</hi> D
<hi>&amp; procurrens versus extremitatem</hi> E <hi>ibique inflexus pergit
postea versus alteram extremitatem</hi> G <hi>&amp; Refringitur in</hi> F,
<hi>quae refractio non diluit Rotationem prioris refractionis in</hi> D,
<hi>quippe quod tendentia Radii sit in partem oppositam.</hi> If
the Learned Doctor had better consulted <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
Doctrine, or the common Laws of Reflection and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction,
he would have been of quite another mind, and
would not so positively have asserted a Proposition so
positively contrary to the Principles of <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> and
all Experiments. For if what he affirms were so, then
(as I urged before) according to <hi>Des Cartes</hi> Doctrine,
and the Doctrine he would defend, the Image from a
Looking-glass must be returned coloured, and the same
also from a plain sided Prisme, where the refracting sides
are Perpendicular or equally inclined, but contrary ways
to the Reflecting Superficies. But this is contrary to
Experiment, he must therefore once again consider how
to find out a Reason why there is no colour generated,
where, according to his Assertion, there is so great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction,
and a doubly promoted Rotation made in both
the refracting Superficies the same way, and both so
much promoting the said Rotation of the Globuli. He
might therefore, if he had pleased, have suspended his
Conclusion. <hi>Adeo ut Doctrina Cartesiana de Globulis eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque
Rotationibus nihil periclitetur ab hac Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98433:22"/>
quae quamvis satis elegans sit &amp; concinna, debitum ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
scopum non omnino attingit,</hi> until he had a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
considered the nature of Reflection and Refraction.
Now, because I find that the Learned Doctor is not the
only person that hath not rightly apprehended this
Theory, give me leave to explain a little more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the manner thereof: Suppose we then in the three
Figures DE and F, that the space between the two
Parallel Lines ac and bd doth represent a Ray or Radia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of light; Not a Mathematical Line, but a Physical
one of some Latitude, between which Lines is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
a motion, or something equivalent thereunto,
which serves to produce the effect of light. This motion
we suppose to be propagated by a Pulse or Wave in all
uncoloured Rays at Right Angles with the Line of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
but in coloured Rays more or less obliquely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the greater or less refraction. We will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the stroke of the Pulse to be the length of the space
between 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3, and 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
in a uniform medium the pulse will continue
the same, and the expansion of it will be Perpendicular
to the Line of Direction or progress; but when it comes
to the Refracting Superficies cd, Obliquely the side of
the Pulse c touches the refracting Superficies first, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
propagated into the refracting medium by a longer
and quicker Pulse, it is propagated to 4 below c before
the other side of the Pulse touches the Superficies at d,
the Pulse therefore 44, 55, 66, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becomes Oblique
to the tendency of the Radiation; and by the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
ef it is reflected by 77, 77, 77, till it touches the
second refracting Superficies gh; where it is observable,
that the same side of the Ray that entred first the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
cd enters first into the Superficies gh, in the same
manner as if it had proceeded on by the straight Lines fm
el till it met with a Parallel Superficies lm to the first
cd; for the Ray between the two Parallel Lines fh, eg,
hath the same inclination and respect to the Refracting
Superficies hg, that the Ray between fm and el would
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98433:23"/>
have to the Superficies ml, supposing there were no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
Superficies at ef. I shall not need, I hope, more
particularly to demonstrate every part of this Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the very observing the Delineation of the Scheme
being enough to make it plain to any one never so little
versed in Geometry, from which he will plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that what I endeavour to demonstrate was really
so, and that I did understand what scope my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
aimed at, so far as to hit the Mark, which
was to shew that Colours were generated, where, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Des Cartes</hi> own Principles, there could be no
Rotation of the Globuli. Now, though the Learned
Doctor would not admit of this Demonstration to be
sufficient to do the work, yet he says, <hi>Pag. 252. Verun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamen
dissimulandum non est, non pauca me meapte opera
excogitasse quibus pro persuasissimo habeo eorum motus &amp;
rotationes modis pure mechanicis semper fieri non posse.</hi> And
in prosecution of the destruction of this Rotation of the
Globuli, which he hath hitherto seemed to defend, he
adds four several Arguments, I shall not now stay to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
them. But whosoever will please to read what the
Learned Doctor hath <hi>suapte opera</hi> excogitated against the
<hi>Cartesian</hi> Hypothesis, and set down in the 252, 253, 254,
and 255. pages. And compare them with what I have
said in the forementioned place, to wit, at the latter end
of the 60. and the beginning of the 61. pages of my
Micrographia, may plainly find the Arguments brought
by the Doctor do very little, if at all, differ from those
I there published.</p>
            <p>I could heartily therefore have wished that the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Doctor had made use of some other Mediums to
prove the Existence of an Hylarchick Spirit, and not
have medled with Arguments drawn either from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks
or Opticks; for I doubt, that such as understand
those subjects well, will plainly see that there is no need
of any such Hylarchick Spirit; and if there be no need
of it, but that all the Phenomena may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, then it is probable that there is none there, for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98433:23"/>
               <hi>Natura nihil agit frustra.</hi> It had been much easier to have
proved the existence of it by Arguments drawn from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
we less perfectly understand, as from the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nutrition, vegetation, and propagating of Vegetables,
and animal substances; for there the manner of the progress
of Nature being infinitely more curious and abstruse, and
further removed beyond the reach of our senses and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
one may more boldly assert strange things
of this Hylarchick Spirit without fear of controul or
contradiction, and from whence possibly it may never lie
within the power of Reasoning to banish him.</p>
            <p>But to leave this Digression, and return to the use of
these water-poises.</p>
            <p>A fifth effect may be for washing and refining of
Earth, Clays, Powders, and the like; the clear water by
these contrivances being made to run over gently at the
top, and so leaving all the settlement from the water at
the bottom.</p>
            <p>By any one of these, with a receptacle Cistern added
to it, the stream of water from that Cistern may be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
or retarded by any degrees desirable. This doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
partly from the proportion of the Tap of the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
Cistern to the Tap of the counterpoised Cistern, and
partly from the shape and make of the Receptacle Cistern,
by the proportion and shape of which the stream of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
through the Tap of the Receptacle Cistern may be
modulated at pleasure, as any one, a little versed in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drostaticks,
will easily perceive and demonstrate.</p>
            <p>A sixth effect may be for governing the heat of Lamps
for Distillations, Digestions, Fermentations, Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Dissolutions, hatching the Eggs of Birds or Insects;
accelerating, and seasoning, or timing the growth of
Plants; nealing of Glasses and Metals by the gradual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of the heat, so as to make them fit for stronger
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98433:24"/>
degrees, or by the gradual recess to bring them out of the
greater degrees to make them tough and capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the cold of the Air.</p>
            <p>It would be too long to give instances of contrivances
for every of these operations but the skilful Mechanist,
Philosopher or Chymist will easily supply his own desires
by some one of these I have instanced in, or at least by a
composition of them. I shall therefore only add a descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of a Clepsydra or time-keeper or two, and so leave
this subject for the present.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A description of a new sort of Clepsydra.</head>
               <p>THis contrivance is nothing else than that Two of the
second sort of Vessels are so contrived as to run
into each other and to empty themselves and be filled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately,
and their bigness or capacity and the hole
through which the Liquor is vented are so proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
as to be emptying the space of an hour, which is
easie enough, and may be adjusted to what accurateness
is desired. Then the convex Superficies of the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical
poise is divided into sixty equal parts by straight
Lines drawn upon its Surface Parallel to the Axis, and to
each other; these lines by the sinking or turning of the
said poise denote the minutes, and if smaller Divisions
of time be desired, the spaces between them may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by other smaller Parallel Lines denoting the parts
of each minute to what niceness is desired. One of these
Cylindrical Receptacles may be fixt, and the other by an
easie <hi>apparatus</hi> may be made to rise a little when it is top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and fall a little when quite empty below the Level
of the other that is fixt: The Chanel between them,
through which the water is to run out of the one into the
other, may be a small pipe with a hole in it of a bigness
proportioned, as I said above, to let the Liquor run out
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98433:24"/>
of one into the other in the time desired, and its ends
may be fastned to the two Receptacles by a part of the
neck of a bladder or gut, so that it may be limber, and
may always have a Declivity into the Vessel that is to be
filled; the Declivity need not be above half an Inch.
The Liquor used in it may be Water, Oyl, or any other
Liquor that doth not easily evaporate: But the best of
all is Quicksilver, because it doth not with keeping eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
at all sensibly, which I have carefully observed
for these fifteen years last past. Nor doth it grow thick
or foul by the alteration of the Air, nor do I find it sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
alter by the heat and cold, at lest not comparable to
the great changes which other Liquors suffer by the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of those qualities. It is an excellent material for
measuring time in a standing Machine; and there may be
hundred of ways contrived to make it measure the space
thereof as accurately as a Pendulum; and I have many
times admired that <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> who was otherwise so
curious and exact in the contrivance and make of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
and Instruments, was yet so defective in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
of measuring time by Quicksilver, when there
were so many obvious and easie ways of doing it, as he
seems to complain in his works. I have made trial of
several with very good success, and found some of them
even beyond expectation certain, of which I may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
upon an other occasion add the descriptions, when
I publish the various ways of making exact Time-keepers
or Watches. In the mean time, being now speaking of
Time-keepers, for variety sake I shall mention.</p>

of a ballance, whose motion was regulated by weights,
flying further and further from the Center according as
the strength of the Spring of the Watch had more and
more force upon its Arbor. The Weights were regulated
from flying out further than they ought to do by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance

to the Center of the motion or fly, in the same proportion
as I then demonstrated Gravity to attract the weight of a

were so contrived as always to counterpoise each other.

often doubted, I confess, whether Moss, Mushroms, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other small Plants (which the Earth seems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98433:25"/>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) were the off-spring of a Seed or Grain;
and I have been apt to believe, that they were rather a
secondary production of Nature; being somewhat the
more inclined to that opinion, because having formerly
examined the small knots or Seed-cods of Moss with a
single Microscope, I could not perceive any thing in them
that I could imagine to be Seed, at least not so great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
as seemed necessary to maintain so numerous a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny,
as was every where to be found of it; that, which
then came out of them, seeming to be rather a pulp or
pith, than any thing like the Seeds in other similar Cods.
But being since somewhat more inquisitive, I did exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
several of the above-mentioned Knobs or Seed-ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and found that there were seeds in them, no less
wonderful for the greatness of number, than the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of bulk. Taking then some of the ripe and brown
or reddish one of them, and pressing them pretty hard,
I found, that there was a small dust went out of them,
which seemed to vanish into the Air. Pressing and squee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
others of these upon a black plate, and examining
the powder with a Microscope, I found it to be a great
heap of exceeding small Seeds, Globular, and pretty
transparent. It is the smallest, I confess, I have yet seen,
and, it may be that has hitherto been discovered. And,
unless that be a plant, which I discovered growing on
the blighted leaves of Roses, and that those small bodies
be seed vessels; or, unless those Knobs, I have discovered
on the top of mould, be the like; I cannot presently
imagine where there should be found a smaller. For, I
find, that there will need no less than thirty six hundred
of them to be laid one by another in a line, to make the
length of an Inch; and, to cover the Superficies of an
Inch-square, there will need no less than nine hundred
and threescore thousands, besides twelve millions, of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Seeds if laid quadrangularly, but if laid triangularly,
there will need no less than two hundred and fourscore
thousand, besides seventeen Millions of single grains.
And the number in a gain weight of them cannot be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98433:26"/>
less than one thousand three hundred eighty two Millions
and four hundred thousand single grains, about eighty
of these square Superficies of Seeds being laid one upon
another in the Trigonal order, making, as near as I can
guess, the thickness of a piece of fine Paper, a square
Inch of which weigheth a grain. And though this
may seem a most incredible narration; yet I would
desire such as are apt to be too censorious, to take the
pains togather a few of these Seed-vessels, and examine
them as I have done, and then speak what they find, and
believe no more than their own sense and reason will
inform them, and they may easily see, that what I have
asserted, will be rather short of than exceed the real num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
Now if this Shell of the Seed be thus small, how
much smaller must needs be the rudiment of the Plant
that lies enclosed within it? And how easily may such
Seeds be drawn up into the Air, and carried from place
and place, even to the tops of the highest Towers, or to
places most remote, and be sowed by the passing Air, or
falling drops of Rain, on the boughs or branches of
Trees, sides and tops of Walls, Houses, or Steeples?
And it is not in the Art of man to leave Earth exposed to
the common Air, and to exclude the entrance, or prevent
the sowing of these imperceptible Seeds; and therefore
it is not to be wondred at, that, if any earth, though
never so pure, be exposed to the Air and Rain, though
at the top of a Steeple, it will produce Moss.</p>
               <p>Further inquiry may possibly instruct us, that there
may be Seeds of Mushroms, Mould and other Vegetables
of as small, if not smaller, bulk, which may be disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and mingled with the Air, and carried to and fro
with it, till washed down by the falling drops of Dews
or Rains; which, if they chance to light on a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
soyl, do there Vegetate and spring up; but dye and
perish, if the ground, they light on, be not natural and
agreeable. But whether this conjecture hit right, further
observation must determine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:98433:26"/>
This discovery I made the year after the late Fire of
<hi>London,</hi> to wit, in the year 1667 there being then vast
quantities of it to be found every where dispersed among
the Ruines left by that Fire, which made me, I confess,
very much wonder at first how such vast quantities should
come to be then so suddenly rooted, and was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my more strict examination of it. This I presently
shewed to many of my Acquaintants, and the next
year 1668. upon the eleventh of <hi>June</hi> I brought an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it into the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> where I suppose it may
yet remain upon their Register; and it was not a little
surprising to all that saw it, when they considered how
exceedingly small each particular Seed was, and yet how
infinitely vast the number of them was produced by each
Plant. How prodigiously small the first beginning and
rudiment of that Plant must be that was produced by it;
now, though indeed the Plant it self be one of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest,
yet this Seed of it was much smaller in comparison
to the Plant than the Seeds of most other Plants compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with theirs. But about two years after this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from a very good friend of mine at <hi>Bristol,</hi> the
Ingenious and Inquisitive Mr. <hi>W. C.</hi> a Relation of some
later discoveries of his, which seemed much to outstrip
even this, whether the comparative magnitude of the
Plant, and of the Seeds, or the number of the Seeds, or
the curiosity of the Seed-boxes, or the strange way of
sowing and dispersing, or the place and manner of the
Seeds production be considered. As they were sent to
me by him in a Letter from <hi>Bristol,</hi> dated <date>
                     <hi>September</hi> 30.
1669.</date> take them in his own words and description.</p>
               <p>NOtwithstanding my many other Avocations, variety of
discoveries do almost every day inlarge my experience;
but more especially this last Week I was very happy in the
detecting of that which all the Philosophers and Physicians
of former Ages, have been ignorant of, as we may well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
from what remains we have of them. My Discovery in
short was this, that all the kinds or species of Ferns together
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98433:27"/>
with all the like Capillary Plants their Congeners are (though
generally denied to have any at all) more abundantly prolifical
in Seeds than any other Plant beside, especially the common
Female Ferns or Brakes, and those more elegantly formed
(I mean chiefly in the little Vesicles conteining the Seed) than
many others, among the hundreds I have observed. To make
it demonstrable to you, I have now sent you both the Plants
with the Seeds on them, and the Seeds of the same Plants
apart in Papers by themselves, which I took off from other
Plants of the same kind, having plentiful parcels of each
(excepting of what I have not sent you) this being the season
of perfecting their Seeds. I thought to have sent you draughts
of the Seed Vessels, as they appeared presently after gathering,
but could not. I presume some of the Vesicles or little boxes
may remain whole, so that by your Microscope you may see
their true figures and distinctions, some of them being more
flatted on each side the little ring or embossed girdle encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
them, others more swelling.</p>
               <p>Also those little rings or bands encompassing the boxes are
different, in some of the kinds broader and flatter, in others
rounder, and standing up higher, yet all agreeing in the
principal parts of their form. I purpose to draw the figures of
them all as they appear by the Microscope, together with their
Seeds, and to add descriptions of all circumstances conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and joyn them to the rest of my draughts of that kind.
Some particulars most considerable I now give you in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>following
account.</p>
               <p>1. The little boxes containing the Seeds are in most of
these Plants not half, and in some not above one third, or one
quarter as big as a very small grain of common white sand;
appearing like little bladders infolded with rings or bands,
shaped like certain little worms I have met with, which may be
referred to the Teredo's and Eruca's.</p>
               <p>2. As near as I could compute, some of these bladders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
about 100 Seeds, which were so exceeding small, as to
be wholly invisible to the naked eye, and indiscoverable without
a Microscope.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:98433:27"/>
3. The Leaves of both the Ferns, especially the common
Female Fern, (which is more abundantly stored with Seed
than any of the rest) and the other I now send you, being kept
close without bruising, and soon after gathering exposed to the
Sun, or dry Air, the bands of as many of them as are ripe,
will contract themselves and break, and fling their Seeds all
about, after the same manner as some other small Plants, such
as the <hi>Persicaria Siliquata,</hi> and some of the <hi>Cardaminas</hi> are
observed to do. This I have observed with a single convex
glass as well as with the Microscope, but with the latter only
I could discover the falling of the Seed. And a pretty quantity
of the Seed being rubbed or brushed off from the Leaves upon
a fine piece of Paper or Parchment, and sweeped together into
a heap, many of those boxes breaking together, and justling
one another would make the heap seem, as it were, full of Mites
or living Creatures, even to the bare eye; and if the place be
free from noise, and the Ear be close applied, the crackling of
them upon breaking may easily enough be heard, and upon
running over the Paper with a Microscope the Seeds will be
found dispersed, and thrown at a great distance.</p>
               <p>4. The figures of the Seed-vessels, as also of the Seeds of all
the Ferns and those their Congeners, called Capillary Plants,
are very near of the same shape and size, notwithstanding the
vast disproportion between them, as particular common Fern,
Wall Rue, Harts Tongue, and Osmond Royal, the first three
of which being very remarkable for their unlikeness to each
other, and the last chiefly for its excelling so many thousand
times in magnitude that of Wall Rue. Which observations may
seem to confirm the opinions of some learned Botanists that
the affinity of Plants are to be judged by the figures of their
Seeds.</p>
               <p>5. That Osmund Royal, which excelleth all the other Ferns
both in greatness, comliness, and vertues, and which hath
been accounted barren, with the rest hath Vessels and Seeds of
the same figure with the other, and very near of the same
size, the extreme smalness of which, even to invisibility, and
the greatness of the Plant, one root whereof, with all the
growth out of it, I have found weighing ten pounds and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98433:28"/>
is surpassingly more wonderful than that of Moss Seeds; of
which I have some kinds of them bearing Seeds, that a great
number of them, with their Roots, Stalks, Leaves, and Seeds,
do not weigh a Grain. Besides, I have found of the common
Female Fern some which have been from the Roots to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
top of the Leaf nine foot high, and within these three
days measured the common broad-leaved Male Fern six foot
and an half long; some of the Leaves of which are among
those I now send you.</p>
               <p>6. But that which appeared most admirable, both to me
and some other Gentlemen that were witnesses of it with me,
was the many differing kinds of small living Creatures, wholly
invisible to the naked eye, and even through largely magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spectacles, though some of them were to be seen through a
deep Convex glass; but with a Microscope, when the Plant
was newly gathered, they might be seen nimbly running up and
down among the Seed-vessels, and some of them were so
small as not to be above twice as big as the small Seeds in
the bladders; a description of some of which I may hereafter
send you.</p>
               <p>I have inclosed in the box sent you twelve sorts of Plants
of this tribe, being the greatest part of the number, and only
seven sorts of the Seeds; those wanting are the Cetrach, Wall
Rue, Maiden-hair, and Polypody, of which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you may satisfie your self in the mean time till I can
send them green by those small parcels of the Plants which
you will find amongst the rest, though by keeping they are
withered.</p>
               <p>The Seeds of the Ferns through a very excellent Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope
appeared of the bigness of a small Vetch or Seed of Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
to the naked eye, and some of them shrink like the sides
of white Pease, with small regular knobs and hollows. Those
of Polypody are differing in colour and shape being yellowish,
as the others are brown, red, and formed like the Seeds of
the smaller Medicas that is of a Kidney shape. All the rest
I found very near of the same form. I cannot omit what I
observed in Cetrach, which Plant I have heretofore often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
and wondred at the ill-favoured roughness on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98433:28"/>
side of the Leaf, appearing like the fleshy side of tann'd
Leather, being wholly ignorant what Nature meant in it, but
now by my Microscope I find it a very pleasant object differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from all the rest, wherein the curiosity of Nature (in a
Plant so abject as that appears) is shewn beyond imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This, when fresh gathered, and not bruised, appears
through the Microscope like fine thin Membranes, such as the
Wings of Flies, chequered with figures after the manner of
Honeycombs when the cells are full of honey, and closed with
Membranes, amongst which, as in so many Cells, lie the Seed-vessels,
shaped as before is mentioned. I doubt not but you
have read the strange stories and fabulous conceits of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
about Fern Seeds. But <hi>Parkinson</hi> is more Orthodox in
some things than any of them: For he positively concludes
from <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 11, 12. that all Plants have their Seeds, and
consequently Fern; where if he had staid, he had asserted a
general truth: But in coming to particulars, he affirms as
great an untruth, in saying, <hi>fol.</hi> 1036, and 1037. that the
Seed is ripe at Midsummer, according to the old traditional
Fable, and tells how it may be gathered; whereas now is the
very season of their seeding, and at Midsummer this and the
rest are not come to their full growth, before which no Plant
seeds. That dustiness which he speaks of, and calls the Seed, is
no other than what is found on divers other Plants, being an
irregular Dust, and is not found on the borders of the dents
of the Leaves on the under side, on which the Seed grows,
but all over sprinkled on both sides, and not found when it is
fully grown. This he affirms of the Male Ferns, which are all
differing very notably from the common Female Fern, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which the fabulous tradition is held. But after in
the following Chapter of the Ferns and their Relatives now
sent you, he seems to give over his Scripture Proposition, and,
speaking of the Seeds, says no more but that they have spots,
dashes, scales, or marks on their back-sides. And of the Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
Royal (speaking of the bush at the top of the Plant)
says it is accounted as the Flower and Seeds. And of the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitis
aspera</hi> says plainly they have none at all. Of this last
I am yet to enquire, but doubt not I shall find that it hath
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98433:29"/>
Seed like the rest. Of all which <hi>Gerrard</hi> and <hi>Johnson</hi> his
Corrigitor gravely concludes (having indeed no demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ground to the contrary) that some have been too rash in
affirming Ferns to have Seed. I intend next Summer to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
whether these hitherto unknown Seeding Plants have
Flowers. In the mean time</p>

               <p>DUring this last great heat of weather in <hi>June</hi> I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a very conspicuous Macula with its immediatly
incompassing Nubecula, and some other less conspicuous
Spots at a further distance pass over the Disk of the Sun,
and found that it was nearest the middle when the heat
was greatest, that the heat increased as it came nearer the
middle, and decreased as it departed from it. It may be
therefore worth observing for the future whether the like
weather do not happen upon the next appearance of the
like Macula, since it seems not very improbable to suppose
that the body of the Sun it self may be much hotter when
such eruptions appear, those Maculae often times ending in
Faeculae. And the rather because I am informed that this
extraordinary heat hath not been peculiar only to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but very general to <hi>Europe;</hi> what it hath been to
other parts of the world further intelligence will inform us.</p>
               <p>Upon a second appearance of Spots in the Disk of
the Sun at the latter end of <hi>July</hi> and the beginning of
<hi>August,</hi> when at one time, to wit, <hi>July</hi> 29. there appeared
about six greater and smaller in one knot with their proper
Nubecules or Umbra's, the heat of the weather again
increased to a very great degree, and abated as they drew
toward the Limb, and grew fainter. But it hath now
since the disappearing, <hi>viz.</hi> on the fourth of <hi>August,</hi> been
exceeding hot also, though I do not find any Spots this
seventh of <hi>August;</hi> it may therefore possibly be that other
parts of the body of the Sun may have an extraordinary
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98433:29"/>
inflammation which may cause so fervent and lasting heats
as have hapned this Summer. At least this Hint may
deserve some farther Inquiry, for though probably it
may not be attained to predict the appearances of those
Spots, yet possibly the appearances of the Spots may
serve to predict the future constitution of the weather.
At least it seems worthy remarking that the greatest heat
that hath been in the Air this year was on that day of <hi>June</hi>
when the first Spot was near the middle of the Sun.</p>
