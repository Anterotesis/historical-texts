         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO THE

            <head type="sub">Tunbridge-Wells Auguſt 30 96.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>COming on</hi> Saturday
<hi>night laſt, to</hi> Bonds-Coffe-houſe,
<hi>on the
Walks, I met with ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and a Book intituled</hi> The
trueſt Account of Mr. <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>'s
Diſcovery of the True
Mother of the pretended
Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Born <hi>June</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49339:3"/>
the <hi>10th.</hi> 1688. By a Perſon
of Quality.</p>
            <p>Upon my peruſing it, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
I cou'd not forbear to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the vanity of the Author,
who has made uſe of not ſo much
as one true Argument, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
Evidence or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to diſprove any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of <hi>my Narrative,</hi> which is
the buſineſs, he but indeed only
ſeems to endeavour. But I
neither fear or value what he
or any of the late King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
can ſay, or do in oppoſition
of what I have writ on this
Subject: Such ſnarling Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Lyers I preſume are no
<pb facs="tcp:49339:3"/>
ways extreamly ſerviceable to
the late King or his pretended
Son's Intereſt; for their Lyes,
Perjuries and Shams have been
ſo often detected, from time to
time, that they will hardly ever
gain any credit from the moſt
rational Men of this Kingdom,
untill they give us ſome ſtrong
proofs of their Reformation;
which this Spark I am ſure has
not done; and may well be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to diſcover his name:
Certainly he thinks the bare
name of Quality has a ſtrong
influence on the belief of the
People of <hi>England;</hi> but the
Cheat is grown as common with
<pb facs="tcp:49339:4"/>
Authors, as Vizard-masks are
indeavouring to paſs under the
ſame Notion, in a ſide Box, or
middle Gallery.</p>
            <p>What I have writ in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Treatiſe is my own, the
Stile is mean, which (I hope
the Reader will pardon, ſince
the matter is truth, I writ it
in haſt on <hi>Monday</hi> morning
<hi>Auguſt</hi> the 30th. 1696.
without any help, as I can prove
by ſeveral at the Wells with
me.</p>

THIRD
NARRATIVE.</head>
            <p>THis Author firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that, <hi>whether
the Birth of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>were
Legitimate, or ſuppoſititious,
has not been queſtioned or thought
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49339:5"/>
worthy to be examined publick by
authority,</hi> and therefore ſeems
to add, <hi>that the Birth muſt
be Legitimate becauſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Government has not expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that vile Impoſture:</hi> As,
I am ſure, they juſtly might;
though the Clemency of our
preſent King, and his late
Royal Conſort of Bleſſed
Memory, (whoſe goodneſs,
have always been equal to
their Royal Births and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
having in this as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Caſes, been willing
to paſs by the Greateſt Abuſes,
and Injuries, committed againſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49339:5"/>
them; for which their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
have been only abuſed
by thoſe they ſpared; which
the Queen was very well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of, and did once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Mrs. <hi>Labaddies</hi> Letters,
and other Papers relating to
this ſuppoſititious Birth to be
Publiſhed: And how little
ſoever this <hi>Quality,</hi> or rather
<hi>Billingsgate Writer</hi> wou'd
make me appear, I ſhall prove
him much in the wrong: and
aſſure him, that this matter
concerning Mrs. <hi>Mary Grey,</hi>
has been examined before
Great and Lawful Authority;
as the Chief Miniſters of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49339:6"/>
State of this Kingdom; and
the poſitive and corroborating
Proofs of ſeveral Perſons of
Quality and others, have all
agreed ſufficiently to convince
the World of the reality of
this <hi>Impoſtor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that <hi>I publiſhed it for
filthy Lucre,</hi> is baſely falſe;
for my Printer and Publiſher
will Depoſe upon Oath, that
I gave the Copy <hi>gratis,</hi> and
would never accept of any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
No, on the contrary I
did it to ſerve my King and
Country, and will maintain
ſo juſt a <hi>Truth</hi> to my laſt
breath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49339:6"/>
Next, he charges me with
<hi>calling in the aſſiſtance of a Poet,
to exert ſo much of his Wit and
Eloquence, as might help me
to entertain the Multitude with
this ſo diverting a Tragy
Comedy</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>as
my Diſcovery of the Mother,
and the Murther of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the pretended Prince
of</hi> Wales. I cannot but ſtand
amazed at his Frenzy, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,
to charge me with
ſuch a notorious falſity, which
is known to be ſo to the King
himſelf, and ſeveral of the
Miniſters of State, to whom
I gave the above mentioned
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49339:7"/>
               <hi>Narrative of the True Mother
of the pretended Prince of</hi>
Wales, as is now Publiſhed;
and I can produce a hundred
Gentlemen to whom I ſhewed
the ſaid <hi>Narrative,</hi> and gave
them exact Copies: Soon after
my loſt coming from <hi>France,</hi>
which was ſome years before
I knew Mr. <hi>Settle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the latter part of
that <hi>Narrative,</hi> relating to
my own unhappy credulity,
occaſioned by the immaturity
of my Judgment, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy
of <hi>Dalleval</hi> and <hi>Hays,</hi> for
whoſe appearance I engaged to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49339:7"/>
the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> with the
relation of what I diſcovered
to the King, concerning ſeveral
former Deſigns againſt his
Sacred Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was all writ by my own
Hand at <hi>Canterbury;</hi> where
I expos'd it to ſeveral the
ſame day I writ it, and I do
Declare, that neither Mr. <hi>Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
nor any other Perſons
gave me any aſſiſtance in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of my Books; only the
<hi>Dedication,</hi> which I confeſs
he did; I having not been
acquainted with things of that
kind: nor ſhou'd I indeed
pretend to Publiſh any thing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49339:8"/>
but <hi>This,</hi> which is matter of
Fact, and a Truth, which
I defie the World to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
            <p>As for my Birth, I gave
an account of it in my laſt
Book. And if it were not
ſo, certainly this Great Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
for this ſham Princes
Cauſe, might eaſily diſprove
me: Thoſe of his Stamp ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
want Witneſſes to Swear
at Pleaſure: But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
known, that I have
had all opportunities of an
ingenuous Education; and had
once the great <hi>Sabran</hi> (now
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49339:8"/>
Tutor to the pretended Prince)
for my School-Maſter, or
Governour.</p>
            <p>And as for what he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<hi>pag.</hi> 3. of <hi>a Plot upon a
Worthy and Reverend Prelate
of this Kingdom,</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
and eſpecially, ſince he
ſays, <hi>And how ſhamefully and
viſibly his</hi> (meaning my ſelf)
<hi>veracity came by the Lee, and
the lye too, in the Affair:</hi>
This aſſurance of his, I look
on but as a pure piece of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Principles, by which
they wou'd yet indeavour,
by palpable lyes, to ſupport
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49339:9"/>
a bad Cauſe; for I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
I never gave any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
againſt any Biſhop,
but the late Biſhop of <hi>Ely;</hi>
only it was my misfortune, to
read a Copy of a pretended
Addreſs to the French King,
which Mr. <hi>Hayes</hi> carried to
the late Queen at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains;</hi>
to which there was
fixed the names of ſeveral
Biſhops and others, whom I
always believed knew nothing
of it: which I declared to the
<hi>Houſe,</hi> when I preſented it,
as it was my Duty ſo to do.
Therefore I may juſtly affirm
this Charge as falſe as his others</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49339:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Next, He tells you, that <hi>my
Secretary ſeems to Envy for my
ſake, that Mr.</hi> Pendergraſs, <hi>Mr.</hi>
Porter, <hi>and Mr.</hi> De la Rue, <hi>with
their Companions, ſhou'd go away
with the whole Glory of the late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,</hi>
&amp;c. But, for this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
he can have no more
ground, then for the former;
but reſolves, if poſſible, to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch truths, as no honeſt or
Conſcientious man can deny:
Such were my diſcoveries, which
have been evidently confirm'd by
the Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crowe,</hi> and
others; which, I think, do in
no wiſe leſſen the ſervices of the
above ſaid Gentlemen, in their
Diſcoveries of the Conſpiracies
againſt the Kings ſacred Perſon
and Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as this Spark
wou'd Inſinuate, Confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49339:10"/>
               <hi>That his Majeſty, nor the
Government, would hardly take
notice of my Informations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have in my former
ſufficiently ſet forth the Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
made uſe of, to Invallidate
me to the King and Parliament,
which the World has now found,
by experience, was the only
means to ſecure the late King's
Friends, and cover their bloody
Deſigns; which from the Year
1689. They have been contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>He now begins to bring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Teſtimonies, of ſeveral
upon Oaths, who, he tells you,
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimouſly declare the Late Queen
to be the true Mother,</hi> &amp;c. Which
Depoſitions are already Printed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49339:10"/>
By theſe you may ſee, what
pains this Gentleman has taken,
to Collect thoſe Depoſitions; and
after a ſerious view of them, I
preſume, moſt will allow his time
but waſted: For I cannot find,
that any one but the <hi>Midwife</hi>
does affirm, <hi>That they ſaw the
Child come from the Queens Body.</hi>
But on this ſubject I will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
for modeſty ſake; Beſides,
the weakneſs of thoſe feeble Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations
is a ſubject that has
been often publickly expoſed,
and that lately too, which this
Quality-writer, wiſely takes
notice of, as being unable to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
I ſhall therefore quit that
needleſs Argument, and proceed to
inform you, what I know concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mrs. <hi>Mary Grey,</hi> and which
hath already, and will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49339:11"/>
prov'd, by a great number
of Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Mary Grey,</hi>
with another Gentlewoman,
came over from <hi>Ireland,</hi> both big
with Child, with the Lady <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conel,</hi>
ſome ſhort time before the
late Queen pretended to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of the ſuppoſed Prince of

<hi>June,</hi> near ten in the Morning.
Mrs. <hi>Mary Grey</hi> being ſeveral
days before Lodged privately in
St. <hi>James,</hi> in the narrow Gallery,
which was near the Queens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment;
It is certain, that on
<hi>Saturday</hi> the 9th of the ſame <hi>June,</hi>
Mrs. <hi>Grey</hi> was taken Ill; upon
which the Queen came ſuddenly
to St. <hi>James;</hi> and one <hi>Sunday,</hi>
when her Majeſty pretended to

heard to Groan, and make faint

in <hi>Paris;</hi> where there
was a breach in the Garden
Walls in <hi>Febuary</hi> 1689/90. At which

Alarm'd the <hi>French</hi> King, and
the late Queen, and occaſion'd
my being ſent in order to imbark
for <hi>England</hi> to get her diſpatcht,
at her Landing there; and that
ſhe was carried to St. <hi>Germains</hi>
to the late Queen, after her being

<hi>French</hi> King at <hi>Merli,</hi> I do affirm

Court at this time ſo cuningly
diſguiſe the Conſternation they
were under, but it took breath:
And wou'd our Male-contents,
who are lately come from <hi>France,</hi>
ſpeak truth; I am ſure they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but Remember part of what
I relate: However I don't queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but this matter will be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made out, to the ſatisfaction of
all <hi>Europe,</hi> very ſuddenly, by a
ſufficient Number of Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>Now, to return to the other
objections againſt me, alledged by
this malicious Gentleman, who
tells you, <hi>I have been confeſſed guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Ingratitude to my beſt Friends
and pretended Relations, and have
been openly Convinced of moſt Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and Malicious Forgery, againſt a
Reverend Biſhop; and of a wicked
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49339:12"/>
deſign againſt the whole Church of
England.</hi> To theſe I Anſwer, and
appeal to any moderate Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and Chriſtian tempered
Reader, that my Duty to my
Country ought to be valued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
any private Intereſt, or
Friend. And I muſt confeſs, I
have always had the greateſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
and reſpect for the Perſons of
my Friends at St. <hi>Germains:</hi> But
the Barbarity of the Intriegues
they had imploy'd me in, gave me
ſufficient cauſe to leave their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
in order to prevent the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of my Countrys blood, and
the Ruine of the Liberties of
<hi>England,</hi> by bringing it under a
<hi>French</hi> power; which looked ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dangerouſly at the time of my
coming over: For the full Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which, I refer my Reader
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49339:13"/>
to my other Books; only I beg
leave to inform you, that I did
not leave the late King and
Queens terms, without ſufficient
cauſe, and a ſerious conſideration;
I mean, in regard to the publick
good for which I have ſuffered,
and glory in my wrongs.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>any Forgery commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by me againſt a Biſhop,</hi> I ſtand
amazed that a Perſon of Quality
ſhou'd perſiſt in ſo known a Lye.
I have heard, I confeſs, of ſome
ſuch Villany committed againſt
the Biſhop of <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cheſter;</hi> but
ſure I am, that his Lordſhip, had
never any Reaſon in the leaſt to
ſuſpect me concern'd; beſides the
Perſons were convicted; and <hi>I</hi>
never till now was charged with
ſuch a crime.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49339:13"/>
And he would inſinuate,
that <hi>I deſigned against the
whole Church of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Certainly this Author knows
me not; for I preſume moſt
that do, can anſwer, That I
profeſs my ſelf, tho unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
a Member of that Church;
To which I was brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and convinced of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
by the late Lord Archbiſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He continues to repeat <hi>my
misfortune before the Houſe of
Commons,</hi> and is hardly put to
his ſhifts for Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, to invalidate my
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49339:14"/>
Teſtimony, and cover the
cunning management of the
Impoſtor-Prince, which will
be made Good by no leſs
Number of prevailing Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
than his <hi>mighty Troop of
Thirty Seven: For Truth, tho
oppreſſed and ſtifled for a time,
Will at laſt break forth, and
maintain its Property againſt all
ſuch ſcribling lying Oppoſers,</hi> as
this Gentleman has expos'd
himſelf to be.</p>
            <p>He would reflect on the
<hi>Papers</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> which I
purpoſe ſuddenly to Publiſh;
but neither himſelf nor Party
will have much cauſe; for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49339:14"/>
they ſhall have them as ſoon
as the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſits, and
which had e're this been
publiſht; only the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
conſequence of them
will, I hope, at that time,
be more ſerviceable to the
true Intereſt of the preſent
Government.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I cannot
poſitively affirm, that Mrs.
<hi>Mary Grey</hi> was murthered;
but after what I had ſeen
and heard from the late
Queens, <hi>Mrs. Grey</hi> and Fa.
<hi>Sabran</hi>'s own mouths, and
miſſing her from the time of
Conveying her from the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49339:15"/>
               <hi>French</hi> King's back ſtairs,
I had ſufficient reaſons, and
did really believe ſhe was
murthered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds,</hi> That any Man,
that has not a very strong
Faith, would Hardly believe
(without very good proof) the
eſcape of ſuch a poor Woman
ſhould ſo mightily Alarm the
<hi>French</hi> King and late Queen;
when her eſcape could have
done them little harm; ſince
it had been more Innocent for
them to pretend, that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the woman, when in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
declared, ſhe was hired,
and words put into her mouth,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49339:15"/>
by King <hi>William</hi> and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, and it
is known to moſt in <hi>Europe;</hi>
that the <hi>French</hi> King is the
moſt unfit perſon to impoſe
ſuch an untruth on the
World: For his <hi>Gallick</hi>
Majeſty very well knows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that had <hi>Mrs. Grey</hi> come
over to <hi>England,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
this matter, all his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,</hi>
or charges againſt
her, wou'd have ſignified but
little: For the many falſe
Impoſitions of the <hi>French</hi>
King, and his abdicated Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
are too well known, for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49339:16"/>
any to truſt, or believe them
for the future, without good
ſecurity. And on the other
hand, all muſt allow King
<hi>William</hi> never gave incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Villanies, nor falſe
Imputations, to ſupport his
cauſe or Intereſt in any kind;
His Throne is Eſtabliſh'd on
the <hi>Baſis, of true Juſtice and
Vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Author adds, <hi>There
was no need of the</hi> French <hi>Kings
being there at the perſonal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
of Mrs.</hi> Grey;
and ſays, <hi>It was below him;
nay it was none of his concern;
but the late King and Queens,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49339:16"/>
&amp;c. But in this, as in other
caſes, he ſhews his Vanity, in
oppoſing truths; and ſure he
muſt willfully forget, that
King <hi>James</hi> was at this time
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one knows: And the late
Queen never did any buſineſs
of concern, without conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>French King;</hi> to whom,
at this time, ſhe was in a more
ſpecial manner obliged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
her ſelf for his aſſiſtance;
fearing without it, it might
prove Impoſſible for her to
be any longer ſecured from being
expos'd, in this her <hi>Maſter-piece of
Intriegue</hi> on which all her hopes,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49339:17"/>
and even thoſe of the late Kings
ſucceſs depended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for their confining Mrs.</hi> Grey
<hi>in ſome remote Convent, as tHat of
Oublies,</hi> &amp;c. If ever the late Queen
or <hi>French</hi> King had any ſuch
thoughts, it muſt needs be ſtifled
by the late Queens extraordinary
Conſternation, which ſhe had not
then recovered: But, as in the
caſe of the <hi>Duke of Monmouth,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but blood could ſatisfy her:
beſides as their might happen a
breach in thoſe Garden Walls too,
or ſome other Contrivance, which
might afford Mrs. <hi>Grey</hi> a ſecond
opportunity of Leaving them,
her Death was therefore undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
thought moſt ſecure, and
might eaſily be practiſed where
'tis not thought ſo great a ſin, but
may be abſolved, eſpecially in ſo
important a <hi>Cauſe.</hi>

This <hi>Gentleman</hi> now falls hard
on Mr. <hi>Settle, for aſſiſting me;</hi>
which, <hi>God</hi> knows, he did not;
for I have no need of help in
a Relation of a Matter, where
I was ſo nearly concerned; And
as for his Advice, <hi>When he writs

That, as in the two former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes,
ſo in This, I have writ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

<hi>I</hi> will maintain againſt all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers

give the World a further Proof,

heard of any <hi>Biſhop, that writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

And, as for that of the

Callais, <hi>in a Yatch:</hi> I confeſs, I
ſhould at firſt have enlarged on

            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49339:19"/>
Next, it is alledged by ſome,

<hi>That I never was</hi> Page

I hope, Mr. <hi>Crone</hi>'s words
may; which were on his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

To which he adds, (and juſt

I was in</hi> France, <hi>when he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49339:19"/>

far his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Aſſurance prompted

That theſe Lords, truſted in

For a Commiſſion of this

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49339:21"/>
upon the adjuſting of that
Matter: And, on his Voyage,
that unhappy and ingenious
Lord had the misfortune to be
Caſt away; and his Fate not
being known in ſome time, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
