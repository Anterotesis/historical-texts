         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter the perusal of the said <hi>Snake in
the Grass,</hi> seeing the gross and absurd
Aspersions, Calumnies, Perversions and
scornful Stuff therein Contained, and the
great Malice of the nameless Author's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
against the People called Quakers; It
was slighted by us and laid aside for some
Months, being stuft with many lying and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
Stories, as scarce deserving any
particular Answer, except the notice of
some few to discredit the Author and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate
his fruitless attempts of his foul Envy
and Falshood: But some indifferent Persons
being urgent for an Answer, and the said
Book being rendred as an unanswerable
Piece, by some too easily imposed upon, and
others in prejudice gave occasion for the
insuing <hi>Reflections</hi> to be Exhibited, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to obviate the injurious Design of the
Author and his Abettors (<hi>i.e.</hi>) some wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
implacable and perfidious Apostates,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:43872:4"/>
who are of those Cattle he has principally
Plowed withal, and from whom he has chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
derived his unjust Authority to Defame
and Scandalize the said People, with those
old, false and refuted Aspersions and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as <hi>Possessed with the Devil, Enthusiastick
Madness, Blasphemy, Heresie, denying the true
Christ and his holy Humanity or Manhood, real
Sufferings and Satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>the Resurrection,</hi>
and <hi>Contemning the Holy Scriptures, Doctrins</hi>
and <hi>Precepts</hi> therein contained, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
more of such like Calumnies and
Slanders, Abuses and Perversions (of our
Words and Doctrins) frequently answered
and refuted by divers of us in our former
and latter Books. And now because of our
present Ease and Liberty, which Mercy
our Gracious God hath influenced the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Government to afford us, from our late
grievous and destructive Persecutions, (for
which Liberty we are truly thankful.) For
this Cause the Devil and his Agents appear
the more enraged and to have exceeding
great Wrath against the remnant of the
true Seed, and to combine together to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
us, with their most shameful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
Abuses, Lyes and Slanders, which
is the present Persecution we are under.
When the Devil was suffered to imploy his
Agents to Oppress and Persecute us in our
Persons and Estates, by severe Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:43872:4"/>
and spoil of Goods, tending to Ruin
us and our Families, then the Pens of his
Clerks and Ministers were quiet towards
us: But seeing his and their wicked ends by
that kind of open and cruel Persecution
could not be accomplished upon us; now
they bend their perverse Studies and Pens
to persecute us with shameful Reproach
and Blasphemy, to Destroy and Murther our
Reputations both as Men and Christians, not
sparing either the Living or the Dead. The
Lord our God will rebuke their Fury and
Outrage, and confound their mischievous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
and Confederacies; even the just and
righteous God (who by his power supported
us under our deepest Sufferings and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
and gave us Faith and Courage then
to Face the severest Storms and Blustering
Winds which rose up against us for our
Christian Testimony and Assemblies) he
hath enabled and will enable us to face and
outface this Storm of envious and outragious
Persecution of our open and secret Enemies.
And 'tis no small shame and disparagement
for such Eminent Church of <hi>England</hi> Men
(as the Author of <hi>the Snake in the Grass</hi> would
seem one of them) to be beholding to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Quakers, such as, <hi>George Keith</hi> and
<hi>Thomas Crisp,</hi> for their Aid or Authority
against us; and to <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Authority also,
who has been detected of numerous Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:43872:5"/>
against us, since he left us, and turned
to the Priests and to the Publick (as he calls
it) and the said <hi>George Keith</hi> contrary to
his many and frequent Vindications of the
People called Quakers and their Principles,
and above thirty Years Conversation among
them, now turned an open Adversary to
Revile and Reproach them, and yet a falsly
pretended Quaker, as if he would ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
himself into favour with the worst of
our Enemies; the Day will yet further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him and them.</p>
            <p>I confess, where Persons of a contrary Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to us, appear moderate and civil in their
Discourse and Treatment, in things wherein
they differ from us, they deserve to be gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and tenderly Answered and Treated; and
if such suppose me mistaken in any thing or
circumstance of words, (from which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not altogether to excuse my self in all
Controversies from my young and early
Years, and yet be assured by the Spirit of
Truth in matters Essential to Salvation) I
would take kindly their civil and friendly
Discovery thereof to me, being desirous
that the Truth may be exalted above all Self-reputation.
But when I find Persons like
this Author of <hi>The Snake in the Grass,</hi> mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
set in a <hi>persecuting Spirit,</hi> to defame
and reproach Truth and our Christian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:43872:5"/>
which I am concerned in Conscience
for.</p>
            <p>I confess then, a holy Zeal the Lord raises,
and has raised in my very Heart and Soul,
against such bitter Implacable and Persecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirits. And the Lord's Power I have
felt, and do still feel it to accompany and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
me in Defence of his blessed Truth and
People.</p>
            <p>And inasmuch as the said Author of
<hi>The Snake in the Grass,</hi> is so very liberal in
his most odious Characters upon us, and
has so frequently Branded us, even divers
Persons by Name with <hi>Blasphemies</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,</hi>
&amp;c. who have been, and are known
to be Persons of good Reputation, both as
Men and Christians in Life and Conversation:
'Tis pity but this Defaming Author, should
be publickly exposed by Name for his Folly
and outrage, especially if he persists in his
Scorn and envious injurious attempts against
us, that he may not be suffered to sculk and
hide himself like a Snake under Grass.</p>
            <p>And as to the seven Queries, which he
upbraids us with, reproaching us, <hi>As puting
them all off with one general Answer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as a
trick and deceit of ours, to hide and cover our
monstrous Heresies, and a full confession of our
Heresies,</hi> Pref. <hi>p.</hi> 350. Which being mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Calumnies, and from which our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Answer to the unprejudiced, clears us,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:43872:6"/>
though we expected it would meet with such
ill Treatment and Mis-construction, as it
hath from <hi>G. K.</hi> and this Author; therefore
thought meet to publish the said Answer
herewith, for the information of others more
Charitable and Impartial, than this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Accuser and unjust Judge. The said
Queries appear to be of so little weight,
and some of them so indirect and in unscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Terms, and perversly designed for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
that I do not think they deserve to be
reprinted here. The following Answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
positive, plain and scriptural, as well as
comprehensive, of what's necessary to be
said to the matters chiefly Questioned.</p>
            <p>And tho' I have long had a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Answer to the said Queries ready, I
do not think my self obliged at present, to
gratifie such imperious arbitrary Inquisitors
as our present Adversaries with the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof; but rather for farther infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

of us very near the conclusion thereof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
only read in the said Meeting, with not
having any further time to consider the Contents
thereof, or to give any particular answer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
It was by the said Meeting left to a few
to consider and answer, as in the Fear of God
and Meekness of Wisdom we should see Cause.
Wherein we observe is noted, great Objections
have been made against us, by those who have
departed from our Communion as by others.</p>
            <p>To which we reply, that 'tis true, and they have
been answer'd, to which we refer. And we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in the said Paper its said, We would not
take an account of you only from your Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we have chosen this solemn
Time. <hi>And again,</hi> And we have chosen this
most proper and convenient Opportunity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And then states the several Queries, and says,
the Questions may be proposed, and their Answer
demanded.</p>
            <p>Now the Objections having been publick, and
our Answers publick, we desire to know, who
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:43872:7"/>
the <hi>We</hi> are, that are intended in this Paper,
that we may apply our selves to them, or give
such Scriptural Answers, as we hope may tend
to satisfaction. But to repeat Answers in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or print to we know not who, so often as
demanded, to the same things already answer'd,
We think it not needful. Therefore have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
only sent thee a few brief Lines, being
grosly Wronged and Misrepresented in the said
Objections, and divers of the Queries contain
several Questions in them, in different Terms
(and some Vnscriptural) so not plain and direct
Queries, therefore cannot positively be answer'd
by our simple YEA <hi>or</hi> NAY, to each Query
as designed. We therefore at present send this
general Answer to the Queries for thy informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We sincerely believe and profess Jesus Christ
and the Resurrection according to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Testimony, and to that measure of Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
which God hath been pleased to give us
by his Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>We sincerely believe in Jesus Christ, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begotten Son of the living God, both as he is
true God, and perfect Man; our Emanuel and
Mediator and as in the fulness of Time, he was
Conceiv'd by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Judea;</hi> Suffer'd under
<hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was Crucified and put to Death;
was Buried, rose again the third Day, and
visibly Ascended into Heaven, and was received
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:43872:8"/>
into Glory; and that this same Jesus Christ that
was Crucified, shall so in like manner come (as
he was seen to go into Heaven) in Power and
great Glory to Judge both the Living and the
Dead, according to their Works at the last and
great Day of Judgment, in that great Harvest
which is the End of the World.</p>
            <p>And that by Jesus Christ there shall be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the Dead, both of the Just and
Vnjust unto the righteous Judgment of the great
Day; consequently, that the Resurrection is not
past, as <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> said, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 18.</p>
            <p>And that the Dead shall be raised incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
<hi>Every Man in his own order, and that
our low Body shall be changed, and made
like unto Christ's glorious Body:</hi> The Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Bodies of the Saints (<hi>We Believe</hi>)
shall be Spiritual and Glorious, and that the Sons
of God, and of the Resurrection shall be equal
with the Angels of God in Heaven, and shine
as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father; and
yet there is such a great Mystery in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
as that <hi>Flesh and Blood cannot In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the Kingdom of God, neither doth
Corruption inherit Incorruption,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</p>
            <p>The whole Sacrifice of Christ (whereof his
Blood outwardly that was shed was a part) was
of great Price with God for Mans Redemption:
Christ's Blood that was shed without the Gates of
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> together with the whole Sacrifice
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:43872:8"/>
himself both of Soul and Body, was a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
and Attonement for Mans reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and peace with God for remission of Sins,
through a living Faith, and true Repentance (in
his Name) given and wrought by his Spirit and
Word of Power in Mens Hearts; whose sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
obedience to Christ, and Walking in his
Light, being required of them, in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
Christ the Author of their eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and to wash them from their Sins in his
own Blood. For without this true Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Obedience to Christ Jesus, Men lose
and forfeit the great Benefit of Christs Sufferings,
and deprive themselves of the Eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Salvation, which he hath hereby obtain'd
for us. Tho' he dyed for all Men, tasted death
for every Man, and gave himself a Ransom for
all, to be testified of in due time, being a true
Propitiation for the Sins of the World.</p>

ANTIDOTE
AGAINST THE
VENOME
OF
The Snake in the Grass:
BEING A
Sober Caution against the great Malice
and gross Abuses of the Book so stiled;
and the People call'd QUAKERS
defended from the same.</head>
            <p>SEeing the nameless Author gives
his Book the Title of <hi>The Snake
in the Grass; or, Satan trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
into an Angel of Light;</hi>
which Character he intends for the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Leaders of those People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43872:10"/>
It may be observed (by the
way) what other Characters, Charges
and Languages he gives the said People,
and treats them with all in his said
Book, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preface, p.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 17. False Prophets,
mad Enthusiasm, obstinate Quakers, their
Rage, their Folly, rank wild Blasphemy,
proud blasphemous Spirit, black-Mouth'd
hellish Venom, Coujurers, Witchcraft and
Conjuration; <hi>p.</hi> 19. whatever the Power
of the Devil may be in such cases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
There never were more visible and dreadful
Effects of it, no not in any possess'd Men
mentioned in the Gospel, than has been
among the Quakers, <hi>p.</hi> 21. even as declared
and witnessed by themselves, and that not
only as to the strange and preternatural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stortions,
Quaking and Shaking of their
Bodies, past the Power of any to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
or to act it by their natural Strength,
but what is much more horrible and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
all other Witchcrafts and Possessions
of the Devil, that were ever heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
these possess'd Quakers do impiously
blaspheme and call themselves Christ; and
some of them have imitated his Passion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43872:10"/>
Death and Resurrection, madly in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>We may hence observe, First, the
Authors most unjust and falsly refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
these black Characters and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
upon the Quakers. Secondly, How
he shews Satan transform'd into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of Light: When and where did he
ever see or read of an Angel of Light,
thus to appear, like a mad Man, a
Witch, a Devil, a Blasphemer? What
horrid Madness, Blasphemy and Self-contradiction,
does the Devil and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
precipitate, such furious foul-Mouth'd
persecuting Agents into, at
unawares? Thirdly, But if the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
were such Madmen, and possess'd
with the Devil as he represents them,
how well has the Man spent his time,
in bestowing his Wit, Drollery and
Raillery (instead of Compassion) on
such Madmen, whose case (if such)
were to be lamented, rather than derided?
Fourthly, For this great Madness and
being possessed with the Devil, as 'tis
cast upon the Quakers. His instance (of
<hi>John Gilpin</hi> in 1653. <hi>James Milner</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43872:11"/>
and <hi>John Toldervy</hi>) p. 22, 23, 24, 30, 34.
can only prove himself impertinently
malicious, and can no more affect the
People called Quakers, nor be any more
valid Argument to prove them Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Blasphemers, (since they have
long since testified against the madness
of those Persons he mentions) than if
one should argue against the Church
and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That
because many of their Members have
run Mad and been put into <hi>Bedlam,</hi>
therefore the Church and Clergy of
<hi>England</hi> are all Mad, and must be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Bedlam</hi> (if they had one big
enough:) And many such other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
Arguments and Consequences
might be retalliated upon this <hi>Snake in
the Grass,</hi> if from a Particular to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
shall be admitted as a sound way
of Arguing, which no rational Man
will allow. Fifthly, His Instance
(against the Quakers) of <hi>James Nayler</hi>'s
failure, and suffering a few mad Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to sing <hi>Hosanna</hi> to him. This is as
unjustly as maliciously remembred and
cast upon us, seeing that Madness was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43872:11"/>
condemned and testified against by the
People called Quakers. And the Lord,
in mercy, made <hi>James Nayler</hi> himself
sensible of the great Temptation and
Cloud, he was, for a time, fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
insomuch, that he not only gave
out a publick Testimony of his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of the Lord's dealing with
him, which was in Judgment and
Mercy, and publickly exposed under
the Title of <hi>James Nayler</hi>'s <hi>Recantation;</hi>
but also some are yet alive that were
both Eye-witnesses of his many Tears
and deep Humiliation, besides his great
suffering in Person by the then Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who being restored into his right
Understanding and Sense of the Love
and Mercy of God in Christ, sometime
after innocently ended his Days in
Peace.</p>
            <p>And therefore it shews, the more
implacable Malice and horrid Injustice,
to reproach us with any personal failing
of his or any other. And not only so,
but to reflect personal Miscarriages upon
our Principles: As where he thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
infers, <hi>viz. So very susceptible do
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43872:12"/>
the Quakers Principles make Men, of the
wild Impressions of Enthusiasm,</hi> p. 35. So
that by this Inference, all <hi>Gilpins, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
and <hi>Toldervy</hi>'s strange Whimsies,
lying Imaginations and Madness, are
unjustly and blasphemously father'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Quakers Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> The
<hi>Light within, Revelation,</hi> the <hi>Infalibility,</hi>
p. 35. (which we intend of the Holy
Spirit's Teaching) and no other.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>P.</hi> 37. As for <hi>Quaking and Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
so much derided; how proves he
that this proceeds from <hi>Delusion and
Diabollical Possession,</hi> p. 44. and not from
the Word and Power of God, at which
many good Men, both of Prophets,
Apostles and Primitive Christians, have
trembled? And also by the same
Power, both wicked Men and Devils,
have been, and shall be made to Fear,
Tremble and Quake.</p>
            <p>7. As to <hi>such strange, preternatural
Distortions</hi> he talks of, where did he see
them among the Quakers? We know
not; unless some have been taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
in some Convulsion-Fits; which
are common to some Persons among di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43872:12"/>
sorts of People; or, when by the
Power of our Lord Jesus Christ, some
evil Spirit has been about to be cast
out.</p>
            <p>8. And how he can discern and judge
all outward <hi>Quaking and Trembling,</hi>
which he derides, to proceed from <hi>a
being inwardly possess'd with the Devil;</hi>
and not from the influence and oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Power of Christ, we cannot
understand, unless contrary to his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
against Infalibility, he proves his
Judgment and Discerning Infallible,
and that even in the Tryal of Spirits;
wherein we cannot esteem him such a
spiritual Man of Discerning, as judgeth
all things.</p>
            <p>P. 34. Again from his dark Stories of
<hi>Gilpin, Milner, Toldervy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as in an
high degree possess'd with the Devil.</hi> He
farther infers, <hi>That there have not been
among so many of all Mankind such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
(a gross Lie) as of these Quakers
that have run quite Mad, for their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is little short of Madness.</hi> The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
he presently mentions, p. 35. <hi>Is
that of expecting Revelations, and of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43872:13"/>
Light within.</hi> But granting that some
pretending to Divine Inspiration of the
Holy Spirit, Revelations and Light
within, and from thence Infallibility in
Matters of Salvation to proceed, and
yet some such have failed and run into
Imagination and Delusion. Is this any
good Argument against the Principle
it self? If not, this Opposer's Work is
only to rake up and set forth Personal
Failings, which can no ways destroy
good Principles, from whence there
have been many Revolters and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliders,
both in the Days of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Apostles and Ours; and some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when they knew God, glorified
him not as God, became vain in their
Imaginations, and their foolish Hearts
thereby darkned; others begun in the
Spirit, yet would end the Flesh. But
where's his Catalogue to prove a greater
number of Quakers have run quite
mad, than among so many of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?
Let him produce it if he can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now 'tis observable, That our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of</hi> Divine Inspiration, Light within,
the Gift of the Holy Ghost, the Work and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43872:13"/>
Ministry thereof, <hi>are plainly confest unto
by this Author of</hi> The Snake in the Grass;
<hi>as</hi> 
               <q>That the Doctrin of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> allows the same, namely, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
teaching that all saving Graces are
wrought in our Hearts by the Inspiration
of the Holy Ghost, and that this Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is as necessary to our fructifying or
bringing forth good Works, as the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Sun is to the Earth's bringing
ing forth of her Fruits, <bibl>

               <hi>Further discovering,</hi> 
               <q>That they do not
only Teach, but also Pray for, and Sing
for God's holy Inspiration of the Holy
Ghost, and plead for the necessity of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inspiration, Light within, <hi>
                     <bibl>&amp;c. from

                  </bibl>
               </q> 
               <hi>He also, instead of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Principle, or proving us all</hi>
Madmen that profess Divine Inspiration,
<hi>tells us,</hi> 
               <q>What sort of Enthusiasm or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
is allowed and own'd in the
Church; and that 'tis full as much as any
sober Quaker can mean by the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and that it is made necessary to every
good Work. And we are directed to it,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43872:14"/>
to follow and be guided by it; and are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that it will lead us to all Truth
that is requisite and necessary for our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Salvation; it is this that opens the
Scriptures to us and our Vnderstandings,
rightly to apprehend the true Sense and
Meaning of them, and which inclines our
Will to love, and duly to follow the divine
Precepts therein contained. If any Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
(as I am confident all that are, in the
least, sober-minded) will say, That this
is all they mean by their Light within;
then where is the difference? Why do they
break off and separate from our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
upon the pretence of the Light within,
wherein we agree with them? <bibl>
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 55,
56, 57.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far, his Confession to the
Principle, wherein he is more Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than in his bitter reproachful Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
and foul Raillery against us,
which he somewhat minceth, yet
confesseth, <hi>He is forced to a little
Raillery now and then.</hi> Second Part,
pag. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:43872:14"/>
The greater shame for him, thus to
manifest himself an open Railer and
Reviler about religious Controversies:
But seeing he has so largely confess'd
and vindicated the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s
allowing Preaching and Praying
for the <hi>Inspiration of the Holy Ghost,</hi>
and agreeing with the Quakers about
<hi>the Light within,</hi> &amp;c. how trifling and
fruitless are his Attempts to vilifie and
make them odious? as <hi>Madmen, Possest
with the Devil, Enthusiastick, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
&amp;c. from the Personal Miscarriages
of some Distracted or Whimsical, or
Mad, or loose extravagant Persons.
How many of his own Church have run
mad? How many Debauched and
Wicked, both of the Clergy and others?
Would he take it well to have a large
Catalogue, or Book, writ thereof, as
the Cobler of <hi>Gloucester</hi> and others have
done, to shew the Contempt of the
Clergy, and then upbraid their whole
Communion or Society, yea, and their
Principles also, therewith? Surely no,
this he would deem very unjust.
Then let him peruse his own Work,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43872:15"/>
and better consider the Nature and
Tendency thereof, together with the
bitter Invectives therein, tending to
raise a new Persecution; which shews
not a Christian Spirit or Charity in him
or his Abettors, Apostates from us,
or others, whose Help (by divers of
of his silly dirty Stories) he appears to
have had.</p>

The Snake in the Grass;
with brief Reflections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</head>
            <p>THat <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s chief Principle
was at first to direct Men to
the inward Anointing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 93, 94.</note> and
that they needed no Man to
teach them, but as the Anointing teacheth them,
and that God is come to Teach his People himself;
but that he would not trust to this, for that he
went about Teaching outwardly, and has erected
an outward Church-Discipline and Authority to
over-rule the Anointing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They keep up outward Ministry and Preaching,
which are more inconsistant with their Principle
of reducing all to the Inward, and waiting for
the Lord in silence within.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reflection.</hi> Here are 3 Falshoods contained
in this Calumnious Charge. As 1. That
<hi>G. F.</hi> would not trust to this Anointing.
2. Church-Discipline to over-rule the same.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43872:16"/>
3. Keeping up an outward Ministry and
Preaching as inconsistant therewith. These
are both false and apparent Perversions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
also upon the Holy Apostles and
their Ministry, preaching and writing Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Instructions to the Churches, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to both Church Order and Discipline,
and yet directed and referred them to the
same Divine Unction (received from the
Holy One) the Holy Spirit, the Word of
Faith and Grace of God within them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Ministry and Instructions to good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Discipline, were not to over-rule
the inward Anointing, but (as proceeding
from the same) to help strengthen and
confirm them in it; for if the Doctrin of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> be so much for the
Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, the Light
within, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he confessed, what then is
their Ministry and Discipline to over-rule
the same? How will he reconcile himself to
his condemning us in this Case?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sn.</hi> p. 95, 96. These two Madmen, <hi>Fox</hi>

from the same Author, the Father of Lies, who
in that Hurricane of Schism and Rebellion, got

            <p>
               <hi>Ref.</hi> The first part is a gross Calumny
against <hi>G. F.</hi> whose divine Inspiration and

found Testimony, given him of God, was
evident against <hi>Muggleton</hi>'s dark Spirit, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
and blasphemious Doctrine
2. The latter part is a bold Calumny and
Reflection upon the Parliament, and <hi>Act</hi>
thereof, for Tolleration and Liberty of
Conscience, as if the Devil, the Father of

how like a dutiful Son of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

would renew the sense of the heavy Curses
of Popish Kings denounced upon themselves
or any of their Successors, who should
either recal the same or <hi>incroach,</hi> in any
part, upon the Tithes, and upon all Assisters
in such Sacriledge (as he calls it?) But it
seems King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. would not be bound
by any of the said Curses, no more than by
the Pope's Supremacy. I think the Man has
out-done the <hi>Rhemists</hi> and other Jesuits and
Popish Priests in these Aggravations, to
fasten the said Curses not only on <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.
but upon all the Impropriators and Receivers
of such Grants, as aforesaid; though the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>
and he agree as to Tithes, being <hi>Jure
Divino,</hi> as in their Annotations on <hi>Heb</hi> 7.
They say, <q>That the Payment of Tithes is
a natural Duty that Men owe to God in
all Laws, and to be given to his Priests,
in his behalf, for their Honour and Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood;
and that <hi>Jacob</hi> promised or vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to pay them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. And that
<hi>Abraham</hi> specially giving them to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck,</hi>
plainly thereby approveth
them, or their equivalent to be due to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43872:19"/>
Christ and the Priesthood of the New
Testament, much more than either in
the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> or in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and for Tithes due to the Clergy
of Christ's Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>See now how exactly this Churchman and
these <hi>Rhemists</hi> agree in this point of Tithe.
But that the Reformed Protestants, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
eminent Protestant Martyrs, were of
the contrary Judgment concerning Tithes;
hear <hi>First,</hi> what Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> saith in Answer
and Opposition to the <hi>Rhemist</hi> recited Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
on <hi>Heb 7. viz.</hi> 
               <q>The Payment of
Tithes as it was a Ceremonial Duty is
abrogated, with other Ceremonies, by
the Death of Christ; but as it is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Maintenance and Livelihood to them
that serve in the Church, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
or any other Stipend appointed
that may be sufficient for their Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
be it <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> than the <hi>Tenth</hi>
part. But that there is any sacrificing
Priesthood to whom it is due in the New
Testament, the old Payment of Tithes
doth not prove; neither did Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
our High-Priest, ever make claim
unto them; nor his Apostles the Ministers
of the Church; but only a sufficient Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Gospel, to be allowed of their
temporal Goods, to whom they ministred
spiritual Goods,</q> 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 14. Gal.</hi> 6. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:43872:20"/>
From all which 'tis evident, <hi>First,</hi> That
the Protestants in those Days did not esteem
Tithes of divine Right for Gospel Ministers,
but abrogated by the Death of Christ, but
indefinitely allowed a sufficient Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for them, without restricting it to the
Tenth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Divers eminent Martyrs and
others, who were both Persons of Piety
and good Fame, are more full and plain in
this Point against Tithes in the Gospel-day
and times; as <hi>John Wickliff, VVilliam Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derby,
VValter Brute, VVilliam Thorp,</hi> the
<hi>Bohemians,</hi> with other Christians mentioned
in the Book of Martyrs, did bear Testimony
against Tithes and compell'd Maintenance
by the civil Authority. This of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Tithes was made a principal Article
against them by the Popish Bishops and
Clergy; as more largely and particularly
appears in the 1st vol. of Martyrs, in the
Reigns of <hi>Richard</hi> II. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and
<hi>Henry</hi> V.</p>
            <p>And tho' with those Christian Martyrs
and first reformed Protestants, we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded,
That Jesus Christ by his Suffering
and Death hath abrogated Tithes, and the
Law that required them according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.
and that his Ministry ought to be free and
without any forced Maintenance, yet 'tis
not our Business now strictly to dispute the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43872:20"/>
Merits of that Case of Tithes, being fully
opened by other Hands; as <hi>Fra. Howgill</hi> in
his <hi>Great Case of Tithes,</hi> and <hi>Tho. Ellwood</hi> in
his <hi>Foundation of Tithes shaken,</hi> and <hi>R. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardson</hi>'s

Christians; (with divers others) to which
we refer the Reader.</p>

Pray when and where did ever the People,

Names of <hi>God and Christ,</hi> either because of
God's Indwelling or for any other cause?
We deny the Charge as both blasphemous
and confused: God's indwelling in his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cannot render them God. And though
we do sincerely believe and own a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a deliverance from Sin, and of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
and Holiness, as obtained and
wrought by Jesus Christ, for and in true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43872:22"/>
to any such equality of Perfection as that of
God himself, which in Wisdom and
Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is infinite; seeing we are Men,

Creator. Therefore 'tis a great and gross
Lie to say of the Quakers, <hi>They all pretend to

Slander implied against the Quakers, that
'tis their Boasting, Doctrin or Principle,
that they, or any of them, are equal
with God, because they partake of his

(and of the divine Nature and Image)
they pretend to no such Equality or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
neither doth <hi>G. F.</hi> but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

Christ without is not another Christ than
Christ within, tho' his being without and
within are in different manners. By the
Light within being <hi>sufficient</hi> to Salvation, or
to bring Salvation, we mean <hi>able to save,</hi>
as the ingrafted Word is able to save the
Soul, yea, even where the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Meaning and interpretation (as well as a

Our owning Christ in Spirit and as a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Calumnies against us. The first part is
sufficiently answer'd before, and in many

The latter part is some of <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Abuses and Perversions, and clearly

Suggestions: Our manifold Sufferings in

the Temporizers of the Clergy) do manifest
the contrary to what's here suggested against
us, that we have not turned, changed nor
conformed according to the Times, in point
of Worship, Principle, Faith or Discipline;
for could we have so done, we might have
escaped many deep Sufferings and great
Losses which we have undergone, and then
have been owned by such temporizing and

rendring them a Sorcerer's Children. But
they deny both <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and all Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers,

The Quakers are as opposite to such Simony,

not such a determination of his; but where
he speaks of <hi>that not being a Command from
God to me, which he commands to another;</hi> he
intends this of special Commands that were
to some, as to <hi>Baptize</hi> and <hi>Preach the Gospel,</hi>
as he immediately explains it, and not of
general Commands of Duty incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all, nor against the Authority of the
Scriptures; it being the Holy Spirit that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43872:30"/>
makes them authoritative and binding, and
enables Men to live accordingly who are led
by the same Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sn. p.</hi> 342. That <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 49. prefers not only their
Writings, but their <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Preachments,
and even all whatsoever they speak, <hi>upon any
Account,</hi> to the Holy Scriptures themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> He very perversly wrongs <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>
in all these Expressions; for there's
not a word of preferring our Writings to
the Holy Scriptures, much less of all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
we speak thereto; but a preferring
the Holy Spirit and its immediate Teaching
in <hi>Man</hi> to the Letter of Scripture, and
preaching in the true sense of the Spirit
with divine Authority (according as Christ
did) to the bare reading the Letter as the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> did; which was not at all to lessen
the Authority of Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sn. p.</hi> 343. To prove gross Contempts of
Scripture daily found among them (<hi>i. e.</hi> the
Quakers) he gives us another particular Instance
of a Quaker-Servant that took the Bible, and in
the open Day publickly burnt it against the Church
in <hi>Bread-street,</hi> to shew her Zeal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> Upon a late Enquiry we understand,
That there was such a Servant-Maid, who
under some Discomposure and Temptation,
attempted such an evil and mad Action; but
was severely rebuked and testified against
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43872:31"/>
by our Friends who came to understand that
Attempt or Action, which we utterly abhor,
and therefore not justly chargeable upon us
as a People, any more than all the mad Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the People in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> who belong
to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Wherefore the
great Envy and Injustice of this Defamer is
very remarkable in this Passage, as 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
against the Quakers, to prove <hi>gross
Contempts of Scripture <hi>daily</hi> found among them;</hi>
which is as bad as to say, They daily burn
their Bibles. Oh sad and sordid Stuff!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sn. p.</hi> 346. I assure thee, Reader, that
there is no mixture of any personal Prejudice in
this Vndertaking; for I do freely own, that I
have a real Kindness and good Wishes for every
one of the Quakers, that I have hitherto been
acquainted with, and I never received any sort
of Disobligation from any of them in my whole
Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> 1. We have no reason to believe this
Person has no personal Prejudice in this his
reproachful Undertaking, being against a
whole People, where every Person of their
Society is concerned, and shamefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed
by him, under as gross Terms and
Characters as the Devil and Malice could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
and produce, through a poor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
Hypocrite, as thus pretends such
real Kindness and good Wishes for every one
the Quakers of his Acquaintance, while at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43872:31"/>
the same time he's endeavouring to murther
their Reputations, both as Men and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
2. And yet he has received no sort
of Wrong from any of them, to disoblige
him, in his whole Life: More shame for
him then, thus sordidly to abuse the whole
People as he hath done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sn. p.</hi> 348. As to the Nature of Christ, they
can subscribe the whole Creed, and yet not mean
one word of it, of a personal Christ existing
now in Heaven in his own true human Nature,
without all other Men, or that he is now any
otherwise a Man than as existing in his Saints:
But that they mean ALL they say of their own
Light within, ONLY which they call a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Christ, and shedding spiritual Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
within them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> Here are several Things very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly
and falsly insinuated in these Passages.
1. As if we did not believe the Man Christ
Jesus to be now in Heaven without us (as
well as spiritually within us) which is not
true. 2. As if we did not own Christ Jesus
to be intire and perfect Man in himself, or
in his own proper <hi>Being or Existence</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, as well as he is by his Spirit in us)
which also is not true, for we really own
him in both. And though Christ, being
the spiritual Rock, and as he is the Word
of God, the immortal Seed and a quickning
Spirit, he is <hi>in us,</hi> and livingly felt and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43872:32"/>
known in all true Believers, yet not to les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
his intire Existence, or limit him the
<hi>Holy One,</hi> as if he were no where or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in <hi>Being</hi> than within us. Such limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we disown, as well as wholly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Christ out of his Saints, as some have
done under those unscriptural Expressions
of a <hi>personal Christ existing in Heaven, wholly
without us;</hi> which Terms some of us have que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
chiefly because imposed by some to
oppose the Light, Life and Spirit of Christ
within, whereby we can only truly know
the Lord Jesus Christ, to our eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Peace. 3. That Christ is truly
spiritual and glorious, we confess and shall
never deny; and that he has spiritual Blood
too, spiritual Water, Wine and spiritual
Drink, to sanctifie, refresh and comfort our
Souls, we must confess as that we daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
as well as he had natural and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Blood to offer and shed on the Cross
for the sins of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sn. p.</hi> 350. That the Quakers general
Answer to the seven Queries of the 15th of
<hi>May,</hi> 1695. was a Trick and Deceit of theirs,
to hide and cover their monstrous Heresies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> This is a very severe and high Charge,
(especially from one pretending <hi>real Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for us</hi>) and as false as any of the rest of
his Railery against us. But what Proof is
offered of these monstrous Heresies, or
covering them? <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:43872:32"/>
               <hi>Sn.</hi> They tell of Christ born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary,</hi> who suffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi>
&amp;c. but they keep off the whole stress of the
Queries, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether they believe in such a
Christ, <hi>as without them?</hi> And that he is now
this day a Man without all other Men? No,
not a word of this; this pinches too close: And
I think this a full Confession of their Heresie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> Our Adversary appears very much
out here: For suppose we did not answer
expresly in all the Terms of the said Queries,
being indirect and confusedly stated, seeing
we gave a scriptural, intire substantial and
comprehensive Answer (which he is not
able to confute): This could not amount to
any confession of <hi>Heresie</hi> on our parts,
neither does his <hi>thinking</hi> so prove any such
thing. He judges with very dark and evil
Thoughts in this Matter. Where did we
ever say, That Christ being born of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and suffering under <hi>Pilate,</hi>
were <hi>not without us?</hi> Or, that Christ is <hi>not</hi>
a Man, without all other Men, as well as
spiritually in them? We are to seek for
such a Confession by us, for we know none
such; but the contrary, we are bound to
believe in Christ intirely in all respects as he
is; both as he is within us, and as he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us; both as he is God, and as he is Man,
according to Holy Scripture-Testimony of
him; and 'tis not uncharitable or envious
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43872:33"/>
               <hi>thinking</hi> the contrary of us, that can be any
valid Argument to convict us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
or of any Heresies whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sn. p.</hi> 351. Out of some of their (<hi>i. e.
the Quakers</hi>) Books, <hi>George Keith</hi> has col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
their true and genuine Answers to each
of the said Queries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under this HOLY
Title, <hi>Gross Error and Hypocrisie detected,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> The first part is false: For <hi>G. K.</hi>
did partially and perversly collect divers
Passages, which could be no proper nor
direct Answers to those Queries, nor so
intended, nor by us adapted to any such
Queries; therefore the greater Abuse in
him, to collect and place them for Answers
thereto. 2. His Title and Charge of
<hi>Gross Error and Hypocrisie,</hi> is blasphemously
termed HOLY, for 'tis altogether Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy,
as well as Malicious, and <hi>G. Keith</hi>
is accountable to the just God for scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
and defaming us, not only with
<hi>Gross Error,</hi> but <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> too. The first
intends those Books of ours, quoted by
him; in all which there's Matter suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to clear us from his Aspersions,
as <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> (and <hi>John Pennington</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so)
have well observed, in divers Answers
to him, together with <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Vindications of us (as a People) and
our Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:43872:33"/>
The latter (<hi>i. e. Hypocrisie</hi>) we may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
must intend our Answer given to the said
7 Queries; wherein (as in divers other
things) <hi>G. K.</hi> hath foully <hi>belied</hi> us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our own Consciences, which are

seeing <hi>G. K.</hi>'s Authority seems to be of some

<hi>Quaker,</hi> but more near to them; and where
he'll yet center or settle, in what Society
or Communion, is a great Question. Or
rather whether he does not aim at setting up
for himself as Sect-master, if he can draw
some sort of People to admire him in his
Notions and reproaching the Quakers (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his former manifold Vindications of
them and their Principles) after above 30
Years Conversation and kind Treatment

            <p>THE Controversie with the

the <hi>Quakers</hi> were not so considerable either
for their Learning, or for their Influence upon
the publick Revolutions, which the others caused
both in Church and State. But their numbers
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43872:34"/>
(whether increased by their being so neglected)
are now really formidable, I mean for the many

            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> Tho' the first part of this Complaint
carries no small Reflection upon the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
and <hi>Independents,</hi> &amp;c. rendring them
greatly obnoxious in the Eye of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as not only formidable but dangerous
(which is most proper for them to answer)
'tis not truly stated as to the <hi>Quakers:</hi> For
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the two late
King's Reigns, has pursued them with more
Zeal and Pains than any other Dissenters,
both to stop their Growth and to root them
out also; tho' not by rationally controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Matters in difference, but by such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
and severe Persecutions, as hard
Imprisonments, Banishments, Spoil of
Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as no other People of Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have so generally suffered, nor to such
a degree, because they did not stand in a
publick Testimony, in the Heat of the Day,
as the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> have. So that
'tis not through the said Churches neglect,
or want of taking Pains to pursue the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
that they are so multiplied and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased;
but rather, as the first and chief
cause of their Increase was God's Power and
divine Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:43872:35"/>
A secondary Cause was their great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions

               <hi>Sn. p.</hi> 4. I find them, (<hi>scoffingly telling
of the</hi> Rabbies of the Quakers) to inherit the
Subtilty, as well as Heresie, of the <hi>Arians</hi> and
<hi>Socinians,</hi> who were the most subtil and hardest to

the Quakers do defend themselves with the same
distinctions, and even add to their Arts.</p>
            <p>Re. <hi>This Adversary is very much out,
and maliciously calumnious in this his charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Heresie of the</hi> Arians, <hi>as well as</hi>
Socinians, <hi>upon the Ministers among the
Quakers: For what was the Heresie of</hi>
Arius? <hi>Was it not that he held</hi> That the Son
of God had his beginning of nothing? That
there was a time when he was not; That he had
a beginning of Essence; That he had this Essence

hold the quite contrary both to <hi>Arius</hi> and

            <p>

Conceits.</p>
            <p>2. The spiritual Authority of the true

great Authority is this? but one of <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s
abusive Pamphlets, which is fully answer'd,
and his Abuses detected over and over;
which this partial Adversary takes no notice
of.</p>
            <p>That some of these called Quakers, were
at first Common-wealth's Men, or for a
Common-wealth, and afterward for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
when it pleased God by his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
Power and Providence to cause such

That the Quakers are against their being
concerned in Fighting, and destroying Men's

them all, both <hi>Presbyter, Anabaptist, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. how plainly soever
they have approved themselves Protestants,
averse to Popery, and as Dissenting-Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
are tolerated; it appears how greatly
he envies their Liberties, and is displeased
with the Government for granting the same.
Oh rare Son of the Church! Will nothing
satisfie this Incendiary, but Persecution and
Ruin to Dissenting-Protestants? May not
such his Work be very grateful to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

does he shew himself to the Protestants?</p>

chiefly from the Church of <hi>Rome. Labadee,</hi>
a Jesuit, set it up in <hi>Holland;</hi> and <hi>Robert
Barclay</hi> the Quaker, was tinctured in his younger
Years, in the Scotch Convent at <hi>Paris;</hi> and
<hi>John Vaughton</hi> was a Roman Catholick, who is
now a great Preacher among the Quakers in
<hi>London;</hi> and (<hi>he adds in his Errata)
William Southby,</hi> a Preacher now among them
in <hi>Pensilvania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> These this obscure Accuser brings as
Instances to make good the Title of this
Third Section, which is, <hi>That the Popish
Emissaries first set up Quakerism in</hi> England;
which is an old lying Story, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
as impertinent. And 1st, We deny
that any Jesuit set it up in <hi>Holland,</hi> and are
persuaded many of our Friends there can
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43872:38"/>
testifie the contrary. 2. Whatever the
Educations of the said <hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>J. V.</hi> were in
their Youth, as to Religion, they were none
of the first Promoters of Quakerism (as he
calls it) in <hi>England,</hi> by many Years.
3. And suppose the One was tinctured, and
the other was a Roman Catholick, this
makes for us; that was not since they were
Quakers, but before they turned Quakers;
and then when they did, they turned from
Papists and Popery in Testimony against it,
and against human Traditions and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and for the Holy Spirit's Teaching
and Worship of God in Spirit and
Truth.</p>

on purpose to bring Men back to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by these
Steps. First, the Infallibility was placed by
<hi>G. Fox</hi> and all the Primitive Quakers, in every
single Quaker.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> These are envious and false Aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to render us infamous, obnoxious and
offensive. 1. We positively deny any such
Contrivance, Design or Purpose. 2. We
deny that <hi>G. F.</hi> and all the Primitive Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
place Infallibility in a single Person,
like Papists, or in every single Quaker with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distinction, but in the Spirit of Truth,
which assures us in Matters of Faith and
Salvation. The Man often sillily scoffs at
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43872:38"/>
the Quaker's Infallibility, but does not truly
state their Principle in that Case.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> This is a great Untruth: We damn
none to Hell; 'tis Men's own Wickedness
(in hating the Light) which carries them
to Hell. We believe there were many

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43872:39"/>
giving those peculiar Titles of Christ to our
selves, or to one another; and <hi>Bugg</hi> has
been charged therewith, and cannot prove
them. <hi>G. Fox</hi> is not so much as mentioned
in that Epistle of <hi>E. Burroughs,</hi> out of which

and mis-represented against the
Quakers: They do not so make their Souls
of the same Person and Substance with God.
I know no such Expressions used by the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
            <p>2. There's a mis-understanding also of
<hi>G. F.</hi> in the Case about his questioning, Is
not that a part of God which came out from
God, and of his Being? as God breathed
into Man the Breath of Life, and he (<hi>i. e.</hi>
Man) became a living Soul; to which
Words <hi>G. F.</hi> expresly refers. We always
understood him to intend, That this Breath
of Life, which made Man a living Soul,
was that divine Breath, or Spirit of Life,
which came out from God and of his own
Being; for otherwise how should Man
thereby become a living Soul? Which clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distinguisheth the Creature Man to be
that living Soul, that was so made by that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43872:40"/>
Spirit, Breath and Life which proceeded
from his Creator, and which some term
the Soul of the Soul. So that the Soul of
Man, abstractly considered, was as truly
created as Man himself; tho' that divine
Inspiration, or Breath of Life, whereby the
Soul had its Being, Life and Immortality,
be Increated and of God himself; for we
ever distinguished between the Soul of Man,
and that which saves it.</p>

               <hi>Sn. p. 69. Sect.</hi> 10. As they place Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in every single Quaker, so they confine it
not to Matters of Faith, but extend it to all
Persons and Things, to know all Men's Hearts
and all Things in the World by their inward
Light without, being told by any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> Here's a great Mistake in these Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations.
1. Such a personal Infallibility as
to know all Persons, States and Things in
the World, we pretend not to; for that
were for Man to pretend <hi>Omnisciency,</hi> which
is only proper to Almighty God: The Man's
egregiously out in confounding <hi>Infallibility</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:43872:40"/>
with <hi>Omnisciency.</hi> The <hi>Infallibility</hi> or <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
own'd by us, originally is in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Light of Truth given by Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and not consisting in Persons, their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
or natural Parts; yet we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
to the Glory of God, that the Spirit
of Truth, doth infallibly teach and lead
them into all Truth, who truly obey it,
and gives them certain knowledge in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith and Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sn. p.</hi> 81. They turn and wind this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of theirs at such a rate, that no Man can
(I am sure I cannot) know what they mean by
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> Where's then the Blasphemy? Here's
manifest Contradiction to what he hath said
before, about extending the <hi>Quaker's Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
to all Persons and Things, and to know
all Mens Hearts and all things in the World,</hi> &amp;c.
which is to pretend to Omnisciency, which is
only proper to God who only is Omniscient.
Silence had better become this occult Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary's
Ignorance, than to reproach or vilifie
us about what he knows not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sn p.</hi> 83, 84. The Strength which God has
given to our Bodies, is as sufficient to climb up
to the Skies, as the Wisdom or Light which he
has given to our Souls was sufficient, of it self,
to have found out the redemption of lost Man,
by the Incarnation and Satisfaction of Christ to
God's Justice for our Sins; or if found out, to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43872:41"/>
have paid that Price, and to have accomplished
that whole wonderful Oeconomy of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by our own Abilities; <hi>and then he goes
on thus confusedly</hi>) so very insufficient is the
Light within us, even tho' followed to the utmost
by its own Strength to carry us to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> This is to deny any divine Wisdom,
Light, Word or Power to be given to our
Souls, as if they could live and immortally
subsist without the divine <hi>Logos,</hi> or Word
in them, which in Scripture is called, The
Ingrafted Word which is <hi>able</hi> to save the
Soul, and consequently to carry us to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
'tis therefore great Darkness to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the sufficiency of this Light, this Word
or Christ within, or to oppose his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Sufferings, Satisfaction, or our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
obtained by him, as our Mediator,
to this his own inward Light, Power and
Appearance; for as truly as Christ Jesus,
as our blessed Mediator, has obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Redemption and Salvation for us, so
truly doth Christ Jesus, by his Light, Life
and Power, make us Partakers of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and Salvation, and to know the
Oeconomy, Law or Rule of his House and
Family, as we obey him therein, that we
being reconciled by his Death might be
saved by his Life. The divine <hi>Logos,</hi> the
Light or Spirit of Christ, is as able now to
discover what Christ hath done and suffered
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43872:41"/>
for our Redemption, as it was to shew the
Prophets his Sufferings, and the Glory that
should follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sn. p.</hi> 84. And therefore the Quakers preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the sufficiency of the Light within (as all
of them but the Separatists do) is not only highly
derogatory to the satisfaction paid by Christ for
our Sins, but it is blasphemous, in ascribing to
<hi>Our Selves</hi> a Power sufficient to work out our
own Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> There are two gross Mistakes in these
Passages. 1. The sufficiency we ascribe to
Christ, his Light and Life within, is not
any derogation to his Satisfaction, Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Ransom given and paid by him
(without us) for Sins and Sinners, no more
than Christ's own exhorting Men <hi>To believe
in the Light, that they might become Children of
the Light;</hi> or the Apostle's, to <hi>a receiving the
ingrafted Word which was able to save the Souls,</hi>
could be derogatory to his blessed intention
and end in his Suffering and Sacrifice for
Mankind; but the contrary, Christ by his
Light and Life within leads to know and
experience the same, <hi>i. e.</hi> our effectual
Cleansing and actual Deliverance from Sin
and Satan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he has obtained for
us and for Mankind, by his Sufferings and
Mediation. 2. We never ascribed to <hi>our
selves</hi> a Power sufficient to work out our
own Salvation, that's notoriously known to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43872:42"/>
be expresly contrary to our professed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple:
We ascribe our sufficiency to be in
Christ by his own Power, Grace and Light
in us to work out our Salvation, it being by
Grace, through Faith in Christ, that we are
saved, not of our selves; 'tis the Gift of God,
and without him we can do nothing. And
this Heavenly Treasure, though we have it
in our earthen Vessels, the excellency of the
Power is of God and not of us.</p>
            <p>After his many Scoffs at our Doctrin of
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> which he knows not what to
make of, he has at length stumbl'd upon an
Instance of those he esteems will be found to
have the best Title to it, <hi>p.</hi> 85. where it is
written, <hi>Prov. 16. 10. A divine Sentence is
in the Lips of the King, and his Mouth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth
not in Judgment.</hi> We would ask him,
If none are indued with a divine Sentence
and unerring Judgment but Kings? Or, if
none are Saints and Partakers of the Spirit
of Truth or divine Wisdom, but Kings?
What kind of Kings he means that are thus
<hi>infallible,</hi> he does not distinguish; sure they
must be just and good Kings indued with
divine Wisdom: But are none else so but
Kings? Do not all that truly fear God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the same Spirit and Wisdom? Is
God any respecter of Persons? What does
he think of those <hi>very Elect,</hi> whom Christ
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43872:42"/>
implies 'tis impossible to deceive, <hi>Mat.</hi>
24. 24. Are they fallible or deceivable? Or
of them in whose Mouths was found no
Guile? Or of them who have put <hi>away all
Guile, and all Malice, and all Lying, and all
Hypocrisie,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. Are such led by
an infallible Spirit or no? But to proceed,
he has some very scurrilous and abusive
Flings at <hi>G. W.</hi> to prove him not led by an
infallible Spirit of discerning or true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>p.</hi> 87. He quotes <hi>G. W.'s Charitable
Essay, in Answer to</hi> Fr. Bugg, <hi>p.</hi> 6. his
objecting against <hi>G. F.</hi> That they (the
Quakers) could discern who were <hi>Saints,</hi>
and who <hi>Apostates, without speaking ever a
Word.</hi> And says that <hi>he</hi> (G. W.) <hi>puts it off
ingeniously thus, That they could discern it by
their lofty Looks, wanton and scornful Eyes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
and fallen Countenances, and so without
speaking ever a Word,</hi> p. 87. And then,
among divers other Scoffs and Flouts, goes
on; <hi>Is not this very hard Fishing for Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</hi>
Adding, <hi>Alas! poor</hi> George, <hi>Is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Quaker <hi>dwindled down</hi> to a meer Gypsie
or paltry Fortune-teller, to nothing but a little
Skill in Physiognomy? Ah!</hi> George, <hi>what a

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:43872:43"/>
To all which it may be safely answer'd,
This Scorner's Abuse and Perversion is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
very evident; for that we do not place
our Infallibility of discerning of Spirits,
only upon those outward Signs in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances
of wicked Men or Women, as
their lofty Looks, scornful Eyes, envious
fallen Countenances; though these were in
part instanced, in Answer to the great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment
made of knowing wicked Hearts
when silent, to shew there are other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Signs and Tokens to manifest them by,
than their wicked Words or prophane
Talk, and even such Signs as Scripture takes
notice of. And seeing this Scorner has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
perverted and minced the Passage
quoted, <hi>Char. Essay,</hi> p. 5, 6. 'tis meet to
recite it more fully, for the Quakers hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Spirit given to them, beyond all the
Fore-fathers in the Apostacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> viz.
<q>That the very intent and meaning of
<hi>G. F.</hi>'s Words herein, was not beyond
all the Fore-fathers without exception,
but beyond all in the Apostacy. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and they can discern who are
Saints and who are Devils, and who are
Apostates, without speaking ever a word;
that is, they that be in the Power and
Life of Truth (as <hi>G. F.</hi> there saith) can
so discern between Saints and Devils;
and that's possible, as 'tis for humble
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43872:43"/>
Men to discern wicked Persons, even by
their proud and lofty Looks, wanton
and scornful Eyes, envious and fallen
Countenances, the shew of whose Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teannces
testifing against them: And more
especially by the <hi>Gift of discerning of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
given to some in the Church of
Christ, Apostates and wicked Spirits are
discernible from Saints; and that a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Vnderstanding and Discerning</hi> is given
among us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> concluding with the
Saints Right of discerning by the <hi>Power
and Life of Truth,</hi> between Saints and
Devils.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From all which, pray observe how plain
it is that discerning of Spirits, which we
assert, is principally placed on (and springs
from) <hi>the Power and Life of Truth</hi> (that is,
from Christ) and the Gift of discerning of
Spirits given to some Members especially,
(and still is continued) in the true Church;
and from which <hi>discerning,</hi> Satan cannot be
hid, however he transform himself; altho'
proud and lofty Looks, wanton and scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eyes, envious and fallen Countenances,
are rendred in Scripture as outward Signs
or Marks of such wicked Hearts, which also
the Gift and Spirit of discerning perceiveth;
and gives to see many times through such
outward <hi>Mediums.</hi> And therefore the <hi>true
discerning of Spirits,</hi> which we plead for, is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43872:44"/>
neither dwindled down to a meer <hi>Gypsie</hi> nor
<hi>paltry</hi> Fortune-teller, nor to nothing but a
<hi>little Jugler's Skill in Physiognomy,</hi> as this
scornful Adversary reflects. And to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
his Reproach and Blasphemy herein,
and shew him that both God, and good Men
divinely inspired, have also taken notice of
such Signs, Marks and Tokens in wicked
Men's Looks and Countenances, as before
mentioned, Let him read and consider
these places of Scripture, <hi>Gen. 4. 5, 6. Psal.
10. 4. Isa.</hi> 3. 9, 16. &amp; 2. 11. &amp; 5. 15.
<hi>Psal. 131. 1. Prov.</hi> 30. 13. &amp; 6. 17. &amp; 21. 4.
And he may see that both God Himself,
and his Prophets and Servants, took notice
of wicked Men's <hi>Countenances, proud and lofty
Looks, and wanton Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. and did not
therefore deserve to be numbred among
<hi>Gypsies and Juglers.</hi> Behold the Levity and
Ignorance of this prophane Scoffer <hi>of the
Spirit of discerning and Scripture!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who further in's scoffing Humour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
against</hi> G. W. <hi>notoriously to detect his
Infallibility by Signs and Faces, as well as</hi>
G. Fox<hi>'s without speaking ever a word (as
he pretends.) His Story is about one</hi> Chr.
Athinson<hi>'s</hi> miscarriage at <hi>Norwich,</hi> in the
Year, 1655. from <hi>Richard Hubberthorn</hi>'s
writing, That in the wisdom of God we were
searching it out, and in his Will waiting for his
Counsel. <hi>The Scoffer reflects,</hi> That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43872:44"/>
all this, neither <hi>G. Fox, G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
nor any other of the infallible Gang could
find it out, till <hi>Chr. Atkinson,</hi> prickt with the
stings of his own Conscience, did freely and of
his own accord confess it, and sign'd a Paper of
Condemnation of himself for this wicked Fact,
<hi>p. 90, 91, 92. Sect.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>And what of all this? What can he make
of it? That the then Quakers could not find
out the Matter of Fact, till upon their
searching it out and waiting in the Will of
God for his Counsel, the Offender was made
to confess it, from inward Conviction in's
own Conscience? And what's the consequence?
Therefore they were not led by an infallible
Spirit; that follows not. That Spirit
might lead them to search and examine the
Offender, in order to bring him under
Judgment and Sense of his Evil, which they
understood before, and upon Examination
and placing true Judgment upon him, were
made instrumental to bring him under Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Confession; for some discovery of
his Crime was made before, which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
their farther Enquiry and Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the reproach thereof from falling upon
Truth and our Friends that were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
Besides, <hi>G. W.</hi> was not at <hi>Norwich</hi>
when this Miscarriage hapned and was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
yet he affirms, that sometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
both he and some others perceived
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43872:45"/>
that the said <hi>C. Atkinson</hi>'s Spirit was wrong,
and that he did not live in the fear of God,
nor in Humility, and that they were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
concerning him, and did seriously
caution him; but he was too high to receive
their Counsel, insomuch that they were
jealous Truth would suffer by him some way
or other, tho' they pretended not to know
the Grossness of his Miscarriage aforehand,
nor till some discovery was made thereof;
neither were they (or are we) desirous to
know all private Conversations and Actions
of evil Men. We pretend not to know by
Revelation, or the infallible Spirit, how
many drunken Priests are in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.
nor how many of them have had their Misses,
and Bastards by their Maids and others;
nor who they all are by Name; but by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Relation we have had account of a
great many such, tho' we charge not all, nor
any of the eminent ones, who are more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
than the rest. And if this scornful
Adversary shall therefore conclude that we
have not the Spirit of Christ (which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible)
he might as well conclude, no Man
has it, because not omniscient; which were
very absurd and blasphemous. And then
be sure he has excluded himself from having
that infallible Spirit of Christ, and so is none
of his, and consequently destroyed the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of all his own Work against us; as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43872:45"/>
having followed his own Spirit (dictated
by Satan) as the false and lying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
did, and not the Spirit of the Lord

               <hi>To his scurrilous Story of</hi> more tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
shewed to some young Women who had
given a Confession in Writing to <hi>John Bolton,</hi>
of their frailty in the Flesh, as is told in the
Spirit of the Hat; but it was hush'd up because
it touched many eminent ones in the Ministry,
who from Day to Day resorted unto them, <hi>&amp;c.
p. 95, 96. Sect.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>This is a sligh insinuating way of impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
scandalizing Persons by such old en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Stories, and all to cast Dirt not only
upon some private Persons, but even upon
<hi>many eminent ones of the Ministry,</hi> without
telling us the Names either of the Men or
Women charged. At this rate many honest
Persons, who are of good Fame also, may
be very injuriously brought under suspicion
of great Enormity and Scandal. But let
this Adversary, who is so very credulous of
such infamous Stories, come forth and shew
himself, and be more plain and particular
in his Charge, as of the Persons and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact charged, together with the said
Confession of the Women; and probably
he may have a more direct Answer: For his
suspicious Charge, as it is exhibited by him,
appears a very blind Story, which we can
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43872:46"/>
make neither Head nor Tail of. And the
<hi>Spirit of the Hat</hi> did then prejudicially and
blindly bring it forth; which 'tis hoped the
Author hath repented of long before this
time.</p>
            <p>But this Opposer should look and examin
among his own Brethren, and remember
that <hi>the Incontinency of Priests</hi> is no new
thing; for there is an old penal Statue-Law,
1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 4. <q>made against Priests, Clerks
and religious Men for <hi>Incontinency,</hi> being
duly convicted of <hi>Advoutry, Fornication,
Incest,</hi> or any other fleshly Incontinency,
to be punished by the Ordinary by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
according to the quantity and
quality of the Trespass.</q> If this Law be
obsolete and not put in Execution, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
suppose 'tis because all the Priests are
reformed and clear of that Enormity in
these Days. However, they would not all
be charged with the Faults of some.</p>

sufficient to cure Men of this most mistaken pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to Infallibility, grounded upon the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Spirit of God, as if nothing could

            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> 1. We know no mistaken pretence to
Infallibility, that's grounded on the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of the Spirit of God; for 'tis an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
unerring Spirit in all its Gifts,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43872:46"/>
Teachings, Operations and Fruits, and leads
the truly spiritual-minded into all Truth;
and no other Spirit can we ground Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
in Matters of Faith or Duty, upon.

proceeds from this Spirit of Truth, but

belong to every One of them in particular.</p>
            <p>

on't: True Prophets were not to suffer,
nor to be branded for the false Prophet's
Falshood and Presumption. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.

asserted to belong to every one, or any of
us, than as we are led by the Spirit of
Truth and taught thereby, a Manifestation
whereof is given to every one to profit
withal. But we do not therefore grant, that
every (or any) false Prophet, belongs to us

true Fear and Watchfulness (as the

the Enemy prevailed to hurry him (by the

a Person with the Fact, for which he has
been reprehended and testified against; and
we desire the Lord may truly humble that
Person unto true Repentance. Is it just to
reproach all for this one Man's Offence?
Would this Accuser be so dealt by, from
the gross Miscarriages of many of his
esteemed reverend Brethren of the Clergy?
Or because some of them have run Mad,
would he and the rest be so deemed? We

that which is written, who break the Vnity of the

Persecution, to be his Vice-gerents;
and therefore cannot in Conscience hold
Communion with them, or with that

the Denyers thereof? See what follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sn. p. 115. Sect.</hi> 10. Tho' God sent many
Prophets to reprove the Kings and the Priests,
yet they neither rebelled against the Kings, nor
set up opposite Altars against those of those wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Priests: But AS they paid all dutiful Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to their persecuting Kings, and suffered
Martyrdom under them without resistance; SO
did they always keep in the Communion of those
same Priests, whom they had provok'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,
and paid all due Obedience to their sacred
Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Re.</hi> 1st. That God sent Prophets to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the wickedness of Kings and Priests,
and the Covteousness, Idolatry, Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Persecution of corrupt and polluted
Priests, is true; and that true Prophets pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
suffered by both. 2. But that the
true Prophets did always keep <hi>in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
of those same corrupted, polluted
and wicked Priests, whom they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
(as asserted) we deny; for the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43872:49"/>
Holy Prophets had a distinct, pure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
from that of the polluted Priests.
3. 'Tis no better than a piece of Popery
thus to plead for keeping Communion with
wicked Priests, and Obedience to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as <hi>sacred</hi> (when they have no <hi>divine</hi>
or sacred Authority,) being debased by their
own Iniquity. This is to make People
Vassals to a corrupt Priesthood, such as the
holy Prophets testified against, and as God
overthrew, for their Covetousness, Idolatry
and Wickedness; the great Corruption of
Priests, is sufficient cause to dissent and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate

Persons; and therefore, the Judgment
against such a Self-separation is not against
the Light, but against a Fruit of the Flesh

this is all still but one and the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible

away from the Letter.</p>
            <p>

that Text, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. altogether literally;
if cleansing from all Sin, be a spiritul and
inward Work or Act, as no doubt it is,
there's as much ascribed to the Spirit as to
the Blood, in respect to the Work of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
Washing and Cleansing from

may be both taken spiritually and literally;
and this is not to spiritualize away the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

To what he saith in distinction between

and against them, who have often affirmed
that Book to be the <hi>Word,</hi> in opposition to
our owning Christ to be the Word, of
whom the Scriptures testifie. And this, on
our part, is no Contempt of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
nor <hi>in their place</hi> any <hi>deifying of our
own Spirit and our own Scriptures,</hi> as this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
most falsly accuseth us, <hi>p.</hi> 152.</p>
            <p>His most seeming pretence for Proof
against us, of <hi>Contempt of Holy Scripture,</hi> is
in p. 142. Sect. 11. where he quotes a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
out of a Book, Entituled, <hi>The Quaker's
Refuge,</hi> &amp;c. thus: <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Whether the
first Pen-man of the Scriptures was <hi>Moses</hi>
or <hi>Hermes?</hi> Or, whether both these are
not one? Or, whether there are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Words contained in the Scriptures,
which were not spoken by Inspiration of
the Holy Spirit? Whether some Words
were not spoken by the grand Impostor;
some by wicked Men; some by wise Men,
ill applied; some by good Men, ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd;
some by false Prophets, and yet
true; some by true Prophets, and yet
false—</q>
            </p>
            <p>And here the Accuser breaks off in his
Citation, like as <hi>F. Bugg</hi> used to deal by us,
who has the same Passage to defame us as he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43872:51"/>
hath done. Whereas next after the Words,
<hi>And yet false,</hi> these follow, <hi>viz. Is not the
Subject of my Argument at this time.</hi> Here
'tis plain the Author <hi>R. R.</hi> has cited these
Questions about the Scriptures, not as the
Subject of his own Argument, but of some
others; he would not then be concerned to
dispute those Questions or Doubts. For
the said Author farther confesseth, <q>That
such Scriptures and Prophesies as have
been written and prophesied by the Holy
Men of God, as they were moved by his
Spirit, treating of the Mystery of God
in the Redemption and Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
by Jesus Christ, and the Duty of
Man in his Obedience to, and Worship
of the same God, as his reasonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
for the Gift of so great Salvation
are the great Concerns now under our
most serious Consideration.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it's clear the Author was no
Contemner of Holy Scripture; and 'tis
clear, the Subject of his Argument was for
the Authority of the Holy Spirit, in judging
or discerning the Mind of God in the Holy
Scriptures, as truly own'd by the Quakers,
thus in the said Book, <hi>Quaker's Refuge,</hi> p. 17.
which could not intend any Contempt of
the Holy Scriptures; much less a <hi>deifying
either of our own Spirit (i. e.</hi> the Spirit of
Man) or <hi>our own Writings in their place.</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:43872:51"/>
We have rarely ever met with more mad,
unlikely and improbable Aspersions than
these, from our most outragious Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</p>
            <p>To what is objected, p. 155. Sect. 11.
<hi>viz. That they (i. e.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>cannot be
bound by any Command in the Scriptures, unless
their Spirit anew require the same.</hi> This is
falsly stated; 'tis not our own Spirit (<hi>i. e.</hi>
the Spirit of Man abstractly) that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to be under the Conduct of, but the same
Spirit which gave forth the Holy Scriptures.
And is not awanting to require of us the
performance of its own necessary Commands
and Doctrins contained in the Scriptures,
seeing 'tis the same Spirit which leads it's
sincere Followers into all Truth; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not to undervalue any of those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Truths recorded in the Holy Scriptures.
And therefore this Adversary's Consequence
intended against us, <hi>viz. That the Scripture
remains of no Authority with us,</hi> p. 155. is
very unjust, being deduced from his own
false Suggestions, supposing us to set the
Spirit in opposition to the Scriptures of
Truth, whereas we plead for the divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Holy Scriptures, in so much
preferring the Holy Spirit from whence
they proceeded and derive their Authority,
and not from Human Tradition. And
this is far from <hi>spiritualizing away</hi> all the

Letter of the Scripture, or <hi>Christ's Humanity,</hi>
as in p. 166. as we are often unjustly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed.</p>

               <hi>To what he saith,</hi> p. 168. That Enthusiasts
have no Principles; they have no Rule but their

and this they mistake for Inspiration; and then
their Madness is at the height.</p>
            <p>We say, take Enthusiasm in the truest
and best Sense, and then such are inspired
of God; and by his Inspiration, have a
true Understanding and right Principles
given them, both Divine and Moral, and
do not mistake <hi>Fancy</hi> for <hi>Divine Inspiration.</hi>
But to whom does the Man apply this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm
which he renders <hi>Fancy,</hi> more
strong in <hi>mad Men</hi> and height of <hi>Madness?</hi>
In his next Page 'tis to the Quakers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He says,</hi> No Quaker can deny but that the
Principle of the Quakers is all Enthusiasm.
There never was any Enthusiasm in the World
that exceeded it, <hi>p. 169. Sect.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Here he seems to take <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> in the
Quaker's Sense, which is Divine Inspiration
or <hi>inspired of God;</hi> which sure cannot be
<hi>meer Fancy,</hi> much less the height of <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
(as before.) The Quakers certainly
deny this of themselves: Thus the Man's
confused in's injurious Attempts to defame
us with the <hi>height of Madness.</hi>

               <hi>His Objection against the Quaker's</hi> Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm,
(<hi>as he calls it</hi>) That none that ever
called themselves Christians have advanced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so high, to have the same infallible Spirit
and immediate Revelation as the Prophets and
Apostles, or as Christ himself, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 169.</p>
            <p>Herein he's greatly out: All true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are Partakers of the Spirit of Christ
in some degree or measure; for he that hath
not the Spirit of Christ is none of his, and
his Spirit is infallible; and a Manifestation
of the same Spirit is given to every Man to
profit withal, and the Effusion of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
upon all Flesh was promised; and we
believe the Promises of God, which are
all <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in Christ Jesus. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this our Adversary, who is so much
averse to having the same infallible Spirit,
and so opposite to Infallibility, is none of
Christ's, consequently no Christian. And
he does but follow his own <hi>fallible</hi> Spirit,
(being prompted on by the Father of Lies)
in what he writes against us, consequently
of no Credit therein; so like one of those
false Prophets that follow their own Spirits,
and see nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then severely to aggravate the Matter
against us</hi> poor Madmen (<hi>in his esteem) he'll
needs have it,</hi> That the height of our Self-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
is to be equal even to God; to be one
Person, Substance and Soul with God: <hi>And he</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:43872:53"/>
does not think that any Human Government can
be secure of Men, in whose Power it is to screw
themselves up to such blasphemous heights of
Enthusiasm, <hi>p.</hi> 169, 170.</p>
            <p>We Answer; 'Tis better to be mad Men
and Fools, than to be screwed up by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Lies to such a height of Malice and
Outrage, as this insulting and railing <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shekah</hi>
appears to be puft up in. When did
ever the Quakers so advance themselves, <hi>to
be one Person, Substance, Soul with God, and
equal even to God?</hi> We positively deny the
Charge, and the Words themselves (but
only as we are united or joined to the Lord
we are one Spirit) and give this Person leave
to secure such Persons in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> if he can
find any among us, that he can plainly prove
to hold the same as he charges. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his insinuating such presumptuous Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
against the Quakers in general, to
render them so highly obnoxious, and the
Government insecure of them; this is
highly and deadly malicious; and he might
as well have taken one Step further to have
shewn his Teeth, and have told the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
what he would have done with the
Quakers; how he would have them dealt
with to be secure of them; whether he
would have them closely Confin'd, Hang'd
or Banish'd; for take our Word, his Charge
is very high against them, and implies no
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43872:53"/>
small Reflection upon the Civil Government,
for so kindly suffering and indulging such
extreamly pernicious mad Folks, as he has
over and over rendred the Quakers; which
serves but to evince the Folly of his own
Fury and Madness, against a peaceable inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

it out.</p>
            <p>As for the Term <hi>Prelacy</hi> 'tis his own,
given in his Scorn and Ignorance. As for
our Womens Meetings, what has the
Scorner against them or their Services, more
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43872:54"/>
than his own Ignorance and Scorn? We
know Them and their Help and Service to
be truly Christian and Charitable, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to be of the Lord; their Intent and
Service being to be helpful in their Places,
for promoting true Christian Charity and
Religion in Life and Practice, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
with regard to Fatherless and Widows
among us, that they may not be neglected,
but Visited and Ministred unto in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
for their necessary Relief and
Comfort. And these Meetings are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
and convenient for Intelligence
among them, of such Objects of Charity
and Compassion. There were <hi>Deaconesses,</hi>
as well as <hi>Deacons,</hi> in the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches.</p>
            <p>4. This Church-man has no reason to
deride or contemn our Women's Meetings;
we charge not his Church with our Poor,
tho' we help to Relieve the Poor of his

            <p>In Sect. 12. concerning the Light within.
<q>That the Light which lightneth every
Man coming into the World, being the
divine Word the Son of God, is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Reason or Conscience, but above
both and enlightneth both,</q> is true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43872:54"/>
divine and universally in every Man;
and therefore we do not by Virtue of this
Light, <hi>advance our selves above all Mankind,
nor damn all but our selves,</hi> as is falsly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
against us, <hi>p.</hi> 171. But as we are
turned and converted from Darkness unto
this Light, the Lord hath advanced us above
what we our selves were in our natural and
unconverted State, and above all others
who yet remain in that state. To the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>Whether a Man can sin while he follows
this Light?</hi> p. 172. <hi>Answ.</hi> No, nor in his
truly following it. And that he <hi>cannot leave
the Light,</hi> without knowing it or being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with Judgment and Conviction
thereof by the Light, is true also. Whence
it does not follow <hi>that there can be no Sin of
Ignorance,</hi> as is wrongfully inferred, <hi>p.</hi> 173.
For there are Sins of Ignorance before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
and Conversion, whilst Men walk
in Darkness, being ignorant of the Light
that shines in it, and their Minds estranged
from it; but after convicted, or Conversion
in measure, if they backslide in Heart and
leave the Light, they cannot be left alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ignorant of their backsliding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they shall be left without Excuse, who
either through their impenitent hard Hearts
treasure up Wrath to themselves, or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slide
in Heart, or wilfully sin until judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
hardned, after they have received the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43872:55"/>
knowledge of the Truth. 1. Because of
God's universal Call and Visitation by his
Light and Free Grace in Christ to Sinners.
2. Because of his swiftly pursuing the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all them that forsake him, by his
Spirit of Judgment: For these, and other
Causes, they are all inexcusable before him,
and the Light will pursue them even to Hell,
as it did the rich Man when in Hell he lift
up his Eyes, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 23, 28. To what
our Opposer objects from these Scriptures,
<hi>Luke 23. 34. John 16. 2. 2 Thess. 2. 11. Mat.
6. 23. Acts 3. 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 8. thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
against the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Light
within, and saying, <hi>There can be no such
Mistake as our Saviour supposes,</hi> (Mat. 6. 23.)
<hi>If the Light within be infallible, and that every
Man has it, and that no Man can leave it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing of it,</hi> p. 174. To all which we
Answer, That some Men's Ignorance of
their Master's Will, others wrong Thoughts,
others being given up to strong Delusion to
believe a Lie, others greatly mistaking
Darkness for Light (and then how great is
that Darkness of theirs?) These can be no
Proofs against the Infallibility of the Light
it self, nor of the Light within being falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but of their own Transgression, Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
and Rebellion against the Light;
<hi>Who know not the ways of the Light, because
they abide not in the Paths of it,</hi> Job 24. 13.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43872:55"/>
And though there's no Sin against the Light
or Backsliding from it, without some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
at one time or other, yet 'tis possible
for some to presume to sin, rebel and shut
their Eyes so long, until they become stark
blind and hardned in sinning and past feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Rebellion, and given over to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Heart and to strong Delusion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a Lie, and so to Damnation and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
yet however clouded all this
while, the Light in them remains in it self
pure, certain, and an infallible swift Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against the Rebellious, who love Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and the Works thereof, rather than
the Light which is come into the World.
Mens thinking themselves to be in the <hi>right</hi>
when mistaken, <hi>p.</hi> 174, 175. (having their
Understandings darkned) will not destroy
all (or any of) the Quakers certainty
which they have in the true Light, as they
believe and walk therein.</p>
            <p>P. 176, 177. It was hard for <hi>Saul</hi> to Kick
against the Pricks; <hi>and that is against the
Power of Christ, which would be too hard for
him, if he strove against it,</hi> as is confest:
No doubt that Power reached his Conscience
when awakened and convicted, consequently
those Pricks which that gave him were then
in him; and that Power or Holy Ghost
which <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Persecutors and <hi>Saul</hi> also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
(when he kept their Garments while
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43872:56"/>
they stoned him and consented to his Death)
was near them to convict and condemn
them for their Persecution and Cruelty,
but their Fury, Wrath and Violence, would
not permit them to adhere or submit to the
strivings thereof, for they <hi>always resisted the
same Holy Spirit as did their Fathers,</hi> Acts 7. 51.
Which Resistance of theirs implies the
Spirit's secretly striving with them and
giving Counsel against their Wickedness and
Cruelty; for how can there be always a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
that which either is not, or moves
not, or counsels not? O therefore the same
Holy Spirit and Light of it, was in them
in some measure moving and striving with
them, to persuade, stop and reclaim them
from those destructive Courses and Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they had chosen. And here we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
how he excuses the <hi>Ministry, where
People are not converted by it,</hi> he deems it <hi>a
very bad Argument to blame the Ministry; for
Mens being Evil may proceed from their own
Perversness, and not from the Fault of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi>
Pref. p. 57. May we not retalliate
such Argument for the Light within, <hi>That
'tis a very bad Argument that the Light within
is either insufficient or fallible, because Men are
Evil, or blind or mistaken?</hi> Which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from their own Disobedience or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness,
and not from any defect or fault
in the Light given them. And when <hi>Saul</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:43872:56"/>
thought with himself that he ought to do
many things contrary to the Name of Jesus
of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and was zealous in persecuting
and imprisoning the Christians, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mad against them, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9, 10. 11.
This was in his blind deceived State, when
a Follower of the persecuting Priests, and
the more blinded by such blind Guides as
hate the true Light and oppose it; <hi>For,</hi> as
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I persecuted this way unto the Death,
binding and delivering into Prison both Men and
Women,</hi> Acts 22. 4. <hi>For many of the Saints I
shut up in Prison, having received Authority of
the High Priests, and when they were put to
Death, I gave my Sentence,</hi> Acts 26. 10. So
that the Priests were very ill Instruments to
influence and misguide him in Persecution
and Cruelty, contrary to the Light; such
his Blindness, Madness and injurious Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
against the Saints, to Imprisonment
and Death, being expresly contrary to the
Law of God without them and within them,
in Scripture and Conscience. Will any be
so blind, as to suppose God did not afford
them so much Light, as to shew them such
gross Iniquities and Injuries to others who
were innocent? How impertinent and sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
then is the Man's Question, <hi>viz. Had</hi>
Paul <hi>then any Pricks of Conscience, or of his
Light within against the lawfulness of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was fully persuaded and zealous?</hi> p. 177.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43872:57"/>
No doubt he had so much Light in him, as
would both have prickt him for, and shewn
the Unlawfulness of his Persecution and
Cruelty against the Saints, if he would have
inclined his Mind to it for Counsel, and not
to the Priests who encouraged him in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
against the Christians, which they
persuaded him to, and not the Light. They
helped to make him so mad against the
Saints as he was; but Christ the Light, whose
Power prickt him, made him wise when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;
and tho' 'tis possible that in his
Hurry and Fury to Persecution, he might
not at that very instant feel the Pricks of
the Light in's Conscience, yet it swiftly
pursued him and seiz'd him, when Christ
had wonderfully put a stop to him and his
Letters and Errand from the High Priests to
persecute the Saints. Tho' the Candle of the
Wicked may be many times put out, 'tis
lighted again. For how oft is the Candle
of the Wicked put out? How oft is Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon him? If it be often put out, 'tis
often lighted. And therefore all these things
seriously consider'd, we do not see it any
hard Matter to make sense of the <hi>Quakers
Notion</hi> (as he calls it) of the Light within,
nor that this Instance of St. <hi>Paul can stand
as any irrefragable</hi> (or other) <hi>Proof against
it;</hi> or, our Testimony for that true Light
which inlightens every Man coming into
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43872:57"/>
the World, <hi>John</hi> 1. 4, 9. Because many
are blinded by the persecuting and covetous
Priests, and many shut their Eyes against
the Light, and many love Darkness rather
than Light, because their Deeds are evil,
and the Candle of the Wicked is often put
out. But they shall all find it hard to Kick
against the Pricks even in their own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
as 'tis confessed even in the English
Annotation, in the Margin, on <hi>Acts 9. 5.
It is hard for thee to Kick against the Pricks,</hi>
i. e. <hi>to resist God when he pricketh and solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
our Consciences;</hi> therefore such prickings
are within.</p>
            <p>All which truly consider'd, 'tis no difficulty
to make Sense of the <hi>Quaker's Notion</hi> (as he
calls it) <hi>of the Light within,</hi> p. 178. seeing
'tis according to the express Sense of Holy
Scripture-Testimony thereof, and the Sense
which the Light gives all them that truly
regard it, Christ being the Light of the
World that inlightens every Man coming
into it, that whosoever believe in his Light
and follow him the Light, might not abide
in Darkness but have the Light of Life, and
become Children of the Light. Neither
doth our Adversary's Instance of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
(or others) stand as any irrefragable Proof
against the Light within, or the Quakers
Notion of it, as he vainly supposeth, p. 178.
Unless it be a good Argument, that because
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43872:58"/>
some Men are blind, and others shut their
Eyes, there's no Sun in the Firmament giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Light into their Houses. We find no
better Proof or Argument from this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
against the Light within, or our Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
thereof; and 'tis far more difficult to
make Sense of his Notion of the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
than of our's: For after he has in Words
owned and confessed to Divine Illumination
or Inspiration of the Holy Spirit, as that
<hi>Enthusiasm or Inspiration of God, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and owned in their Church, and that 'tis
full as much as any sober Quaker can mean by
the Light within,</hi> Pref. from p. 46. to p. 55,
56. Another while he'll have the Light
within <hi>not Infallible,</hi> but Fallible, because of
Men's Mistake, who put Darkness for Light,
p. 173, 174. 2d Part. Another while he'll
have the Light within <hi>no Light,</hi> from <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 20.
placing this Remark upon it, <hi>No Light,
George;</hi> mark that, p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 251. But he should
have observed the Hebrew Note in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
<hi>No Morning,</hi> instead of <hi>No Light,</hi>
which I may return upon him. If they speak
not according to this Word, it is because
there is <hi>No Morning</hi> to them. <hi>No Morning!</hi>
Man; mark that. But is there no Light
before Morning, pray? Now how difficult
is it to make Sense of this Man's Notion of
the Light within? One while with him,
'Tis a Divine Inspiration; another while,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43872:58"/>
'Tis Fallible; another while, No Light:
So that one while 'tis a divine, good and
certain Light; another while uncertain,
not Infallible; another while 'tis nothing,
no Light. Thus confusedly and madly
Envy and Darkness appears against the true
Light.</p>
            <p>This Adversary, to prove his false, reit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrated
black Charge, <hi>That the Quakers
take to themselves the very Attributes of God;
and make a pretence, from this Light within, to
excuse blasphemous Pride, assuming All the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
due to Christ whom they call this Light,
upon the account of his or its Inhabitation in
them,</hi> p. 178. He refers to <hi>G. Whitehoad</hi>'s
<hi>Innocency against Envy,</hi> p. 18. Sect. 12. in
Answer to <hi>F. Bugg, viz.</hi> As to his Charge
of <hi>idolatrous</hi> if not <hi>blasphemous</hi> Names and
Titles given to <hi>G. F.</hi> How proves he that
they (<hi>i.e.</hi> Two Persons in their Letters to
him) gave and intended those Names and
Titles to the Person of <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi> This
Story, in the first part, is notoriously false,
as it affects the Quakers in general. The
last part is a blind Story, as 'tis intended for
Proof of the black Charge before; those
idolatrous Names and Titles are not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
nor any plain Proof of the exact
Copies of both those Letters could we ever
have. And <hi>G. W.</hi> has further cleared this
Matter in another Answer to <hi>F. B.</hi> as also in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43872:59"/>
his <hi>Just Inquiry,</hi> from p. 19. to p. 30.
And in behalf of the People called Quakers,
we positively and sincerely deny; 1. That
they take to themselves the very Attributes
of God. 2. That they excuse blasphemous
Pride, as that of assuming all Worship due
to Christ, because of his inhabiting in them:
These, with Detestation, we solemnly deny.
But this Accuser should have looked at
home, and at his Brethren of the Clergy,
what Honour and Attributes do they give
to their Bishops, when they go down upon
their Knees to them, as their <hi>Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in God,</hi> with <hi>Your Grace, My Lord,</hi> &amp;c.
Do these import Divine Honour and Divine
Attributes, or Earthly, pray? And where
did ever Christ's Ministers or Apostles, do
such Homage to <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus,</hi> or call
either of them my Lord <hi>Timothy,</hi> or my
Lord <hi>Titus,</hi> and Your Grace, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> And what
thinks he of <hi>Godfathers and Godmothers?</hi>
Are not these Divine Attributes, and very
high ones too? And of their being <hi>Sureties</hi>
for Infants, for their forsaking the Devil
and all his Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and keeping God's
holy Will and Commandments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do
they not herein take upon them Christ's
Office and Work, who is our Surety? And
what Scripture have they for these? Answer
directly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:43872:59"/>
'Tis a notorious Untruth also, <hi>That they
(i. e.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>allow of divine Honour to
the Man Christ Jesus, on no other account than
as</hi> G. W. <hi>allows it to</hi> G. Fox; <hi>that is, because
of the residing of the divine Word in him,</hi>
p. 180. We say this is apparently false;
for on divers other Accounts we allow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Honour; and far more Honour to the
Man Christ Jesus, than to any mortal or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Creature whatsoever, as in all things
Christ Jesus hath the Preheminence, and all
Fulness dwelling in him, and all Power in
Heaven and Earth committed to him, and
were not all the Angels of God to worship
him? And all Men to honour the Son, as
they honour the Father? Therefore this
Opposer's blasphemous Consequences drawn
against us, from his black Charge aforesaid,
<hi>As worshipping one another with divine Honour,
and not grudging to apply all the Attributes of
God to themselves for the Light within sake,</hi> &amp;c.
p. 181, 182. with the rest of his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of the same kind, are as false as the
other. We desire ever to walk humbly with
God in Christ Jesus, in a holy Reverence
and Worship to him only, to whom all
divine Worship, Glory and Honour is
due.</p>

he says, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Penn <hi>makes Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense
of it; and worse, he compares it to
Transubstantiation, nay, to the Alcoran;</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Reason against Railing,</hi> 1673. p. 138.
which is a plain Perversion, and as false as
the Charge it self: For <hi>W. Penn</hi> does nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make Nonsense of the Resurrection it
self, scripturally considered, nor compare
it either to Transubstantiation, or to the
Alcoran. But <hi>T. Hick</hi>'s <hi>gross Belief and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of a Carnal or Fleshly Resurrection of
the self-same Carnal Body; and yet that it shall
be so changed, as to be a spiritual glorious Body,
like unto Christ's.</hi> This he compares to the
Doctrin of Transubstantiation, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
say, That the Bread and Wine, after
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43872:60"/>
Conse cration are so changed as to be the very
Christ, and yet the Accidents remain (<hi>i.e.</hi> of
Bread and Wine) so he can't make better Sense
of his Adversary's gross apprehension of the
Resurrection of the Body, being or remaining
the same carnal Body of Flesh, Blood and
Bones that's buried, and yet changed so as
to be a spiritual and glorious Body, like
unto Christ's, which was not to deny the
Scripture-Doctrin of the Resurrection it
self, but rather a carnal Alcoran Notion
thereof; for in the Book quoted <hi>Reason
against Railing,</hi> p. 133. And under the
same Head, take <hi>W. P.</hi>'s plain Confession
of the Resurrection in his own Words,
against his Adversary, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Who can
have the Confidence to call the Scripture
his Rule, and yet contradict it so egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
as when the Apostle tells us, It is
not the same Body that is sown that shall
be, to assert that it is the same Body;
and that who says the contrary, denies
the Resurrection and eternal Recompence,
(which is a very confident Perversion and
Opposition to the Apostle's Doctrin.) In
short, we do acknowledge a Resurrection
in order to eternal Recompence, and
that every Seed shall have its own Body,
and rest contented with what Body it
shall please God to give us (who giveth a
Body as it pleaseth him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.)
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43872:61"/>
But as we are not such Fools as curiously
to enquire what? so must we for ever
deny the gross Conceits of <hi>T. H.</hi> and his
Adherents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And in conclusion of
the same Head, <hi>Reason against Railing,</hi> p. 124.
he saith, <q>For our parts <hi>a Resurrection we
believe, and of Bodies too,</hi> unto Eternal
Life. What they shall not be, I have
briefly said and proved; what they shall
be, we leave with God, who will give
every one a Body as it pleaseth him; and
<hi>Thou Fool</hi> belongs to the unnecessary
Medler.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus 'tis evident <hi>W. P.</hi> did not deny the
Resurrection it self, nor count it Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the gross Conceits of some
Persons about it: Consequently, this Accuser
has charged the Quakers as falsly in this
Point, as in the rest.</p>
            <p>And we know not <hi>Those others</hi> (among us
he tells of) <hi>that suppose the Soul it self is the
spiritual Body mentioned,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 44. <hi>and
consequently that there is no other Resurrection
than at each particular Persons death,</hi> p. 184.
We know none in our Society hold or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
these things; but the contrary, that
the Soul of every Person shall be invested
with its own proper spiritual Body, in the
general Resurrection and last Day. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the true Believers being quicken'd and
raised out of the Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> unto Life,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43872:61"/>
Righteousness and Victory, in and by Jesus
Christ (who is the Resurrection and the
Life). Three things are also observable in
that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. The Apostle argues, 1. for
the Resurrection of the Dead, from the
Resurrection of Christ, against some that
said, <hi>There is no Resurrection of the Dead.</hi>
2. He argues against some, and reprehends
them as <hi>Fools</hi> that questioned <hi>How the Dead
are raised, and with what Bodies do they come
forth?</hi> From the Wheat and other Grain
that's sown, and the difference between the
Celestial and Terrestrial Bodies, and the
Natural Body and the Spiritual. 3. For
those Saints that shall remain alive at the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ to raise the
Dead, that they shall be <hi>changed in a moment,
at the sounding of the last Trumpet of God:</hi>
It's evident that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> fully
answers both those that said there is <hi>No Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
of the Dead, and also those Fools
that question <hi>With what Body do they come
forth?</hi> And asserts the sudden change of
those who shall remain alive until the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Lord from Heaven. So that the
Resurrection of the Dead, and final change
of the Living, so as the Corruptible must
put on Incorruption, and the Mortal shall
put on Immortality. As this Doctrin was
really believed by the Primitive Christians,
so it is by us, who believe that God raised
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43872:62"/>
up Jesus from the Dead; and therefore the
Dead, both the Just and Unjust, shall be raised
by Jesus Christ according to Scripture, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Prejudice may suggest to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But our Adversary will needs have it, <hi>That
Mr.</hi> Penn <hi>does understand that long and elegant
Description of the Resurrection of our Bodies,
from the 35th</hi> Verse of the 15th Chap. of the
first Epist. to the <hi>Corinthians, <hi>Only</hi> of the
spiritual state of the Soul in this Life;</hi> and for
it quotes, <hi>The Invalidity of</hi> John Faldoe's
<hi>Vindication,</hi> 1673. p. 373, &amp; p. 369.
He wrongs <hi>W. P.</hi> in this, <hi>i. e. That he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
that long and elegant Description of
the Resurrection,</hi> (1 Cor. 15. 35. to the end.)
<hi>Only of the spiritual state of the Soul in this
Life.</hi> I say this is a Perversion and Abuse
of <hi>W. P.</hi>'s Discourse in the Case; for on
verse 44. he utterly denies that this Text
is concerned in the Resurrection of Man's
carnal Body; shewing, according to <hi>Beza,</hi>
both from the Latin and Original Greek,
that <hi>a natural Body is sown, a spiritual Body is
raised;</hi> that there's not a Word in either
for the Relative <hi>It, Inval.</hi> p. 369. And in
p. 373. <hi>W. P.</hi> supposing the Apostle treated of
a natural Change, and not only of the spiritual
state of the Soul in this Life. This Supposition
is not to understand the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to treat
only of the spiritual state of the Soul in this
Life, in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. from v. 35. For in the
place quoted, it is by the Accused confessed,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43872:62"/>
That tho' <hi>we sow not the Body which shall be,
God giveth a Body as it pleaseth him,</hi> from
1 Cor. 15. 37, 38.</p>
            <p>'Tis observable, That <hi>W. P.</hi> (in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to <hi>T. Hicks</hi> and <hi>John Faldoe</hi> quoted)
is not so unnatural as not to allow the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
Soul a suitable Clothing or Mansion,
(when the earthly Tabernacle is dissolved)
which is eternal in the Heavens, according
to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. wherein it is undoubtedly
happy, being in perfect Peace and Rest with
God in Christ Jesus; but he also allows it a
spiritual, celestial, glorious Body in the
Resurrection, far excelling the Terrestrial.
And we doubt not but we shall be the same
(and as many) <hi>distinct Souls,</hi> Men (or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons)
in the Resurrection as we are now,
though far better Clothed with our spiritual
glorious Bodies, we hope. The Premises consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
'tis evident our Accuser has as actually
wronged us in this Point, even in Matter of
Fact by Perversion, as in his saying, <hi>The
Quakers have spiritualiz'd away all the Body
and the Being of Christ into their Light within,</hi>
p. 195. which is all a notorious Untruth,
and answered before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To his Stories,</hi> 1. Of a Quaker Preacher,
to whom he urging for a proof of the Resurrection,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 52, 53. That many Bodies of Saints
arose and came out of the Graves after Christ's
Resurrection, and went into the Holy City and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43872:63"/>
appeared unto many; That he made this Answer,
That was not meant of the literal or earthly
<hi>Jerusalem;</hi> that any dead Bodies arose there,
but of the spiritual <hi>Jerusalem</hi> which <hi>John</hi> saw
coming down from Heaven. 2. And that
others told him, They heard the same Exposition
in a Quaker Sermon at one of their Meetings,
<hi>p.</hi> 196.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We know not any Preacher among
us that gave such Meaning or Interpretation
to the said Text, neither do we own it.
And we have reason to question the truth of
these Stories.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>He says,</hi> He can tell of a Preacher among
the Quakers that said, He had already obtain'd
the Resurrection by Christ, having risen in his
Heart; and that he believed no other Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
nor expected any, <hi>p.</hi> 198.</p>
            <p>We question the Truth of this Story also,
in the last part of it, <hi>viz. That he believed no
other, nor expected any than Christ risen in him,</hi>
and this also of <hi>no other</hi> we disown; for as
truly as we own Christ risen in us (and we
in him from Sin and Condemnation) so
truly do we believe and expect to be raised
up by him in the last Day, above all Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
and Mortality; we being raised in
Christ from Sin here, we shall be raised by
him to Glory hereafter. And therefore are
not of the Opinion of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Phyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
who said, <hi>That the Resurrection is past,</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:43872:63"/>
(or made) <hi>already,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 18. For that
Resurrection which <hi>Paul</hi> (in his converted
state when risen with Christ) had not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 11, 12. we do believe and
expect as yet to come after this Life, and at
the last Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Accusation is,</hi> That <hi>G. F.</hi> says
plainly in these Words, There's none have a
Glory and a Heaven but within them (<hi>leaving
out what follows</hi>) which was before Man had
a Being, <hi>Gr. Myst. p.</hi> 214.</p>
            <p>This is intended of what the Saints <hi>have</hi>
and <hi>enjoy</hi> in this Life, in the Present Tense,
(and not of that more full attainment in
that which is to come) who have and enjoy
the indwelling of God and Christ, as their
God and their Glory according to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
having of this excellent Treasure in
their Earthen Vessels, according to their
measures of degrees of attainment, being
changed from Glory to Glory (from one
degree of Glory to another) as by the Spirit
of God. There's no doubt but all true and
spiritual Believers, who are dead with
Christ, and whose Life is hid with Christ in
God, when Christ who is their Life shall at
last appear, they shall <hi>appear</hi> with him in
<hi>Glory,</hi> Col. 3. Yea, in far more Glory than's
here attainable in a mortal State. Though
we are now the Sons of God, yet it appears
not what we shall then be; but when Christ
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43872:64"/>
appears we shall be like him, for we shall see
him as he is, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3. 2. Heaven, which
is God's Throne and Dwelling-place, is no
doubt so spacious, and the Heavens which
declare his Glory so wonderfully extensive,
that we cannot suppose they should all be
contain'd in the narrow compass of our
Hearts, though our Conversation be now
in Heaven, and we come to a heavenly state
in Christ Jesus. Therefore we do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
all our expected Attainments of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Glory to within us in this Life,
but the way to attain more thereof in that
which is to come, is to <hi>partake of some share
thereof in Christ Jesus,</hi> even in this Life, and
where Christ is enjoy'd, there Heaven and
Glory is in measure spiritually enjoy'd,
there being spiritual and inward Heavens,
as well as natural and outward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> For the spirituality of the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Bodies,</hi> and the nature of the Body of
Christ after his Resurrection and Ascension,
Our Opposer may peruse <hi>H. Moor</hi>'s <hi>Search
into the nature of a glorified Body,</hi> Apol. ch. 3.
p. 494. Of his <hi>Modest Enquiry into the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Iniquity.</hi> And compare the same
with what we have written on that Subject,
and then let our Opposer answer him, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been a Doctor of his own Church, and
Philosopher also of Repute in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:43872:64"/>
As to his 14th Sect. <hi>Of the Sacraments,</hi> (as
he terms them) but without Scripture-proof
of the Term <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as applied to
the outward Elements, Signs or Shadows,
which end in Christ the Substance, who
livingly represents himself beyond them,
by his Spirit in the Hearts and Souls of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Believers, who have attained unto the
spiritual Communion of the Body and Blood
of Christ, and to partake of his spiritual
Supper with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>The difference between us and our Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
in this Point, is about the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
11. 26. of shewing forth the Lord's Death
till he come, as he says <hi>By the Celebration of
his last Supper,</hi> Whether this <hi>coming of Christ
be spiritually in our Hearts, or at the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
at the last Day, which ends the time limited
for the Celebration thereof?</hi> We believe it of
the first (if that may be owned as any real
coming of Christ) He of the last. His Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, <hi>That Christ was so come in the Hearts
of the Holy Apostles and of the purest Primitive
Christians.</hi> The Apostle's condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to divers Things that were Shadows
and Figures for sometime; it follows not
that therefore, we are bound to imitate
them in all things they did. Neither were
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the purest of Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
when <hi>Paul</hi> writ his first Epistle to
them; nor had they then so far attained to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43872:65"/>
the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, as to
confirm and make them blameless as in his
Day, but then waited for such his coming,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. for there were divers Disorders
among them, and many of them carnal and
walked as Men. And therefore they were
not then of the purest of Christians; though
they had good Gifts, yet they had then
great need to wait for the coming of Christ
to make them better, to bring them into a
blameless state. The Apostles themselves
were come to higher Attainments in Christ
Jesus, which they laboured to bring their
Hearers to, as is evident from <hi>Paul</hi>'s desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>That the</hi> Corinthians <hi>might not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
how that all the Fathers, who were baptized
unto</hi> Moses <hi>in the Cloud and in the Sea, did all
eat the same spiritual Meat and drink of the
spiritual Rock which followed them or went with
them, which Rock was Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.
And told them the Cup of Blessing which
we bless, is it not the Communion of the
Blood of Christ? And the Bread which we
break, it is not the Communion of the Body
of Christ? For we being many are <hi>One</hi>
Bread and <hi>One</hi> Body, being all Partakers of
the <hi>One Bread,</hi> ver. 16, 17. and doubtless
the knowledge of this Mystery was <hi>what he
received of the Lord,</hi> which was above the
Sign, Shadow or Figure thereof. Yet 'tis
not to be questioned, but there was a good
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43872:65"/>
Intention in the first Proposal and Practice
of those outward Memorials of Christ's
Death among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
they stood in, to remember and shew
forth Christ's Death thereby, until they
knew and had more of his Life to shew forth,
in a holy and unblameable State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
in the Day of the Lord Jesus
Christ, for whose spiritual coming they
waited, for that end, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8. And
also that they might <hi>flee from Idolatry</hi> and
keep out of it, and forbear eating in the
Idols Temple, which he warned them
against. As to Christ's Celebration of his
last Supper, 'tis strange that should be so
much urg'd as obligatory upon us, until
<hi>Christ's last coming again at the Resurrection in
the last Day;</hi> seeing we find none of the
Urg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs thereof so much as in a true imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the last Supper of Christ, where he
eat the legal Passover with his Disciples,
according to his own appointment, this
part of the Supper being laid aside as Jewish,
fulfilled and ended by Christ. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to us that last Supper of Christ appears
to be a Consummation and fulfilling of the
Jewish solemn Feasts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law,<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>T. Godwyn's Moses and Aaron,</hi> treating of the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover,</hi> &amp;c. and Christ's answering the same in his Supper, <hi>Exod. 12. Mat. 26. 18, 19. Luke</hi> 22. 8. to ver. 15.</note> as <hi>John</hi>'s
Baptism was, of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43872:66"/>
legal Washings (or Baptisms) imposed,
until the time of Reformation, when Christ
blotted out and nailed the Hand-writing of
Ordinances to his Cross. After which,
they were not legally obligatory, though
condescended unto for a Season, by reason
of the Weakness of divers, and Respect
many had unto them in the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.
And tho' too many now are very
formal and superstitious in those outward
Observations and Shadows, laying so much
stress for Salvation upon them that they
neglect the Substance; yet others being
more conscientiously tender in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
thereof, we are the more tender to
these, so as not to censure or condemn them
meerly for practising that which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
is their Duty, either in breaking of
Bread or Water Baptism, yet desire they
may see further, and come under that higher
and evangelical Dispensation of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Communion and Bread of Life, and
Cup of Blessing from Heaven (which can
only nourish the Soul unto eternal Life) and
of the spiritual Baptism of Christ, which
only is the Soul's sanctifying and saving
Baptism; so that this <hi>One Baptism</hi> and this
<hi>One Bread,</hi> which is the Substance, they may
livingly partake of unto eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:43872:66"/>
We do hitherto want Proof that <hi>Paul</hi>
either received of the Lord the Bread and
the Cup, or the real Supper of the Lord in
the Figure or Type (but the Mystery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;)
or that to observe the Figure was an
Institution of Christ to continue in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Church: And tho' he fulfilled the
Command of the Passover at his Supper, we
have no reason to think that was his own
Institution to continue in the Christian
Church, no more than the Passover, Legal
Offerings, Circumcision, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We confess,
<hi>That the neglect and abuse of the Holy Mystery,</hi>
p. 207. (which is the Substance, Christ
the living Bread) <hi>did and doth incur Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and grievous Diseases,</hi> as among the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians;
He that eateth and drinketh unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself,
not discerning he Lord's Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 29. If
you rest or stick in the Shadow, and neglect
the Substance or Mystery, so as you discern
not the Lord's Body, you discern not that
whereby your Souls should live and be
nourished unto eternal Life: 'Tis Matter of
Condemnation, you are but eating and
drinking Damnation to your selves. The
main end and drift of the Apostles labouring
with and writing to them at <hi>Corinth,</hi> was
to bring them to Life and Substance to the
spiritual Rock, the spiritual Meat and
Drink, which is Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 14, 15,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43872:67"/>
16, 17. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. that they might be
blameless in his Day; which 'tis evident
the outward Figure or Shadow did not
bring them to, but they were blameable,
and blamed for the Carnality, Divisions
and Disorders which were among them,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 3.</p>
            <p>Now as to the outward Supper, so little
being said for it by our Opposer, we are
not willing to enlarge or enter into any
strict Controversie about that Subject; but
for further Explanation, refer him to what
our deceased Friend <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> has writ
upon it, in his <hi>Apology,</hi> from p. 493 to
p. 514. And if we were convinced that it is
our Duty to receive Bread and Wine as an
outward Memorial of Christ's Death, we
should never own this our Accuser (who
has shamefully reproached us) or any such
Enemies, to be our Administrators, nor hold
Communion with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Baptism,</hi> he alledges <hi>Mat. 28. 20.
Go teach all Nations, baptizing them.—</hi>
And here the Man breaks, leaving out, <hi>In
the Name of the Father, and the Son, and the
Holy Ghost;</hi> and then brings in, <hi>And lo I am
with you alway, even unto the end of the World:</hi>
Taking it for granted, that this Commission
must intend <hi>Water Baptism;</hi> and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
thereof, as well as Teaching or
Preaching, even unto the <hi>End</hi> of the World.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43872:67"/>
Hence saying, <hi>They (i. e.</hi> Christ's ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Officers) <hi>indeed were impowered, as</hi> John,
<hi>to baptize with Water,</hi> p. 205. But is this
Adversary really for <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, or
for baptizing as <hi>John</hi> did? He's not express
nor plain in this Point. Tho' he would
seem an eminent Advocate for the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> we may greatly question his
Sincerity herein. If under this Pretext he
means Infants Baptism, or Sprinkling them,
he should not take up the Anabaptist's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for that which they oppose as a <hi>scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptureless
Thing,</hi> and at the same time deem
them <hi>Schismaticks, Enthusiasts,</hi> and number
them among the <hi>various Sects set up by</hi> Rome,
<hi>under universal Tolleration,</hi> as before, p. 17,
18. 2d Part. He's very disingenuous in this
as well as in many other Things: He should
have plainly told us what Baptism he aims
at; and who the Subjcts of it, whether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
or Believers; before he had either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
or threatned us for the neglect of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>However, pray observe the great Stress
he lays upon this</hi> outward Baptism with Water,
<hi>viz.</hi> That it was an Ordinance instituted as a
means of Grace, whereby the inward Baptism
with the Holy Ghost was conveyed; therefore
the Form appointed, of admission into the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of the Church, and thereby giving a Title
to all the Privileges and Promises annexed to it,
<hi>p.</hi> 206. whereby Persons are daily baptized into
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43872:68"/>
Christ's death, <hi>p. 209. And tells us of</hi> Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Signs and Seals, Pledges and Means of
Grace, <hi>which he judges the</hi> Enemy has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
Men into a neglect of.</p>
            <p>Now observe, 1. He makes Water-Baptism
(whether of Infants or Believers
he resolves not) not only an Institution, but
a Means of Grace, whereby the inward
Baptism of the Holy Ghost is conveyed.</p>
            <p>2. Such a Form appointed of admission
into the Church, as giveth a Title to all the
Privileges and Promises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That 'tis the Baptism into Christ's
Death.</p>
            <p>4. A Seal, Pledge and Means of Grace.</p>
            <p>In all which he does but upon his own
Authority impose upon the Reader, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Scripture-proof: And his Impositions
herein are liable to many Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>1. They suppose all Persons under Grace
and the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, who are
come under Water-Baptism, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of Infants or others; when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is evident in many wicked Persons,
and even in <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the Sorcerer, who
was baptized and yet wicked; and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gift and Baptism of the Holy
Ghost, would have bought it for Mony,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:43872:68"/>
2. It also supposes all to be void of Grace,
and of the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, and
of the Promises, who are not baptized
with Water; consequently, that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
are Damned because they are not
so baptized: Which is highly unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            <p>3. We deny that by Water-Baptism Men
are baptized either into Christ's Death,
Body or Church; or that 'tis a Seal or Pledge
of Grace: For 'tis by one Spirit that true
Believers are baptized unto Christ, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ's Death, and into One Body;
there being One Faith and One Baptism,
which is that of the Spirit's, which is the
Soul's saving Baptism, typified by that of
Water. See 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 13. Rom. 6. 3, 4.
Gal. 3. 27. Ephes. 4. 5. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next place we may observe, this
censorious, uncharitable Man will not allow
Christ's Commission,</hi> Mat. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. To intend
spiritual Baptism, or the Baptism of the Holy
Ghost; <hi>because he saith,</hi> Christ only is he
who could baptize with the Holy Ghost. To say
that Man could bestow God (which the Holy
Ghost is) is the highest Blasphemy, <hi>p.</hi> 203,
204.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further to aggravate the Matter
against us, he saith,</hi> If the Quakers Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. do hold, it will follow
that the Apostles and their Successors, have
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43872:69"/>
power to baptize with the Holy Ghost; which is
Blasphemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> He is highly mistaken in his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative
Charge of Blasphemy in this Case;
for if our Interpretation of the Text does
hold, That Christ's Apostles and Ministers
had Power given them by him (being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with them even in his own Work) to
baptize with the Spirit, as well as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
Men to God; then our Interpretation
isd not Blasphemy, because it holds. This
severe Judge against us is quite out here:
For tho' Christ be the great and efficient
Cause both of giving and baptizing with the
Spirit, yet his true Ministers, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with his divine Power, were instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in his Work of baptizing with the
Spirit, yea, and of ministring the Spirit,
and he was with them in his own Work;
<hi>Lo, I am with you always to the end of the
World,</hi> saith he; What for? <hi>To enable them
to baptize with Water.</hi> No, that many can
do without him, or the least sense of his
Presence; but lo Christ was with them to
impower them to <hi>Go teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
them into the Name of the Father, Son
and Holy Ghost.</hi> It is not <hi>Go teach, and then
baptize them with Water;</hi> but <hi>Go teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. There was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and spiritual Baptism, immediately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
(and present with) their Ministry,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43872:69"/>
(and it was to such as were docible too,
and not to Infants who are not capable of
Teaching;) and this spiritual Presence of
Christ and his Baptism, accompanying their
Ministry, is evident according to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
own Relation, <hi>Acts 11. 15, 16. And AS
I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them that
heard, even as upon us at the beginning. Then
I remembred the Word of the Lord, how he
said, John baptized with Water, but ye shall be
baptized with the Holy Ghost.</hi> What's more
plain, than that here was Teaching and
Baptizing with the Holy Ghost, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Ministry?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query,</hi> But were Christ's Apostles instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in ministring the Spirit? Yes, they
being Ministers of the Spirit, and not of the
Letter. See <hi>Gal. 3. 2. Received ye the Spirit
by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of
Faith preached?</hi> And ver. 5. <hi>He therefore that
ministreth to you the Spirit, and worketh Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
among you, doth he it through the Works of
the Law, or by the hearing of Faith preached?</hi>
Their Speech and Preaching being not in
the enticing Words of Man's Wisdom, but
in plain Evidence of the Spirit and of Power,
that the Faith of the Hearers might not
stand in the Wisdom of Men, but in the
Power of God, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 4, 5. For</hi> (said
he) <hi>our Gospel was not unto you in Word only,
but also in Power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43872:70"/>
much Assurance,</hi> 1 Thes. 1. 5. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise,
this imposing <hi>Judge</hi> has promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Water-Baptism above the spiritual,
powerful Ministry of the Gospel. <hi>He'll
have the spiritual Baptism to go along with that
of Water, duly administred and received</hi> (as
he saith p. 205.) But by no means will he
allow the spiritual Baptism to go along
with the Gospel Ministry or Teaching, as
commanded <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. No by no means,
that he deems <hi>Blasphemy;</hi> which bewrays his
no small Ignorance both of the Scriptures
and of the Power of God and true Gospel-Ministry
in this case; and therefore he'll
not allow <hi>Inward Baptism</hi> to <hi>supersede the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi>
Though <hi>John Baptist,</hi> who had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Commission for the Outward, allowed
it, he preferred and exalted Christ's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
above his own, saying, <hi>He must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
but I must decrease,</hi> John 3. 30 <hi>I
indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance,</hi>
(or amendment of Life) <hi>but he that cometh
after me is mightier than I, whose Shoes I am
not worthy to bear; he will baptize you with the
Holy Ghost and with Fire,</hi> Mat. 3. 11. Mark
1. 8, Luke 3. 16. John 1. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>That <hi>John</hi> as to this his outward Ministry
of Baptism should <hi>decrease,</hi> implies not an
immediate or present end thereof, upon the
entrance of Christ's Dispensation or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
but that <hi>John</hi>'s should gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43872:70"/>
and wear out as Christ's Ministry and
Baptism do encrease and grow, as the Heat
of Fire or Sun dries up the Water, and
causes it to decrease by Degrees, and not
suddenly all at once. For <hi>John</hi> and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
being of great esteem with many both
Jews and Greeks (no doubt) his Baptism
was condescended unto and allowed, when
the Apostles were gathering divers of the
Churches of Christ to a higher Ministry.
And that this of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism was an Act of
Condescention and not of Commission to the
Apostles, <hi>Paul</hi> is very plain in this case,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14, 15, 16. after he saith, <hi>I thank
God that I baptized none of you, but</hi> Crispus
<hi>and</hi> Gaius, <hi>lest any should say that I had bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in my own Name. I baptized also the
Houshold of</hi> Stephanus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He gives a
more general Reason for his thanking God
he baptized no more, <hi>ver. 17. For Christ
sent me NOT to baptize, but to preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
&amp;c. And doubtless <hi>Paul</hi>'s Commission
from Christ was as large and extensive as
any of the Apostles had; therefore their
Commission in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19 was not to
baptize with Water, but with the Spirit,
wherein their Gospel Ministry came.</p>
            <p>His supposing that <hi>If the inward Baptism
must supersede the Outward, then must Inward
Teaching,</hi> p. 203. This supposes the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Baptism of equal Authority with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43872:71"/>
Teaching or Preaching the Gospel, and as
necessary to continue, which we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
yet we deny not but the inward and
immediate Teaching of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is
more excellent and permanent than the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as the Holy Spirit is the Original and
Spring from whence the true outward Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
arises and flows, and unto which it
leads; and the more People come to know
an Introversion and joining of their Minds
to the Inward, the less need they'll have of
the Outward, though we bless God for
both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how proves this Adversary,</hi> That the
visible Representation of the Lord's death, by
the Bread broken and the Wine poured forth,
and also Water-Baptism, are the Body or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
part of Religion which (<hi>he saith</hi>) the
Devil has stolen from us; so that the Soul soon
disappeared, and left a noisome Carcass of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
<hi>p.</hi> 209, 210.</p>
            <p>What a strange, confused Whimsie is
this? How has the Devil stolen from them
the Body of Religion, and left a noisome
Carcass behind? 'Tis more likely that he has
stolen away the Soul of Religion from them,
or rather their Minds from it; and left
them only a Carcass behind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> who are so much
doting about and even idolizing the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
(which is far short of the Body of true
Religion) and neglecting the Life, Soul and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43872:71"/>
Substance thereof; so that their outward
Observations are dead, empty and fruitless,
as those Observers are who are void of
Christian Humility, Love or Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Those repeated known Falshoods,</hi> 1. That
Christ's outward dying and shedding of his Blood,
many of the Quakers have turn'd to mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but his spiritual Suffering within us,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>To spiritualize AWAY the literal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
and Sufferings of Christ,</hi> p. 208, 209.
These Falshoods being fully answer'd and
denied by us already, we need but persist in
our Negation thereof.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Head of Baptism with
an Argument or two from the Terms of
the Commission, <hi>Mat. 28. Go teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
baptizing them in the Name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If the Commission intended bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
them with Water, then the Apostles
must have followed and used the Terms of
the Commission in the Execution thereof, to
manifest their Authority for it.</p>
            <p>But they did not follow nor use the Terms
of the Commission in baptizing with Water;
therefore, that Baptism was not intended in
the Commission.</p>
            <p>The first part of the Argument is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
from the Sanction and Authority of
the Commission it self, which is expresly,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43872:72"/>
               <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them in</hi> (or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)
the Name of the Father, and of the Son and
Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second part of the Argument is prov'd
by the following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Christ's Apostles and Ministers
did Teach and Preach in the Name of the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost; but they did
not Baptize with Water in the Name of the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost;</p>
            <p>Therefore baptizing with Water was not
intended in that Commission.</p>
            <p>The second Proposition is proved by their
baptizing only in the Name of the Lord, or
in the Name of the Lord Jesus, when they
baptized with Water as <hi>John</hi> did.</p>
            <p>We do not find in all the <hi>Acts</hi> or other
Scripture, that the Name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost, were used by any of
the Apostles of Christ in baptizing with
Water. Let him peruse <hi>W. DELL</hi>'s

            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:43872:72"/>
            <p>Herein (<hi>he saith</hi>) the Quakers are direct
<hi>Socinians;</hi> for they positively deny the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>Here he stumbles at the Threshold again;
this is a positive Untruth in Fact. They are
neither <hi>Socinians,</hi> nor do they deny the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Christ it self; for God was ever well
pleased and so satisfied in his dear, innocent
Son, but never with Sinners continuing in
their Sins. That therefore which we deny, is
the <hi>Vnscriptural, Sin-pleasing</hi> and <hi>Sinner-soothing
Notions</hi> of our former Adversaries
about it, as that of Christ suffering under
<hi>Vindictive Justice,</hi> from the Father, and
making such a <hi>rigid</hi> and strict Satisfaction
and Payment in our Stead; thereby to acquit
and justifie the guilty Offender, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in Sin all his Days. This Notion of
Satisfaction, as severely and rigidly stated,
as vindictive upon the dear Son of God,
and thus indulging to Sinners, both the
Quakers, and even a Bishop of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> have opposed.</p>
            <p>'Tis also such a Notion of a <hi>rigid Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
and strict Payment, held as a <hi>Notion of
Law,</hi> in the strictest and severest Sense, that
<hi>W. P.</hi> opposeth God's Compassion unto,
<hi>in pardoning Iniquity, passing by Transgression
and Sin, and forgiving our Trespasses</hi> (which
we ever own to be for Christ's sake, but
upon true Faith and Repentance) from
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43872:73"/>
these Scriptures, <hi>Mica 7. 18. Mat.</hi> 6. 12, 14.
&amp; ch. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore this Adversary mistakes and
misrepresents <hi>W. P.</hi> in this Point, as <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming</hi>
and arguing against the <hi>Satisfaction
of Christ,</hi> p. 212, 213. when he argues
against that kind of Satisfaction held (<hi>as a
rigid Notion of Law</hi>) that admits not of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of Sins past; which we consess
Christ's Sufferings and Sacrifice has made
way for, upon true Repentance on the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
part, which Christ's great Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
(under the Burthen of the World's Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities)
do call for, and require univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
of them.</p>
            <p>And as to the Praise of the great Love
and Grace of God to Mankind, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that it was by the same Grace Christ
tasted Death for every Man, and was really
an Offering and a Sacrifice of a sweet smell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Savour to God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. and our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mediator; and in that Sense sincerely
own what was really his Satisfaction to the
Father, to stay the Execution of his Wrath
and obtain our Pardon, giving us Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
by his Light and Grace in our Hearts,
yet such a kind of <hi>rigid Satisfaction</hi> and strict
Payment to <hi>vindictive or revenging Justice,</hi> as
if God poured out his just Indignation or
Wrath (merited by Sinners) upon his
innocent Son (as some of our Adversaries
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43872:73"/>
have affirmed no less.) This we confess
we cannot reconcile either to God's divine
Justice or Mercy, or to Christ's Mediation
and Intercession for Transgressors. And
little short of this, is our present Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary's
Notion, <hi>That Justice cannot remit the
least Farthing, else it were not Justice;</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>divine Justice</hi> even of <hi>God,</hi> as being
<hi>not only just, but Justice it self in the Abstract,
the highest and most adequate Notion of Justice,</hi>
p. 214. All which duly considered, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
upon the most <hi>rigid</hi> and <hi>extream</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Satisfaction; as if divine Justice
(<hi>i. e.</hi> God himself in his Sense) could not
remit the least Farthing, but Christ must
strictly pay every Farthing of the Debt of
Offenders; whereas there is a divine Justice
or Righteousness (that's truly Evangelical)
which is declared in the Forgiveness of Sins
that are past, through the forbearance of
God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. and ver. 26. to shew at
this time <hi>his Righteousness;</hi> that he might
be <hi>Just,</hi> and the Justifier of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
in Jesus. It was for this end that
God set forth his Son Jesus Christ, to be a
Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to
declare his <hi>Rightoousness</hi> for <hi>the remission of
Sins past,</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore the Quakers do
not make <hi>one of God's Attributes fight with or
conquer the other,</hi> nor <hi>one to subdue and beat
down the other;</hi> or <hi>his Justice to quit the Field
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43872:74"/>
to his Mercy;</hi> as is ignorantly and unjustly
suggested, to make us guilty of great <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense
and Blasphemy,</hi> p. 214, 215, 216. For
all God's Attributes in himself are in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
Union and Harmony; and in his
Creatures concur and agree, in order to its
Reconcilation to himself; as when he brings
Man to taste of his Justice and Displeasure
for Sin, it's still in Mercy, to humble him
by his Chastisement and Judgment unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
that he may find Mercy, so as
Judgment and Mercy may meet in the same
Soul. And God's Wisdom is truly magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in finding out the means of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<hi>by our great and only Mediator
Jesus Christ,</hi> through his Mediation, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Sacrifice and Attonement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his
Goodness and Mercy are equally magnified,
in affording those means: But this proves
not that <hi>adequate Satisfaction</hi> to <hi>vindictive
Justice,</hi> which our Adversaries have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for.</p>
            <p>And tho' we sincerely own Jesus Christ as
we ought to do, both for our Example, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor,
Light and Teacher; yet this is
not all our Notion, or rather Knowledge,
wherein we receive him; neither do we in
these, deny the necessity of his Death, or
<hi>exclude</hi> any <hi>rational</hi> account thereof, as is
unduly supposed, p. 216. For there was
great reason for Christ's Death and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43872:74"/>
for Sinners (because all in <hi>Adam</hi> were
dead and under Condemnation) that they
might live by and unto him, so as to be
truly capable of really knowing and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Christ Jesus, in Spirit, Life and Power;</hi>
and in all his Offices and Works, both as
King, High priest and Prophet, our great
Mediator, Example, Captain, Leader;
Light and Law-giver.</p>
            <p>But to draw towards a Conclusion of this
point of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> seeing 'tis so numbly and
impertinently stated by our present Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,
let us observe a little further how rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and severely he states it, to the Dishonour
of God, divine Justice it self, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Son. He first puts the Queston.</p>
            <p>What room then is there for God's Mercy?
If he be all Justice, where is his Mercy? <hi>Then
he Answers:</hi> God's Attributes do not fight or
contradict one another, they magnifie and exalt
one another. (<hi>True thus far; but how?</hi>)
Thus God's Justice is magnified, in that it
<hi>exacts</hi> full and <hi>adequate</hi> Satisfaction, paid
to God's Justice for our Sins, in the Sacrifice
and Death of Christ; which because of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, was full and <hi>adequate</hi> Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And by his humane Nature, the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was paid by the same Nature, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
<hi>p.</hi> 214, 215.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:43872:75"/>
All which considered, this is to assert Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
as a <hi>Notion of Law</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>
call'd it) in the highest, rigid and most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Sense exacted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that any of the <hi>Prebyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
&amp;c. have asserted it. And to save us
the Labour of drawing the Consequences
and Answers here, we may here (I hope
without Offence) give him a Recitation of
a more ingenuous Person's Answer (and
Objection against this Notion) than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,

of <hi>Worcester</hi>) in his <hi>Discourse concerning the

            <p>
               <q>The state of the Controversy hath been
rendred more obscure by the Mistakes of
some, who have managed it with greater
Zeal than Judgment; they have shot over
their Adversary's Heads, and laid their
own more open to Assaults. It is easie to
observe, That most of <hi>Socinus</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are levelled against an Opinion,
which few who have considered those
things do maintain, and none need to
think themselves obliged to do it; which
is, <hi>That Christ paid a proper and rigid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for the Sins of Men, considered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Notion of Debts, and that he paid the
very same which we ought to have done;</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:43872:75"/>
which in the Sense of the Law is never
called <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> but <hi>strict Payment.</hi>
Against this <hi>Socinus</hi> disputes, from the
impossibility of Christ's paying the very
same that we were to have paid, because
our Penalty was eternal Death. And that
as the consequence of <hi>inherent Guilt,</hi> which
Christ neither did nor could undergo. If
a <hi>Mediator</hi> could have paid the same, then
the Gospel had not been the bringing in
of a better Covenant, but a performance
of the old, p. 271. But if there be a
<hi>Relaxation</hi> or <hi>Dispensation</hi> of the first Law,
then it necessarily follows, that what
Christ paid was not the very same which
the first Law required; for what need of
that, when the very same was paid that
was in the Obligation? But if it be said,
That the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the Person makes up
what wanted in the kind or degree of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
this is a plain Confession, that
it is not the same, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Besides, if the
very same had been paid in the strict Sense,
there would have followed <hi>A Deliverance,
ipso facto,</hi> for the Release immediately
follows the Payment of the same; and it
had been Injustice to have required any
thing further in order to the Discharge of
the Offender, when strict and full Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had been made of what was in the
Obligation. But we see that <hi>Faith and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43872:76"/>
Repentance,</hi> and the Consequences of those
Two are made Conditions on our parts,
in order to the enjoying the <hi>Benefit</hi> of
what Christ hath procured, so that the
Release is not immediate upon the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>P. 272.</bibl> We are to consider that these
very Persons assert, <hi>That Christ paid all
for us, and in our Name and Stead,</hi> so that
the <hi>Payment</hi> by Christ was by a <hi>Substitution
in our room:</hi> And if he paid the same
which the Law required, the Benefit must
immediately accrue to those in whose
Name the Debt was paid; for what was
done in the Name of another, is all one to
the Creditor as if it had been done by the
Debtor himself. But above all things it is
impossible to reconcile the <hi>freeness of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
with the <hi>full Payment,</hi> &amp;c. Neither
will it serve to say, <hi>That though it was not
free to Christ, yet it was to us,</hi> for the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi>
and <hi>Remission</hi> must respect the
same Person; for Christ did not pay for
himself, but for us; neither could the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
be to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is impossible
the same Debt should be <hi>fully</hi> paid and
<hi>freely forgiven,</hi> much less will it avoid the
Difficulty in this Case to say, <hi>That it was a
refusable Payment;</hi> for it being supposed
to be the very same, it was not in Justice
refusable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 173. But this whole
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43872:76"/>
Opinion is built upon a Mistake, <hi>That
Satisfaction must be the Payment of the very
same;</hi> which while they contend for, they
give our Adversaries too great advantage,
and make them think they triumph over
the Faith of the Church, when they do it
only over the Mistake of some particular
Persons. But the Foundation of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
lies in the Consideration of <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
under the Notion of <hi>Debts;</hi> and
<hi>That Satisfaction therefore must be by strict
Payment in Rigor of Law.</hi> But how great
that Mistake is, will appear in the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Discourse.</q> Thus far the Citation.</p>
            <p>The subsequent Discourse he mentions, is
from p. 273, 274. to the end of the said
<hi>Discourse of the Sufferings of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would advise our Accuser to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
his Notion of a <hi>full and adequate Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
paid to God's Justice</hi> (which he has
told us cannot remit the least Farthing)
with the aforesaid Discourse, and then
see how he'll reconcile his Notion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>In Sect. 16. <hi>Concerning the Holy Trinity,</hi>
he saith:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> acknowledge a
Three, but deny a Trinity; which is to confess
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43872:77"/>
the same Thing in English, and to deny it in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin;
for <hi>Trinitas</hi> is only Latin for <hi>Three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He mistakes the Quakers: They do not
deny the <hi>Three</hi> either in Latin or English,
but really own the <hi>holy, divine Three</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
tho' their being rendred <hi>distinct and
separate Persons,</hi> by some of our former Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
we have conscientiously questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
as unscriptural Terms.</p>
            <p>Our Adversary adds, <hi>They cannot tell what
Three they are, if not Three Persons,</hi> p. 219.
This is a Mistake; we can safely tell what to
call them in Scripture Language: That they
are Three that bear Record, or Three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (i. e. <hi>Witnesses</hi>)
in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the
Holy Ghost, and these Three are One,
<hi>John</hi> 1. 5. These are the Father, Son and
Holy Spirit, which are essentially One, or
One in the Divine Being.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Adversary further saith:</hi> The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
who own the Divinity of Christ, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
greater Difficulties than the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who
deny the Divinity of Christ, <hi>p.</hi> 219.</p>
            <p>'Tis well he now grants the Quakers own
the Divinity of Christ: But how well this
agrees with much of his Book against us,
let the serious Reader judge. And we know
no Difficulties we are under herein: The
Man imagins, and would obtrude Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
upon us, from his own Terms, which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43872:77"/>
are none of ours; as that <hi>there is but One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the Godhead;</hi> which are none of our
Words. Much less his <hi>Muggletonian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
<hi>That God died, and that Christ was
his own Father to whom he pray'd upon the
Cross.</hi> We know no real occasion given by
the Quakers, for him to draw such Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
upon them, or to be <hi>afraid of such
Distinctions and Salvo's at the bottom of the
Quaker-pretences,</hi> as impertinently he prates
against them, exposing his pretended Fears
instead of Proofs.</p>
            <p>And what if <hi>G. F.</hi> opposed <hi>Chr. Wade</hi>'s
calling <hi>The Holy Ghost a Person?</hi> And if he
said, The Scriptures do not tell the People
of <hi>Three Persons,</hi> &amp;c? And yet confessing
the <hi>Father, Son and Holy Spirit to be always
One?</hi> Does it follow, That the Quakers do
not acknowledge that there were <hi>Three in
Heaven before Christ was born, as</hi> (he saith)
<hi>it seems?</hi> p. 220. And then to aggravate
the Matter against <hi>G. F. That he means One
Person, as</hi> Muggleton <hi>does,</hi> p. 220.</p>
            <p>What if the Quakers think the Term
<hi>Three Persons,</hi> too low an Epithite or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
to put upon the most Glorious, Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Three</hi> that bear Record in Heaven?
Can they be to blame herein? When they
aim at giving more Honour to them, in a
true Scripture sense, than they think the
Term <hi>Persons</hi> imports, yet still owning the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43872:78"/>
               <hi>Holy, Divine Three</hi> in Heaven, and that
they were before Christ was born; contrary
to what's unduly suggested against us. For
the Father, the Word and Holy Spirit, were
concerned both in Divine Wisdom, Power
and Goodness, in forming, preserving and
governing both the Old Creation and the
New; <hi>By the Word of the Lord were the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
made, and all the Host of them by the
Spirit of his Mouth,</hi> Psal. 33. 6. So here's the
Divine, Holy Three forming and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first Creation. And the Gospel
was commanded to be preached in the Name
of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, that
Men might truly believe and know the
Work of God by his dear Son and Holy
Spirit, unto their everlasting Salvation,
Peace and Comfort. <hi>For God so loved the
World, that he hath given his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
but have everlasting Life,</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>And
Jesus answered and said, If any Man love me
he will keep my Word, and my Father will love
him; and we will come unto him, and will dwell
with him,</hi> John 14. 23. And ver. 26. <hi>The
Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the
Father will send in my Name, he shall teach you
all things, and bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
which I have told you.</hi> And Ch. 15. 26.
<hi>But when the Comforter shall come, whom I
will send unto you from the Father, even the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43872:78"/>
Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth of the Father,
he shall testifie of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 13, 14. Hereby know we that
we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath
given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and
do testifie, That the Father sent the Son to be the
Saviour of the World. <hi>All which may evince
how scripturally we own a</hi> Trinity, <hi>or</hi> Holy
Three <hi>in the Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Accuser tells of</hi> what unimaginable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
Enthusiasm may drive Men to; and that
all should beware of that desperate Shelve, upon
which both our Church and State have suffered
miserable Shipwreck, <hi>p. 221, 222. Here he
disparages his own Church, whereby we
may beware of embarking in such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>raz'd,
wreck'd Vessel, as here he represents
her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He excepts against the Words <hi>not distinct,</hi>
from which <hi>G. F.</hi> intends, in a sort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Acceptation, <hi>That the Son is not divided
or separate from the Father,</hi> p. 222, 223, 224.
Tho' 'tis true in one Sense, the Father, Son
and Holy Ghost are not essentially distinct as
to their divine Being, which is but <hi>One,</hi>
they are but One God; but in respect to
their Properties of Relation, as Father, Son
and Holy Ghost, as such they are distinct;
but not divided nor separate, either in
themselves or Work of the Old or New
Creation; yet not Three Gods, nor Three
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43872:79"/>
distinct Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tors, but One God, and One
Creator.</p>
            <p>Passing by divers Impertinencies and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
under this Head, to conclude, We
know no People professing a Deity in
<hi>Christendom,</hi> that more sincerely and livingly
believe and confess a most glorious <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Trinity</hi>
(or Holy Three) the Father,
the Word (or Son) and Holy Ghost, than
we the People called Quakers do believe and
confess; to the Praise and Glory of the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Our Accuser's 17th Sect. <hi>Concerning the
Divinity and Incarnation of Christ,</hi> is full of
Falshoods, Perversions and Misconstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>1. He begins with this Falshood, <hi>viz.
The Quakers Heresie in this is taken from the</hi>
Socinians: <hi>They say, Christ took Flesh; but no
otherwise, as they explain it, than as Angels
assumed Bodies,</hi> &amp;c. Which is notoriously
false against the Quakers, who confess and
believe, That Christ, the Word, took real
Flesh, a real Body, and not a meer Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition,
nor a Fantastical Body; and so they
have often declared both in Print, and
Preaching.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That they allow (not always) that Christ
did inspire the Person of that Man Jesus, in an
higher measure than other Men.</hi> False and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43872:79"/>
perverse again: God did inspire the Man
Christ Jesus higher than all other Men; he
received the Spirit not by measure, but in
fulness; he was anointed with the Oil of
Gladness above all his Fellows: All other
Men, even the best, are inspired only mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surably.
This is always allowed by
us.</p>
            <p>3. False again, <hi>That they deny any proper
Incarnation of Christ; that is, that he was
made Flesh.</hi> For the Word was made Flesh,
<hi>John</hi> 1. 14. And he took not upon him the
Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
and part of the same Flesh and Blood
which the Children had, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 16.
and Christ Jesus is one entire Christ and
Saviour. We do not divide nor confound
Jesus and Christ, nor take the Name <hi>Christ</hi>
to our selves, but <hi>Christians,</hi> as anointed by
him, and Partakers of Christ, and only so
far have an Interest in his Name, Power and
Life.</p>
            <p>4. False also, <hi>That they say not that Christ
did carry up</hi> (i. e. <hi>the Body of Jesus) with him
into Heaven.</hi> Whose Body then but his
own, when he was visibly seen to ascend, so
as a Cloud received him out of their sight?
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>5. Seeing we confess, That Christ is now
in Heaven; when did ever we <hi>refuse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that there is any Jesus now in Heaven, or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43872:80"/>
any elsewhere?</hi> This is an absurd Accusation,
as if we divided Jesus and Christ, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
Jesus to be Christ; which is far from
us.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>That they know not what's become of him,</hi>
(Jesus) is also false. He ascended far
above all Heavens, that he might fill all
things; and we know him in us by his
Spirit.</p>
            <p>7. That they say there's no Christ without
them; <hi>is false also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. <hi>No other Christ but what's within them.</hi>
There's not Two Christs: 'Tis one and the
same Christ that is without us and within us,
tho' in different manners.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>That they allow him no other Body but
their own;</hi> is false. They allow him his
own proper glorious Body, in which he is
their Head, and they united to him; so as
the Body (in general or comprehensively)
is but one Body, even so is Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 12.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>That they spiritualize ALL his Life
and Death to his spiritual Living and Dying
within them;</hi> which is a reiterated Falshood.
The same Christ that was crucified in the
Flesh without, is spiritually within known
in true Believers: 'Tis not another Christ,
but another Manifestation of one and the
same Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:43872:80"/>
11. Our Friend <hi>G. F.</hi> (in the places im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently
and perversly quoted, <hi>Gr. Myst.</hi>
p. 210, 211, 254.) does not dispute against
saying, That the Man Christ that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
his Body is now in the Presence of
his Father: But against their saying, <hi>Christ
is absent from the Saints and People;</hi> and
against their professing <hi>a Christ without them
and another within them, (i. e.</hi> Two Christs)
<hi>There being but one Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Cor.
8. 6.</p>
            <p>12. 'Tis neither <hi>impious nor blasphemous</hi>
in the Quakers to affirm, That the One
Lord Jesus Christ does <hi>influence, inspire and
enlighten us by his Life and Spirit in our Hearts,</hi>
(this is the true state of the Case) <hi>to guide
us; and that he is the only Christ and Saviour
that so doth; and that Christ, and his Spirit
and Light, are not so divided:</hi> Being still but
One Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who
suffered for us, and reigneth both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, in which he hath all Power
committed to him.</p>
            <p>13. Our Adversary refers to one <hi>Rob.
Gordon</hi>'s Authority against us, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Testimony to the true Saviour, or Jesus
of</hi> Nazareth, printed 1670. In which there

us, he has not retracted his Answer to the

and it will not support our present Opposer
against us.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>What he quotes of</hi> S. E.<hi>'s Challenge,</hi>
What was said of Christ, the World was made
by him, and the World knew him not, so it may
be said of this true Prophet <hi>G. F. p. 232.
We the Quakers, so called, disown the
Comparison, any otherwise than as it relates
to</hi> the World knew him not, <hi>for so far Christ
himself allows his own,</hi> They are not of the
World, as I am not of the World, <hi>John</hi> 17.
And the World knoweth you not, because it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 1.</p>
            <p>15. His repeated false Charges of making
our selves equal with God, and preferring our
selves before the Man Christ, making him and
all he did and suffered to be BVT a Type or
Shaedow of what is really performed in us by the
true Christ, <hi>p. 233. These Falshoods and
Perversions are answered, denied and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,

            </p>
            <p>16. Crying up a Light within, <hi>to cry down
the Blood without.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. To preach him (Christ) as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>to cast out the Attonement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18. Denying him to have any real, outward,

which Christ assumed was his real Body, and
he really suffered in it; and therein was
made a little lower than the Angels, <hi>Heb.
2</hi> 9. who were not capable of such Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43872:82"/>
as his, yet he was dignified, crowned
with Glory and Honour far above them.</p>
            <p>24. Again the Snake perversly quotes,
<hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s <hi>New Rome Arraign'd; That the
Quakers can never call the bodily Garment,
Christ;</hi> thence inferring, <hi>His Body to be but
only as a Cloak or a Garment which a Man
wears, which he may throw off or put on again
without any alteration in his Person or Nature,</hi>
p. 237, 238. In this he perversly strains
the Simily (a Man's Cloak has no feeling to
suffer with him when he is bruised or
wounded) and he is partial still, in not
taking notice of the Answer to <hi>F. Bugg</hi> even
in this very Point. See <hi>Charitable Essay,</hi>
p. 2. thus given, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <q>As to <hi>J. P.</hi>'s Words chiefly objected,
<hi>That we cannot call the Bodily Garment, Christ.</hi>
The word <hi>Garment</hi> I take to be only a
figurative manner of speaking, as the
word <hi>Vail,</hi> which is his Flesh is, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 20. An Ingenuous Man would allow
him his own meaning as he explains it;
namely, <hi>That we cannot call the Body (which
he took upon him) <hi>Chiefly</hi> and in the <hi>First
Place</hi> Jesus Christ.</hi> It not being first,
nor the intire Christ, because he was the
Son of God, and consequently Christ,
before he took upon him that Body, even
when God created all things by. Jesus

               <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p>And after several Arguments in p. 3, 4.
proving the Divinity and Pre-existence of
Christ the Son of God, before he assumed
the Body, the general Consequence dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from the Premises, is, <q>That the
Names Jesus and Christ chiefly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
belong to <hi>Him</hi> that took the
Body, though sometimes given to each
and to both.</q>
            </p>
            <p>25. <hi>False again,</hi> That the Quakers say or
make the Flesh of Christ of an earthly, perishing
Nature, <hi>p. 238. from</hi> F. Bugg<hi>'s, saying
(against</hi> J. P.) That which he (<hi>Christ</hi>) took
upon him (<hi>i. e.</hi> his Body) was our Garment,
even the Flesh and Blood of our Nature, which
IS of an earthly, perishing Nature; <hi>falsly
adding,</hi> and is perished by their Account,
<hi>p. 238. Thus from</hi> Bugg<hi>'s Authority and
Citation against us; but takes no notice of
the Answer in the said</hi> Charitable Essay, <hi>p. 4.
in these Words,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>He (i. e. F. B.</hi> and now his Disciple
the Author of the <hi>Snake</hi>) hath here noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
wronged the People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
by imposing a false Creed upon
them. Where do they say, <hi>That Christ's
Body either was or is of an earthly perishing
Nature?</hi> I utterly deny the Charge, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43872:83"/>
                  <hi>F. B.</hi> also to be our Creed-maker, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struer
or Expositor, who hath unjustly
inferr'd this upon us from <hi>Is. Pennington</hi>'s
saying, <hi>He took upon him the Flesh and
Blood of our Nature, which is of an earthly
perishing Nature.</hi> Whereby neither he
nor the Quakers say, That Christ's Body
either <hi>was</hi> or <hi>is</hi> of an <hi>earthly perishing</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for his Flesh saw <hi>no</hi> Corruption,
therefore did not perish; tho' our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
our Flesh and Blood be of an earthly
perishing Nature, <hi>so</hi> is not Christ's. I
cannot rationally suppose that <hi>J. P.</hi> ever
intended that Christ's Body (which on
Earth did not corrupt) <hi>is</hi> of an earthly
perishing Nature now in Heaven as ours
is now on Earth; (take his Words also
Grammatically) for it is such an absurdity
as I cannot think ever entred into <hi>Is. Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington</hi>'s
Heart, being a Man both of
Learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sense and Conscience; <hi>[The
Flesh and Blood of our Nature]</hi> being ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
next to <hi>[which is of an earthly perishing
Nature]</hi> Therefore <hi>[perishing]</hi> appears
only relative to <hi>Flesh and Blood,</hi> as 'tis
ours and in us, and not to Christ's Body
which <hi>is</hi> incorruptible and glorious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>26. The People called Quakers neither
<hi>account that the Body of Christ perished, vanished
or was annihilated,</hi> as said, p. 238. but that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43872:84"/>
'twas changed so as to be a glorious, celestial
Body.</p>
            <p>27. <hi>'Tis not true in his Sense,</hi> That the
Quakers think that the Name of Christ does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to every one of them, not only more than to
that Body now, but as well as to it while upon the
Earth; <hi>quoting</hi> Bugg<hi>'s</hi> New Rome. <hi>Again,</hi>
Doth not the Name Christ belong to the whole
Body, and to every Member of the Body, as
well as to the Head? <hi>A Question, p.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>Thus one Adversary credits and promotes
the Authority of another to reproach us,
without taking notice of our full Answers
already given. Oh! disingenuous, as in
this very Point. In the said <hi>Charitable Essay,</hi>
p. 4. in these Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> Doth not the Name belong to the

Christ's, by their Doctrin, as believing Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No, that's not our Doctrin;
there's one Body, and so but one Christ,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. But turn the Question into
<hi>F. B.</hi>'s contrary Doctrin implied, and then
'tis <hi>The Name Christ belongs not to the whole
Body, Christ's Body (i. e.</hi> his Church)
<hi>is not Anointed; it therefore hath no right to
his Name nor any Member thereof;</hi> but then
doth not this appear contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's
Doctrin, <hi>viz. For as the Body is one
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43872:84"/>
and hath many Members, and all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Body, which is one, though they be
many, yet are but one Body; even so is Christ,</hi>
1 Cor. 12. 12. The Protestant Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Bible are, <hi>That
we might be one Body with Christ, and the
whole Church one Christ.</hi> And on <hi>Ephes.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Not Equally, because he is the
Head. 2. Not Literally to be so named,
but vertually and spiritually (<hi>i. e.</hi> as by
inward Participiation) and so <hi>truly,</hi> with
respect to that divine Power and Spirit,
whereby both the <hi>Head</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> are
Anointed (and united) and each Member
partakes thereof in some measure. But
Christ, the Head in all things, has the
Preheminence, he was <hi>Anointed</hi> (more
eminently) in Fulness, his Members in
part or measure by the same Spirit and

            </q>
            <p>I think this Answer to <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> may fully
Answer his Disciple the Author of the
<hi>Snake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>28. From <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s saying, <hi>Christ is the
Elect;</hi> our Adversary infers, <hi>And the Elect
are Christ, they make them convertible Terms,</hi>
p. 239. They are not so made by us nor by
<hi>G. F.</hi> in the place quoted, <hi>Gr. Myst.</hi> p. 88.
but the contrary; tho' there he saith, <hi>Christ
is the Elect whom God upholds;</hi> He also saith,
<hi>Christ knows his, and said he had other Sheep,
and he knew All the Elect; and who receive him
and are in him, are the Elect.</hi> There's no such
Words in the place quoted as <hi>that the Elect
are Christ.</hi> Thus the plain Scripture is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
which <hi>G. F.</hi> refers to, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:43872:85"/>
29. He again quotes <hi>Gr. Myst.</hi> p. 207.
<hi>That God's Christ is not distinct from his Saints.</hi>
Here the Man unfairly leaves out what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>viz. For he is within them, their Spirits
witness him,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein 'tis plain, he
means Christ is not <hi>divided</hi> or <hi>separate</hi> from
his Saints. He takes <hi>distinct from,</hi> in a kind
of common Acceptation, for <hi>divided</hi> or <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from.</hi> Here he cavils about Words
or a Mode of speaking, and then draws his
hard Consequences. As</p>
            <p>30. The grossest Absurdities, highest Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
and that <hi>G. F.</hi> could find no difference,
no distinction at all betwixt Christ and himself:
<hi>Which appears a perverse and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Calumny. As doth the next,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>31. <hi>That All the divine Attributes should be
given to</hi> G. F. <hi>as well as unto Christ; and that</hi>
G. F. <hi>does assume the Stile and Names of Christ
to himself,</hi> &amp;c. The Man here quoting his
own Authority in his Sect. 5. and there
<hi>F. B.</hi>'s, both which we deny. They have
injuriously abused <hi>G. F.</hi> and others in this
Matter, who neither calls himself <hi>The Door
that ever was, nor the same Christ yesterday,
to day, and for ever;</hi> (he speaks this of
Christ, not of himself;) neither did the
Quakers call him the <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Star,</hi> &amp;c.
as <hi>Bugg</hi> and the <hi>Snake</hi> have basely asperst
him and others, Sect. 5. p. 41, 43. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:43872:86"/>
These Calumnies and perverse Abuses are
sufficiently detected in several Answers to
<hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and in <hi>Just Enquiry into the Libeller's
Abuse.</hi> And tho' we deny that those divine
Attributes given to Christ may be given to
any mortal Man, yet divers Names given to
Christ are given to Saints also; as the <hi>Son of
God,</hi> the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> Luke 3. 28. John 1.
12. Rom. 8. 14 <hi>The Light of the World,</hi>
John 8. 12. Mat. 5. 14. <hi>The Salt of the Earth,</hi>
Mat. 5. 13. <hi>The Righteousness of God,</hi> 1 Cor.
1. 30. 2 Cor. 5. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Kings, Priests, Prophets,
Apostles, Ministers, The Seed, The Good Seed,
Anointed, Elect,</hi> given both to Christ and
his faithful Followers. But it may be said,
These are not all properly divine Attributes:
However, they are such as are given both to
Christ, and his Brethren and Members the
Saints, and true Followers of God: But
<hi>The Image and Glory of God,</hi> I presume will
be assented to be no less than <hi>divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi>
or importing the same, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Blasphemy or Idolatry, Man (whose
Head Christ is) is called <hi>The Image and Glory
of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not in any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to Christ, though the same Epithets
or Characters do properly belong to him,
<hi>Heb. 1. 3. 2 Cor. 4 4. Col.</hi> 1. 15. yet given
also to Man, because indued with (or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating
of) God's Image in Christ Jesus;
but we confess some divine Attributes and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43872:86"/>
Names are given, as only proper to Christ,
and not to Men or Saints; as, <hi>The Wisdom
and Power of God, The Word of God, A Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Spirit, The only begotten Son of God, The
Messiah, The very Christ, The Prince of Life
and Peace; The Mighty God, The Everlasting
Father,</hi> &amp;c. these are only intended and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to Christ.</p>
            <p>32. We do not find <hi>Blasphemy or Idolatry</hi>
excused, or any fair pretence used for the
same by <hi>W. P.</hi> in the place quoted (<hi>i. e,</hi>
11 Ch. <hi>Of the Invalidity of</hi> John Faldoe<hi>'s Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>)

            <p>The nameless Author of the <hi>Snake in the

and great Spite against the People called
Quakers in general, and divers Particulars
by Name; now, to compleat his Design of

the Tail of his Work, and have a fling and
sit of Hissing like an angry Snake, or as one

against the said <hi>G. W.</hi> I being the Person
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43872:87"/>
aim'd at, may now briefly answer for Truth
and for my self, as concerned.</p>
            <p>1. The word <hi>Creed</hi> he imposes upon me:
'Twas no formal Creed or Summary of our
Faith, tho' real Truths by way of Positions
in the affirmative, as a Christian Testimony,
in direct Opposition to <hi>F. B.</hi>'s great Abuse,
false Charge and Perversions, which with a
negative Testimony against him therein, are
both adapted to answer his own Terms,
Words and Phrases, that our Testimony
and Positions might be the more apparent
against his Abuse and Perversions; for I
know no Adversary that I find Fault with,
but I can freely and in good Conscience as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
my own Sense in the Matters in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
as well as oppose his, though it
be not in the manner of a formal <hi>Creed,</hi> yet
true in it self; for we should have nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Creeds,</hi> if all Positions we write in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to Opposers, must be esteemed
<hi>Creeds,</hi> or Summaries and Confessions of
our Faith; nevertheless, we believe what
we assert and vindicate in each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
            <p>My Accuser presently shews his Prejudice
and Enmity against me without cause, <hi>As
with a new Confession of Faith, in such dubious
and general Terms, as may at first sight deceive
the unwary Reader;</hi> though I gave it in as
plain and as much in scriptural Terms as I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43872:87"/>
could, and as the Matters concerned would
admit of. And I know my own Sincerity
therein better than my Accuser, who insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
calls me <hi>Honest George,</hi> whilst he is
aspersing me and casting Dirt at me, as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
keeping off contradicting the Heart of
the Heresie, still preserving it safe and untouch'd;
and not only so, but often with a slily, insinuated
Excuse and Defence of it,</hi> p. 244. So that
my confessing <hi>Jesus to be the Christ, and
both his coming in the Flesh and in the Spirit,</hi>
according to holy Scripture-Testimony,
and also to the <hi>Holy Scriptures of the Old and
New Testament, namely, the Holy Doctrin and
divine Precepts therein, as given by divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration</hi>
(on which much of my said Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
against <hi>F. Bugg</hi> depends;) this hath
no better Acceptance or Resentment with
my Accuser, than as <hi>no Contradiction to the
Heart of Heresie, but as still preserving it safe
and untouch'd;</hi> and which is worse, <hi>a slily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated
Excuse and Defence of it.</hi> Oh sad
Stuff! Whither will not Pride and Envy
precipitate some Men? What scripturally
to confess <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
(as above) is this no Contradiction
to Heresie? But to preserve, excuse or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it? What's Heresie than, pray? Is it
to confess Jesus Christ come in the Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
according to holy Scripture-Testimony of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43872:88"/>
him? Oh! for shame, leave off such blind
Envy and blasphemous Abuse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now to come to the Point, How or
wherein have</hi> I slily insinuated Excuse and
Defence of it (<hi>i. e.</hi> of the Heart of Hersie, <hi>as
before?) p.</hi> 244. Thus (<hi>saith my Accuser</hi>)
in his first Article he confesses Jesus to be the
Christ, even the same Jesus Christ who was
born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I confess this is part of my Confession,
but cannot believe this is either not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to the Heart of Heresie, or that it
is any Excuse or Defence of it. Nor that
our confessing God or Christ to be our
Light, can be any such Excuse or Defence.
Neither do we attribute the Name <hi>Christ</hi> to
any (much less <hi>to every one) of our selves,</hi> as
we are often falsly accused, as here, p. 245.
Whence he also most unjustly infers, <hi>That
then this will appear that this Confession of</hi>
Whitehead<hi>'s is a meer Fallacy, while it attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<hi>no more</hi> to Jesus Christ than to</hi> G. W.
p. 245.</p>
            <p>Which is a very foul and absurd Falshood
and notorious Lie in Fact, and contradiction
to my said Confession (even so far as 'tis ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by himself as before) which is, <q>1. We
sincerely own, profess and confess Jesus to
be the Christ, even the same Jesus Christ
who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> in <hi>Judea, Mat.</hi> 2. suffered
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43872:88"/>
Death upon the Cross without the Gates
of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was quickened and raised
again by the Power of God, and ascended
into Heaven and Glory, according to the
Scriptures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now have I herein attributed no more to
Jesus Christ than to my self, as he saith?
Where did I ever attribute this to my self?
Where's the meer Fallacy? Not in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to Jesus Christ, but in this horrid
Abuse and gross Perversion thereof. Did I
ever say that I am Jesus Christ? Or, that I
was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi> Or, that I
suffered Death upon the Cross at <hi>Jerusalem?</hi>
&amp;c. Oh! for shame, who cannot see such
Malice and Madness as my Adversary has
vented against me in this Matter?</p>
            <p>Again, I find no Fallacy in my Confession
to Christ, as without; nor is there any, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
I had denied the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (of
whom Christ was born) to be without, or
<hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to be
without us; nor doth Christ, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
prove him not to be our Light within;
for the same Christ said, <hi>I am the Light of
the World;</hi> therefore he is our Light, <hi>yea
the Quakers Light</hi> (as he calls it) they being
included in the World. Does not the Sun
shine in our Houses, because the Body and
Fulness of it is without them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:43872:89"/>
My Accuser quibbles and quarrels with
<hi>Art.</hi> 10. of my Confession, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
do not teach that the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

the Head.</q> And here he leaves out all the

p. 47. But even in the same 10 <hi>Art.</hi> quoted
against me, I do not allow any Member to
be called <hi>Christ,</hi> but expresly dissallow it,
though I confess how Christians have
some Interest in his Name, but not to be
called <hi>Jesus,</hi> but Christians. The explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
part of my Confession in the said 10th
Article, disingenuously left out by this Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
is in these Words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>But that the
divine Anointing (to which Name Christ
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43872:89"/>
hath relation) virtually is in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
or degree afforded to every Member
of his Body, but not so amply as to him
the Head; <hi>nor for any Member to be called
Christ, but a Christian;</hi> because Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Anointing the Holy Spirit
not by measure, but in fulness; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is the Head of the Body, the
Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And this very Matter is more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
in my <hi>Charitable Essay,</hi> in Answer to
<hi>F. Bugg,</hi> p. 4. as before. It was far from
my Thoughts or Intention to imply any
such thing, as <hi>That I am Christ as well as
Jesus;</hi> for I have often written my self <hi>A
Servant-of Christ;</hi> and so I am, I humbly
bless his Name that's above every Name.
Therefore I am still very unjustly accused
with <hi>rank Sophistry, dodging and deluding,
and casting a Mist before the Eyes of poor deluded
People, or leading them into the Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
or of any Equivocating or Jesuitical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith,</hi> as foully and unjustly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
p. 246, 247. I have a Conscience
towards God in what I confess, and in good
Conscience testifie, That thou my scornful,
lurking Adversary, hast cast manifold false
and gross Defamations upon me, and many
others of my Christian Persuasion.</p>
            <p>And in the true Sense of Scripture, I have
both confess'd Christ's coming in the Flesh,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43872:90"/>
and as he <hi>the Word</hi> was made (or took) Flesh, <hi>Jo.</hi>
1. 14. And more than the <hi>Socinians,</hi> I do still
confess, <hi>That as the reasonable Soul and Body is
One Man, so He that is God and Man is One
Christ.</hi> And whether this will give Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to an implacable Adversary or no, I
value not; knowing my Conscience clear in
the Sight of him who judgeth righteously,
which I am sure this my unjust Judge and
false Accuser is not, who presently after he
has stil'd me <hi>Honest George,</hi> unjustly brands
me with Infamy, as <hi>Sophistry, Delusion,
Depths of Satan, Mystery of Iniquity, Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
Jesuitical Confession,</hi> &amp;c. Oh! rank
Malice, bitter Envy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for my Confession in the 7th <hi>Art.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
against me, it stands good and true,
<hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>We own no such saying, as that the
Holy Doctrin or Divine Precepts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
is either Dust, Death, or the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's
Meat, but truly profitable to us by
the Assistance of God's Holy Spirit given
to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And this was in direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s saying, <hi>These Quakers, who
pretend to own the Precepts and Doctrin of the
Bible to be holy and blessed, yet say 'tis Dust
and Death, the Serpent's Meat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Apol.
Introd.</hi> p. 18. to his <hi>New Rome.</hi> [We do
not believe any of these Quakers ever so said
of the Precepts and Doctrin, nor do they
own any such Saying, I wholly disown it.]
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43872:90"/>
But then to beg the Question, <hi>What was it
you called Dust and Serpent's Meat? Was it
nothing else but the Ink and Paper? Did any
Body ever say, That these were not Dust? Or,
Is that any part of the Controversie betwixt us?</hi>
Snake p. 249. Here he yields the Point;
he grants the Ink and Paper to be <hi>Dust.</hi> I
said, <hi>Will decay and turn to Dust;</hi> but so will
not the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> nor the <hi>Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
contain'd in Scripture.</hi> And it has been
confess'd by <hi>F. B.</hi> and others, That <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
is not ascrib'd <hi>to the Paper and Ink</hi> (or
Inky Characters) that will decay, but to the
<hi>Holy Doctrin</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> which will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
but be permanent and endure, and
therefore called the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Holy Matters therein contained.
That the Books and Writings in Ink and
Paper will wear out, so will not the <hi>Word,</hi>
is evident. <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> could
burn <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet's Roll or Book,
writ with Ink by <hi>Barach,</hi> but not the <hi>Word</hi>
of the Lord, nor properly the Words
thereof; for the same <hi>Word</hi> caused all the
former Words to be written again, after
the Roll was burnt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. If then the
Books, the Paper and Ink be combustible,
or will decay and turn to Dust, but not the
<hi>Word,</hi> nor the <hi>Doctrin;</hi> where's then the
Controversie indeed, when the same thing
is granted on both sides?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:43872:91"/>
He quotes <hi>Gr. Myst.</hi> p. 302. Sect. 11.
p. 146, 147. as saying, <hi>Paper and Ink is not
infallible, that will come to Dust;</hi> unto which
the <hi>Word, Christ</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> is preferred,
in the same place quoted. And in the said
<hi>Gr. Myst.</hi> p. 78. by Letter, he there means
<hi>Paper</hi> and <hi>Ink;</hi> but the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the thing
it speaks of, is <hi>spiritual,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> is <hi>Spirit.</hi>
And further, p. 127. the Scripture (or
Writing) it self, without the Spirit that
gave it forth, is a dead Letter in it self.
<hi>The Spirit is that that gave forth the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part, as I am not in the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to my self of the least Contempt of
Holy Scripture, nor yet of the Bible; for I
have always preferr'd it to all other Books
extant in the World, and more affected
Reading therein than any other Book, even
from my Childhood; and often bless divine
Providence for preserving to us the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
So I know of none among us guilty
of contemning them: Neither is what's
said, from any Contempt of Scripture, no
more than it is of the Earth and the Heavens,
to say, They shall wax old and perish,
but the <hi>Word</hi> that made them endureth,
<hi>Psal. 102. 25, 26. Heb.</hi> 1. 11, 12. But say
what we can in this Case to clear our selves
of any Contempt to the Holy Scripture,
this our uncharitable Judge and Accuser will
not believe us: He's bent to asperse, he
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43872:91"/>
has swallow'd down so much of the soure
Leaven of the Malice of a few false Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
Persecutors and Apostates, from
whom he derives much of his Authority;
and thus scurrilously and most falsly imposes
upon me, <hi>viz. And therefore</hi> George, <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all thy meally Modesty, it is; it is
indeed</hi> George, <hi>it is the very Doctrin of the
Scriptures which you blaspheme as Dust, and
Death, and Serpent's Meat, on purpose to bring
Men off from trying your pernicious Heresies by
those saecred Oracles,</hi> p. 250. This is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Abuse and Calumny, against my self
and others of us (to out-face us against our
very Sense and Consciences) and in good
Conscience I testifie against it; it never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into my Intention or Thoughts so to
blaspheme the Doctrin of the Scriptures, as
to term or deem it Dust, Death or Serpent's
Meat: The Lord rebuke this lying; envious
Spirit.</p>
            <p>Neither do <hi>I vilifie the written Doctrin and
Precepts of God, in comparison of our New
Light</hi> (as he falsly calls it) p. 250, 251.
but reverently esteem them: The Man
makes no Conscience of defaming us. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we <hi>quarrel with the Law and the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
nor yet with Writing or Scripture,
as 'tis in <hi>Ink or Paper,</hi> but distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Writing</hi> and the <hi>Things written,</hi>
which is no Contempt to either. We are
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43872:92"/>
thankful to Divine Providence for both the
Scripture, or Writing, and the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
and Divine Precepts therein written;
for they testifie unto Christ our Light, and
our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight to the Truth of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to what he saith,</hi>-If any do not teach the
same, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to the Law and the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
or written Word, it is because there is no
Light in them, <hi>Isa. 8. 20. And then puts
this Emphasis upon it,</hi> No Light, George!
Mark that: Your false Pretences to the Light
within are here over-rul'd, <hi>p.</hi> 251.</p>
            <p>I deny that our Pretences to the Light
within is either false or here over-rul'd; if
they speak not according to this Word, it is
because there is <hi>no Morning</hi> to them. If he'll
see the Note from the Hebrew in some Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
he may see <hi>no Morning</hi> in the Margin
over against <hi>no Light:</hi> Then let him Mark
that. But is there no Light in the Creation
before Morning, either inward or outward,
pray? Did not the Light shine in Darkness,
before it shined out of Darkness? And had
not the Believers a more sure Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
whereunto they did well to take
heed, as unto a Light shining in a dark
Place, until the Day dawned and the Day-star
arose in their Hearts? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.
And are not many reproved by the Light
them in, for telling Lies and speaking contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Word? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore there
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43872:92"/>
was some true Light in them, before the
Morning appeared to them.</p>
            <p>And tho' my Accuser says, <hi>These, and
such-like Texts, detect and explode the miserable.
Ignorance and Blasphemy of these Pretenders to
Light.</hi> For which we have his own <hi>ipse dixit,</hi>
and much such Raillery, but know no plain
Texts of Scripture yet produced by him,
that so detects us; but his own Falshood and
great Ignorance about the Light, is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, he falsly defames and reprobaches
me, from p.</hi> 28. Of Innocency Triumphant,
<hi>with</hi> excusing and justifying Diabolical Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
in the Quaker-Refuge (<hi>he saith</hi>) against
the Authority of the sacred Scripture, <hi>by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
That it questioned but some, not all,
<hi>p.</hi> 252.</p>
            <p>This Accuser has a most odious, injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
course of defaming and perverting, as
well as curtalizing our Words, wherein he
has taken part with his famous Author
<hi>F. Bugg,</hi> to whom the Answer was given,
on which he grounds his black Charge against
me, <hi>Of justifying Diabolical Suggestions,</hi> &amp;c.
In which Answer I expresly declare thus,
<hi>viz. His Accusation that the Quakers insinuate,
in a Book called</hi> The Quakers Refuge, <hi>That
<hi>What</hi> the true Prophets spake was false, and
<hi>What</hi> the false Prophets spoke was true,</hi> p. 47. <hi>New
Rome Vnm.</hi> p. 23. We disown these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43872:93"/>
and I think they are not duly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from the said Book, questioning
whether <hi>Some Words were not spoken by wicked
Men, some by wise Men, ill applied; some by
good Men, ill expressed,</hi> &amp;c. Now, at my
saying, <hi>Yet this questioned but of some Words in
Scri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ture, not all;</hi> he takes occasion to Rail
fearfully against me, as a <hi>Justifier of Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Suggestions.</hi> When my Answer was
not with the least intent to oppose or lessen
the Authority of the Sacred Scriptures;
but in direct opposition to <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
in these general, odious and false
Expressions, <hi>viz. That the Quakers insinuate,
that <hi>What</hi> the true Prophets spake, was false.</hi>
Which Expression we utterly deny, as both
in themselves grosly false, against the true
Prophets, and falsly charged on the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
to defame them.</p>
            <p>And as to the Questions cited out of the
<hi>Quak. Refuge,</hi> at which Offence is taken,
1. They are not mine. 2. I do not believe
they are the Author's of that <hi>Quak Refuge,</hi>
tho' cited by him. 3. It is apparent he
does not espouse them as his own Judgment,
nor make them the Matter in that present
Controversie, nor resolve them in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative;
but seems to recite and wave
them, as Originally proceeding from some
other Person, as I understand. The fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
that can be drawn from my said An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43872:93"/>
to <hi>F. B.</hi> that may seem offensive (which
I should be sorry for, if 'twere really so) is
my seeming to grant the Question, <hi>That in
some Words some true Prophets were mistaken.</hi>
And if this be made an Offence, I think 'tis
no real one, for I designed none: However,
I still confess, <hi>I believe the Record of Scripture
to be true.</hi> Good Men, and some true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
also, have been and may be mistaken
in some things, and have had their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
and Failings truly recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
and also their Deliverances, for
good Ends and Admonition to others. Was
not <hi>Samuel</hi> a good Man and a Prophet, and
yet mistaken, when he took <hi>Eliab</hi> for the
Lord's Anointed? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16, 6. 7. And in
the Argument upon <hi>Job</hi> in the ancient Bible,
is marked, <q>
                  <hi>That</hi> Job <hi>maintaineth a good
Cause, but handleth it evil. Again, his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
have an evil Matter, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it craftily. Moreover, he was assured
that God had not rejected him; yet through his
great Torments and Afflictions, he burst forth
into many Inconveniences both of Words and
Sentences.</hi>
               </q> See the Argument at large.</p>
            <p>And was not the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> mistaken
when he thought himself alone, or none in
<hi>Israel</hi> but himself, that was zealous for the
Lord God of Hosts? But what saith the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of God unto him? <hi>I have reserved unto
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43872:94"/>
my self seven thousand Men, that have not
bowed the knee to Baal,</hi> 1 King. 19. 10, 18.
Rom. 11. 3, 4. And to say but little of
the Old Prophet that persuaded the Young
Prophet, contrary to the Word of the Lord,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. I could instance <hi>Jonas, David,</hi>
and several others that were good Men,
who had some Weaknesses and Mistakes in
Words and Actions, yet the Lord was good
to them and helped them, according to the
Integrity of their Hearts towards him. And
these Things being truly recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
for Instruction and Admonition, we
truly esteem the Scripture-Record thereof.
And even where the <hi>Words, Lies, Blasphemies</hi>
and Actions of the Devil, wicked Men and
Persecutors, and the Judgments which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel
them, are recorded in the Scriptures, we
own the Record or History thereof to be
true, and highly esteem it for Instruction
and Warning to Men. And to distinguish
between the Words of God in Scripture,
and the Words of the Devil, is but what
the Scripture it self doth, which can be no
Contempt to it; for I have known some
stumbled, by some of the Priests making
no distinction, but calling all that's written
in Scripture <hi>the Word of God;</hi> as one that
was the Mayor of <hi>Thetford</hi> near 40 Years
ago, told me, That a Priest wanting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43872:94"/>
into the vacant Benefice, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there for Approbation, took his Text
out of the Words wherewith the Devil
tempted Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. And bidding the
People hearken to the Word of God, as
they should find it written in such a Chapter
and Verfe; whereupon this Person that told
me of it was so offended, that he would not
give his Voice to chuse the said Priest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had told them, That was the Word
of God, which was the Words of the Devil.
Now let none be so disingenuous as to take
this as in Contempt of Holy Scripture, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
or Precepts therein; for where either
the Words, Blasphemies, wicked Actions
or Persecutions of the Devil or Men, are
therein mentioned, the Record thereof is
true, and in Testimony against them, and
the intent of such Record holy, just and
good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Farther my Accuser tells me,</hi> Nor is my
Salvo more ingenuous <hi>in the</hi> Eleventh Article.
<hi>And why so?</hi> It is really, say I, contrary to
our Faith and Principle, to make Christ Jesus
himself Only a Figure, a Veil or Garment,
<hi>p. 254. Which was in direct opposition to
his Author</hi> F. Bugg<hi>'s falsly saying,</hi> The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
would make Christ Only a Figure, a Veil,
a Garment, <hi>implied by way of Question,
p.</hi> 58. New Rome Ar. <hi>Here he quarrels
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43872:95"/>
with the word</hi> Only <hi>as with the word</hi> Amply,
<hi>and accuseth me with</hi> Equivocating, and that
this is but a Negative Confession: But really
<hi>George (quoth he</hi>) this is not re-assuming
your Christian Testimony in the Affirmative, as
thou didst promise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> still hiding your self in
the Dark in Negatives: But we would know
affirmatively, what it is you do profess; and this
thou didst promise, and this thou hast not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
<hi>p.</hi> 255, 256.</p>
            <p>Here he accuseth me with breach of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
but very falsly, as in the said 11th
Article is plain, that my Confession of Christ
Jesus himself, is not only Negative but
Affirmative, namely, <hi>He being the Substance
and End of all Figures, Types and Shadows.</hi>
Is not this Affirmative, pray? And as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from Truth is his accusing the <hi>Quakers
Books of calling Christ Jesus a Type or Figure
of their Light within,</hi> p. 263, 264. I know
no such Books of the Quakers that so call
Christ Jesus <hi>A Type of our Light within,</hi> but
that he is our Light, which hath inlighten'd
us among the rest of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It's implied by way of Question,</hi> That
Christ cloathed himself in Flesh and Blood, and
that he took Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for so (<hi>quoth he</hi>) it
may be said that our Soul is cloathed with our
Body, as with a Garment or Veil. It is not
Words; but the meaning that we contend about,
<hi>saith he, p.</hi> 257.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:43872:95"/>
We know best our own Meaning, being
well satisfied that 'tis according to Holy
Scripture. Where's then the difference?
He then quarrels with our Meaning, not
with the Words here, but elsewhere; he
doth as his Author <hi>F. Bugg</hi> has done with the
words <hi>Veil</hi> and <hi>Garment,</hi> in <hi>J. P.</hi>'s Question
to <hi>Professors:</hi> But this Author yields the
Point, he assents to both; <hi>As our Soul is
clothed with our Body, as with a Garment or
Veil;</hi> and so of Christ. Which warrants
<hi>J. P.</hi>'s Question against his Author <hi>F. B.</hi>
and himself, at least so far as not to make it
a Subject of any further Contention against
us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, my Accuser brings a heavy, black
Charge upon me in these Words,</hi> viz. In
this same 11th Article we are now upon, after
your full and Affirmative Declaration (<hi>before
he would have it Negative</hi>) you subborn Two
Texts as Favourers of your damnable Heresie
before-told, yet (say you, slily) his Flesh was
called the Veil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. And he took upon
him the form of a Servant, and was made like
unto Men, and was found in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Shape
or Figure of a Man, <hi>Phil. 2. 6, 7. And then
exclaims,</hi> Ah <hi>George! George!</hi> I could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
thee any thing but this: What<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put upon us
at this rate!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:43872:96"/>
It seems my citing those Two Texts, and
alledging them to prove that the word <hi>Veil</hi>
was applied to Christ's Flesh which he took
upon him, and the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Shape</hi> or
<hi>Figure</hi> of a Man, to the form of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
or outward Man, tho' I intended no
other than that, without the least Contempt
to Christ: Such Words might be used as
they had been by some of our Friends. For
this it seems I have committed such a heinous
and unpardonable Crime or Sin, as this my
severe Judge cannot forgive. This is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
as my highest Offence; and truly I
shall not need to seek to him for Absolution
or Pardon, nor to be my Confessor: I have
a merciful and faithful High Priest to apply
and appeal to; I need not go to unmerciful
and implacable Ones for Pardon; especially
such a one as has so shamefully calumniz'd
me with <hi>subborning Two Texts as Favourers of
damnable Heresie.</hi> How comes this Accuser,
in his Fallibility or Uncertainty, thus se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
to condemn me, when he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
Matter of Fact about the Two said
Texts, being alledged in behalf of my
Friend's meaning, and not at all with the
least Intention to lessen the Dignity or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Son of God? No, far be it from
me. And where's my unpardonable Sin in
the Application of the Text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2? Why
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43872:96"/>
he saith, <hi>George Whitehead brings in the word
Figure, which is not in the English Translation.</hi>
And what then? <hi>But let him have it, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
makes it synonimous to Shape,</hi> p. 263.
And he is forced to let me have it, because
he cannot well deny it, without Disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to himself. But herein he would place
on me a Mis-application of the Words,
<hi>[Who being found in the Shape or Figure of a
Man,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>And</hi> therefore saith, <hi>what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
has this to the calling Christ Jesus a Type
or Figure of their Light within, which I have
shewn above out of the Quakers Books?</hi> And I
have denied this as a Falshood before, and
now declare against his manifest Perversion
and Injury to me, and my Words herein.
For as I sincerely disown the Words charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>viz. The calling Christ Jesus a Type or
Figure of our Light within,</hi> I could not apply
the Words before in the Text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. to
have any relation thereto; much less as
proof of that which I never held: And I
know none of us that doth so call Jesus
Christ <hi>A Type of our Light within,</hi> he being
the Fountain thereof. Nor that Christ is
<hi>Only a Figure,</hi> as falsly charged by <hi>F. Bugg.</hi>
Which Perversion, so far as I can find, was
first forged from these Words, in the Book
<hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Errand;</hi> viz. <hi>Christ in the Flesh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them, is their Example or Figure; which is
both one.</hi> For his being their Example,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43872:97"/>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. &amp; 4. 1. &amp; 1. 15. &amp; <hi>John</hi>
13. 15. are quoted. See also <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 31.
he was called <hi>a Sign.</hi> Now hence to say he
was <hi>Only a Sign,</hi> were a gross Perversion;
Christ was our <hi>Example.</hi> Now hence to say
he was nothing else but an <hi>Example,</hi> were
an Abuse and to lessen his Dignity, and a
variation from the Sense; as our Adversary
has done upon Trust of his Author <hi>F. Bugg;</hi>
upon his false Report, which is besides all
Justice, Morality and judicial Proceedings.
Now the Question is, Whether <hi>Figure</hi> may
be made synonimous to <hi>Example,</hi> for the
words <hi>Example</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> as before? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it may. For <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> sometimes
points at a thing to come, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14.
who was the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Figure of him that was
to come. And sometimes <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
a present Example or Pattern, as in
<hi>Phil. 3. 17. Mark them which walk so, as ye
have us for</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Example.</hi> And the same
Word is used in 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 9. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12.
&amp; <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 7. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. only in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Cases, or Terminations. And the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>an Example or Type,</hi>
John 13. 15. Heb. 9. 23. Thus <hi>Example</hi> or
<hi>Type</hi> are made synonimous in <hi>T. C.</hi>'s Lexicon,
and the like in <hi>Crit. Sacr.</hi> but more fully
explain'd; for there <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplum,

2 Pet. 2. 6.</p>
            <p>i. e. <hi>Exemplum, Exemplar,</hi> hath a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Signification in Scripture. 1. It signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<hi>a Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of Things, either past
or to come. 2. An Example of Imitation.
3. An Example of Warning or Caution.</p>
            <p>Now see how synonimously the Terms
<hi>Type, Figure, Patern</hi> and <hi>Example,</hi> are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in Scripture, and of what extent, not
only in relation to the Types under the Law,
but in some respect to Christ and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
tho' he be also confessed to be the
Antitype, Substance and End of all Legal
Shadows, Types and Figures. But I have
not <hi>called Christ himself a Type of our Light
within,</hi> nor justified the same.</p>
            <p>As to my Accuser's Offence at my saying
<hi>Christ's Flesh is called the Veil,</hi> Heb. 10. 20. it
was to remove an Offence taken against my
Friend <hi>J. P.</hi> for using the same. And it
would have become this Adversary to have
forborn his blasphemous Scoffing at my
Light; as; <hi>George if thy Light has hitherto for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to tell thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c. I bless the Lord my God,
who is my Light, Life and Salvation; he
has shewn me the new and living way of the
New Covenant, which our blessed Lord
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43872:98"/>
and Saviour Jesus Christ consecrated, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
or set open through the Veil, that is
to say, his Flesh; yea, through his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Death, as being the Testator, he
hath enforced that New Testament or second
Covenant; he took away the first, that he
might establish the second; and so hath
open'd the Passage into eternal Life, into
the Hollest of Holies within the Veil, and
beyond all the Shadows and Veils under the
Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was in the most holy Place within the
second Veil in the Tabernacle, which was
called the</hi> Holiest of all <hi>in the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that</hi> the golden Censor and Ark of the
Testament were put, and the golden Pot which
had Manna, and <hi>Aaron's</hi> Rod that had bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and the Tables of the Testament, and over
the Ark the Cherubims of Glory shadowing the
Mercy-seat, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. Exod. 26. <hi>So the most
excellent things were within the Veil, tho'
there was a Beauty and Glory also without
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which, I doubt not were Shadows of
the New Covenant, and the spiritual Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
thereof in Christ Jesus, in whom
the <hi>most holy place</hi> of that divine Service and
Worship (in the New Covenant Sanctuary
which the Lord has placed in the midst of
his People) is <hi>in the Spirit and in the Truth.</hi>
And all our spiritual Blessings and heavenly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43872:98"/>
Treasures are in Christ Jesus, who is our
Sanctuary and Hiding-place.</p>
            <p>And it is in the inmost, or most inward
and spiritual Dispensation of <hi>the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
that Mercy and Forgiveness is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
and Christ most livingly and effectually
known to us and enjoyed; and in him the
most holy and heavenly Places, wherein the
true spiritual Believers sit down with him;
and as being washed from their Sins in his
Blood by his Spirit, are his Church and
Sanctuary also, and thereby have boldness
to enter into the holy Place, even by <hi>that
new and living Way</hi> (which Christ hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for us through the Veil, that is to
say, his Flesh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.) that we may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him therein into <hi>Heaven</hi> it self. And
what entrance through Christ our Mediator
we have here in measure received into this
new and living Way, and holy and heavenly
Places in him, we doubt not but it is to us
an Earnest of a more full Enjoyment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Glory hereafter, with Christ Jesus
our Fore-runner, Leader and Captain of our
Salvation, we continuing faithful to the end
in this his new and living Way, as true and
constant Followers of him.</p>
            <p>God in his great Love and Wisdom has
afforded several Dispensations, one higher
and more glorious than another, in
order to bring Man nearer and nearer
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43872:99"/>
to himself; as that of the Law, and of
Shadows and Types; that of the Prophets;
that of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist;</hi> that of Christ in
the Flesh, and that of Christ in the Spirit
and New Covenant, which is higher, more
powerful and more glorious than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and therein a more clear knowledge
of Christ than in all the former, wherein
there was some Sight of him through Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and Veils, but by his divine Light
shining in our Hearts God is pleased to give
us the Light of the knowledge of his Glory
in the Face of his dear Son Christ Jesus, that
we all with open Face, as in a Glass, may
behold the Glory of God, and be changed
into the same Image from Glory to Glory,
as by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.
&amp; Ch. 4. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' our Adversary has made a
deal of Dispute and Quarrel with us about
calling <hi>Christ's Flesh the Veil,</hi> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
yet he is fain to grant, <hi>That Christ's Body is
called a Veil in relation to its Type, the Veil of
the Temple,</hi> p. 262, 263. but he'll have this
<hi>not to be in the Quakers Sense. They call it a
Veil; that is</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Garment, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinction
to its being Christ's Substance, and
of his Nature,</hi> p. 262. Whereas its rather
in contradistinction to its Being, his Divine
Natnre, or to its being in the first place,
or <hi>principally</hi> or <hi>chiefly</hi> Christ himself (who is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43872:99"/>
the Son of God) for whom the Body was
prepared, because he did pre-exit it, or
was in Being before he took upon him that
Body, even in his Father's Glory before the
World began, wherewith he is glorified.
However, <hi>the Veil,</hi> which was <hi>Christ's Flesh,</hi>
(through which he set open the new and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Way) we never deny to be Christ's
Body, or to be a real Body, but own it was;
and never believed it to be a Fantastical
Body, as I have often said; but that Christ
the Son of God took upon him real Flesh
and Blood of our Nature, yet pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt
in him. And as his Flesh was called
<hi>the Veil,</hi> it answers its Type or Figure,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the Veil of the most Holy Place, or
Oracle where God gave Answers, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
6. 20. &amp; 8. 6, 8. &amp; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 10, 16. And
these <hi>most Holy Places</hi> in the Tabernacle and
Temple, being Places of divine Service,
then peculiar to the High Priest to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
their Antitype is in Christ Jesus, the
New Covenant, where in the Spirit and in
the Truth, God is truly worshipped, and
meets with (and speaks to) his People, even
by Christ Jesus their High Priest, who is
present in the midst of his Church and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of his People, the true and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Worshippers, who meet in his Name,
Spirit and Power, whose Light and Truth
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43872:100"/>
brings its Followers unto his Holy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 43. 3.</p>
            <p>And as to Christ's Substance and Nature,
what does our Opposer mean thereby?
How has he distinguished in this Point?
Christ has in him a <hi>divine Nature,</hi> as well as
that of <hi>Man,</hi> which he hath also in the
purest Sense. But which is the greatest?
Is not the divine Nature, the <hi>Deity</hi> in him,
greater than the Manhood? As he said, <hi>My
Father is greater than all, greater than I,</hi>
John 10. 29. Nevertheless, as our great
and <hi>only Mediator and Intercessor,</hi> it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
he should be Man, as he is the most
glorious, heavenly Man; and as the Christ
of God he is spiritually <hi>in</hi> us, <hi>in</hi> his Saints
and Members, in some measure, by his Spirit,
Light, Life and Power, even as the <hi>incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible,
immortal Seed</hi> in Man is of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost; and therein all true
spiritual Believers do in measure partake of
the divine Nature, being born again of this
incorruptible Seed.</p>
            <p>The gross Calumnies, cruel Mockeries,
false Stories and Perversions of the Author
of <hi>The Snake in the Grass,</hi> are therein so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous;
together with his partial picking,
nibling, mincing and carping at our Books,
which is so perverse, and much on't so silly,
that I confess many of them are waved in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43872:100"/>
this Answer, as not worthy of spending
more precious time about them; and I shall
leave the said Author to the just Judgment
of him that judghth righteously, wishing
his Repentance before it be too late.</p>
            <p>And tho' he sculks and hides himself, as
if he were afraid or ashamed to own his
Work with his Name to it; so am not I of
my Name or Vindication; tho' I be (and
expect to be) reproached and misrepresented

            <head>A BRIEF
EXAMINATION
OF
Some Passages,
IN THE
Second Book of the Author
OF
The Snake in the Grass:
FALSLY STILED,
Satan dis-rob'd from his Disguise of Light:
Or, The Quakers last Shift to cover
their monstrous Heresies, laid fully open.</head>
            <p>WHEN I looked upon the
Title of the said Book, sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Satan dis-rob'd from his
Disguise of Light:</hi> With this additional re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
Title; <hi>Or, The Quakers last Shift
to cover their monstrous Heresies;</hi> and being
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43872:102"/>
               <hi>By the Author of the Snake in the Grass,</hi> I did
suppose it to be the Second Part to the same
Tune, or much of the same Nature with
the former, full of Bitterness and Scorn, by
the reviling Title, and no fair Reply to
<hi>T. Ellwood</hi>'s Answer; and so it appears;
and I expect will be made farther appear,
if <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> deems it worth the while to
undertake it. But that which appear'd most
strange to me and some others, was, in the
Title of the said Book, it is thus declared;
<hi>Which also may serve for a Reply (as to the
main Points of Doctrin) to</hi> Geo. Whitehead<hi>'s
Answer to the Snake in the Grass; to be published
the end of the next Month, if this prevent it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which appeared very strange to me, and
the Man's presumptive Falshood the greater,
I having a great part of the Copy of my
Answer to <hi>The Snake in the Grass</hi> in my
Hands, when I first saw these Words in
Print; and the rest of my Copy then in the
Printers Hands, which we did not hear they
lent him to make Reply to; and when I lookt
over his Book, I neither found any repetition
of my Answer, nor Reply thereto. However
he's so confident and boasting in his own
Work, that he takes it for granted, That
not only the Quakers are put to their last
Shift, but also that this pretended Reply to
<hi>T. Ellwood</hi>'s Answer to <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s Narrative,
may also serve for a Reply to <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43872:102"/>
Answer to <hi>The Snake in the Grass:</hi> Which
would seem a cunning Piece of Divination
indeed, to Reply to a Book before he sees it
or knows it. But if he will still have his
said Reply a sufficient Reply thereunto, he
may go on in's own Conceit, and save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a further Labour of Replying, lest he
give himself the Lie, by giving the World
to understand that what he has said may
serve for a Reply to <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
may not serve for a Reply.</p>
            <p>However, he seems to have taken upon
himself a heavy Task, in being an Advocate
for <hi>George Keith;</hi> and more heavy, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the Contradictions charged upon
him by <hi>Tho. Ellwood, John Pennington</hi> and
his Brother <hi>Edward,</hi> and partly for <hi>Baptists</hi>
and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and all against the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
in his Reply; but very partial in carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at our Words and Answers in many
places, without taking notice of the unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
Expressions, Absurdities and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
of our Adversaries, and yet in
general Terms excuses them; but in no small
Contradiction to himself, and the sad Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
and ill Characters he has given in his
<hi>Snake in the Grass,</hi> 2nd Part, Sect. 3. pag.
17. 18. both of <hi>Presbyter, Anabaptist, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
Quaker,</hi> &amp;c. as all under <hi>Enthusiasm,
of</hi> Rome's <hi>dressing in several Shapes and Forms,
and as a plentiful Harvest of</hi> Rome<hi>'s reaping,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43872:103"/>
But now he can advocate and take part with
any of them against the Quakers, like some
mercinary Soldier of Fortune.</p>
            <p>I do not intend to spend much time here
to Answer his said Reply, though 'tis no
great Difficulty to do; but to take notice of
a few Passages in it, wherein I and some
others are concerned, and injurionsly dealt
with therein.</p>
            <p>1. My excepting against that made Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<hi>Co-creator,</hi> as used by the Baptist,
telling of God being <hi>Co-creator</hi> with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I confess I am no more reconciled to
the Expression now, than I was when first I
questioned it as unscriptural; whereby I
never intended not to allow the <hi>Word</hi> to be
God, or to the Son of God, as I am most
injuriously accused, p. 2. For divers of my
ancient and first Writings in Print shew the
contrary, that I own <hi>the Word</hi> to be <hi>God,</hi>
and Creator too. But the Phrase <hi>God Co-creator
with God,</hi> I think still implies Two Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and consequently Two Gods. 'Tis
not the Particle <hi>co with,</hi> in this Case, will
excuse the Matter, for <hi>co</hi> or <hi>con</hi> is <hi>simul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
as Co-workers, <hi>Co-partners,</hi> which
are more distinct Agents than one: But the
<hi>Creator</hi> is but <hi>one God, one Word, one Spirit,</hi>
and so <hi>one Creator.</hi> But this invented word
<hi>Co-creator</hi> was brought by the Baptists for
proof <hi>That the Light in Man, wherewith the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43872:103"/>
word God as Co-creator lighteth every Man, is
the Light of Reason, the Light of Nature,</hi> &amp;c.
consequently but <hi>a created Light;</hi> which I
deny. Seeing that it is the same Life that was
in the Word, that was the Light of Men,
<hi>John</hi> 1. 4. What good Doctrin or good
Sense were it then to say, That the word
God was Co-creator with the Father of his
own Life, Light and Power: And no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sense can I make of the Baptist's Notion
of the Light in this Case, nor of this Man's
excusing him. Besides, a learn'd and
more moderate and ingenuous Person, has
lately made the like Exception against the
word <hi>Co-creator</hi> in a printed Paper, called,
<hi>Reflections upon some Passages in</hi> G. Keith<hi>'s
Narrative;</hi> where he saith,</p>
            <p>
               <q>It seems to me that the word <hi>Co-creator</hi>
might justly be rejected by <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi>
being a word neither us'd in the Holy
Scriptures, nor by any of the ancient
Councils; and it seems to import a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
that there are Two Efficients of the
Creation, one having a creative Power di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the other.</q> Yet, withal, he is
pleased to give this gentle Reflection on me
by the way. <q>Tho' <hi>G. W.</hi> has not spoken
with that Caution and Accuracy which he
should have us'd in a Matter of so grand
Importance;</q> which I do the more easily
bear from him because of his Moderation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:43872:104"/>
Suppose that in some Passages, in some of
my former Writings, as to the Circumstance
of Words or Expressions, there may be some
Deficiency, or want some Explication or
Distinction, or something dubious, and
the Particulars thereof were shewn me, I
hope I should not be wanting to give my
Explication to the Satisfaction of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and Ingenuous. As to the Matters
intended by me, I know the Lord gave me
a true Sense and Sight, by his Power, in
my young and early Years, he having inclined
my Heart after him from my Youth, I bless
his Holy Name.</p>
            <p>The same Person whom I cited before,
goes on, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>I do not conceive that he,
(<hi>i. e. G. W.</hi>) denies either the Divinity
or Humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ:
The Father is Creator, the Son Creator,
the Holy Ghost Creator; and yet they are
not Three Creators, but One Creator.</q>
Thus he: Consequently, not properly
called <hi>Co-creators;</hi> for that would imply
Three Creators.</p>
            <p>And I think I might more warrrantably
oppose the same than my Adversary imply
Three <hi>intelligent Beings</hi> in the Godhead, by
his definition of <hi>a Person,</hi> that every <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
BEING is a Person;</hi> that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the word <hi>Person</hi> (saith he) p. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:43872:104"/>
Whence it follows, That if there be Three
distinct Persons in the Deity, they are
Three distinct <hi>intelligent Beings;</hi> unless he'll
argue as one of his Brethren did; <hi>They are
not Three Substances, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Three Persons.</hi>
Another having given <hi>Aquinas</hi> his definition
of a <hi>Person,</hi> as being an <hi>individual Substance
of a rational Nature, which is neither the part
of another, nor upheld by another.</hi> But now
if they be not <hi>Three Beings,</hi> nor <hi>Three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences,</hi>
how well have these Men defended
a principal Article of their Faith? Seeing the
Father, the Word and Holy Ghost are own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Christians to be <hi>One Being; One Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;</hi>
therefore not <hi>Three Beings</hi> nor <hi>Three
Substances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My speaking of Christ as the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of the Father; and for his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as he was the Brightness of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Glory, and express Image of his
divine Substance, and thereupon questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
<hi>T. Danson,</hi> where doth the Scripture
say, <hi>That his Soul was created?</hi>
               </q> This Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is no Determination that it was, or
was not. Christ, as God, his Soul was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created.
As Man, his Soul or Spirit was
not the Deity, but formed and assumed by
the Word. The Word, or Son of God,
who made the Worlds, was not a Creature,
because he made all Creatures. Though he
took upon him a most pure and perfect Soul
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43872:105"/>
and Body, he took upon him the Seed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might in both Soul and
Body suffer for Mankind, and sympathize
with us in bearing our Sorrows and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Griefs; and that his Soul might be
in Travel for us, and made an Offering for
Sin, and poured out unto Death, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.
By my said Question I chiefly eyed his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
considering him as he proceeded and
came out from God, and as he was glorified
with the Father, before the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, my Adversary's Charge
of <hi>Heresie</hi> upon me and the Quakers, <hi>against
the Incarnation of Christ,</hi> p. 2. as also his
Author <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s publick Aspersions, <hi>That</hi>
G. W. <hi>disowns Christ to be God, and denied
him to be Man,</hi> Narr. p. 16. These are to
tell the World, That we own <hi>no Christ</hi> at
all: Wherein, as they have both grosly
wrong'd my Intention, Principle and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Testimony, I am persuaded <hi>G. K.</hi> has
wronged his own Conscience, and that he
must needs know the contrary of me, in
this and some other things, for which he is
accountable to the just God.</p>
            <p>For by questioning the Words <hi>created or
human Soul,</hi> I did not thereby intend <hi>to
deny Christ to be truly Man,</hi> as is unduly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated
against me, p. 2. but rather to own,
That tho' Christ was truly Man in Soul and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43872:105"/>
Body, yet that his Soul was more divine
than any other Mans or Mens; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he may be said to be a <hi>most divine Man,</hi>
and more of the divine and increated Life
in his Soul, than in any other Man's what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever;
and that therefore the word <hi>human,</hi>
as it relates to the Ground or Earth, from
which the Body of Man was taken, I might
suppose was too low or mean a Character or
Epithite to give to the <hi>Soul</hi> of Christ, or to his
spiritual glorious Body either; and I hope
I deserve not blame in this, while I was
careful not to lessen the Glory or Dignity
of the Son of God, (as he is the Lord from
Heaven) by not allowing him to be from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
or <hi>Earthly,</hi> either in Soul or Body in
his glorified State; and I am perswaded that
some so much insisting upon the word <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Soul and Body of Christ,</hi> gives the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
more advantage than my pleading for
his Divinity and Heavenly glory both as
God and Man.</p>
            <p>To my Question to <hi>Robert Gordon,</hi> I think
there's no real Cause for Offence to be taken
at it, if the Occasions ministred by him, were
Impartially taken notice of, which they are
not by this partial Adversary. As <hi>R. G.</hi>'s
great Ignorance both of the Light and Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-work
of Christ <hi>in</hi> Man; excluding
Christ's work of Salvation and Justification,
<hi>&amp;c. as all done and finished without Man,</hi> even
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43872:106"/>
when <hi>no good</hi> is wrought in Man; and
pleading for <hi>Imperfection and Sin in Man,</hi>
in so much that <hi>Geo. Keith</hi> charged the said
<hi>Gordon</hi> with 18 corrupt Doctrins, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
20 Lyes and false Accusations, in the
conclusion of my Book, Entituled, <hi>The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Christianity in the true Light asserted,</hi>
Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1671. And yet this officious
Adversary takes his part, excusing him, in
defence of <hi>G. Keith</hi> against us, as he has
done also in his <hi>Snake in the Grass,</hi> which is
such a piece of confused Mixture and Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
as I have seldom ever met withal.</p>
            <p>My Question to <hi>R. Gordon</hi> as Cited:
<q>Dost thou look for Christ as the Son of
<hi>Mary,</hi> to appear outwardly in a bodily
Existence <hi>to save thee?</hi> If thou dost, thou
mayest look until thy Eyes drop out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou wilt see <hi>such an</hi> appearance of
him?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And what proof is made of this against
me? But that I do</hi> not acknowledge that
Christ has now the Body of a Man, or will
come in that Body to Judge the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Neither do I deny it. If I do not
acknowledge it in this Passage, I do in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others, namely, that Christ as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Man has his own proper glorious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
wherein he will come to Judge the
World at the last day. And therefore do
not hold that Christ has <hi>no bodily Existence</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:43872:106"/>
(or being) <hi>without us,</hi> as <hi>G. K.</hi> accuseth me,
<hi>Narr.</hi> p. 16. He wrongs me in this, as in
divers other things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But upon</hi> R. Gordon<hi>'s pretending</hi> a perfect
Justification and Redemption of Sinners without
them, <hi>when</hi> no good is wrought in them; <hi>and
yet granting that Christ's appearing the</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time is without Sin to Salvation.</p>
            <p>But then his deferring this till the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Body, this I confess, was so
offensive to me, that I put the said Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
the reason whereof appears more at
large in my said Answer, <hi>Nature of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
p. 29. It being always my Judgment,
with many others, that Salvation from Sin
should be expected in this Life, and Christ's
second appearance for that end also, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. That this ought not to be
put off till the last day, but expected even
in this Life as in the Apostles days. There
were those then that looked for him to
whom his appearance the second time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sin unto Salvation was promised, and
the true Believers were not disappointed of
their expectations in that weighty matter.
As many have been who have expected to see
Christ's <hi>outward coming in Person</hi> (with their
<hi>carnal Eyes</hi>) to save them. Besides, 'tis true
in Fact, that those carnal Eyes of many fail
them, drop out or rot, before they can see
Christ's outward appearance, or coming in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43872:107"/>
the last day to Judgment. And <hi>G. Keith</hi>
himself, as well as I, have charged false
and corrupt Doctrin upon <hi>Robert Gordon,</hi>
particularly in his asserting, <hi>That Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Justification and Reconciliation, is finished
and compleated by what Christ did and suffered
outwardly, and not in our Persons, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of any thing to be wrought in us.</hi>
Artic. 6, 8, 12 of his Charge against <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Nature of Christianity,</hi> p. 70, 71, 72.</p>
            <p>And why now I should be accused by <hi>G.
Keith</hi> or his Advocate, for the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to <hi>R. G.</hi> as if I <hi>denied</hi> Christ to appear
in, or to have <hi>a Bodily Existence</hi> or Being,
I see no just Cause, but rather that <hi>G. K.</hi>
does therein (as in many other things) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere
with himself and his own former
Testimony, which is directly agreeable to
what I have said, and more severe and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,
as in his <hi>Help in time of need,</hi> p. 78,
79. In these words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>And now whether ye will hear or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
this I do declare unto you, in the
Name and Power, and Authority of
the living God, the day of the Lord is
of a truth broken up among us, and ye
shall look till your Eyes fail you, and rot
within your Eye-holes, e're ever you see
another day, <hi>or appearance of Jesus Christ</hi>
to your comfort, than what we the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Lord called Quakers, do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43872:107"/>
come, and yet more abundantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and if ye will not hear, my Soul
shall mourn for you in secret places, and
weep before the Lord on your behalf.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere,</hi> Was this to deny Christ to have
any Bodily Being? If <hi>G. K.</hi> may be cleared
herein, I may be clear from and against his
own Judgment unduly given upon me.</p>
            <p>I see no <hi>vehement</hi> (or any) denyal of
Christ's being either Bodily (or Spiritually)
at God's right hand, as I am accused, p. 3.
by Questioning the Words and Terms of
<hi>R. G.</hi> 
               <q>What Scripture proof has he for
these words, That <hi>Christ existeth</hi> outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bodily without us at God's right hand?
And what, and where is God's right hand?
Is it Visible or Invisible? Within us or
without us only? And is Christ the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
as an outward Bodily Existence, or
Person without us distinct from God; and
on that consideration, to be Worshipped
as God, yea or nay? And where doth the
Scripture say, he was outwardly and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
glorified at God's right hand? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>These Questions are no conclusions nor
any positive determinations, and they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in them the reason thereof, namely,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:43872:108"/>
1. Our then Adversary's excluding Christ
as to his being out of his People and Saints,
because at God's right hand; which has been
the common Argument of divers of them.
2. Their neglect and opposition to Christ's
inward spiritual appearance, and saving
work in the heart, under pretence of his
<hi>outward and bodily Existence</hi> at God's right
hand; which expressions I did the more
Question, because of the common and gross
sense wherein many are apt to take them,
<hi>as a bodily Being,</hi> like their own earthly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<hi>of Flesh and Blood,</hi> which cannot inherit
the Kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50. And
because they commonly have opposed his
being at God's right hand, to his inward
and spiritual appearance, asserting the one
in opposition to the other, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
very gross and carnal conceits of
Christ's outward and bodily Existence at
God's right hand; thence inferring that
the true Christ <hi>is not in Men,</hi> which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
and Inference I deny; the reason
whereof may farther appear.</p>
            <p>As for instance, <hi>John Newman</hi> whom <hi>G.
K.</hi> and his Advocate has sided with against
me, argues thus.</p>
            <p>Christ cannot dwell in Man, for Christ is
perfect Man, as well as perfect God, <hi>in his
Book stiled,</hi> The Light within, <hi>p. 61. Again,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:43872:108"/>
If Jesus Christ be with the Father, then he
is not in Man, and that therefore 'tis a feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ and Light within, <hi>p.</hi> 47, 66, 72.</p>
            <p>I deny the Argument, both of the first
Proposition and Consequence; Christ being
with the Father, or at God's right hand,
is no reason or proof that he is <hi>not in
Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I then Answered <hi>J. N. Christ
ascended,</hi> p. 20, 21. <q>Doth Christ's being
with the Father, or at <hi>his</hi> right hand,
hinder him from being in his People?
This is gross Error, and contrary to
plan Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Know you not
how that Jesus Christ is in you, except
ye be reprobates; and this is neither
a <hi>feigned Christ,</hi> nor a <hi>feigned Light,</hi> as
Blasphemously and Scornfully he words
it: And what doth <hi>J. N.</hi> think or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
concerning God, his right hand and
being? And Christ at God's right hand,
that he thus would exclude, limit and
seem to confine them out of all Men?
Doth not this oppose the Infiniteness and
Omnipresence of God and Jesus Christ,
and bring them under the limitation of
finite Creatures?</q> With much more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Subject in the places Quoted.</p>
            <p>I do not find that my Answer to <hi>J. N.</hi>
is <hi>a denying</hi> Christ's outward appearance at
the great day, as accused, p. 4. But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43872:109"/>
a Questioning such a manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
as he and others carnally expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be seen with their carnal Eyes; as
having declared that Jesus Christ Rose and
<hi>Ascended Flesh and Blood,</hi> and those that
pierced him in his Body, <hi>shall see that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
visibly come again.</hi> I Answered, <q>These
are not the words of Scripture, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and for Answer to him, I referred
to <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 13, 14, 16. In none of
which is Jesus Christ called (or represented
as) a Body of <hi>Flesh, Blood and Bones,</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
to come again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> The words
<hi>Blood and Bones, G. Keith</hi> has in recital here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
injuriously left out in his <hi>Gross Error
and Hypocrisie,</hi> p. 3. And yet makes use of
the place to defame me with <hi>unbelief in a
fundamental Doctrin of Christian Faith;</hi> and
the same words, as Body of <hi>Flesh, Blood and
Bones,</hi> he has likewise left out in his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Citation and Construction in his <hi>Nar.</hi>
p. 17. He has also left out this following
Passage on the same Subject: <q>Howbeit
His (Christ's) appearance shall be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
seen both to the Joy of the
Righteous, and universal Conviction and
Condemnation of the Wicked, who have
rejected his Light within, and his saving
appearance thereby made manifest; yea
every Eye shall see him both of Good
and Bad, both those that have waited
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43872:109"/>
for his second coming without Sin to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and they also which have Pierced
and Crucified him,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c. Christ Ascended,</hi>
Printed in 1669. p. 22, 23.</p>
            <p>I never heard before, That 'tis a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Doctrin of the Christian Faith, <hi>That
Jesus Christ either consisteth of a Body of Flesh,
Blood and Bones, or is in such a Body to come
again visibly, to Mens carnal Eyes they now
have;</hi> which was the very thing I Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the places Quoted against me by
<hi>G. K. Light and Life,</hi> p. 41. Printed in
1668. And <hi>Christ Ascended,</hi> p. 21, 22, 23.
Wherein, in the first, he has left out the
Question, Did <hi>John</hi> see him with carnal
Eyes, on <hi>Rev.</hi> 1? <q>And of the glory of
the Father, wherein the Son of Man shall
come, <hi>Mat. 16. 27, 28. Luke 9. 26, 27.
Is it visible to the carnal Eye?</hi> left out;
and in the latter, after <hi>in none of which,
(i.e.</hi> Scriptures Quoted) <hi>is Jesus Christ</hi>
represented as a Body of Flesh,</q> here <hi>Blood
and Bones</hi> are left out, which is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
and more unjust, to render me an
unbeliever thereupon; like as if one should
deal thus by a Quotation out of <hi>G. K.</hi>'s
<hi>Way cast up,</hi> p. 131. After <hi>[it being no more
a Body]</hi> to leave out <hi>[of Flesh Blood and Bones]</hi>
and then how would <hi>[but a pure Ethereal or
Heavenly Body]</hi> stand or co-here? which
he speaks of the glorious Body of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:43872:110"/>
Though I have always opposed the Gross
and Carnal conceirs of many about <hi>the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>
I do not believe that Christ's glorious
Body and the Saints Resurrection Bodies,
(which must be like unto his,) shall be all shut
up in Invisibility, so as not to be seen or
known one of another, But that in Christ's
Kingdom of Glory hereafter they shall as
truly see and know one another, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of God in Heaven do, to whom they
shall be Equal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note, That our present Adversary's
granting,</hi> Christ's Body to be glorified in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and <hi>much</hi> changed from the condition it
was in upon the Cross, <hi>p. 4. And also,</hi> That
such a gross Notion of the Resurrection, no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
ever held, as if the Body were to rise in the
same Grossness and Carnality that it has in this
Life. <hi>And that</hi> G. K. has sufficiently explained
himself, and that the Body when raised, shall be
the same as to substance, but not as to the Gross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Carnality as now; and did Illustrate it
by the Chymical Extraction of Spirits out of
Herbs, <hi>&amp;c. p. 26. As</hi> G. K. <hi>saith,</hi> How
much more ought we to acknowldge the Wisdom
and Power of God who not only can, but will
change the Bodies of the Saints from all gross and
terrestrial Qualities, to be Heavenly and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;
the Husk or drossy Part, (that is no more
the true Body, than Dross in a lump of rich Oar
of Gold is Gold) being excepted, <hi>Gross</hi> Er. <hi>p. 13.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43872:110"/>
and p.</hi> 9. We must needs think (<hi>saith he</hi>) That
Christ's Body was really Terrestrial, i.e. had
Terrestrial Qualities when it was upon Earth; But
now it is Heavenly endued altogether with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Qualities, as the Bodies of the Saints will
be at the Resurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to be more full and plain, observe
what he saith in his <hi>Way cast up,</hi> p. 131.
<q>That Body that was crucified on the Cross
at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and is now Ascended and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in Heaven, which remaineth the
same in Substance that it was on Earth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be wonderfully changed as to the
Mode and Manner of its being: It being no
more a Body of Flesh, Blood and Bones;
but a pure Ethereal or Heavenly Body,
like unto which the Bodies of the Saints
are to be at the Resurrection.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now observe this great and wonderful
change of Christ's glorified Body, and of the
Saints Resurrection Bodies, was not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
granted by our former Adversaries,
as <hi>T. Elwood</hi> truly observes, though very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly
charg'd with <hi>horrid and sensless Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and notorious Falshood,</hi> p. 4. for saying, <q>It
is well known that many of the Baptists,
as well as others of other Professions, do
hold the Body of Christ now in Heaven,
to be as really and materially a Body of
Flesh, Blood and Bones, as it was when it
was upon the Cross.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:43872:111"/>
That many have so held both of Christ's
glorious Body and the Resurrection Bodies,
hath been notoriously known to us and many
others, as my said Answer to the said <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
partly shews, p. 17. 18. And our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to <hi>Tho. Hickes</hi> and <hi>Mathew Caffin</hi> and
<hi>T. Grantham</hi> rendred Christ's Body Heaven,
such a one as his <hi>Quakers Ref.</hi> p. 40, 41. And
<hi>Thomas Vincent</hi> (and others) his gross con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
may be seen in his <hi>Illustrations about the
Resurrection,</hi> noted in our Book entituled, <hi>The
Christian Quaker,</hi> in folio, 2d. part p. 161,
162, 163, 164, 165. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The most that ever I discoursed of those
our former Adversaries, have held the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
in that gross sense mentioned,
by <hi>T. E.</hi> except <hi>Jer. Ives,</hi> tho' a contentious
Adversary, yet in that Point more ingenuous
than most of his Brethren in those Days. At
a publick Dispute between some of us and
some Baptists at <hi>Chersey</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> when a
Question about the Body of Christ in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
was Ignorantly obtruded by <hi>William
Burnett;</hi> his Brother <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> in answer to
my speaking of Christ's various appearances,
as in divers Forms, after he rose, said,
<q>
                  <hi>What</hi> change or alteration His Body might
have, we cannot determine, nor what
Glory he is in; for to enquire with <hi>what
Body</hi> the Dead are raised is absurd, <hi>Christ
Ascended,</hi> 
                  <bibl>p. 19, 20.</bibl>
               </q>

            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:43872:111"/>
Now it is observable in our former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
on this Point, The Question put to
us was not, <q>Whether the Saints shall
come forth in the Resurrection, with their
Bodies of such a Spiritual, Pure and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Extract, as to be free from all
Carnality, Grossness, Dross, Husk and
Terrestrial Qualities; even so as no more
to be Bodies of Flesh, Blood and Bones,
but Pure Ethereal or Heavenly Bodies,
like unto Christ's glorious Body?</q> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>G. K</hi>'s and his Advocates confession.
I say, this was not the Question we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
then: But, <hi>whether the same nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
Body, of Flesh, Blood and Bones that
dies, shall be raised?</hi> This we have objected
against, and the <hi>same Substance;</hi> that is,
the same gross Substance and Bodily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of <hi>Flesh, Blood and Bones;</hi> this we
have excepted against. But Resurrection Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of such a refined Extract and Celestial
Substance, as is not Flesh and Blood, but
free from that Dross and Husk, as is now
proposed, was not in controversy, that ever
I remember between us and our former Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.
However <hi>G. K.</hi> should be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
as to tell the People, what he
means by the <hi>same Body for Substance,</hi> that
shall rise, that it is not the same Body of
<hi>Flesh, Blood and Bones; but a pure spiritual
ethereal heavenly extract Body,</hi> and then see
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43872:112"/>
how that will take: And I think he'l gain
no more popularity in that Point, than
those of us he Quarrels with, without just
Cause.</p>
            <p>Otherwise 'tis very disingenuous to hide
himself under general and indefinite Terms,
by telling the People, the same Bodies that
dye shall arise the same in Substance, and
not tell them what Substance that is, that
is not Flesh, Blood and Bones; for under
those general Terms they may take him to
mean in the common and gross sense of the
same Flesh and Blood, who understand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of a Celestial Seed or Ethereal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
hid in these gross Bodies, or in their
first Elements which they are to be dissolved
into, whether in the Earth, Fire or Water,
wherein many Bodies have been destroyed,
dissolv'd and consum'd.</p>
            <p>That Scripture, <hi>Jo. 14. 19. Yet a little
while and the World seeth me no more:</hi> (which
<hi>G. K.</hi> thinks he better translates, <hi>as yet</hi> or
<hi>not as yet</hi>) Nar. p. 17. However I did not
alledge it to prove, that <hi>Christ has no Body
at all,</hi> as in <hi>Nar.</hi> p. 17. herein <hi>G. K.</hi> wrongs
me; but that the World should see Christ
no more in that manner wherein they then
saw him: That which they then saw of him
with their carnal Eyes, they should see no
more, <hi>i.e.</hi> as in the Flesh. And how should
they, if his glorified Body be no more <hi>a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43872:112"/>
Body of Flesh, Blood and Bones,</hi> but a pure
Ethereal or Heavenly Body, they must have
other Eyes to see him withal, as such than
these same Eyes of Flesh they now have.</p>
            <p>Again, I am manifestly mis-represented
by <hi>G. K. Narr.</hi> p. 18. <hi>As thinking all</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphites
<hi>and</hi> Muggletonians, <hi>who
believe that the Man Christ has any bodily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
in Heaven;</hi> which was none of my
Answer or Argument: But upon <hi>J. Newmans</hi>
excluding Christ out of all Men, because
at the right hand of God as a personal
Being, and calling Christ within <hi>only a
feigned Christ,</hi> as his terms were; this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
I opposed, and still do, as no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
reason to exclude the true Christ
out of all Men, and therefore gave this
Answer, <hi>i.e.</hi> 
               <q>This manner of excluding
God's right hand, and Christ to a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
(as wholly) out of his People in
a <hi>Personal Being,</hi> (which are no Scripture
Terms) still implyes him to be such a
Personal God or Christ, like the <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphites;</hi>
&amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now I say again, If any one should ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
in better Terms, <hi>that Christ is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Intelligent Being at God's right hand,
without all Men, Ergo, he is not in Men,
no not in believers;</hi> I deny the Consequence,
for this is to limit the Omnipresent God
to a remoteness as well as Christ, and tends
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43872:113"/>
to gratifie the carnal imaginations of such
as have formed an Idea or Imagination of
God and his right hand, like a Person or
Man remote and without all Men, under
such limitation as the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> did,
and that according to the common speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when we say <hi>such a Person,</hi> we <hi>mean
such a Man</hi> whom we <hi>call a Person,</hi> (as
we do a Woman also) and my Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie's
also more finely defining a Person
to <hi>be a Spirit,</hi> p. 5. will neither help the
Argument for the Baptist against us, nor
amend some Mens carnal Imaginations of
<hi>a Personal God</hi> like themselves; for who
are most carnal in their Thoughts about
God, are most apt to imagin carnally of
him; and suppose any should argue in
this Man's Terms, That Christ being at
God's right hand, who is a Spirit, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
not in believers or any Men, this would
bespeak as much Ignorance as the former,
and more Absurdity, to suppose God a
limited circumscribed Spirit, not Infinite
nor Omnipresent, which is to oppose his
being the true God, as he is an Infinite
Omnipresent Spirit, Power, Life, Light
and Wisdom.</p>
            <p>Besides, my Animadversion is very plain
to <hi>J. N.</hi> in this case, <hi>Christ Ascended,</hi> p. 69.
<q>If the indwelling of God and Christ be
such in his People, and the Saints in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43872:113"/>
such near Union and Conjunction with
Christ, as the Branches with the Vine, and
the Members with the Body; (as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to himself he confessed) then
'tis false and a lying Imagination, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
either Christ, God, and his right
hand so remote as not to dwell in any
Man, no not in their own People.</q> And
I may add, 'tis also contrary to God's
own promise, to dwell <hi>in them</hi> and <hi>walk
in them,</hi> and to his saving and upholding
them by his own <hi>right hand.</hi> Christ's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
set at God's right hand, bespeaks his
Exaltation, Dignity and Glory, obtained
through his Humiliation and Sufferings,
but not an exclusion of Christ, of God or
his right hand, as if each were limitted or
circumscribed <hi>wholly</hi> without all Men, and
as not to be in any Men, as they are in
a true Spiritual and Scripture sense.</p>
            <p>p. 6. My telling <hi>J. Horn</hi> and <hi>T. Moor,</hi>
               <q>That the Nature of Christ is pure, but
theirs filthy, therefore not in Christ, as
they said it was, whilst pleading for
<hi>Sin</hi> as their <hi>natural Heritage during this
life.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This was simply in Opposition to the
<hi>Antinomian</hi> Sin-pleasing Notion, of their
being justified and pure in Christ, when
in themselves filthy and actually Sinful,
which was all one, as if I had told them,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43872:114"/>
you are not in Christ nor Heirs with him,
whilst in your selves filthy and Sin
your natural Heritage, which is far from
any such false Notion, as that <hi>Christ could
not take on him Man's nature, except he took
on him the pollution of it.</hi> 'Tis none of
my Notion, nor intended in the Passage
before, but unjustly cast upon me by <hi>G.
K. Narr.</hi> p. 7. and his Advocate, <hi>Satan
Disrob'd,</hi> p. 6.</p>
            <p>To my Adversary's confidently asserting,
<hi>That</hi> J. Faldo, <hi>nor any other did ever oppose
this, That they should Preach ONLY the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
and Sufferings of Christ at</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
<hi>i.e. without Preaching likewise the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
operations of his Spirit in our hearts,
Satan Disrob'd,</hi> p. 7. And that if <hi>W. P.</hi> or
<hi>T. E.</hi> cannot name one single Man, much
less any of those Communions which he
disputes against, that ever thought Christ's
outward appearance would ever save them
without his inward appearance in their
Consciences, then against whom have they
disputed? p. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes I can name one single Man
whom he has vindicated against us, (in
<hi>G. K.</hi>'s behalf) who has both thought and
said as much as, that Christ's outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and Sufferings has saved them,
without his Appearance or Work in them,
and that is the said <hi>R. Gordon,</hi> and it's
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43872:114"/>
Charged against him, among his many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
corrupt Doctrins by <hi>G. Keith,</hi> in my
and his Book, Entituled, <hi>The Nature of
Christianity,</hi> p. 70, 71. <hi>Artic.</hi> 1. That
Christ without us upon the Cross, hath
already subdued all things, finish'd Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
made an end of Sin, abolish'd
Condemnation and Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art.</hi> 8. That Redemption, Justification,
were finished and compleated in the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Body in Christ for us, <hi>not <hi>in our
Persons.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art.</hi> 12. That Redemption and <hi>all things</hi>
are wrought; purchas'd for us, <hi>without</hi>
the help of any thing to be wrought in
us.</p>
            <p>These <hi>G. Keith</hi> Charged upon him, with
many more as corrupt Doctrins. So that
here was one Man, (<hi>i.e. R. G.</hi> and too
many more) that has laid the whole
Stress and Work of Man's Salvation, <hi>only</hi>
upon Christ's outward Appearance and
Suffering, <hi>without his inwarad appearance and
operations by his Spirit in us.</hi> Which is
corrupt Doctrin and repugnant to that of
the necessity of Regeneration, and being
born again, without which no entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God's Kingdom.</p>

               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:43872:115"/>
               <hi>Another Passage by the way I observe,</hi>
               <q> 
                  <hi>Whereafter this Advocate for</hi> G. K. <hi>has
represented</hi> T. Ellwood, <hi>as telling how
little of difficulty there is in barely and
historically believing this,</hi> (i.e. <hi>that
God sent Christ to dye for Sinners, and
to reconcile God to Men by his Death)
the common Faith of all that part of
the World called Christian shews,</hi> &amp;c.<bibl>p. 11.</bibl>
               </q>
               <hi>He grants,</hi> That though that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
alone will not do, yet that it is not so
easie a matter, truly to believe this, even hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storically:
But that 'tis a hard Task with
the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and opposed by the <hi>Socinians,
(i.e.</hi> the satisfaction <hi>by Christ's outward
Death</hi>) and by all the <hi>Deists</hi> open Debauchees,
and among the Profligate and Prophane of the
meaner Rank, few if any of them do really
believe it, even historically, or forget it and
never think of it, otherwise it would have a
greater influence upon them, <hi>p.</hi> 11, 12.</p>
            <p>He might have been so charitable or
just, as to have ranked the <hi>Quakers</hi> among
better company, and not to thus scandalize
them, who sincerely believe the sacred
History of Christ's Death for Sinners, and
Reconciliation thereby, but do experience
the influence and fruit thereof, by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, according to their growth in
Grace, who faithfully follow him in his
Light. The Passage I am to observe (as
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:43872:115"/>
his Reason for what goes before) follows,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Historical Faith must be inseparable
from the saving Faith, aud indeed the saving
Faith is the Historical throughly digested and
applyed, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Which is to conclude that none have the
saving Faith, but those who have the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical;
consequently, that all must be
damned who have not the historical Faith of
Christ dying for Sinners, whereby he has
at once condemned all Nations or Peoples,
both Infants dying in Innocency, and all
others who have not the History or histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Faith of Christ's sufferings and Death,
tho' it was really for mankind in general,
and may and doth for ought he knows influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
many who have not the historical Faith
or knowledge thereof, otherwise the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
good and end thereof intended for all, is
frustrated, to many thousands for want of
the History or Preaching of Christ's Death
to them; unless <hi>G. K.</hi> can demonstrate and
resolve, that the twelve Revolutions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Souls will make it all up: That all
that are Deceased or have Dyed without the
historical Faith or Knowledge of Christ Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
shall return and have opportunity
to have Christ so Preached unto them; which
he has no divine Revelation for, but rather
a long exploded Hypothesis or Supposition,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:43872:116"/>
(as in the first part Heathenish) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the more difficult Task to give any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
demonstration of the same.</p>
            <p>'Tis farther observable, what uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as well as inconsistency, this Advocate for
<hi>G. K.</hi> is in, even in this Point. He saith,
<hi>viz. How God will deal with the good moral
Heathen, who never heard of Christ, I will not
determine, nor enter into the Secrets of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
p. 12. When he has determin'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
that if they have not the historical
Faith, they have not the saving Faith, if
they be inseperable as he has asserted: For
'tis certain without some saving Faith, they
cannot be saved, as without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to please God.</p>
            <p>But he appears as pinching and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
in his following objection against the
Light, as he is uncharitable in the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that they, (<hi>i.e. the good moral Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>)
have the Christian Faith by believing
their Light within, Or that there is any object
of the Christian Faith without the outward Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
who suffered at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is a Quakers
Dream, and opposite to the whole Tenure of the
Gospel, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Hence observe. 1. This is to deny the
Gentiles any Christian Faith, who believe
in the Light given them according to God's
promises to them; yea though they be <hi>good
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:43872:116"/>
moral Men,</hi> who so believe, as if they could
be good or pious without any Christianity
in them: Which is to oppose the blessed
end of Christ being so given for a Light of
the Heathen, and Salvation to the ends of
the Earth. 2. It is to deny the Light of
Christ, or Christ as the Light within, to
be any object of the Christian Faith; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Christ's Doctrin: <hi>Believe in the Light
that ye may be the Children of the Light.</hi>
3. The last part of the Objection implies,
that either Christ as without, and Christ as
within is divided, or that there are awo
Christs, an outward Christ, and an inward
Christ, whereas there is but one Lord Jesus
Christ. And his Light within cannot be
without or divided from him, who is the
Fountain of Light and Life. 4. 'Tis not
opposite (but according) to the Tenour of
the Gospel, to believe in the Light or Word
of Faith, (<hi>i.e.</hi> Christ as within nigh in the
Heart;) which hath both Law and Gospel,
Judgment and Mercy in it to Minister, sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to Mens states and conditions. And
in this Light or Word, we meet with the
great Ends, Benefits, or Fruit of Christ's
suffering and Mediation, which are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
and come to be fulfilled in all, who tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe in and obey the same Word,
whereby the Gospel is preached in every
Creature under Heaven, yea even in many
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:43872:117"/>
thousands of Souls who have not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
History of Christ's suffering and
Death; tho' both the sacred History and
sincere Preaching thereof by the Spirit of
Christ, be of great use and advantage, and
in no wise to be rejected where God is pleas'd
to afford them. But seeing, <hi>He that believes
not in the Son of God is condemned already, and
the wrath of God abides upon him, because he
obeyeth not the Son of God,</hi> John 3. 18. conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Son of God is offered unto all,
and his Grace is given and appears unto all
mankind that they may believe in him and
thereby lay hold on him for Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Christ plainly gives the reason of
Mens condemnation when he there saith,
<hi>This is the Comdemnation that Light is come into
the World, and Men loved Darkness rather then
Light, beeause their Deeds were Evil,</hi> John
3. 19. Otherwise to represent God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
and bring his Wrath upon Men, for
not believing in that they never had, or
which was never afforded nor appeared unto
them.</p>
            <p>This were Blasphemously to render God
Unjust, Unmerciful and most cruel to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
and bring his Wrath upon Men for
an Impossibility; for how should they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in, or obey the Son of God, if no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Grace or Power of believing be afforded
unto them? This were like as to bind their
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:43872:117"/>
hands and feet, and lock all Food from
them, and then bid them walk and work
or else starve. But our good God is no
such hard Master, who willeth not the
Death of Sinners, but rather their return
to him that they may live, and for this
end hath sent his Son to be the Saviour of
the World.</p>
            <p>As for innocent Infants, or little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
who dye in Innocency, Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
has provided for their safety, by
Christ Jesus, his Meditation and Seed of
eternal Life in them; and <hi>their Angels,</hi>
who see the face of God continually, are
ready to carry their Souls into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Kingdom, when they dye in that
State.</p>
            <p>My Objecting against <hi>W. Burnet,</hi> about
the Blood of Christ that was shed on the
Cross, was first and chiefly, upon his hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That the <hi>shedding <hi>of the Blood of Christ
upon the Cross, that was let out by</hi> vertue
<hi>of the Spear being thrust into his side, to be
meritorious, or the meritorious cause of Man's
Justification,</hi>
               </hi> which his Brother <hi>Ives</hi> could
not stand by him in; but supposed a
meaning for him. Secondly, That the same
Blood that was shed, doth <hi>both purge and
sprinkle their Conscieuces, sanctifie and justifie</hi>
them, and yet that 'tis <hi>not in Being,</hi> but
cumpared to <hi>a price lost,</hi> as more at large
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:43872:118"/>
in my Answer, <hi>Light and Life,</hi> p. 7, 8.
&amp; p. 64. together with their contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about it, referring to <hi>W. Burnet</hi>'s
Book and their Discourses. But now to
excuse his saying, <hi>That Blood is not in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
this Advocate will have it, <hi>that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gives way to this supposition of the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
<hi>by way of Concession, not as his own
Opinion,</hi> p. 16. 'Tis a wonder the Man's
not ashamed to use such a slim come off
and false cover for him, when 'twas a
real Confession, and not forced from him
as a meer Concession for Argument sake,
why should he compare it then to <hi>a price
lost?</hi> And another Baptist, <hi>Thomas Brown,</hi>
confess'd that the <hi>Blood that was shed, is
not in Being, it sunk into the ground,</hi> Light
and Life, <hi>p.</hi> 66.</p>
            <p>The occasion of my Questioning them so
much about this matter, was because they
seem'd to place the great stress of Man's
Salvation upon the outward Blood of
Christ and the act of <hi>shedding</hi> of it, as if
it were the present agent operating in
them, <hi>Purging, sprinkling their Consciences,
Sanctifying and Justifying,</hi> without making
the Spirit the Operator or Efficient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
whereas both Sanctification, washing
and cleansing from Sin, Regeneration, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and so Salvation, are more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
ascribed to the Spirit, the Grace,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:43872:118"/>
the Word of God, yea, to Christ himself,
than to <hi>the act of shedding</hi> that Blood, or to
that Blood it self; yet I never opposed that
as being a part of the Sacrifice of Christ, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for Sinners, in order to a Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Attonement and Reconciliation. And
farther, to his comparison between the
Baptists declaring the <hi>Blood shed on the
Cross not in being, and the Agonies and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Christ upon the Cross, as not now in
being,</hi> I do not therefore dissolve all the
merits of his Sufferings or Death to our
Justification thereby. I do not so Argue,
(as implyed against me) that because his
Passion was Temporal and Finite, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not Meritorious;</hi> for the Merits or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
on Christ's part, is placed upon
his Obedience in humbling himself to
Death, even to the Death of the Cross,
<hi>wherefore</hi> God hath highly exalted him,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Phil. 2. 8, 9. whose Exaltation and
Dominion is for our Salvation, if we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to him as our Leader, Commander
and King.</p>
            <p>But my distinction for Argument is this,
Tho' that Blood and Sacrifice were
offered as a price in order to Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
it is the Power and Spirit of
Christ, that inwardly operates and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
the Soul to God, purifies and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the Conscience, and so effectually saves
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:43872:119"/>
us from Sin and Pollution. The <hi>Price</hi> is
already paid, but the <hi>Work</hi> is yet undone
in many; we value the <hi>Price,</hi> but must
not neglect the <hi>Work</hi> of our Redemption
and Salvation in us; for Christ's Sacrifice
will not save, justifie or acquit any in a
State of impenitency or unbelief; they
must know the work of his Grace and
Good Spirit in their hearts unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Obedience of Faith in Christ,
or else they perish in their impenitency
and wilful unbelief, whereby they make
both the Cross and blood of Christ of
none effect unto them.</p>
            <p>Except a Man be regenerate and born
again, he cannot see, nor enter into the
Kingdom of God. And I conceive I am
not to be blamed, much less ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Ranters (as <hi>G. K.</hi> has, <hi>Narr.</hi> p.
25.) for ascribing the saving work of
sprinkling the Conscience, sanctifying and
justifying principally to the inward
Grace and Spirit, more than to the Blood
shed upon the Cross.</p>
            <p>I say again, I see no necessity of <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Men to the <hi>Type for the Antitype,</hi> to
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> or <hi>the Temple,</hi> p. 17. either for
Jesus Christ or his Blood there, but that
such direction is contrary to what the
Righteousness of Faith saith, <hi>Ro.</hi> 10. 6,
7, 8. compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, 12, 13,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:43872:119"/>
14, 15. Tho' we also Preach Christ as he
was Crucified and Dyed at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
raised from the Dead, and I do not say
<hi>that's contrary to</hi> Ro. 10. as <hi>G. K.</hi> wrongs
me several times over, <hi>Narr.</hi> p. 26, 27.
But <hi>to direct Men either to go to the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Temple at</hi> Jerusalem, or <hi>to look to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
<hi>for Jesus Christ the Antitype of that
Temple,</hi> &amp;c. This I deem'd contrardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
to <hi>Ro.</hi> 10. above quoted; but they
are to turn and look to the <hi>Word</hi> of Faith
nigh in the Heart, where they may Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
find, feel and know Christ in <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Power,</hi> even in the <hi>Power of his
Resurrection,</hi> so as to be enabled <hi>both to
confess with the Mouth the Lord Jesus, and
believe in the Heart, that God raised him up
from the Dead.</hi> And <hi>this word of Faith</hi> and
of God is confessed unto by <hi>G. K.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be the <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>Foundation of true
Faith;</hi> and that this <hi>is Christ in them,</hi> and
that from the same Scriptures I quoted,
<hi>Deut. 30. 12, 13. Ro.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
As more fully appears in his <hi>immediate
revelation,</hi> p. 3. &amp; p. 64, 65. Print. 1668.
Therefore 'tis not to destroy nor <hi>allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
away</hi> the <hi>Object</hi> of Faith, to direct
People to Christ as the <hi>word of Faith nigh
in the Heart,</hi> as the <hi>Object</hi> thereof, nor is
it <hi>Antichristian Doctrin,</hi> as <hi>G. K.</hi> has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43872:120"/>
accused me in this Point, <hi>Narr.</hi> p. 27.
contrary to his former confessions.</p>
            <p>And suppose any one in deep distress for
want of Christ to free and save him from
Sin should earnestly enquire, where shall I
find him? Whither will you direct me to
find Christ? And one should answer, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
thee to <hi>Jerusalem, to the material Temple,
to the Type for Christ the Antitype;</hi> and should
again say, I direct thee to Christ as <hi>above the
Clouds,</hi> and <hi>not to Christ as the Light within,</hi>
and then call the Light within <hi>an uncertain
Guide,</hi> (as the Baptist did whom I answered
in this Case) How would this answer the
distressed Soul? Or agree with the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Moses,</hi> or of <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, <hi>in Deut.</hi> 30. 11, 12, 13, 14. and
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8, 9. As for what the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Faith saith? I should rather an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Question according to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Apostle, Whither
shall I be directed to go to find Christ? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>Say not in thine Heart, who shall Ascend
into Heaven, that is, to bring Christ down from
above? Or, who shall Descend into the Deep;
that is, to bring Christ again from the Dead?
But what saith it? The Word is nigh thee, even
in thy Mouth and in thine Heart; that is the
Word of Faith which we Preach.</hi> And this
Word of Faith will bring thee to know the
great benefit and fruit of Christ's Death at
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43872:120"/>
               <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for thee, and the power of his
Resurrection, that thou mayest thereby be
enabled livingly to <hi>confess with thy Mouth the
Lord Jesus, and believe in thine Heart that
God hath raised him from the Dead,</hi> so as thou
mayest be saved by him. But I yet say, to
preach Christ as a remote <hi>outward Christ only</hi>
in opposition to his <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of Faith
within, (as in the Heart) is to keep People
in unbelief, remote from the true Faith and
Knowledge of Christ, either as without us
or within us; which opposition ought not
to be to Christ in either respect.</p>
            <p>As concerning <hi>Sol. Eccles</hi> saying, <hi>That the
Blood that was forced out of Christ's Side with
the Spear after he was Dead, being no more than
the Blood of another Saint.</hi> p. 19. and <hi>Nar.</hi> p.
28. <q>Concerning which I said, I do not
make <hi>S. E.</hi> his Expressions therein an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of our Faith, for I own that in one
sense the Blood shed was more than that of
another Saint, (tho' not in the visible matter
of it) <hi>more,</hi> in that it had a peculiar signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
for Christ, the one offering was the
Man peculiarly ordain'd and appointed of
God, both to bear the Sins of many and to
end the many offerings under the Law,
and in all his Example and Sufferings that
were permitted to be laid upon him, he
both Answered, Fulfilled and ended the
outward part and administration of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:43872:121"/>
Law and Shadows, and performed the
Father's Will therein, and was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
Eyed and Prophesied accordingly by
the Holy Prophets; and through all his
sufferings in the Flesh he gave an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Testimony, and Consecrated a New
and Living way, even through the Veil,
that is to say <hi>his Flesh;</hi> that the way into
the most Holy might be manifest, <hi>Light
and Life,</hi> 
                  <bibl>p. 58, 59.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the first place, I did shew a dislike of
<hi>S. E</hi>'s Expressions before cited, in not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them as an Article of our Faith: tho' I
was willing Charitably to improve his own
explication, so far as it would bear a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Construction, with respect to his own
declared Estimation of the Blood of Christ,
it's Value and Vertue.</p>
            <p>2dly, I shewed in part my estimation of
the Blood and whole Sacrifice or Offering of
Christ, both in respect to the <hi>Blessed Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
Value and Efficacy thereof; more than
that of any other Saint or Saints, which
manifestly differs from <hi>S. E.</hi>'s Expressions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cited.</p>
            <p>However, if I have not been thought plain
enough in this matter, let me be allowed
so much candor, as to be credited, in being
more full and plain therein; I disown his
said comparison of the Blood of Christ, with
that of another Saint; and believe he was
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:43872:121"/>
not in the Counsel or Wisdom of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
tho' I did charitably construe his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with respect to the sincerity he had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and his self denying crucified
Life, and Testimony he bore for Truth,
in divers sufferings and respects, (and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he dyed in Peace) tho' in some things
he in his zeal was not guided in true Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which was his own weakness and
personal Failure, not justly chargeable on
us as a People, much less on our Principle
or belief of the Spirit of Truth; or, the
infallible guidance thereof. Howbeit this
Adversary appears so eagerly bent against us
as a People, that he is willing to take any
occasion to Defame and Brand us; as in this
very Passage which he calls, <hi>The Broad and
Impious Blasphemy</hi> of <hi>Sol. Eccles.</hi> He Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
yet Bitterly reproaches us as a People,
and my self in particular, in these Words,
<hi>viz. There never was surely such a Company
of good natur'd forgiving People! They can slip
over, cover and excuse the Lewdest Blasphemies
in a Charitable way,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They can see no faults
in their own Friends.</hi> G. W. <hi>says of this very
Passage of</hi> Sol. Eccles. <hi>That it was so harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
as might have satisfied any spiritual or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biassed
Mind,</hi> p. 21. And that this is in his
<hi>Light and Life,</hi> before quoted <hi>p.</hi> 58. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he notoriously wrongs me and perverts
my Words; I did not call this very Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:43872:122"/>
(or comparison of <hi>S. E</hi>'s) harmless, but
his Words declaring his high esteem of the
Blood of Christ, and of the new Covenant
which was not his comparison of the <hi>Blood
of Christ</hi> with <hi>that</hi> of another <hi>Saint,</hi> which
I have disown'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In my answer to</hi> W. Burnet, <hi>quoted, but
lamely and partially cited,</hi> p. 22. 23. <hi>§. 5.
I did not call</hi> Christ's outward material Blood
a Type of the mystical Blood or Light within, <hi>as
my answer is perverted, but closely pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Argument, with exceptions which
he is not cleared from by this Advocate,
his Argument is this,</hi> viz. All things under
the Law in the Type were purged with Blood,
and this Blood was material Blood and not my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical;
and that Blood that Christ shed in order
to the effecting the Salvation of Man <hi>must needs</hi>
be visible and material Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which is to Argue thus, that</hi> because all
things under the Law were purged with material
Blood, and not mystical, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Blood of
Christ which purgeth the Conscience and Effecteth
the Salvation of Men, must needs be Material,
and not Mystical. <hi>I still deny the inference,
and my answer shews where and against
what my Exceptions lye. The Types and
Shadows under the Law, did both point
at what was Material and what was Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
in Christ: If the legal Sacrifices,</hi> were
Types of Christ and so Mystical, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:43872:122"/>
p. 23. <hi>contrary to</hi> Burnets <hi>asserting
them</hi> Material, not Mystical. <hi>As in his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting,</hi>
That 'twas Material Blood, not My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical,
whereby all things under the Law were
purged; <hi>but now contrarywise those</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
are <hi>granted to be</hi> Mystical, because Types
of Christ, the Substance and Mystery of
them.</p>
            <p>My Answer to <hi>Burnet's</hi> Argument, even
in the first part, left out by this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
is plain and clear, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>As if one
should reason, That because the Type
was Material, visible, and not Mystical,
therefore the Antitype or Substance must
needs be Material and not Mystical; by
this all Mysteries of divine things are
excluded from being either spiritual, the
Antitype, or substance. Whereas it was
the Heavenly things themselves that are
in Christ, in which consists the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and end of Types and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And my subsequent exceptions against
the said Argument are as plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answered;
<q>That if the Antitype was
Matterial and Mystical, because the Type
or Shadow was Material, then this is
like as to argue, That because Circumcision
which was a Type, was Material or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
therefore the Circumcision of the
Spirit which is the Antitype of it,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:43872:123"/>
must needs be outward too, and not
Mystical; and thus he might as well
reason touching all other Types and
Shadows under the Law, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
or good things to come Prefigur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or Shadowed by them, That because
the Priests under the Law, (at the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Tabernacle or Temple) were Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of outward or Temporal things,
Carnal Ordinances, Shadows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those good things to come, which
Christ was said to be the High Priest
of, must needs be Temporal and not
Mystical; which to assert were absurd,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And I farther proceed in my Answer,
about the Heavenly and Spiritual things
which the Law had the Shadow of,
<hi>viz.</hi> Whereas both the Heavenly and
more perfect Tabernacle and Altar, with
the Heavenly things, are all Mystery and
Spiritual, the Offering and living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
are Spiritual, the Passover Spiritual,
the Seed Spiritual, the Bread, the Fruit
of the Vine, the Oyl, the Flesh and
Blood which give Life to the Soul, yea,
the Water and Blood which washeth
and sprinkleth the Conscience are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Mysterious, as the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
it self is, which they belong to,
and these things known in. And this is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43872:123"/>
the New and Living way, which Christ
set open through the vail of his Flesh,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</q> Let him receive this who can.</p>
            <p>And if our Adversary and his abetters
know no more of the Mystery of Christ's
Blood or Work of purging and sprinkling
the Conscience, than their profession and
application of the Material Blood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the sanctifying Spirit and Operation
of it; they may remain long enough with
defiled Consciences, and full of Envy and
Malice. That precious outward Offering
and Blood of Christ outwardly shed, has
long been greatly abused by misapplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the holy design and ends thereof
perverted, by carnal Professors, to indulge
themselves in Sin and Disobedience against
Christ during Life. Now laying aside the
Baptist's Argument aforesaid, I do grant
that the Material <hi>Blood</hi> (whereby all things
under the Law were purged) as it had the
very Image of the Material Blood of Christ
that was outwardly shed, it was Typical
thereof. And <hi>that Blood of Christ</hi> including
his whole Sacrifice, argued by the Apostle
to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> as the Antitype, answering
and fulfiling the <hi>Types</hi> thereof, and which
were not only Types of that Blood and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
as outwardly offered, but also a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the inward and spiritual sprinkling,
purging and sanctifying of the Conscience,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43872:124"/>
by Christ our High Priest, with his Blood
and Spirit of Grace.</p>
            <p>The good things to come, which the Law
had the shadow of, but not the very Image
of them, were Heavenly and Spiritual
things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. But the Law had the
very Image or Resemblance of the Material
Blood of Christ that was shed, in that it
had material Blood of Sacrifices, one Blood
resembles another; therefore that Material
or Natural Blood outwardly shed, was not
those Spiritual and Heavenly things which
the Law had the shadow, and not the very
Image of.</p>
            <p>The Material and Typical Blood whereby
all things were purged under the Law was
sprinkled on them by <hi>Moses</hi> and the High-Priest,
therefore 'tis Christ our High Priest,
who sprinkles and effectually purgeth the
Conscience, which he doth not Literally,
but Spiritually, in which work his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Power is livingly concerned, as
the efficient Cause, and his Blood and
whole Sacrifice in preparing and making
way for, and obtaining Redemption and
Remission of Sins, received upon true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
on our parts. It's said, <hi>How much
more shall the Blood of Christ, who through the
eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to
God, purge your Consciences from dead works
to serve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. The
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:43872:124"/>
value, efficacy and fruit of his offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without spot to God, is greatly or
principally placed upon <hi>the eternal Spirit;</hi>
and so is the work of Sanctification and
effectually purging the Conscience, both
from dead works and the pollution of Sin.
That which inwardly and effectually purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Conscience, and sprinkles the heart
from an evil Conscience, is the Spirit, the
spiritual Vertue Blood and Life of Christ, that
actually purgeth and cleanseth them from
all Sin, who truly walk in his light, which
has the sanctifying life and vertue in it.</p>
            <p>There was a kind of expiation and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by way of Sacrifice under the Law and
old Covenant, yet the Consciences thereby
not purified nor made perfect.</p>
            <p>But the Expiation or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Cleansing,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. That's made
and prepared by Christ himself and his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and the Covenant of Grace and
Mercy (wherein that work of Grace is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed)
<hi>Sealed</hi> with <hi>his own Blood;</hi> this reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Conscience to a real purifying and
perfecting thereof by the Spirit and Power
of Christ. <hi>By one Offering he hath perfected
for ever them that are Sanctified, whereof the
Holy Ghost also is witness to us,</hi> Heb. 10. 14,
15. Therefore that Expiation made by
that most excellent Offering without us, is
fulfilled by the Spirit in the work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:43872:125"/>
within us. We are delivered from
the outward Law and the Curse of it by the
Body of Christ, but are made free from the
Law and Sin of Death by the Law of the
Spirit and Life in Christ Jesus, <hi>Ro.</hi> 7. 4. &amp;
8. 2. To that of <hi>Act 20. 28. The Church
of God which he purchased with his own Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon the Man has some slight flings
at me, but makes very little work on't. As
to my saying, <hi>The Blood of God</hi> (which is
God's own Blood, and whereby his Church
is purchas'd) <hi>must needs be spiritual, and the
Covenant of God is inward and spiritual, and
so is the Blood of it,</hi> consequently both <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical.</hi>
I did not hereby hold that God is
either <hi>Material,</hi> or has a <hi>Material Body</hi> or
Blood, but the contrary, that <hi>his own Blood</hi>
whereby his Church is purchased is more
than the Material or Natural Blood of Christ
that was shed, though that was a part of the
Sacrifice offered for Man's Redemption; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dare our Adversary say that Blood
could be properly called <hi>God's own Blood</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he holds that God has a <hi>material</hi> Body
and Blood) no more than the <hi>Annotation</hi>
thereupon, which saith, Of <hi>God's own Blood,
that which appertaineth to Christ's humanity, is
attributed to his Divinity, because of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of properties and union of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in one Person.</hi> Which Notation or the
Terms of it, I shall not now dispute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:43872:125"/>
               <hi>But I'le take leave to explain my self far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the spiritual vertue and mystery of</hi>
God's own Blood (and the Blood of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Covenant, the Blood of sprinkling therein,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) wherehy God has purchased his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God's own Blood,</hi> was no less than his <hi>own
dear</hi> Son, Christ himself: It was a manner
of speaking, the Blood put for the whole
Offering, the <hi>innocent Blood</hi> that <hi>Judas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,
was <hi>Christ himself,</hi> Mat. 27. 4. And
the Ransom or Price given for Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
was <hi>Christ himself,</hi> who came to
give his life for the Ransome of many, <hi>Matt.
20</hi> 28. And he gave himself a <hi>Ransome</hi> for
all Men, to be testified of in due time,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. God spared not his own Son,
but delivered him up for us all. There's a
twofold work in the Redemption, that is
by Jesus Christ, 1. By <hi>the Sacrifice</hi> and
<hi>Mediation</hi> of Christ, general for all Men.
2. By his Power, Spirit and Life, actually
freeing and delivering the truly believing
Soul from Sin and from the Nature and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Sin and Condemnation, because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in which sense God's Church was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
with his own Blood, and in which
last and special sense my Answer was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
as not only by the natural or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Blood shed, but principally by the
spiritual Blood or Life of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:43872:126"/>
God's sparing not his own Son, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
him up for us all, includes the whole
Sacrifice of Christ in Soul and Body which
were offered; therefore <hi>God's own Blood,</hi> is
such an high and elegant Phrase, as bespeaks
the great love of God in Christ, as the
whole Ransom and Price of Man's Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both outwardly and inwardly, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
by the Ransom given by Christ's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
and Sacrifice, and inwardly, by the
operation of his Life, Power and Spirit,
which Mystically is that precious Blood,
that is opposed to all corruptible things,
which redeems from the vain Conversation,
from all Iniquity, and effectually washeth and
clcanseth us from our Sins, purgeth and
sprinkles our Consciences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And farther, to Answer to Types and
Shadows under the Law, of shedding Blood
and sprinkling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That God according
to his Mercy saved us by the washing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
and renewing of the Holy
Ghost, which he <hi>shed</hi> on us abundantly,
through Jesus Christ our Saviour, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.
5, 6. And I'le sprinkle clean water upon
them, and wash them from all their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
saith the Lord.</p>
            <p>And the Blood of sprinkling which the
spiritual believers were come unto, has the
same effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:43872:126"/>
And if the name of <hi>Water</hi> be attributed to
the Spirit, as it is, <hi>Jo. 7. 38, 39. Light and Life,</hi>
The name of <hi>Blood</hi> may also; which is not
to Allegorize away or invalidate the outward
Blood or Sacrifice of Christ, or any part
thereof; yet the Mystery thereof, we may
not deny, but confess. And according to
the answers I have given for the Blood of
Christ, and the Mystery thereof, our deceased
Friend and Brother <hi>Robert Bercley</hi> expresly
agrees, whose Testimony therefore I am
the more willing to cite, because <hi>G. Keith</hi>
has approved of his Works, p. 60. <hi>R. B</hi>'s
Testimony in his Works, p. 10. follows
in these words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>This Blood (speaking of the Blood of
Christ that is healing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is known
and felt within to wash and purge the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
for Christ as he is within is not
without his Blood which is Spiritual, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the pure Blood of the <hi>Vine,</hi> and is
that Wine of the Kingdom which is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi>
felt to wash and to refresh, which
he gives to them who know not distinctly
the outward shedding of his Blood, as it
was many hundred years ago, and which
many are ignorant of, who have heard
much of the outward shedding of his Blood,
but know not the <hi>Blood</hi> as shed and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
forth <hi>in them,</hi> to sprinkle their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
from dead Works; for it is <hi>a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi>

Carnal; <hi>and his Blood which they Drink
of, is</hi> Pure <hi>and</hi> Heavenly, <hi>and not</hi> Humane
<hi>or</hi> Elementary; <hi>as</hi> Augustin <hi>also affirms,</hi>
Ps. 98. Except a Man Eat my Flesh he hath
not in him Life Eternal: <hi>And he saith,</hi> The
Words which I speak unto you are Spirit and
Life, understand spiritually what I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
Ye shall not Eat of <hi>this Body</hi> which ye
see, and Drink this Blood which they shall
spill that Crucifie me. I am the living Bread
which have dscended from Heaven; He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himself the Bread who descended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
exhorting that we should believe in him,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:43872:127"/>
Unto which I further add for Illustration,
<hi>That the pure Blood of Grapes</hi> promised to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
and <hi>Israel,</hi> Gen. 49. 11. <hi>Deut</hi> 32. 14.
was Typical of this spiritual Blood and
Fruit of the Heavenly Vine Christ Jesus,
which truly relieves and comforts the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
and sorrowful Soul that comes unto
him.</p>
            <p>And also the <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> the <hi>Butter,
Oyl,</hi> and <hi>Wheat,</hi> and other Temporal Blessings
which were in the promised Land, were
all Types of Christ and the spiritual Blessings
received in him, in his Kingdom and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Canaan.</p>
            <p>And <hi>the Oyl and Wine</hi> which the Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
<hi>Samaritan</hi> poured into the Wounds
(of the Man that was wounded by Thieves
and left half Dead) <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 34 were also
Typical of the healing Vertue, Life and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Blood of Christ Jesus, which he
graciously poureth into many wounded
Souls.</p>
            <p>As concerning the word <hi>Personality</hi> and
<hi>Personal Existence,</hi> as applyed to <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Christ;</hi> I have sometimes questioned, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the word <hi>Humane,</hi> as ascribed to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
Body of Christ, (which is spiritual)
and also to his Soul or Spirit, for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
1. Because imposed on us by some
Adversaries without Scripture proof of
those terms, and not to Question Christ's
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:43872:128"/>
glorious <hi>Manhood;</hi> (for in that sense I
admit of, and sometime may use the word
<hi>Humanity;</hi> either for <hi>Man,</hi> or for the
Good Nature and disposition of Man, as
of the word <hi>Trinity</hi> for <hi>Three,</hi> being not
willing to maintain contest about Words,
but to mind the thing intended thereby.)
2. Because false Arguments have been drawn
thence against Christ and his Light in
Man. 3. Because of the carnal Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of too many thereof, who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of expecting Christ to come again in
the Flesh, in the same manner as he was on
Earth, and to be seen with their carnal Eyes,
neglect the introversion of their Minds to
Christ's inward appearance in Spirit. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
whilst Men feed upon such Notions
and Imaginations of Christ, excluding him
out of their Hearts, they exclude the living
and Heart-purifying Faith of Christ, so that
their Faith is but Dead and Fruitless, whilst
such seem to adore. Christ as only an <hi>outward
Christ,</hi> or as <hi>wholly without them,</hi> and <hi>not in
them,</hi> instead of opening the Door of their
Hearts unto him to let him in, they harbour
and indulge their own Corruptions, Pride,
Scorn, Envy and Covetousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in
their Hearts, out of which proceed all these
bitter Reproches, Revilings and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which we meet with this Day, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:43872:128"/>
In all my former questioning their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural
terms (who profess the Scriptures
to be their only Rule) ascribed to God and
Christ, I never designed to deny his being
<hi>our Mediator</hi> as <hi>Man,</hi> nor to oppose his
coming in Power and great Glory, in his
gloryfied spiritual Body, to Judge the Quick
and the Dead in the last Day; tho I have
sometimes shunned controversy on that
Point, and about the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>last Day</hi>
of Judgment; Urging not to put the day
of the Lord afar off, nor to neglect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
day of their Visitation and Judgment
of Christ, by his Spirit and Light within
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Question how are the Dead raised and
with what Body come they forth,</hi> I have often
waved as unnecessary as well as unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
being reprehended in some, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
35, 26. I being willing to acquiesce in the
will of God in that matter, to give a Body
as it pleaseth him, and to every Seed its own
Body as proper thereunto, <hi>ver.</hi> 38.</p>
            <p>One thing I would be better understood in,
Not having fully explained a Passage in that
Book, <hi>Christ Ascended,</hi> Pref. and <hi>p.</hi> 67.
<q>Where 'tis implied that we do not affirm
Christ is in every Man, or that every
Man hath the Son, but a measure of his
Light, Grace or Heavenly Gift in all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:43872:129"/>
Whereby is meant Christ in his fulness
is not in any Man, nor revealed in every
Man, nor is every Man in Christ.</p>
            <p>Neither is Christ in every Man, as he is
in them in whom <hi>the Body is Dead because of
Sin,</hi> Rom. 8. 10. But as <hi>a Light,</hi> as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<hi>Seed,</hi> as the <hi>Word,</hi> he is in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in every Man, but every Man is not
in Christ as the new Creature is, and all true
Believers who walk in his Light, are in him,
and he in them.</p>
            <p>And for our endeavours to draw Peoples
Minds off, from their carnal expectations
of Christ's outward coming again in the
Flesh; or from resting upon a fleshly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him as come in the Flesh without
them only, that their Minds may be turned
to his Light and Grace within them, to know
his Power and Work in them.</p>
            <p>This cannot be truly deemed any <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Doctrin or Ministry, and we are sure
<hi>G. K.</hi> did not so deem it heretofore, but
the contrary; see his <hi>Help in time of need,</hi> p.
22. <q>This is the Antichrist who denies
Christ the Son come thus in the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of himself in the Heart, for that come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ in his Bodily appearance at
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Antichrist will not, does not
deny it, being he knows it will never
harm his Kingdom, so to confess him come,
provided Christ's Kingdom be not set up
in the Heart.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:43872:129"/>
So that Antichrist's work now-a-days, is
to oppose Christ's spiritual Coming and
Kingdom; and yet pretend to own his
coming in the Flesh: Yet this greater subti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>Antichrist's</hi> work now than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
will not cover his evil designs; but the
true Seed Christ will prevail, and his Power
reign over that Spirit of Antichrist, and
Son of Perdition. Glory to God, and to
the Lamb that sitteth upon the Throne.</p>

J. Cole</hi> declares, That they are not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
<hi>He insults,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a strange story and incredible,
That ever <hi>Jos. Cole</hi> insulted in any such
Blasphemous contempt of the Protestant
Bible, as to our being not at all concerned,
so we are not in any such contempt, no,
farr be it from us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Josiah Cole</hi> is so far from joyining with
the said <hi>A. S.</hi> that he Writes in Testimony
against him, by way of Answer to his
Pamphlet, as finding him therein smiting
at the People called Quakers, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to render them odious, by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>That they are led by a deluding Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.
So that <hi>Josiah Cole</hi> had no reason to joyn
with him, or take his part against any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Protestants, <hi>Whore unvail'd,</hi> p. 57.</p>
            <p>Our Accuser proceeds farther upon the
said story, which he would turn upon the
Quakers, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. p. 9, 10. <hi>Now why should these Men
be reputed Protestants, they count themselves
none of us, who are not concerned on our part,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43872:134"/>
no, not against the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>but draw
their Arms against us, who joyn with them, not
only against our Ministers, but our Bibles.</hi> [Here
are Lyes, and gross Calumnies accumulated
against us] <hi>Why should these be reputed as
Christians? Can they be Christians who Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
the Bible? Answer</hi> No, but these are
horrid and gross slanders against the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
who have approved themselves both
better Protestants and Christians than their
Persecutors, and such a Persecuting, Sculk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Adversary as this our Accuser, who
seems strenuously to seek our ruin, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to murther our Christian and
Civil Reputations; but to us it is no more
than the hissing of <hi>The Snake in the Grass,</hi> or
like one that whispers out of the ground.
And his next Charge is also grosly false, as
'tis intended against us, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. Surely their Light within is Darkness,
who joyn with the most ignorant and bigotted of
the Romish Emissaries against our Bible, <hi>p.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere,</hi> When, or where, do the Quakers
so joyn with those Emissaries? I take this to
be a most gross and foul piece of Forgery
and Calumny.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>Our Accuser gives high, and superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
commendations of</hi> John Pennyman, as an
ancient, worthy and <hi>most</hi> sincere honest Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who (<hi>he says</hi>) had been inveigl'd with their
false shew and pretences to Piety, remained zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43872:135"/>
in their Communion, and suffered with them,
till he discovered the grossest Immoralities among
them, lying, cheating and foul uncleanness,
which having complained of, and otherwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to their superiours, tho' the fact could
not be denyed, yet they would not censure any
that continued in their Vnity, for which reason,
he (after long strugling with them, to amend
their scandalous vices) at last left them, <hi>p.</hi>
10.</p>
            <p>As his Character of the said <hi>J. P.</hi> in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative
degree, appears a piece of flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
insincere and unmerited, his scandalous
stories on his behalf, and reason of his leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us, appear neither true nor impartial: I
never heard of any undeniable proof of the
matter of fact from <hi>J. P.</hi> and I am sorry,
that in his old Age, he should give such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to such malicious, persecuting Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
as this, to reproach us, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as if we did indulge and hold unity
with such Persons <hi>guilty of the grossest Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities,
lying, cheating and foul uncleanness.</hi>
Will <hi>J. Pennyman</hi> adventure to stand by
these stories and aggravations against us? I
question it: And he knows better the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his leaving us, than the account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and what offence he took at our
Friends Paper, that was published to clear
us from the great Offence and Reproach he
gave by his notorious unwarrantable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43872:135"/>
at the Exchange, and how he was
committed thereupon, I am not willing
now to repeat it upon him. I would not
have him think that I am in any Revenge
or <hi>Rage</hi> against him (as we are unjustly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
neither would I have him dye in enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or uncharitableness against us. And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he has espied out any particular mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
that's no just cause of his leaving
our Communion, much less of turning open
Enemy against us: Or if such miscarriages
have not been judicially proved before those
called our Superiors, their not Censuring
the parties accused to Excommunication,
for want of such proof, was no just cause of
his leaving our Communion, or turning Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
to defame us.</p>
            <p>16. That we recommend the most virulent
of <hi>Rome's</hi> invectives against the Protestants
and their Bible too, <hi>p. 10. Is a gross Falshood;
we know no such Recommendation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. <hi>How tame is the Church of</hi> England <hi>that
suffers</hi> Fox<hi>'s Journal to be newly Printed and
presented to the Vniversity of</hi> Oxford, <hi>and many
other of the Quaker Prophets to be printed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi>
11. Which unjustly implies some great Crime
and Iniquity in the said Journal, and a great
offence to this Persecutor, that we are not held
under severe Restraint and Persecution, that
he and such persecuting Incendiaries may
have liberty without controul to Asperse
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:43872:136"/>
and Misrepresent us, and we none to defend
our Innocency, which is high Injustice.</p>
            <p>18. That the Quaker Prophets cast the utmost
contempt upon the Person of Jesus our God,
<hi>p. 11. Which is a most odious Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. <hi>That by the Register of their Sufferings</hi>
(i.e. <hi>Quakers) they <hi>hope</hi> to make their Sufferings
for the Truth (as they call it) to exceed all the
Ten Persecutions; and to be more undeserv'd
than the Sufferings of Christ himself, or of the
Apostles,</hi> p. 11. These are gross and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
false Suggestions, we have no such
hopes. He cites <hi>E. B.</hi> unfairly and partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this Point, and yet the Comparison
about the Sufferings of the People of God
in this Age, <hi>as greater or more unjust</hi> than in
the Days of Christ, or the Apostles, or since,
is a mistake, we shall not stand by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison;
whether 'twas so first verbally stated
by <hi>E. B. himself,</hi> or by some mistake since, I
shall not undertake to determin, unless I see
his original Copy. However we are clear'd
from either magnifying our Sufferings above
Christ's or his Apostle's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For we do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Christ's Sufferings before all other Mens,
and that he was wholly Innocent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly
and unjustly Prosecuted and put to
Death by wicked Hands, who were justly
charged with Murther therein. This Point
is farther cleared on our parts, in <hi>The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers

Vindication against</hi> F. Bugg's <hi>Calumnies,</hi>

of <hi>The Snake in the Grass</hi> has more justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Act of Christ's Persecutors and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
(and consequently undervalued his
Innocency in his Sufferings) than ever the
Quakers did, where he reflects upon <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>'s
Argument, <hi>That Killing of Christ out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
being the Act of wicked Men, could be no
meritorious Act,</hi> Satan Disr. Glean. <hi>p.</hi> 5. This
he retorts as my Argument, but does not
answer or refute it, and I am of the same
mind still, that the <hi>Merit,</hi> and what was <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious</hi>
was in Christ's Obedience and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
in his suffering to Death; and not
in the Act of wicked Men in Killing and
Murthering him, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 52 &amp; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23.
And if this Adversary be of the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
let him speak out and plainly tell us,
if he believes that the Act of wicked Men
in Murthering the Just <hi>one,</hi> was a <hi>meritorious</hi>
Act.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>Many of them</hi> (i.e. Quakers) <hi>suffer'd
(not so much as they deserved) for open and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Blasphemy,</hi> p. 12. Which is a gross
Calumny and Scandal, undeserv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dly cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and is a plain indication of this
Accuser's great malice, cruelty and persecute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:43872:137"/>
21. <hi>That the hardship of Imprisonments (which
many of the poorer sort of them</hi> (i.e. Quakers)
<hi>did suffer; was the greatest of their Sufferings,</hi>
p. 13. Which is a great Falshood. Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
was not the greatest of their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
or of their Hardships. But the strait
and close confinements duress and hardships
which many suffered in noisom Goals,
whereby many lost their Lives, and many
their Healths impaired, besides spoil of Goods
ruining Families, and divers banished out
of their native Countries into foreign Islands
and parts beyond Seas, as also cruel Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
Beatings, Stonings and other Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities
which many have suffered from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
pretending for the Church; these
hardships were more than mere Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
To the shame of this Persecutor
and the rest of his cruel Fraternity be it Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
His contemning and undervaluing our
Sufferings will not extenuate their Cruelty
and Persecution.</p>
            <p>22. <hi>That</hi> Isaac Pennington <hi>in his considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning</hi> Israel, <hi>p. 3. gives that</hi> (i.e.

is false in the last; for Christ and his Light
within are not divided, nor is his Light pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to him, nor do we prefer any other
Light than that of Christ to <hi>Moses</hi>'s or any
other dispensation or Ministry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:43872:137"/>
23. <hi>That</hi> our Friends leave out whole Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
full of hideous Blasphemies and Treasons,
<hi>i.e.</hi> out of the reprinted Works of their Prophets
(<hi>p.</hi> 14.)</p>
            <p>Which is a most hideous and sordid Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny.</p>
            <p>24. That <hi>Edw. Burrough</hi> in his <hi>Epistle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed

(i.e. <hi>Infallible discerning Spirit) to all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

between Truth and Error, between every
false and right way, and it perfectly discovered
to us the true state of all things,</hi> p. 20. Upon
perusal of the place quoted in the said Epistle,
I do not find that <hi>E. B.</hi> extends the gift of
discerning, to all and every of the Quakers,
nor the discovery of the true state of all
things; herein are his words and intention
perverted, tho' he confesses that every one
has a true Light given by Christ, but not
that every one has attained to the same
gift of discerning of Spirits and States, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
1. <hi>E. B.</hi> personates the converted
and faithful among the Quakers, who
walk in the Light which gives to discern
between Truth and Error, the Right and
the Wrong way; for whatsoever things
are reproved are made manifest by the Light.
2dly, The perfect discovery of the true state
of <hi>all Things,</hi> He does in the place quoted,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:43872:138"/>
restrict to the discovery of the Fall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation
of Man, and to what's needful for
Man to know (<hi>i.e.</hi> in respect to Salvation.)
<hi>Epis. to Gr. Myst.</hi> (p. 7, 8.) We are not to
suppose that <hi>By discovery of the true state of
all things,</hi> he intended to ascribe Omniscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to us Creatures, no more than the Holy
Apostle <hi>John</hi> did in the like Expressions.
1 <hi>John 2. 20. But ye have an Vnction from
the Holy One, and ye know <hi>all Things.</hi>
               </hi> And
<hi>verse 27. But as the same Anointing teacheth
you of <hi>all Things,</hi> and is Truth and is no Lye.</hi>
These were all things needful for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and preservation in Christ Jesus.
And herein in this divine Unction, and the
teachings thereof stands the Infallibility,
Certainty or assurance we plead for, and
not in Man's Will, Wisdom, Parts, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements.
And as we keep in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
received from the Holy One, we
receive its Teachings which are true and
certain, and so fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Infallibility in what it Teacheth, being
Truth and no Lye. But if any go from this
Anointing into the Will or Wisdom of Man
or carnal Reasonings, they go into uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and so become fallible and subject to
fall into Error; erring from this certain
Principle produceth Error both in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and many times in Practice. For 'tis

<hi>As it taught them they did abide in him,</hi> i.e. <hi>in
the Son of God,</hi> ch. 2. 27. Who saith, <hi>abide

            <p>I find this Author to <hi>the Snake in the Grass,</hi>
is very apt frequently to misrepresent our
Friends Words, which I cannot impute so
much to his Ignorance, as Envious design
to make us as Infamous and Odious as he can.
As he had dealt by <hi>E. B.</hi> in the passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he has in like manner serv'd <hi>Francis
Howgil</hi> in his Preface to <hi>the Snake in the Grass,</hi>
(p. 244.) Which I did not so much search
or remark in the foregoing Answer, as since.
He charges <hi>F. H.</hi> with <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> quoting,
<hi>p.</hi> 232. of his Works, intitled, <hi>The Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel-day,</hi> where he saith, <q>He
that hath the Spirit of God, <hi>is in THAT</hi>
which is Equal (<hi>i.e.</hi> as follows) he that is
join'd to the Lord, is one Spirit, there
is Unity, and the Unity stands in Equality
it self.</q> Hence (and on some other words
curtaliz'd and mangl'd) the said Author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. Having thus made themselves Equal to
God in very Nature, it is not strange to see
them denying any other God or Christ but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
they pull God out of Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Snake, <hi>p. 245. These Blasphemous and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Inferences against the Quakers, as they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:43872:139"/>
are utterly denyed by us, I find no just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for them, from</hi> F. H'<hi>s Words, if
truly cited and considered, where he places
the</hi> Equality <hi>between the</hi> Father, Son <hi>and</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit: <hi>That <hi>which is</hi>
               </hi> Equal, <hi>he plainly
speaks of the</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> God <hi>in the place quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and by the Unity [stands in Equality
it self] he means no other, than that the
Saints</hi> Vnity <hi>stands in Christ, who is</hi> Equal
<hi>with the Father, according to Christ's own
Prayer,</hi> John 17. 21. That they all may be
one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee,
that they also may be one in us. <hi>And</hi> verse 22.
And the Glory which thou gavest me, I have
given them, that they may be One, as we are
One. <hi>And</hi> verse 23. I in them, and thou in
me, that they may be made perfect in one.</p>
            <p>That <hi>F. H.</hi> places the <hi>Equality</hi> in the
<hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and on his part, is evident by
his following Words, (left out by the said
Author) <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>He that is born from above,
is the Son of God, and he said, I and my
Father are one; and when the Son is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
and speaks, the Father speaks in
him, and dwells in him, and he in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, though the Saints cannot claim to
themselves that <hi>Equality</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (who
is their Head) hath; yet who can in Truth
deny their being made <hi>Partakers</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:43872:139"/>
Nature</hi> and Union in Christ Jesus, and
holy Spirit with the Father?</p>
            <p>The account which this Author of the
<hi>Snake</hi> hath given against <hi>Tho. Curtis,</hi> p. 20,
21, 22. which he saith, <hi>he has seen under the
hand of</hi> W. Clark, I do somewhat Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the Truth of divers Passages in it, as
whether <hi>T. C.</hi> is not therein mis-represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
though I cannot from my own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
refute them, yet 'tis very strange that
<hi>T. C.</hi> should be represented so very grosly
Ignorant, as in that said Account, (but I am
sure 'tis a gross Lye, that the Quakers do
hold, or have always held these Heresies
charged on him) or that <hi>G. Keith</hi> should
suffer him to be so foully expos'd in print;
if he was privy thereto, I am apt to think
'twas a piece of great <hi>Incivility,</hi> as well as
<hi>Ingratitude</hi> and Treachery against <hi>T. C.</hi> to
serve him such an ill turn.</p>
            <p>26. That he would not lessen the Sufferings
of the Quakers, (<hi>p. 13.) is a notorious Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood,
as his scoffing at, and vilifying them,
and rendring</hi> many of them to have suffer'd for
open and notorious Blasphemy (<hi>p. 12.) doth
evince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>27. <hi>That</hi> Mary Fell, <hi>after she was Married
to</hi> G. F. <hi>became the Mother of the</hi> Quakers
<hi>Church,</hi> (p. 17.) is a scornful Falshood, we
have not given her, or any other Woman
that Title; though she and many more
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:43872:140"/>
faithful Women have been own'd as <hi>Mothers</hi>
in <hi>Israel;</hi> but <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that is above, the
<hi>Mother</hi> of us all.</p>
            <p>28. That many of the generality of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
do stick in the very bottom of that sink of
Heresies, which they have been taught; and that
their Leaders go about to justify, excuse and
pallitate them, (<hi>p. 18) These proceed from
the</hi> Sink <hi>of his gross Calumnies and Malice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>29. <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>yearly Epistle, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all</hi> Quakers <hi>throughout the World, is their
supream Law,</hi> (p. 18.) is false again, we
know no such Epistle, that is so esteem'd
our supream Law; but rather Epistles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from our <hi>supream Law</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>30. <hi>That 'tis only for placing their Faith in
the outward</hi> Jesus, <hi>that the</hi> Quakers <hi>have so
condemned them,</hi> (i.e. the Priests) (p. 19.) This
is not true again, 'tis not for placing their
<hi>Faith</hi> (if it were really so) in an outward
<hi>Jesus,</hi> or rather Jesus without them; but
for their dead Faith without Christ, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Works and Fruit; and their many Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,

            <p>His story about one <hi>Archer</hi> in <hi>Wilts,</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning,
<hi>whether he was not among the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-Bishops,
who compos'd this last general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil?</hi>
(p. 19.) is very scurrilous and false,
as it is turned to affect the <hi>Quakers.</hi> We

<hi>to which the other</hi> Quakers <hi>gave the right
hand of Fellowship; and that there he Preach'd
and exercised his Talent with great Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
p. 19, 20. Though we have heard of
such an one's miscarriage, yet I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
and am perswaded, the latter part
of the <hi>story</hi> is a great <hi>Forgery,</hi> to scandalize
the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that either they gave him the
right hand of Fellowship, or that he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>London</hi> with great Approbation, after
he fled upon discovery; this is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
story, basely designed to cast Dirt
upon us; for the World well knows our
Christian care to expunge such from our
Society, upon the knowledge of their Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
but whether there be the like care
and practice in this Authors Church, he may
consider if he will.</p>

               <p>'Tis observable, that the said <hi>Author</hi> of

            <head>Some notice taken of the said
Author's Discourse for Water
Baptism.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HAving lately seen and received a Book
stiled,</hi> A Discourse proving the divine
Institution of Water-Baptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of The Snake in the Grass, <hi>and finding
these Passages after the Contents,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <q>That there will be published a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
by the same Author, shewing,
whom Christ hath ordain'd to Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Sacraments in his Church.</q> And
another,</hi> wherein is proved, that the chief of
the <hi>Quakers</hi> Heresies, were broached and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
in the days of the Apostles, and in
the first 150 Years after Christ.</p>
            <p>To the latter part whereof, I must tell
him, and Advertise the Reader, that this
officious Author should have spared his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Discourse, thus Charging the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
with Heresies, so long since broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and condemned, until he had seen an
Answer to his <hi>Snake in the Grass,</hi> wherein
he hath most unjustly and falsly Charged
the Quakers with numerous Heresies and
Errors (as also he hath in divers things very
falsly aspers'd them in this Discourse.) And
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43872:142"/>
if he repeat the same again upon us, (as it
may be suspected) to prove them so long
since broached and condemned; this will add
nothing of proof, that we the People called
Quakers are guilty thereof, but only serve
to shew his own Malice and Impertinency
and gross Calumnies already confuted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the viewing his said Discourse for Water-Baptism,
I find nothing material, but what
is mostly answer'd in the foregoing <hi>Antidote,</hi>
and Book therein referred unto in page 126.
Besides, I find him very much imposing and
begging the Question in his said Discourse,
1st. Pleading for <hi>Infant Baptism</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
as being <hi>the outward Seal of</hi> Christ's <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
(but without Scripture proof) and
then flees to the Baptists Arguments, for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
Believers or People Docible, from
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. and other Scriptures, which they
use to urge in opposition to sprinkling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
            <p>He miserably imposes in placing upon
outward Baptism, all these Priviledges, <hi>viz.
Regeneration,</hi> or <hi>being Born into the Church,
Baptizing into the Christian Faith,</hi> (p. 9, 10.)
<hi>The Promise of the Inward Baptism of the Holy
Ghost,</hi> (p. 12.) Calling the outward, <hi>The
means whereby we are made partakers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and whereby the inward Baptizm of the
Holy Ghost is given,</hi> p. 34, 60. All this he
places upon outward <hi>Baptism with Water:</hi>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:43872:142"/>
But then it must be upon the <hi>duly receiving</hi>
thereof, (p. 12.) wherein he hath before
included Infants as well as others, but all
this without Scripture Proof. Now if all
those Infants that are Sprinkled or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
be Regenerated and Born again and
Baptized into the Faith, and partakers of
the Holy Ghost and the Baptism thereof;
How will this agree or consist with their
Preaching the necessity of Regeneration, and
the new Birth to such when docible, seeing
he saith, a Man can be but once Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
(p. 9.) I find that when he pleads for
Baptizing Believers, (p. 23.) he cannot es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
the Baptist's Arguments, altho' he
hath reviled them as badly in a manner as
he hath done us, as is before shewed.</p>
            <p>I find that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. doth
Puzzle him, esteeming it an <hi>obscure Text,</hi> p. 22.
Which is, <hi>Christ sent me not to Baptize,</hi> &amp;c.
and he is very impertinent, and begging
the Question in his Answer to it.</p>
            <p>But while he Argues with the Baptists Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for Believers Baptizm, I take it for
granted, that he Argues for that, which he
and his Brethren the Clergy are out of the
practice of, and therefore <hi>insincere,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
his Works deserves to be rejected
whilst Infants are the Subjects chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:43872:143"/>
He bitterly exclaims against both <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,
Independents, Anabaptists, Quakers,
Socinians, Vnitarians, Latitudinarians</hi> and
<hi>Deists,</hi> &amp;c. in his Preface, as being <hi>the
Spawn of Rebellion and multifarious Schism,</hi>
(and especially against the <hi>Presbytery in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>)
either for their Indifferency or disuse
of Water Baptizm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See what a busy
Agent this is, as if he would have his Hand
against every Man: But I must leave him
for others concerned to deal with him, if
they see it worth their Time and Labour: I
having bestowed more for the Truth sake
(and for the sake of many more sincere
than himself) than he or his Works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
