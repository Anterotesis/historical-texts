            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The reason was because of the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest you had therein; not onely in regard of the spirituall brother-hood, and former acquaintance; but especially in respect of the subject thereof.

            <p>CHristian Reader, little did I dreame, that these private meditations, intended onely for a particular Congregation, should bee made thus publike to the view of the world: <hi>Sed homo proponit Deus disponit,</hi> man purposeth, but God disposeth. Importunity wrung them from me, and present opportunity, caused mee to yeeld thereunto. And the rather, because I saw now in good part effected, and very much advanced, by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mercy of Almightie God, that (concerning the fall of the English Euphraticall Iordan or Nationall Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, of Prelates) which I did conceive then to be very neare approaching: Being induced thereunto, by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the time appointed, and by God limited, for the Christian Churches pilgrimage, through her most vast wildernesse; following her all along it, as it were step by step, from one moneth to another, with the helpe and light of that true Type and right guide the old Church of Israel, <hi>having the Lord going before them by day in the pillar of a cloud to leade them the way, and by night in the pillar of fire to give them light, that they might goe both by day and by night, under the conduct of</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron. The want of which Typicall guide, hath beene the cause, in my opinion, that many (though very worthy men, and
<pb facs="tcp:94214:7"/>
well deserving of the Church of God, for their excellent labours in the exposition of the booke of the Revelation) have many times wandered along the said Desart, in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the footsteps of the said Christian Church which they have often missed. It being indeede as difficult to be found without the helpe of the foresaid Typicall guide, as I suppose, as any of those waies mentioned by <hi>Solomon, Prov. 30. 18. 19.</hi> but very easie having the said light going before. Therefore have I already laboured for a good while, and doe purpose to continue still (if I bee not prevented by God, or by the labour of some other in that kinde) to parallel the travell of both the foresaid Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp; their most notable accidents, &amp; to send it abroad. A tast whereof I profer unto thee in the meane while, the which, if being relished by thee, it findes any good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement at thy hands, though it be presented unto thee, in a very ill polished, because borrowed, language, it will the more encourage me, to goe on with cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and alacritie, in my intended purpose, by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the All, sufficient God and thy Christian pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in my behalfe, to him, <hi>who is no respector of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> and who doth <hi>reveale his secrets, to all them that feare him,</hi>

the one being greater then the other, as the Ocean is greater then the Rivers, and the Rivers, are greater the one then the other, yea greater then the Lakes, &amp; Pooles of waters, though they also be called by the title of <hi>Sea</hi> in Scripture phrase, as that great Vessell made by <hi>Salomon,</hi> for the service of the Temple, was likewise called by the same title of <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cron. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Sea.</hi> They differ also in Quality, some of them being salt, the other brackish, and the other fresh, these last being as it were distilled and purified in their passage through the veines of the earth.</p>
            <p>Moreover such waters thus gathered together to make up these diverse <hi>Seas,</hi> are very powerfull and unresistable, no earthly power being able to stay either the ebbing or flowing of the Sea, or the most violent course or streame of any of the least Rivers; much lesse to abate their overflowings.

not to cast it away as a new Doctrine, though it might seeme so at the first sight, but to ponder it well before, though they finde it clothed in a very course and homely language and yet borrowed; in which having dared to walke thus farre in publike, I will yet adventure a litle further, observing out of this text thus expounded some few points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the which I meane to handle as briefly as I can to apply them to some use of Admonition and exhortation.

and very like frogs which are most timorous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the least noise making them quickly to dive and hide themselves in their puddle wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But where will, or can these hide now them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: their Euphraticall Iordan being now dryed up? sure they can but skip up and downe, yet for a very little while, (and that yet as the fish doth in the frying pan, from which it falls in the fire) to croake and doe their message as it was shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for they must all be caught and killed (unlesse they repent, to give <hi>glory to the God of Heaven,</hi> as some shall assuredly doe as it appeares <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 13.) Besides by the drying up of their said Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes the terror of the Lord is fallen upon them, as it fell upon that prophane <hi>Balshazzar</hi> when hee saw <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 5. 5, 6.</note>

            <p>The first movers then or instrumentall causes of all of them were these foure windes which were to blow from the foure quarters of the world upon that of the Roman Empire, viz.
