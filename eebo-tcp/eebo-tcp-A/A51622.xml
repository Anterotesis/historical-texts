            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Garlick and Onions, in such plenty there;</l>
               <l>Delicates so divine, that, truth to say,</l>
               <l>I'd them almost adore as well as they.</l>
               <l>Altho the Levites tell us 'tis a Cheat</l>
               <l>One hour to worship what the next we eat,</l>
               <l>In all Religions some things dark there be,</l>
               <l>And this is an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Mystery.</l>
               <l>For <hi>Pharao</hi>—true that all things were not well,</l>
               <l>—He was misled—but must we then rebel?</l>
               <l>The Subjects, as i'th' sacred Rolls appears,</l>
               <l>To <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Crown, almost four hundred Years.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60099:10"/>Thus he,—but mad <hi>Abiram</hi> swears and raves,</l>
               <l>We will not, no by Heav'n, we won't be Slaves.</l>
               <l>Whom we have made, we can as soon unmake,</l>
               <l>And what with ease we gave, with ease can take:</l>
               <l>What has he done?—what mighty Action since?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Moses,</hi>—that thinking, that unthinking Prince.</l>
               <l>He, and his Sanhedrin, supine and still,</l>
               <l>What have they done that's good? how much that's ill.</l>
               <l>They cannot, dare not touch us, no, they fear</l>
               <l>That <hi>Pharao</hi> yet shou'd overtake 'em here.</l>
               <l>I'm for a Tyrant, or an Anarchy,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Pharao</hi> my King, or I'll be <hi>King of me.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Go on! swear, flatter, lie, dissemble, rave,</l>
               <l>And the next step, the very next's the Grave:</l>
               <l>You cannot 'scape—Nature's black horrid Womb</l>
               <l>Labors with Earthquakes to bring forth your Tomb.</l>
               <l>It rives, it gapes, you screech, you fall, you go</l>
               <l>To murmur with your Fellow-Fiends below.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nor shall even Heathen <hi>Balaam</hi> be forgot,</l>
               <l>Nor his curst <hi>Midianitish</hi> Wives and Plot.</l>
               <l>(Even <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Ass cou'd preach, and since we find</l>
               <l>Taught other Brutes, the Panther and the Hind.)</l>
               <l>Dearly he lov'd the Wages of Deceit,</l>
               <l>And God's own <hi>Israel</hi> did as dearly hate.</l>
               <l>A Sorcerer, who any thing cou'd be,</l>
               <l>Transform'd, as quick as thought, t' a Bird, a Tree,</l>
               <l>And e'er his monstrous Shapes you throughly scan,</l>
               <l>Be that <hi>unfeather'd two leg'd thing</hi> a Man.</l>
               <l>But then what sweet, what charming Notes he sung,</l>
               <l>What Honey drop'd from his false <hi>Syren</hi> Tongue.</l>
               <l>Wou'd Angels chuse in mortal Verse to raise</l>
               <l>Ours, and their own eternal Master's Praise,</l>
               <l>To <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Words they'd tune their heav'nly Airs,</l>
               <l>Thy Songs, thy Language, <hi>Balaam,</hi> shou'd be theirs.</l>
               <l>Why would'st thou <hi>Israel</hi> curse, ah <hi>Balaam</hi>! why,</l>
               <l>Nor with the Righteous live as well as dye?</l>
               <l>Why with thy soft bewitching Arts betray</l>
               <l>To <hi>Midianitish</hi> Gods and Wives a Prey?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60099:10"/>From Hill to Hill why didst with <hi>Balaak</hi> go</l>
               <l>To enchant and curse when Heav'n commanded No.</l>
               <l>Ah! hadst thou <hi>Israel</hi>'s God indeed ador'd,</l>
               <l>Hadst thou in earnest fear'd th' eternal Lord,</l>
               <l>Thy Songs so sweet, thy Numbers so divine,</l>
               <l>Scarce <hi>Moses</hi> Song had won more Fame than thine:</l>
               <l>But now thy Glory sleeps in Shades profound,</l>
               <l>Fy Fate and gloomy Death encompass'd round.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now, Muse, the smoother Arts of Praising try,</l>
               <l>Tho our hard Fortunes there Success deny:</l>
               <l>Sour all our Soul, hardly one Stroke that's fair,</l>
               <l>One single Line or Feature pleasing there.</l>
               <l>This sure will happier Images create,</l>
               <l>And force one short-liv'd Joy in spite of Fate.</l>
               <l>Together summon all that's sweet and fine,</l>
               <l>Let the bright Field with such calm Glories shine,</l>
               <l>As Fancy prints around a Form divine.</l>
               <l>That rosie smile which decks a much lov'd Face,</l>
               <l>That Beauty ineffable, that more than humane Grace,</l>
               <l>Tho all together mix'd exactly be,</l>
               <l>Yet, God-like <hi>Phinehas,</hi> all come short of Thee.</l>
               <l>Thy Mien does Awe and Admiration move</l>
               <l>With such a purple Blush the Angels <hi>love:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Just such a radiant Gloom his Face adorns</l>
               <l>As paints the East in Summers rising Morns;</l>
               <l>His Soul is in his Body well design'd,</l>
               <l>His Face the lively Image of his <hi>Mind</hi>:</l>
               <l>Of honorable Stock and ancient House;</l>
               <l>His Youthful Laurels shade his Manly Brows:</l>
               <l>No tame Passivity did him disgrace,</l>
               <l>Nor did his Doctrine e'er belye his Face.</l>
               <l>God made him Man, nor wou'd h' himself debase</l>
               <l>And enter of the brutish bearing Race:</l>
               <l>With Hand, as well as Tongue, he'd the Gainsayers strike,</l>
               <l>He drew both Swords, and us'd them both alike.</l>
               <l>His Zeal to God did rather much improve</l>
               <l>Than check or stifle his dear Country's Love.</l>
               <l>When both at once engag'd, he livelier grew,</l>
               <l>And double Strength from the fair Quarrel drew.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:60099:11"/>See where God's Champion does undaunted stand,</l>
               <l>A shining Javelin in his mighty hand,</l>
               <l>Stop'd Heav'ns high Arm, when it did just engage,</l>
               <l>And stay'd the Plague, as it began to rage.</l>
               <l>Eternal Praises are to <hi>Phinehas</hi> due,</l>
               <l>His Name shall live, if Truth it self be true.</l>
               <l>O may that God of Hosts, who oft did bless</l>
               <l>His rightful Arms with their deserv'd Success,</l>
               <l>A double Portion of his Spirit bestow</l>
               <l>On every meaner Priest that serves below;</l>
               <l>With such a noble warmth their Minds inflame,</l>
               <l>And grant their Courage as their Cause the same.</l>

               <l>Fain wou'd I all the other Heroes trace,</l>
               <l>The Glory and the Pride of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Race,</l>
               <l>Who still'd those Murm'rers which refus'd to fight</l>
               <l>Against the faint devoted <hi>Canaanite;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and a numerous Train,</l>
               <l>Who never counsell'd, never fought in vain.</l>
               <l>But hasty Fate allows no longer stay,</l>
               <l>It stops my Pen, and pulls my Hand away.</l>
