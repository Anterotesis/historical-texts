         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>
Pulpit Harangues. There is no question to be made, but
that all who understand the excellency and perfection of
Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Discipline, must confess the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
under its present Constitution, to be the most Orthodox,
the most pure, without the Phylacteries of Hypocritical
Ceremonies, and the closest to primitive Institution of
any Religion in the World. And this is further to be said
for the Protestant English Clergy, that you rarely hear
of any that fall under those publick Scandals and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
for which the Romish Clergy, from the highest
to the lowell, are loudly and so generally taxed, so tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
they sin more out of Vanity than Wickedness.</p>
            <p>But the Nation is so overstocked with <hi>Crape Gowns,</hi> that
'tis impossible but that in such a number there must be
failings among them, subject to great Remark and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation:
An ill Omen of sick Divinity when it comes
to be mantled in the shrouds appropriated for the dead.
Now these men in Crape, as they are generally young,
so they are generally very highly conceited. A character
which they will much more advance, if they refuse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Admonishments of others, as they undertake
to be the Instructers of others themselves. And therefore
they will do well kindly to accept of this Mirror here
presented them, new foyl'd and furbish'd up, to be placed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64370:3"/>
in their Studies, and look'd in every morning, by which
means they will be able to find the reason why some of
their Churches are so empty, others so numerously thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and by reforming their own contemplated blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
gain an esteem, both of their persons and their
Doctrine, more operative upon the good Opinions of
the People. No P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>agiary Looking-glass, as that Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb
<hi>Heraclitus</hi> has with a debauch'd, and ridiculous
mummery intimated to the World.</p>
            <p>'Tis most certain then, that there is something which
does lessen the value of many of our Clergy, and render
them less serviceable to the Church, than might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
hoped for: And this may be referred to two
very plain things, the Ignorance of some, and the Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of others.</p>
            <p>This proceeds in part from the old fashioned Methods
and Discipline of Schooling itself: by vertue of which
Lads are kept till Sixteen on Seventeen Years of Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
a pure slavery to a few Latine and Greek words, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented

sing over to a lamentable Tune Three or Four Scanzas of
<hi>Lilly</hi>'s Poetry; if he be quick and ready to tell what's
latine for all the Implements in his Fathers Shop, or his

cries the <hi>Pedagogue:</hi> a hopeful Youth, 'tis a Thousand
pities but he should be a Scholar; he'l prove a brave Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
man, and an excellent Preacher I warrant ye. Then
away with him presently to the University, where he
learns a little Logick, and a little Ethicks, and to speak
Truth and shame the Devil, a very little of every thing
else, and then the next time you meet him, whip! he's
got into the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>Well, when they have him at the Universitie, what do
they do with him there? There, if he be of the inferior
sort, that he may not over-heat his Brains with Study,
he is put to Bed making, Chamber-sweeping, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-fetching,
which are no question great preservatives
against vain Philosophy.</p>
            <p>However, the <hi>Fellow</hi> whom he serves, cannot but in
pitie, if not for Conscience sake, let him glean some
small morsels of his Knowledge, which costs him no
more then only the expence of that time while the young

Nightcap: From thence he learns, <hi>Quid est Logica?
Qua sunt Virtutes morales?</hi> and to number the Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

leave of the University, and by the first Carrier, upon a
Pack, away he goes by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>low Marches into his nown Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

and then have at a Parsonage; for the Gentlemen is put

to his choice, either of Preaching or Starving. Now what
a Champion for Truth can we expect from such a one
as this? What a Raiser of Doctrines, what a Confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

without the Leg of Prayer. The same Person added, now
that these feet may be able to bear us thither, we must put
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64370:6"/>
on the Hose of Faith. For the Apostle says, <hi>Our feet must
be shod with the preparation of the Gospel.</hi> Was it not
elegantly observ'd, <hi>That Goodness was the milky way to</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter<hi>'s
Pallace.</hi> But that which follows was far more neat
and curious, full of fancy, and worthy imitation upon
those words of St. <hi>Iohn; These things I write unto you,
that ye sin not.</hi> The observation was, That it is the purpose
of the Scripture to drive men to Heaven, which he made
out thus; <hi>The Scriptures contain Doctrines, Precepts, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
Threatnings, and Histories. Now take these five Stones,
and put them into the scrip of the heart, and throw them with
the sling of Faith by the hand of a strong resolution, against
the forehead of sin, and we shall see it fall before us like</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah.
Now if these things flow naturally, or that a young
<hi>Levite</hi> can blow'em out of his Nose, how happy is he
that can s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oop in his Pulpit, and make use of his Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
how easie a thing is it to drill out an hour in tickling
the Auditors Ears with Parables. But it they come hard,
Heav'ns bless us! how does that poor man labour to make
an Ass of himself? for Similitudes without Judgment
are the most ridiculous things in the world: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the <hi>Round Earth cannot fill the Triangular Heart
of Man.</hi> A most pithy expression to set forth the ambition
of Mankind. An Errour to be laught at by the Butchers
Boys, who know that the heart is no more triangular than
a Town-Top.</p>
            <p>The next Ornament of modern Preaching is, <hi>Chiming</hi>
of words, as <hi>Faith, Hope and Charity, Hope, Faith and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
Or thus, like the second Peal-changes at St. <hi>Pulchers,
Revelation's a Lady, Reason the Handmaid, Revelation's the
Esquire,</hi> Reason the Handmaid, Revelation's <hi>the Sun, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the</hi> Moon: Then by and by Reason leads, <hi>Reason is
good, but</hi> Revelation much better; Reason is a <hi>Counsellor,</hi>
Revelation is a <hi>Lawgiver;</hi> Reason is the <hi>Candle; Revelation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64370:7"/>
the Snuffer.</hi> Not unlike this was the jingling determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between the old Covenant and the new. <hi>The old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
was of works,</hi> the new one of <hi>Faith; the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was by</hi> Moses, <hi>the new by</hi> Christ; <hi>the old Covenant was
before,</hi> the new one afterwards. The <hi>old was first, the new
one was second.</hi> All which being undeniable Truths, there
was an end of the business.</p>
            <p>To come now to the method of Preaching, you would
think they came into the Pulpit to vent their whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and conceits, rather than to Preach sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>First, before the division of the Text, there must be a
Preface, wherein it is of great consequence to make the
Text like something or other, according to the dictates of
his ingenious fancy. One simpers upon his Auditory, and
<hi>now methinks,</hi> quo he, <hi>My Text, like an ingenious Picture,
looks upon all here present;</hi> in which both Nobles and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may behold their sin and danger represented. This
was a Text taken out of <hi>Hosea;</hi> but what if it had been
taken out of any other place? why still it might have been
an ingenious Picture, had the Gentleman so pleas'd. For
it was a conceit calculated for the meridian of any Text.
And truly in my opinion so were all these that follow.
Says one, <hi>I might compare my Text to the Mountains of</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>where the Lord disports himself as a young Hart, or a
pleasant Roe among the Spices.</hi> And there was no question
but he did so; for 'tis to be suppos'd there was no body so
unmannerly as to hinder him. Saies another, <hi>My Text is
like the Rod of</hi> Moses, <hi>to divide the waves of sorrow; or like
the Mantle of</hi> Elijah, <hi>to restrain the swelling floods of Grief.</hi>
The first man's Text for my mony; what say you? I say
this man's—no, you are out—the first man's allusion
runs higher. You shall have another climb up to his Text,
as thus; <hi>As</hi> Solomon <hi>went up six steps to the Throne of Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64370:7"/>
so must I as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>end six degrees to come to the high meaning of
my Text.</hi> Cries another, <hi>as</hi> Deborah <hi>arose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and went with</hi>
Barak <hi>to</hi> Kadesh; <hi>so if you will go with me and call in at the
third verse of the Chapter I will shew you the meaning of my
Text.</hi> I assure ye, very pretty conceits, both; it would
gravel a man which to choose. There are besides these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other sorts of Texts; and truly 'tis well there are,
for store is no sore. <hi>One like an Orchard of Pome-Granates.</hi>
Another <hi>like St.</hi> Matthew <hi>sitting at the receit of Custom;</hi>
a third <hi>like the Dove that</hi> Noah <hi>sent out of his Ark.</hi> There
have been several Texts like <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> there is one
<hi>Genesis</hi> more wonderful, like a pair of <hi>Compasses stradling;</hi>
and another much more wonderful then that, <hi>Like a Man
going to Iericho.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text being thus chosen, and ascertain'd what it is
like, must in the next place be divided, and by and by you
shall see an Orchard of Pome-Granates so strangely transino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grify'd,
that you would never think it the same thing, and a

with a sort of Texts, so like Logwood, that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to divide 'em six or seven times before they can make
'em split to their minds.</p>
            <p>But then, O then, there's the delight of their Souls,
when the sentence ends with a jingling Rhyme, and crys

out almost past imagination, first there was a <hi>Captain</hi> and a

and Reingre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in regard of the <hi>Castle.</hi> But then there was unroosting,
and unresting; for the Castle was taken. Then there was
number and name; that was in reference to the Garrison.
Then their was <hi>Manner,</hi> &amp; <hi>Measure, Trouble,</hi> and <hi>Tryal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>
and <hi>Revolution, Assault,</hi> and <hi>Assassination, Voydness,</hi>
and <hi>Vacuity.</hi> Thus you see by the lucky finding out that
<hi>Captain,</hi> and that <hi>Castle,</hi> what a world of other business
fell in course. This 'tis to have an exuberant fancy, and
to have one Eye i' the Air, and another upon his Text.</p>
            <p>But more to be admired was he, that out of these eight
words, <hi>Weep not for me, but for your selves,</hi> spun out no less
then eight parts. 1. <hi>Weep not, 2. But Weep. 3. Weep not,
but Weep. 4. Weep for me. 5. For your selves. 6. For me,
for your selves. 7. Weep not for me. 8. But for your selves.</hi>
This Gentleman had a strange Command of his tears, Nay
he could weep and not weep, he was Weeping Master
General of <hi>England.</hi> Every Man to his calling: the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
to his, <hi>Prime your Pan, cock your Match, blow your Cole,

for me, for your selves, weep and not weep;</hi> Who would not
go to this Gentlemans grieving School for an hour or so,
to hear how prettily these words of command run?</p>
            <p>Nor was he to be less respected, who taking his Text out
of <hi>Gen. 48. 2. And one told Iacob, and said, Behold thy Son
Ioseph <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ometh unto thee,</hi> presently made it out to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that <hi>his Text</hi> was a Spiritual Dyal For said he, <hi>Here

thy Son</hi> Ioseph <hi>cometh unto thee,</hi> Here is farther, <hi>behold,</hi>
which is the Dyal that turns &amp; points at every word in
the Text. Behold <hi>And,</hi> behold <hi>one,</hi> behold I <hi>told,</hi> behold
<hi>Iacob,</hi> Again behold, <hi>And,</hi> behold <hi>Said,</hi> behold, <hi>behold,</hi>
which is the reason that this word <hi>behold</hi> is placed in the
middle of the twelve words, indifferently pointing at
each.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Doctrines, Observations,</hi> and <hi>Inferences</hi>
raised from their Texts, they are without all Compare.</p>
            <p>One takes for his Text, that of <hi>Isaiah 41. 14, 15. Fear
not thou worm</hi> Jacob, <hi>&amp;c. thou shalt thresh the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
Whence he observed that the <hi>Worm</hi> Jacob <hi>was a
threshing Worm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second from the Text <hi>Gen. 44. 1. And he commanded
the Steward of his house, saying, fill the mens Sacks with
Corn, as much as they can carry,</hi> plaid this division upon
the plain song, <hi>That great Sacks and more Sacks, would hold
more than few Sacks and little Sacks: For look,</hi> said he
<hi>as they came prepared with Sacks and Beasts, so they
were sent back with Corn. The greater and the more
Sacks they had prepared, the more Corn they carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,

            <p>No less careful of uttering truth was he, that upon
<hi>Iohn 2. v. 15. And when he had made a Scourge of
small Cords, he drave them all out of the Temple,</hi> made

from whence, in the 3d place, he raised this Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the People, That when they were teaching, they
should not move too much, for that was to be carried
away with every wind of Doctrine: unheard of curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties!
O these University <hi>Wits!</hi> there are no men in the
World like 'em. Will ye have a short &amp; witty Discovery?

               <hi>That whilst the Disciples were taking thought for a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
Christ thought fit to take them down a Cubit lower.</hi>
How divinely was he inspired, that made the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Discoveries upon <hi>Matth. 8. 2. When he came down
from the Mountain great Multitudes followed him.</hi>
1. That Christ came down, as well as he went up. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That
the Multitude did not go hail fellow well met with him.
Such a man as this deserved a good Living; for he spoke
nothing but upon solid grounds. But now here's a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
deserves to be recorded in History. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 47.
<hi>Then one said unto him, behold, thy Mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
stand without; but he answered and said, who is
my Mother, and who are my Brethren?</hi> upon which he

            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64370:9"/>Others there are, who being appointed, or chusing to
preach upon some point of Divinity, avoid the plain and
easie places, tending or relating to that Subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
fetch it in by Head and Shoulders out of foreign Texts
nothing at all to the purpose; which shews a great
Master piece of Learning; for then the People cry, I could not
Imagine what Mr. <hi>such a one</hi> drove at; but yet at length
how cunningly he brought it in.—He's a quaint man.
Suppose for Example, that a young Gentleman were to
preach up Episcopacy, you shall have him baulk all other
Texts and take this, <hi>Sirs, what shall I do to be saved?</hi>
For the Greek word for <hi>Sirs,</hi> being <hi>Lords,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were bishops that were spoken to. Another
being to preach up Kingly Government, forsook all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Topicks, and chose that of the Evangelist, <hi>Seek
first the Kingdom of God.</hi> From whence he prov'd that
Kingly Government was most pleasing to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but that some men are not so apprehensive as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the thing is plain; for the Text does not say the
Common-Wealth of God, nor the Aristocracy of God, but
the Kingdom of God. But what could be more quaint
than this? Suppose I were to preach against <hi>non</hi> Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
I would scorn the common road<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Why? What
would you do? Oh! I have it i'my head already, I

            </p>
            <p>If there be any who think I enumerate these things out
of disaffection, they have as little Charity for me, as
they have for themselves, there being nothing more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
among them, than Envy, Passion, Repining, and
supplanting of each other. There is certainly a most
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64370:10"/>
profound and awful Reverence to be paid to a true,

Writ; but for every Whiffler in Divinity to arrogate
that esteem to himself, meerly for his Habits sake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intrinsecal worth, is a meer presumption. They
should labour by imitation of their betters, to gain that
esteem, which would be then their due. But instead of
following their Studies, as they ought to do, you shall
find some idleing away their time in Coffee Houses, and
chattering State Affairs, which nothing belong to them.
Others you shall meet handing young brisk Ladies in the

               </gap>ight to see long Gowns and Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats
together; as if there were not lac'd Cravats and
Ruffles enough about the Town for that amorous em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment:
To say truth, we have too much pratin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in
<hi>England,</hi> especially in great Cities, where the Bells ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lie still all the Week long, from Six a Clock in the
morning, till Five at night. And all this to feed the
Qstentation of our Pulpit-Thrashers. And yet all this
while even Preaching itself, is, without all doubt, not to
be accounted so essential a part of Divine Worship, as
Prayer is. In which assertion I take the greater boldness,
knowing that Sermons are only well studied Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and methodiz'd Instructions, whose chiefest end
is but to incite men to the duty of Prayer, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Were Sermons therefore less frequent, they would be
much more valued: For then would men have time to
meditate, and their abortive Irreverences would not drop
so often from their Mouths, without Soul or Life, as not
having staid their time in the Womb of Meditation. I

does any thing more keep back the dissatisfi'd People
of the Nation, from coming to Church till the Service be

well acquainted as to know him scarce able to read the

Were true vertue and right Judgment reigning in the hearts
of men, such idle prejudices would vainly be suppos'd, and
the Doctrine that proceeded from the most tatter'd habit,
would be as acceptable as the sayings that flow'd from he
mouth of one clad in Silk. But in regard the world is not so
absolutely perfect, it is never to be question'd whether the
<hi>Alms-Man-Teacher</hi> of a Parish can be respected by those
to whom he is beholding for his daily Bread. Whether the
that cant look out of his Pulpit into the Church but that
he spies one or other, upon whom he depends, and for want
of mony has not confidence to reprehend his Sex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

utter with courage any thing that can be so benefical to
his people, as to render them his diligent hearers, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
respecters.</p>
            <p>The Divine Service 'tis true is the same, whether read in a
Cathedral, or a Thatch'd Church; whether read by an
Archbishop, or the meanest of his Priests. But as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of the place has a great influence upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
devotion, so likewise the condition, and quality of the
person that reads it, whose circumstances, as to this life
are so bad, and low in this world. Nor do they delight to
confess their sins, or sing praises to God with him who sighs
more for want of mony, and Victuals, than for his tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes,

Here is a certain person in a brown Study,

But forsooth, we have a sort of people in
this Nation that will have the King make no disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries;
that would have him be altogether in the

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igns of Loyalty. In the first place, for a man to
wear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ign of Loyalty: For there is a strange Sympathy
between the Heart and the Hat. As the Heart moves,
so the Hat moves: If the Heart be dutiful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectful,
off goes the Hat. A disloyal Heart, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sloyal
Hat: Which we find too true by the <hi>Quakers</hi>
themselves; who will neither put off their Hats, nor

Swear before a Magistrate, Two great marks of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty.
I remember, my beloved, that <hi>Pantagr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>el</hi>
dreamt a Dream, and his Dream was this: he dreamt
that he was beloved and caressed by a fair <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ady; but
at length, that he was metamorphos'd into a Drum,
and the Lady into Madam <hi>Madge Howlet.</hi> So it is
with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> while the Lady <hi>Faction</hi> caresses
them in their fond Dreams: but the time is coming,
and I hope to see it, when they shall be turned into
Drums; that is, be ratled and thumped till they roar
again; and <hi>Faction</hi> shall be turned into a Female.

tantomen megalopton otera whyon.</hi> Again, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
Scarlet is a Royal Colour: The Robes are
Scarlet; and therefore they that wear Scarlet Twists
i' their Hats, must of necessity be true blue, as they
say. For the Twist signifies Allegiance; and Scarlet
signifies Cordial, as being the colour of the Heart. So
put both together, the Twist and the Scarlet, and
there's <hi>Cordial Allegeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second mark of Loyalty, is to drink the <hi>D.</hi>'s
health, and cry <hi>Huzzah</hi>—If you stamp upon your
Hat at the same time, 'tis still a sign of a more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
Loyalty. For by tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pling upon your Hats,
you shew you readiness to throw your Lives and
Fortunes at his Feet. But to return to the word
<hi>Huzzah</hi>—It is a word of a most sublime significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—
It was invented for the use of the Knights
of the Order of St. <hi>Dive Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eille,</hi> as you may read
in <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s Antiquities of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Some derive
it from the Hebrew word <hi>Hoz,</hi> which signifies Wealth
or Riches, to shew that when you drink the D.'s
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64370:17"/>
Health, and cry <hi>Huzzah,</hi> you drink it out of the
abundance of your Loyalty. Others derive this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphic
<hi>Huzzah</hi> from the Hebrew word <hi>Hazah,</hi> to
snore or be sleepie; and then it carries with it this
signification: That no man ought to snore or sleep
when the <hi>D.</hi>'s Health is drinking; or if he do, that
he ought to be waked i'the Devils Name with a <hi>Huz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah.</hi>—</p>
            <p>There is one more sign of Loyalty, and that is when
you hear a quaint Notion stream from our lips, or
the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> run down with a powerful <hi>Sa sa,</hi> and a
<hi>whipping, quipping jerk,</hi> to cry <hi>Hum,—hum,—hum,</hi>—
We love <hi>Humming</hi> mightily—nay, we'll give you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to cry <hi>Huzzah,</hi>—i'the Church too, so it be out
of a cordinal affection to <hi>Humming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have the Discovery, and the Discovery
made. And now I come to the Third part, and that
is the <hi>Sim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>els,</hi> or the taking away of the <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the opening of these Words, the Cabinet
of my Text discloses unto you three things. First,
That the <hi>Simnels</hi> were taken away. Secondly, The
persons that did take them away, <hi>viz.</hi> The Subjects of
<hi>Grandgousier.</hi> And thirdly, from whom; from the
people of <hi>Picrochol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first of the first, That is, of the <hi>taking away
of the Simnels.</hi> Here it is plain, from the Words of
my Text, that there was a wrong and injury done;
the <hi>Simnels were taken away.</hi> Not willingly, you
may be sure; for else there had been no c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>use of
complaint; but by force, by violence, against Law,
and against Reason these <hi>Simnels</hi> were taken away,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64370:17"/>
               <hi>Violentia extra modum est violentia Carnalis,</hi> saith
<hi>Origen;</hi> the fittest Author in the World to be quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on this Subject. For as he made himself an
<hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nuch</hi> and guelt himself; so would the Subjects of
<hi>Grandgousier,</hi> the Subjects of Rebellion, geld us of
our <hi>Simnels,</hi> take away our <hi>Simnels</hi> by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orce and
violence. Now, my beloved, me thinks I hear you
asking me what these <hi>Simnels</hi> are? These <hi>Simnels,</hi>
my beloved, are the Rights and Priviledges of us
Church-men.</p>
            <p>These are the <hi>Simnels</hi> which the Subject of <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier,</hi>
the Fanaticks and Dissenters, men that will
not crie <hi>Huzzah</hi>—nor wear Scarlet Twists in their
Hats, would take away from us. There is our <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>
of Bowing at the Altar: There is our <hi>Simnel</hi>
of the Surplice: There is our <hi>Simnel</hi> of Eccles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Jurisdiction, and that has many Plum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in it. The
Plums of Commendation: The Plums of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
The Plums of Endictments, Fining and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
for Conscience sake. Then there is our
choicest <hi>Simnel</hi> of all, the <hi>Simnel</hi> of our Livings and
Tythes. And lastly, there is our <hi>Simnel</hi> of <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession:</hi>
For the Dukes Case is a hard Case, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved;
the Scripture tells us so. All these <hi>Simnels,</hi> my
beloved would the Fanaticks, the Subjects of <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier,</hi>
take from us by force and violence. Now if
the King and the Council, and the Lord Mayor, and
the Justices of the Peace, will not mind these things,
we are to put them in mind of their duty, and their
neglect of the Church. And then again, if the State
do think the Fanaticks to be ill Members of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
disturbers of the Government, and do prosecute
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64370:18"/>
them for that reason, then are we to encourage the
<hi>State,</hi> to bring Texts of Scripture for the <hi>State;</hi> then
are we to run with the Stream of publick business, to
Glose and Flatter like true Politicians, and all this that
we may not lose another <hi>Simnel</hi> of ours, which is the
sweet <hi>Simnel</hi> of Preferment. Were I now to preach
before a great Magistrate that had the Power in his
hands, I would say, My Lord, you bear not the Sword in
vain—The Fanaticks, the Fanaticks, the Subjects
of <hi>Grandgousier,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> my Lord, would
take our <hi>Simnels,</hi> our Rites and Priviledges from us.
Where are all your Penal Statutes, your Fines, and
Imprisonments? Let'em be fin'd and imprison'd, nay
hang'd my Lord. Let'em be excommunicated. Do
you send'em to us, and we'll excommunicate 'em, and
then we'll send'em to you again, and do you send
'em to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> my Lord. What's the reason we
have not Juries and Common-council-men for our
turn? The Land mourns for the sins of Juries and
Common-council-men. And it is your, and other
Magistrates duty to look after these things. Now if
my Lord should say, Trouble not your heads with
these things that nothing concern ye; Do you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to refute and convince them of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
by sound Doctrine and good example of Life:
Then would I say, No, my Lord, they will never
be convinced by us; for we have not Wit nor Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
enough to do it, neither can we take so much
pains. 'Tis easier to talk an hour about State-affairs,
and make Satyrs against the Fanaticks, than to preach
convincing and sound Doctrine. The Fanaticks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be confuted by Bolts and Shackles, by Fines
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64370:18"/>
and Imprisonments, by Excomunications and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations;
And therefore pray, my Lord, let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
