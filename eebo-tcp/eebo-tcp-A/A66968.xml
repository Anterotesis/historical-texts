         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of their terrour that ſeek to harm us, but aſſuredly reſt ſecure

Night, and the Shafts, though go abroad by day, the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
ſhall have no advantage over us: Therefore let us acquit
our ſelves like men, and not faint, or grow weary: Let fear
fly our Breaſts, and let us Arm our ſelves with Courage in a

Hoſts is the diſpoſer of all things, and if the Lord be with us,
who ſhall be againſt us, and proſper? for there is a Sword of

            </p>
            <p>Thus by extraordinary means does the Almighty ſave, when
he bares his Arm to make his power known to the Sons of Men;
then happy are all they that truſt in him, for they ſhall never
be confounded, their Enemies ſhall come out one way, and flee
ſeven; the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall draw a Sword after them, and they ſhall
be ſcattered, even from Heaven ſhall they be diſcomfited, and
ſcattered o're the face of the earth, as in <hi>Judges 3. 2. They fought
from Heaven, the Stars in their courſes fought againſt</hi> Siſera. If
Heaven be on our ſide, in vain is the Combination of man, for
who is able to ſtand before that mighty God, whoſe very looks
drieth up the deep, and whoſe wrath maketh the Mountains
to melt, before whoſe Majeſty <hi>Job</hi> confeſſeth himſelf to fail and
tremble, like one in a ſtormy Tempeſt, and that his fear was
ſo great, that he was not able to bear it; nor (can his hand be
ſhortened, that he will not ſave thoſe that ſtand for his truth;
ſuce as are valiant for the promotion of God's honour, are ſaid
to fight the Lords Battel; that is, he owns them to be his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and he puts power and ſtrength into their hands, as he did
into his Servant <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s, when he made the Heavenly Bodies,

contrary to the courſe of nature, obey a Mortal Voice, the Sun
and Moon ſtood ſtill till his people had accompliſhed their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
upon their Enemies, as we find it in <hi>Joſhua</hi> 10. 13. And
when <hi>Moſes</hi> held but up his hand, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> prevailed, for
there is nothing too hard for the Lord, when he deſigns to
bring about his purpoſes: <hi>I called on the Lord in my diſtreſs</hi>
(ſays holy <hi>David) the Lord anſwered me, and ſet me in a large
place; the Lord is on my ſide, I will not fear what man can do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me: The Lord taketh my part with them that help me, therefore
ſhall I ſee my deſire upon them that hate me; it is better to truſt in the

v. 5, 6, 7 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9, 10. Thus we may behold, how a good Cauſe
puts life into the Soul, and makes the Spirit riſe to the extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
height of valour, baniſhing the image of fear, by a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
aſſurance of ſucceſs, makes Men bold as Lyons, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary

in their hands, even whilſt they were building, and repairing
the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to prevent and repel their treacherous
Enemies, who ſought always to ſurprize and bring them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
