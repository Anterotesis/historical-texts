            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. COurteous Reader who loveſt Truth: There hath lately come to my hands a Treatiſe, ſent from Good friends, concerning ſome <hi>Points</hi> of Concluſion, which one hath explained and as to <hi>his</hi> ſence ſufficiently expounded at large.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thereupon I have been entreated by <hi>them,</hi> alſo to give <hi>My</hi> apprehenſion or <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and explanation upon thoſe very Points.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Seeing, therefore I obſerve, that, in that very Explanation, there are ſome Erroneous Opinions that run contrary to the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> and true Underſtanding: which are of concernment to the Reader, and may almoſt ſtagger him; therefore I would take the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and expreſſe it in a more <hi>rectified</hi> underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Not</hi> to diſturb or judge any man; but that the underſtanding thereof might be made <hi>more cleer,</hi> for the ſake of the Reader, who with earneſtneſſe, ſeeketh the PEARL of Divine Knowledge, that it might introduce their hungry <hi>Minds</hi> into better ſecurity and Reſt; and ſo might have occaſion, to ſeek with the greater earneſtneſſe the Pearl of <hi>Divine</hi> knowledge; and to refreſh themſelves therewith, till we can attain the PERFECT enjoyment thereof in the other Life, <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note>

               <item>IV. The Fourth is 1 Corinthians <hi>11. 12.</hi> As the <hi>Woman</hi> is from the <hi>Man,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>Man</hi> cometh by the <hi>Woman,</hi> but all things from God.</item>

            <p n="5">5. Becauſe the <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Text mentions it thus; <hi>God Created Man in his Image:</hi> From which it clearly and Manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; that the Tri-une God, <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> his firſt begotten or born Son and moſt holy expreſſe Image of his inviſible Deity before all Creatures, hath created not only Man, but alſo <hi>all</hi> Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Earthly <hi>Creatures,</hi> yes all whatſoever was made, <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>In</hi> him, and he hath made and brought them forth in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his holy praiſe and Glory.</p>

            <p n="13">13. Further, He ſpeaketh of the <hi>Originall</hi> and Creation of <hi>Man</hi> ſo wonderfully, that he cannot ſhew it in the Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor in the Light of <hi>Nature;</hi> and there belongeth clean another Explanation to it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. LEt the Chriſtian Reader but look this Author Rightly into his heart: and conſider what he <hi>ſeeks</hi> under this deſcription: where he ſaith, God hath created ALL <hi>things</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as alſo created and made Man viſible in <hi>him:</hi> but wholly <hi>without</hi> divine manifeſtation and knowledge; ſo that God with his Myſtery in the leaſt was <hi>not</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in <hi>Adam:</hi> whereas yet the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> did breath into him the <hi>living</hi> Breath: whence Man became a living Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Alſo how this Authour ſpeaks quite <hi>againſt</hi> himſelfe; for he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth in many places; That God did breath into Man a powerfull living Spirit-Life, out of the Divine underſtanding and Mouth; in <hi>which</hi> Man was the Image of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now if the Spirit of God did breath into him <hi>his</hi> Breath, viz: the living underſtanding Soul, how then was not God manifeſted in Man? But he muſt do it for another cauſe, that <hi>thereby</hi> he might give forth or profeſſe himſelf wholly &amp; <hi>altogether</hi> to be God: for he ſets it down thus, That God Created and made <hi>Adam</hi> viſible in Chriſt and not further manifeſted himſelf in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57410:22"/>
                  <hi>Adam,</hi> but only in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and ſo Created <hi>Adam</hi> onely to and for the Naturall Life, and he underſtandeth properly under it, only that he ſhould or muſt Fall: For if he had no Divine knowledge and if God had never been manifeſted in him, then the Devill might <hi>eaſily</hi> have got the Game of him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This <note n="*" place="margin">E.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And <hi>this</hi> muſt help him to it, and be the ground and Corner ſtone thereof; That God did Create and make Man viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the <hi>Firſt</hi> Time in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and is now the <hi>Second</hi> Time <hi>wholly</hi> new generated in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="8">8, Now underſtand this Authours confuſedneſſe or intricacy; Firſt he ſaith, God Created and made Man manifeſt in his Image, that is, in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Eternall Image: which is the Authours Corner-ſtone, but altogether erroneous and not right: CHRIST in JEHOVA in IESU from Eternity, was <hi>no</hi> Image of the Deity, and even NO <hi>Chriſt:</hi> The <hi>firſt begotten</hi> or born of the Father <hi>before all Creatures</hi> from Eternity, is Gods Heart, Voyce, Word or Manifeſtation of the Divine Mouth; the <hi>Scripture</hi> underſtandeth <hi>no</hi> other Image.</p>

               <p n="14">14. God alſo took not his Love to himſelf for a wife, <hi>in that</hi> he would generate an Image to himſelf; He himſelf generateth the Love; the Love, is IESUS or IEHOVA: <hi>viz:</hi> the Second Principle or the Second Perſon in the Deity.</p>

               <p n="16">16.

               <p n="39">39. For, the holy Bloud was conceived in the <hi>Holy</hi> Spirit, and was immortall, it was conceived IN the water of the Eternall Life, in the <hi>Tincture of</hi> Gods Light in his ſweet Love: and had reſolved it ſelf <hi>into,</hi> and appropriated it ſelf with, the Bloud of the diſappeared Image.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>FIrſt</hi> as concerning the Text <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 54. 5. Which this Authour explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he hath much more <hi>confuſed</hi> it, and brought it altogether out of a right and orderly underſtanding into a confuſed unintelligible matter thing or Subſtance; and hath altogether confounded the <hi>Eternall birth</hi> of the holy Trinity wholly with the Creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His intent is to ſearch out the <hi>Birth</hi> or Geniture and Originall of all things or Subſtances: he hath demerſed himſelf into the <hi>Birth</hi> or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of the Deity, and highly elevated himſelf, and ſet himſelf up to be <hi>totally</hi> like God, and made himſelf <hi>a God:</hi> and yet underſtandeth as little of it, as the Cow doth of the <hi>Bell</hi> which it carryeth about her Neck, only it heareth it ſound and <hi>Ring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Secondly:</hi> He <hi>involves</hi> all Heavenly and Earthly Creatures in the perdition of Man, and will have them all regenerated and Redeemed again in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and maketh a Lamentable forced deſolation of the right underſtanding by <hi>confounding</hi> one thing with another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Thirdly:</hi> He totally and altogether confoundeth the <hi>Diſtinction</hi> between God and the Creature, and forceth them together into one contrary to all Reaſon and Truth; and ſetteth the earthly Man, if he but <hi>beleeve,</hi> totally with his mortall Subſtance, in the Deity, and giveth him full power or authority, in Heaven and Earth, quite contrary to the Ground of the holy Scripture, and alſo contrary to viſible or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent things, or Subſtances.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He will, be, rule, overpower, know and underſtand <hi>all in all,</hi> yes God himſelf, and yet he underſtandeth not the Ground of a Fly in its Eſſence and Subſtance, <hi>much leſſe</hi> the Divine and uncreaturely: and maketh a confuſed <hi>Wheel</hi> like a Drunkenneſſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And if ſuch flattering hypocriſie ſhould once become totally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, then were the <hi>greateſt</hi> Antichriſt <hi>of all</hi> born or generated: which ſetteth it ſelf in the Seat or Throne of God, and very <hi>audaciouſly</hi> giveth forth himſelf for GOD, and preſenteth his own great holineſs without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in immortality.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Quite <hi>contrary</hi> to the viſible or apparent ground of all Truth, and totally hideth the Man of Sinne in the Anger of God; and maketh of him-a-dear Sonne of God in his <hi>outward</hi> Fleſh, and thus bringeth us ſo totally out of the true underſtanding; that we ſhould <hi>not underſtand,</hi> how and in what manner Chriſt becometh generated or born IN us; what the Heavenly and Earthly Man is.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He will perſwade us, we are <hi>both</hi> inwardly and outwardly, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally perfect holy and <hi>without</hi> all Blemiſh and <hi>Sinne;</hi> we ſhould but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57410:31"/>
and then the naturall outward ſinfull Man <hi>dyeth,</hi> and becometh wholly and altogether changed into <hi>Chriſts</hi> Perſon; ſo that, Man, here in this Time upon Earth is as he ſaith <hi>wholly</hi> and altogether <hi>Chriſt;</hi> who in Heaven ſitteth at the right hand of God; and is on Earth a totall <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> God-Man inwardly and outwardly <hi>without</hi> defect.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And there is nothing more wanting, but that the poor Sinner, who would faine repent and beleeve, fall down before THIS great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, which he himſelf <hi>will</hi> BE, and worſhip him, that he may receive him to Grace, into this HIS Holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For HE will needs be the Chriſt in ALL, in Divine Omnipotence and Subſtance, and diſtinguiſheth not at all, what God, Chriſt, and Man, is, what the Creature, Humanity and God are; in him Fleſh and Spirit is <hi>all one,</hi> moreover Mortality and Immortality.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Yet I would very fain ſee him, to know whether he be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then other Men: I have not all my Life long, heard any tell of any ſuch wonderfull Man in the World, not in any Hiſtory read of <hi>ſuch a Wonder:</hi> And if that be true which he ſaith, then he muſt according to the Tenure of the Scripture, ſhine <hi>ſeaven times</hi> brighter then the SUN, and other Men and Living Creatures would be <hi>ſtruck</hi> blind before him, becauſe of his Great Holineſſe and Clarity or Brightneſſe.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But if he ſhould ſay Men can <hi>not ſee</hi> that in him; as indeed he doth, neither hath any Man on Earth <hi>ſeen</hi> it in him or in any other Man eſpecially being Heat and Cold, as alſo Pain and Sickneſſe take hold of him, and that he continually cloatheth himſelf with the Cloathing of <hi>Beaſts,</hi> he ſleepeth and waketh, uſeth <hi>Earthly</hi> Food and Drink in the Curſe of God; and which is much more, liveth in <hi>repreaching</hi> and curſing of honeſt people that love God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In that regard, we yet very ſtrongly doubt of his <hi>perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and doe not hold his confuſedneſſe, for Gods Voyce, out of Gods Holy Subſtance; eſpecially ſince we ſee, that he yet underſtandeth <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> of the Divine and Naturall Birth or Geniture, and eternall <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> or Manifeſtation of all things or Subſtances, how one originateth out of another; and yet thus elevateth himſelf, without Divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, out of a meer <hi>litterall</hi> Conceit, which yet he perverteth, and ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth aloft without Wings, before they are feathered.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But ſeeing it is a ſubtile extravagant Errour, wherewith, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, honeſt hearts fearing God in Innocency <hi>might be</hi> ſeduced, without ſufficient ſearching into this extravagancy; therefore I would have the Reader who loveth the Truth <hi>informed</hi> of this almoſt quite hidden Errour, and will a little unfold the ſame; that men may ſee the high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperably <hi>ſuperlative</hi> ſence, as he ſuppoſeth, and therewithall a little to open the true ground; which hath <hi>better Teſtimony,</hi> and alſo agreeth with that which is viſible or apparent.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Not</hi> at all to contend with this confuſed Wheel and to defame him; but for the ſake of Chriſts Children, whom Chriſt hath Redeemed with his Bloud; to <hi>try</hi> whether many, will not become better diſcerning,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57410:32"/>
and would learn to diſtinguiſh ſuch an Errour, and get a <hi>more aſſured</hi> certainty.</p>
               <p n="16">16. At the Beginning, he maketh a great Speech or Sermon, ſignifying, how He will <hi>Anſwer</hi> out of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Triune God out of Gods Mouth and Heart out of <hi>all</hi> Saints, men ſhould hearken to it and look upon it as Gods infallible Word.</p>
               <p n="17">17. This now, is ſufficiently explained above, that it is groundleſſe, and that to ſpeak in ſuch a manner is ineffectuall, alſo it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any Angel or Man ſo to ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But concerning the Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 5. The Explanation thereof is very ſufficiently made <hi>before,</hi> yet for the Readers ſake I will ſet down <hi>ſomewhat more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. The Prophet ſaith, <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 54. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>He who hath made Thee is thy Man</hi> or <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; The Lord of Hoaſts is his Name; and thy Redeemer, the Holy One in Iſrael; who is called the God of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. The Prophet ſpeaketh here in his own underſtanding, not of a Man or Huſband, but by way of <hi>Similitude;</hi> in like manner as the Seed to Man lyeth in the Man or <hi>Husband,</hi> from which Man becometh manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So all, yes all whatſoever is manifeſted, lay in the <hi>Eternall</hi> Man or <hi>Husband, viz:</hi> in the Generatour of all things or Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="21">21. But eſpecially of mans Life; which he hath <hi>breathed</hi> into the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Image, according to the Similitude of <hi>his</hi> Subſtantiality; and out of all his out-breathed Subſtance; as <hi>John</hi> ſaith; <note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 1. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The Life of Man was in</hi> HIM.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And yet in this we are <hi>not</hi> ſo to think, as if the inbreathed Life or Subſtance of Man, were only and <hi>ſolely</hi> the Spirit of God, in Divine Holineſſe and Omnipotency; No: elſe if that were periſhed [as it came to paſſe] <hi>then</hi> God were periſhed: but each Life of each Creature becometh <hi>given</hi> to the Creature out of the Originall of its Subſtance.</p>
               <p n="23">23.

                  <p n="66">66. And this is the very <hi>abomination</hi> before God; that the Lifes Forms are gone out from the equall agreement every one into the Manifeſtation of IT ſelf: whence in the Life, contention, <hi>viz:</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up of Pride, as alſo Covetouſneſſe, Envy, Anger, and falſe or wicked ſuttlety; <hi>exiſteth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="67">67. So that every Forme knoweth it ſelf in the ſelf-hood, and is Manifeſt to it ſelf, whence Man, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> in this oppoſite Strife; is introduced into <hi>Sickneſſe,</hi> woe pain and corruption.</p>
                  <p n="68">68. For in the equall agreement NO Corruption can be, for <hi>all</hi> Wills of the Lifes Forms are but One only Subſtance, they goe in one equall harmony, every property is the good reliſh and love-deſire to the other, but in the inequality or diſagreement there is meer <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi> not at all willing in its property, to hear ſee ſmell taſt and feel.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. In theſe <hi>Five</hi> Senſes ſtandeth the <hi>Enmity</hi> of the Life, wherein there is nothing but meer ſtrife, in reſpect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality or diſagreement and diſharmony, which the ſound <hi>viz:</hi> the Voyce of God receiveth <hi>not</hi> or ſuffereth not to come into it ſelf: <hi>unleſſe</hi> the multiplicity of the Wills let their right or propriety goe; and ſink down again totally in reſignation, into Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>

                  <p n="71">71.

72. Now we are to weigh, the <hi>Propagation</hi> of Man; the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body is become earthly; for, the vanity, out of which the earth became generated, is <hi>awakened</hi> in it; and hath ſwallowed up the holy heavenly Subſtance into it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="73">73. For, the true Love-Spirit, departed in the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Earth from Man, when the vanity awakened, then God <note n="*" place="margin">Gen: 3. 17. to the 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Curſed the Earth;</hi> then all was done concerning the faire Paradiſe of Man; his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Image of the divine Subſtantiality faded: and was no more known.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. Which in a Similitude is underſtood to be no otherwiſe, then as when look upon LEAD which before had been GOLD, and had through MERCURY, turned it ſelfe into LEAD, wherein the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous <hi>Mercury</hi> is manifeſted; which before in GOLD ſtood in great brightneſſe and Perfection.</p>
                  <p n="75">75. And as now in the <hi>Lead</hi> there is yet a poſſibility to be <hi>Gold;</hi> but it was not manifeſted in the <hi>Mercury;</hi> the <hi>Mercury</hi> could not turn it ſelf again into <hi>Gold;</hi> unleſſe the <hi>Artiſt</hi> came and brake to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the <hi>Lead</hi> Totally: and turned it into the <hi>firſt matter,</hi> out of which it was Created; then might out of that matter fair <hi>Gold</hi> come to be, as it was at <hi>firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="76">76. Or elſe, if the power of <hi>Sol,</hi> did move it ſelf in this <hi>Mercury</hi> of the <hi>Lead,</hi> which yet is a <hi>Saturn,</hi> but yet hath the Impreſſion, <hi>viz:</hi> the firſt Ground to <hi>Gold</hi> in it ſelfe; and generate in its power <hi>Gold</hi> again in the <hi>Lead,</hi> ſo that I ſee <hi>Lead</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> in ONE Subſtance; and yet it is not manifeſted: but the <hi>Lead</hi> holdeth the <hi>Gold</hi> as it were half Swallowed up and covered.</p>
                  <p n="77">77. Thus we are to underſtand in like manner concerning <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> their faire <hi>Golden</hi> Body in divine power and Subſtance, became a <hi>Dark</hi> obſcure <hi>Lead;</hi> ſpoken by way of Similitude; The <hi>Golden Mercury</hi> awaked in the vanity of the poyſon, then faded and vaniſhed the <hi>Gold, viz:</hi> the holy Body in the Abomination: and now it was totally Earthly, and muſt to Earth again.</p>
                  <p n="78">78. But the voyce of God which called them again, eſpouſed it ſelf again with the promiſe of the Serpent Cruſher or Bruiſer, in <hi>Venus'es Matrix, viz:</hi> in the Second Principle, in the part of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Subſtantiality, in which <hi>before,</hi> the Word of the Divine ſound had been manifeſted: But when the Souls deſire went out from it, it faded and vaniſhed in it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="79">79. Thus in this eſpouſall in the <hi>Lead,</hi> there was <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi> one in another, but the <hi>Gold</hi> was not manifeſted, till Gods <hi>Mercury,</hi> in the word of Promiſe; manifeſted it ſelf in the <hi>Lead, viz:</hi> in the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> then became the <hi>Lead</hi> in Chriſts humanity again changed into <hi>Gold:</hi> and the proceſſe was held, as the <hi>Tranſmutation</hi> of Mettals is

                  <p n="82">82. Whereby we are cleerly to underſtand: that in all men the VANITY, <hi>viz:</hi> the awakened Lifes forms in their ſelf-hood and ſtrife, are again become propagated; and will ſtill <hi>continually</hi> be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, till in the breaking or Corruption of the Earthly Body; for ſo long as Man findeth Heat and Cold or ſickneſſe and oppoſite will in his Spirit and Body, <note n="*" place="margin">NOTE</note> 
                     <hi>ſo long</hi> the <hi>Abomination</hi> is in FULL Life.</p>
                  <p n="83">83. Concerning the Saints of God, which as Prophets in the Spirit of JESUS, have propheſied of the CHRIST to <hi>Come;</hi> they have all ſpoken out of the Limit of the Covenant, out of the promiſed Word, which would move it ſelf again in the <hi>Fleſh; none</hi> of them was totally new born again in the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="84">84. For the Word ſtood in the inward faded Image, and opened it ſelf with the voyce, through the outward <hi>Mercury,</hi> and ſhewed the <hi>outward Man,</hi> what would yet happen and be done to him, when the word of Promiſe ſhould he manifeſted in the <hi>Mercury</hi> of the Fleſh; and therein break to pieces the <hi>abomination,</hi> and death of the Strife in the Lifes forms.</p>
                  <p n="85">85. But after CHRIST out of JESUS, became manifeſted in the Fleſh, then that very Fleſh became <hi>anointed;</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> he was called the <hi>Anointed</hi> of the LORD: and if we introduce our Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, into this Manifeſted Word in the Fleſh of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then will alſo that very promiſed word, which is <hi>together</hi> propagated in ALL men in the Limit of the Covenant, be manifeſted in our Souls-deſire in the faded Image of the Divine Subſtantiality: and in <hi>Venus'es Matrix, viz:</hi> in the Second Principle, wherein God is, <hi>viz:</hi> in his right Heaven which is <hi>in</hi> MAN, cometh to <hi>Life.</hi>

That is, the faded Image, getteth the Divine ſound in the Souls deſire; <hi>Chriſt</hi> becometh <hi>Man</hi> in the faded Image, and cruſheth or bruiſeth Death, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Abomination</hi> of the vanity in the outward <hi>Leaden</hi> Fleſh, <hi>viz:</hi> the poyſonous <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Lifes forms, the Head

                  <p n="87">87. Now underſtand us further; concerning the <hi>Propagation</hi> between Man and Wife both in the Holy Children and in the wicked: How and in what manner it is with the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the Maſculine and Feminine deſire; and How in NO Man holy children without Sinne CAN be begotten; as this <note n="†" place="margin">E.

                  <p n="88">88. The <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the Deſire towards Wife or Woman and Husband or Man cometh from both the Mothers, <hi>viz:</hi> from the dividing of <hi>Adam;</hi> from both the <hi>Tinctures</hi> of Fire and Light: which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not much nobler, and purer than the Fleſh, or the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the Fleſh: they are <hi>done with,</hi> and have not the true Life in them, but they are the fiery deſire to the true Life.</p>
                  <p n="89">89. But if they come together into ONE, into Subſtance; then they awaken the true Life in the <hi>Mercury;</hi> their vehement deſire is after Life; they would again be that which they were in the Image of God; when <hi>Adam</hi> was Husband and Wife or Man and Woman, out of which exiſteth now the vehement <hi>Imagination</hi> in the <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="90">90. The Fires <hi>Tincture</hi> longeth in the Fleſh thus vehemently after the Lights <hi>Tincture,</hi> and the Lights after the Fires, The Man or <hi>Limbus</hi> or <hi>Limus Terrae et Coeli,</hi> the extract of Earth and of Heaven; longeth after <hi>Venus'es Matrix, viz:</hi> after the Joyous Conjunction of the Love-Life, <hi>viz:</hi> of the Love-reliſh; which reliſh in <hi>Adam</hi> was one in another, wherein he loved himſelfe, and the Perfection conſiſted therein.</p>
                  <p n="91">91. For the Fleſh knoweth not what it <hi>doth;</hi> it is indeed a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that deſire; for in the deſire of the <hi>Tinctures</hi> the Seed is Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, wherein again the <hi>Tincture</hi> lyeth, and ſo vehemently driveth on, that it alſo might come to Life; for all Life or every Subſtance and thing preſſeth after its <hi>Center</hi> out of which it is generated.</p>
                  <p n="92">92. Now it is to be known what is there ſowen; The <hi>Tinctures</hi> which Imagine ſo vehemently, are in the <hi>Seed</hi> of Man and Woman, and the <hi>Seed</hi> becometh in the Impreſſion of the <hi>Fiat, viz:</hi> in the hunger of the deſire; <hi>Material;</hi> and originateth out of the power of the Fleſh and of the Spirit; both of the Man and of the Woman.</p>
                  <p n="93">93. In the Man, the Spirit is fiery, that ſoweth the Fiery <hi>Tincture,</hi> in the Woman the Spirit is watery according to the Light; that ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Spirits <hi>Tincture,</hi> in the Inward Kingdome, the Image of the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> Subſtantiality; and in the outward, the Aires property out of the <hi>abomination</hi> of the Earthlineſſe.</p>

                  <p n="95">95. The Man beareth in his Seed in the <hi>firſt</hi> Principle, the Fire-world, <hi>viz:</hi> the Fathers Property, out of which the Father manifeſteth his Sonne, <hi>viz:</hi> his Love, <hi>viz: Venus'es Matrix:</hi> that is, the ſecond Principles Property in him, but in his Seed not manifeſted, but only as a Glimmering Tinder or Mother; ſo far as he is holy; and in the Third Principle; he beareth in the <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in his Seed; the <hi>awakened</hi> Anger of God: in which the abomination againſt God exiſted, and became Manifeſted in <hi>Venus'es Matrix, viz:</hi> in the Womans Property:</p>
                  <p n="96">96. Theſe Properties, become with the <hi>Seeds</hi> of Man and Woman in the Conjunction brought into ONE, there the TWO <hi>Tinctures</hi> receive one another in great Joyfulneſſe, as it is found by <hi>experience,</hi> when the Seed goeth forth, How the <hi>Tincture</hi> lifteth up it ſelf in Joy; whence mans Life is moved, as a Joyfull aſpect; enough underſtood by thoſe that are OURS.</p>
                  <p n="97">97. And the <hi>Two</hi> Tinctures eſpouſe themſelves thus inſtantly in the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the Seed into <hi>One;</hi> and awaken the <hi>Mercury viz;</hi> the Work-maſter of the Life, ſo that he laboureth in the Seed, and awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Lifes forms in the <hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="98">98. And if the <hi>Mercury</hi> be not potent enough, then it draweth the Mothers <hi>Menſtruum</hi> to it ſelf; and bringeth it into the Seed of the Conjunction, then it maketh the Seed <hi>in Menſtruo</hi> to be FLESH; in which yet there is a materiall poyſon, and the great <hi>abomination</hi> againſt the holyneſſe and purity; as is ſufficiently underſtood by all Lovers of <hi>Myſteries,</hi> what kind of poyſon lyeth in the <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> which deſttoyeth and poyſoneth any tender plant of the Earth: as is undenyable.</p>

                  <p n="56">56. Men ſhould not ſet down the Triune God <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be in the Humane ſubſtance, <hi>before</hi> Chriſts becoming Man or Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for after the Word became Fleſh, <hi>then</hi> he was called CHRIST, and no theretofore, in the Covenant, where he was only in the <hi>Promiſe.</hi>

                  <p n="58">58. The womans Seed <hi>attained</hi> the Anointing in the Motion of the Name JESU in MARY, and not in <hi>Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and <hi>David.</hi>

                  <p n="61">61. <hi>Eſau</hi> was generated of <hi>NO Saw,</hi> or Swine, for his Mother was NO <hi>Saw</hi> or Swine; He was begotten out of <hi>Iſaac's</hi> and his Wifes Seed; as well as his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> but the kindled Anger of God, which <hi>Adam</hi> awakened, had laid hold on <hi>Eſau.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="62">62. For, the Love and Anger were <hi>both</hi> manifeſted in Man, <hi>viz:</hi> Evill and Good, and they were alwayes in the wreſtling, till at laſt CHRIST came, and overcame the Anger, with the ſweet Love of God, out of JESUS, and changed it into Divine Joy.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. <hi>Eſau</hi> was a Type or Shadow, of the Earthly Sinfull <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> was a Type of <hi>Chriſt; Chriſt</hi> would bleſſe and reconcile the <hi>Eſau</hi> through <hi>Jacobs</hi> Seed: for <note n="†" place="margin">Math: 9. 13.</note>

                  <p n="71">71.

Indeed the Divine wiſdome ſtandeth NOT in <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but it ſheweth <hi>Art</hi> the way, what it ſhould do and how it ſhould Seek: ART is <hi>really</hi> the Tool or Inſtrument <hi>of</hi> God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the divine wiſdom worketh or laboureth: why ſhould I then <hi>deſpiſe</hi> it?

                     <hi>All Creatures are ruled by Man,</hi> and in Art is the Outward Body Covered and defended from Heat and Cold.</p>

                     <hi>forgotten,</hi> and that many in their Old age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo childiſh they do at length forget, OUR FATHER, which they had learned: that is very cunningly and Slyly intended by him.</p>
                  <p n="75">75. For before he had ſaid, He was ſo <hi>perfect,</hi> that he <hi>need</hi> not any More to PRAY, OUR FATHER, &amp;c. likely he would fain that none ſhould <hi>learn</hi> to PRAY, and beſides ſhould learn NO <hi>Art,</hi> and then he <hi>need</hi> forget nothing.</p>
                  <p n="76">76.

                  <p n="78">78.

                  <p n="79">79. This <note n="†" place="margin">E. S.</note> Authour calleth the Womans Seed, the good holy <hi>divine</hi> living working <hi>Seed</hi> of God, CHRIST JESUS, the Living Word of God, and yet underſtandeth not <hi>what</hi> Gods Seed or the Womans Seed is,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57410:64"/>
what the Life and power is: when I ſpeak only and alone of the Womans Seed, then <hi>I ſay not,</hi> Gods ſeed CHRIST JESUS: The Name JESUS is divine, but the Name CHRIST is God and Man.</p>
                  <p n="80">80. When JESUS manifeſted himſelf in the Womans Seed and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed THAT, <hi>then</hi> the Perſon was called CHRIST; yet now the Name JESUS is the holy divine Life, <hi>viz:</hi> the Divine Seed out of the <hi>word</hi> of the Deity: the Womans Seed is his <hi>aſſumed</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
