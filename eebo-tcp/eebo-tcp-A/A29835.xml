            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Air, Rays to the Sun, or Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to a Subſtance; for admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is his Frame, excellent the ſymmetry of his Proportion, and miraculous his Compoſure, made by the Almighty as the Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, Navil, and <hi>Compendium</hi> of this great World, the Image of his Maker, and the Prince of all Animals. Matter and Form be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his two firſt Principles; His innate Heat, by Philoſophers, being compared to Fire; His Spiritual parts to Air, his Solid parts to Earth, and his Moiſt parts to Water: The firſt called Natures principal Agent in the World, carrying in it the two Engines of natural Motion and Life; the ſecond poſſeſſing the Animals Spirits, rare and fluxile Bodies evermore allowed bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as to Limits, ſpending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Liquefaction; The

                  <p>The firſt being nothing elſe but an Harmonical act begot out of Matter and Form, making an individual Perfection lengthned into Continuance by a placid motion of Spirits operating in the Nutritive Juyce of the body; Death concluding both the Actor and Act, by making a Divorce between the former: Generation confirming a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique Form inherent in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifique Seed and Matter, and Corruption only diſcovering the diſſolution of corruptible Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments already lapſt into ruine.</p>

                  <p>In Natures Elaboratory we may alſo find three ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces provided for variety of uſes, as in the firſt, her Inſtruments, Veſſels, and Conſiſtences, of Bodies kept and reſerved in their proper places. Where we may ſee Percolation made, which is a kind of ſeparation of ſubtil Natures, the finer ſpirits being ſeparated from the groſſer, and this maintained by the weight of unequal Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Clarification ſhewn by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diſtribution of Liquor with
<pb facs="tcp:40826:12"/>
the tangible parts, and by refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Spirits themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Impulſion or Percuſſion made good by a ponderous Body put into motion.</p>
                  <p>Fermentation in its Original Particles ariſing in our Bodies out of Sulphure and Salt, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phure being the exiſtence, and Salt the maſter of its Acrimony; nothing entring our Bodies which do not bear a ſaline qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in it, and Sulphure being herewith intermixt, diſſolves this Salt and runs it into Fuſion, the which being looſned and attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by its Acrimony, doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the ſame, and ſo enters all the parts of the nutriments which we take into us.</p>
                  <p>A aſſimilation being made by many paſſages, Percolations, long continuance of gentle heats, and circuits of Time.</p>

                  <p>Dilatation opening every compact Body, and cauſing a free paſſage therein.</p>
                  <p>Digeſtion taking its notion from living Creatures, and thence extended to Liquors or Juyces, the higheſt notion thereof being fetcht from the degrees of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of one Body into another, as from Crudities to a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Concoction, which is the ultimity of the action and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
                  <p>Maturation of Liquors being wrought up by the congregation of Spirits, whereby they are

ſeen to gain and receive a better digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>Sublimation being nothing elſe than the ſeparation of ſubtil and thin Particles from thoſe which are thick and feculent, making that which was once impure, to appear more clear and pure.</p>
                  <p>Calcination making for a more apt Solution abating the Acrimony, its end being two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, as making that which was inflamable, impure, and crude; much abated, altered, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calcined, running the ſame into a more generous Liquor, and changing its corporeous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a more ſpirituous.</p>
                  <p>Fixation being the equal ſpreading of tangible parts, and their cloſe coacervation which makes them leſs willing to iſſue forth.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:40826:14"/>Concretion of Bodies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſolv'd by its contrary, thus Ice which was congealed by cold, is diſſolv'd by heat, theſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations rather being the returns towards their former nature, than alterations.</p>
                  <p>Coagulation made from the reduction of thin and fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to a ſolid ſubſtance, and this may be made good either by ſeparation, ſegregation, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, as when the whole is run into an uniform ſubſtanc, by Cold or Viſcidity, ariſing from a ſaline principle, Coction or Elixation.</p>
                  <p>Condenſation made good in the Jejuneſs of the Spirits and their impurity with the Tangible parts: Theſe, or moſt, if not all of them being nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in us, I have preſumed to
<pb facs="tcp:40826:14"/>
give a light touch upon them by way of Introduction.</p>
                  <p>In the next Office we find Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures varieties of Fermentative Menſtruums, Salts, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Juices, daily uſed in our Bodies, and theſe do bear the names of Acids, Subacids, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, Acreds, Auſteers, Viſcids, Bitters, Acerbs or Sowers, Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginous or oily Juices, Dulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, Inſipids, and thoſe other Juices of the Glandules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We begin with Acids, where we find that every Acidity is a very great Ingredient in Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, all Acids being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for promoting and ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward its journey and progreſs; Thus an Acid humour prepar'd in the Stomach out of the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and therein for ſome ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reſerv'd, does both promote Digeſtion, and the ſubaction of
<pb facs="tcp:40826:15"/>
the ſame, for all Acids which are reduced to a fluidneſs having their Salts advanc'd, do both promote and aſſiſt Fermentations and diſſolutions of the ſame in our bodies, in which action both the Salt and the Sulphure with which our Nutriments were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſht, are hereby confringed in the Ventricle and reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to minute Particles; and hence is it that Chyle it ſelf thus being fermented, does get a Creamy colour by its ſulphureous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles being diſſolv'd with the Salts, and mixt with an acid Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But then how theſe Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities do get into our Bodies, we no ways making uſe of acid things, may thus be made good. We cannot live without Acidity in Turgent occaſions, for there is an acidity in the Air, in which we breath, made good by a
<pb facs="tcp:40826:15"/>
                     <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> or Vitriol, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto expoſed, which is ſeen to fetch out hence an Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gaſſandus</hi> and others do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That the Air is fill'd with Nitrous Particles, and Niter eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knows does maintain an acidity in it; in Meats and Drinks are acidities made good, and hence we need not run far to ſhew how Acidity happens in Man, we apparently ſeeing that by continual Fermentations in our Bodies, many things which were formerly ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, or at leaſt temperate, have afterwards turn'd moſt acid, the which may either happen by diſſipation of the Animal Spirits, or ſome other internal cauſe; and this amongſt Animals is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily found out, unleſs it be by a melancholy Juice, ferments of
<pb facs="tcp:40826:16"/>
the Stomach, or Spleen, or Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick Juice, or Morning <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liva,</hi> or Spatttle; and as all Animals have their conſiſtence from Fermentative principles, ſo the whole World is fill'd with Fermentative Particles; and it's the general opinion of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that whoever wants an acid Juice, can never be allowed to digeſt well: We ſhall much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon theſe acid Juices, when we ſhall treat of the Blood and <hi>Lympha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Subacids take their names from their leſſer quantity of Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and thus the Pancreatick Juice is call'd Subacid, made by the Blood and Spirits like it, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the ſmaller into the larger <hi>Ductus</hi>; and as a general remarque hereof, as too much Acidity is ſeen a great procurer of Intermitting Fevers, ſo Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acids
<pb facs="tcp:40826:16"/>
do make a ready way for the diſcharge of the ſame, for ſo long as Choler is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in our Bodies, Flegm is leſs viſcous, and the Pancreatick Juice being leſſened in its acred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this makes the more ready way for the diſpatch of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
                  <p>Salines, experience teacheth us, do congregate into diverſe Figures and Angles, and all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being naturally Saline, ſcarce perceivable in the family of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables; for Herbs have their fixt Salts from their Incinerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Volatil Salts are ſeen extracted from the Blood of Animals by Sublimations; and Lixivial Salts being either fixt or volatile, do infring Acidity, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate Flegm, correct acid and auſteer Effects, hinder concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bile, correct ill Humours,
<pb facs="tcp:40826:17"/>
and cleanſe the Blood; and Volatile Salts do concenter and enervate the Subacid Liquors of the Glandules; and although an acid Spirit is not eaſily ſecern'd from a Lixivial fixt Salt, yet it is eaſily made good from a volatile Salt; which volatile Salt may be contained in a legitimate <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> of the Blood made out of laudable Bile, in which <hi>Serum</hi> whereof I ſuppoſe may be made an acid Spirit apt enough for framing a Matter for the <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi>; as therefore there is in the body of the Blood a laudable <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> which may well enough be variouſly changed either by outward cauſes, as Air, or Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triments, or inward, by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mind, or Body, or the like, ſo may theſe beget and imprint a ſtrange quality in the <hi>Lympha,</hi> by making it either
<pb facs="tcp:40826:17"/>
more acid, more ſubſaline, more diluted or aqueous, or more thick and viſcid. But we ſhall have more occaſion hereof in the Blood; all Natural Salts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if they be urged by repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Diſtillations, do paſs into lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Liquors; Volatile Salts are always ſeen white, and if they be expoſed to humid air, they ſpeedily run into a reddiſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, not very ſalt, the volatile ſaline parts herein vaniſhing, and the ſulphureous parts only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining which gives the colour; the ſaline parts of the Blood therefore lodge between Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Volatization, then properly call'd Fixt, when it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hears to the Sulphure and terene parts, and then Volatiliz'd, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them both and ſticking to the ſpirituous Particles thereof and marching therewith, as is
<pb facs="tcp:40826:18"/>
made good in diſtill'd Spirit of Urine after a long digeſtion: Thus in ſome meaſure the ſaline parts in our Bodies are ſeen to mix with the Chyle, and run the ſame into digeſtion in the Bowels, they acting orderly in us; and then are volatiliz'd into a Nervous Juice, and planted in the middle conſtitution of the ſanguine Maſs, and then being exalted by a long circulation and digeſtion they hereby become Volatile, and are partly joyned with the Spirituous Particles and exſtill'd into the Brain with them, and there become Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and at length turn into a Nutrimentitious Juice fit for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the ſulphureous and ſolid parts of the Body through which they paſs. Salt therefore as it is allowed three ſtates of Fuſion, Volatization, and Fluidneſs, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:40826:18"/>
it acts accordingly in our Bodies, for when its ſaline Corpuſcles be mixt with the reſt and made ready for diſſolution, then it ſhews it ſelf in the firſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Animals, beginnings of Fermentations, and indigeſted Formations of things, and this bears the name of Fuſion.</p>
                  <p>When from the firſt rudiments of Motion the Saline Particles are ſeen to aſcend with ſome Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit having Sulphure thereto add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this invigorates the ſame and gives it a volatization.</p>
                  <p>That properly called <hi>Fluor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> when the ſaline parts which were formerly collected with the Earth and Sulphure, are now aſſociated to the Spirit, and this knot of mixture being looſned, it thereby gets its freedom, and being thus clear'd and freed whilſt the major part of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb facs="tcp:40826:19"/>
and Sulphure leaves it, it takes chief place it ſelf, and ſo is rendred inſipid and free from all ſaltneſs whatever.</p>
                  <p>Acreds do ſhew their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance from a Volatile Salt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete things, the which being diſſolv'd from their mixtures, do ſpeedily loſe themſelves; and hence is it that ſome Herbs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though abounding with an acred Juice whilſt green, when they grow dry they are perfectly ſeen to loſe their Acredity, as is made good in Scurvey-graſs, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſſes, and the like. Again, the volatile acred Salt being mixt with the Air in the Lungs and received into the Blood by Inſpiration, or taken into the Stomach with our Nutriments, or ſuckt into the Body by its pores, or mixing it ſelf with the Liquors of the Glandules or the
<pb facs="tcp:40826:19"/>
Blood, doth both infect, ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and vitiate the ſame. Acreds alſo in the time of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do contract the Ventricle and promote an expulſive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty therein, moving the heat with more frequent contractions, making the Pulſe bear a part with it, and the Blood being ſtagnated, does hereby grow more acred, and this runs it into Inflammation, and oft-times converts it into purulent or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Matter.</p>
                  <p>Auſtere Acids do generally ariſe in thoſe bodies which are readieſt inclinable to Aſtringen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whoſe Particles are fill'd with many ſmall prickings cloſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fibres, and as it were contracting the ſame: Thus we ſee auſtere Acids do breed and produce Glutinoſities of fluid things by aſtriction, reſtore both
<pb facs="tcp:40826:20"/>
the Tone and ſtrength of the parts, correct and temper vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization, amend the fluidneſs of Choler, hardning the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Inteſtines, oft-times the mother of Suffocation, and whatever we take into our Mouths of Vitriol or Tobacco, they are ſeen to leave an auſteer guſt upon our pallates.</p>
                  <p>Viſcid Juices do variouſly bring Diſeaſes upon our humane Bodies; Thus we ſee that both <hi>Saliva,</hi> Pancreatick Juice, and <hi>Lympha,</hi> do err, and prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious by their viſcidities in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticks, and the beginnings of Catarrhs are allowed to ariſe from viſcid Nutriments and cold Air. Coagulation of Humours alſo are ſeen to ariſe from a viſcid Chyle, and an Inteſtinal Flegm marching along in the milky veſſels, and its viſcidity that makes
<pb facs="tcp:40826:20"/>
flations, keeps ſo cloſe to the Stomach and in it, and which makes their <hi>exits</hi> thence ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie, and its viſcous and coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Blood that both ſtagnates the motion of the Blood, and hinders the ſecretion of the Chyle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Bitter Juices carry in them both Sulphure and Salt, wherein they are ſeen very equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and do operate in the Blood as they do in compound Liquors, where contracting a new bitterneſs by being either burnt in their Concoctions, or too much ſpent by evaporation; they do hence occaſion a kind of bitter ſmoakineſs which they ſeem to purchaſe hereby, and bear the ſame in their whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
                  <p>Acerbs or tart and ſowre Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces generally are in their proper
<pb facs="tcp:40826:21"/>
nature very near in kin to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere or aſtringent Juices, and do hurt our Bodies by obſtructing our Pores, wherein having once got entrance, they are not very readily or eaſily to be thence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; they bear up their tart and ſowre nature, and are not to be overcome with ſuch which are of a more ſweet conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Unctuous or oily Juices are then allowed to be produced when the Particles of any Body are ſeen ſphaerical and globular, neither bringing much diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, or pricking, or tickling therewith. Sulphure being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in maſter in chief, and Oyl be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to take fire, if it once aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes it, it keeps the ſame up and maintains it; and the Lix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ivial Salt once joyn'd with Oyl as often as it is digeſted with any acid, it produceth a notable heat;
<pb facs="tcp:40826:21"/>
and thus the Blood ſo long as Choler is cheif maſter in it, is ſeen to turn ſaline and oily, Oyl and Fat being accounted the two chief ingredients of Bile.</p>
                  <p>Dulcorate Juices do declare themſelves by their pleaſant taſt which they carry in them, and when the ſaline Particles do grow equally together with the ſulphureous Particles giving the later another nature, they are both ſeen to run into obtuſe ſtreaks; and this alchalizated Spirit and fixt Salt, of what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſoever it be mixt and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by long digeſtion, does there produce and beget a dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corated ſweetneſs.</p>
                  <p>Under Inſipid Juices, if they may ſo be called, may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Water, Rain, the White of an Egg, and thoſe may then moſt properly be ſo termed
<pb facs="tcp:40826:22"/>
when the Particles of any Bodies are not always rendred with an aſperate, but with levigated Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficials, in which the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Earth and Water are predominant above the reſt; and although indeed there's nothing in the world can really be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Inſipid, yet thoſe are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſeen to carry that name which are altogether deprived of Sapour and Guſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Juices are thus ſeen to bear concord and agreement in our Bodies, where we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee Sweets and Acids very well agreeing together, and Sweets and Auſteers, the firſt ſhewn in Syrup of Citrons, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Wood Sorrel, Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the like; the later in Marmalade of Quinces, ſtewed Prunes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40826:22"/>Sweets and Unctious may alſo well enough agree in the Palate but not in the Stomach, they being very ſubject to occaſion a vomiting and nauſeouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Sweets never agree with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, Bitters or Salines.</p>
                  <p>Bitter Juices never are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the Palate.</p>
                  <p>Salines always agree beſt with acred things.</p>
                  <p>Acreds, Aſtringents, and ſharp Juices do well enough agree with Sweets but no others: Some of theſe do take their names from Heat, being the uppermoſt, as Acreds, Bitters, ſome from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberant Cold, as Acids, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acids, Auſteers, Acerbs, or ſowre Juices; and others from moderate heat, as ſweet, viſcid, fat and inſipid, the firſt two of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to Cold, the later two enjoying a better degree of heat:
<pb facs="tcp:40826:23"/>
And to conclude this, we may very well judge of the Juices in our Bodies, as we may obſerve them in ripe Fruits which are ſweet and grateful to the palate, yet ſowre while green, and dry of conſiſtence; afterwards this dryneſs leaving them, a ſofter condition poſſeſſeth the fruit, and when this change happens, this ſowerneſs turns into ſharpneſs, and this ſharpneſs by time and maturity forgets its acidity and becomes ſweet. Thus ſalt and bitter things can no whit be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed agreeable with ſweets, which are allowed our nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhers, for all Nutriment turns to Blood, and good Blood is hot, moiſt, and ſweet; and therefore that Sapour which is neareſt in kin to the Blood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt proper for Nutriment;
<pb facs="tcp:40826:23"/>
and this brings me into Natures third Office, wherein we ſhall view her excellent Liquids and and Balſamick Liquors, amongſt which are reckoned Chyle, Blood, Animal Spirits, Nervous Juice, <hi>Lympha,</hi> Salival Flegm, Choler, Pancreatick Juice, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> Urine, and Sweat, they conducing towards our welfare, life, and motion.</p>
                  <p>Chyle therefore is a milky Juice like to that of Cream, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and excocted out of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triments taken into the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and theſe Nutriments are digeſted in the Stomach after the manner of Fermentation and ſo become moiſt, and Chyle thence extracted. What Fermentation is we have already in brief ſet down, we therefore next do proceed to the cauſe of Chilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and this is taken from
<pb facs="tcp:40826:24"/>
its propriety of ſubſtance, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of which, heat is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe operated in the Stomach than it is in the Heart; it takes its creamy colour from its ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous parts, being diſſolv'd with its ſaline, and thoſe mixt with the acid ferment of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; for whatever Liquor is impregnated with Sulphure and volatile Salt, it gets hence a milky whiteneſs if any acid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour be poured to it. Blood is the Royal liquid Balſam, and the chief Fermentative liquor of the Body; the ſcarlet Juice whereof is made in the Heart out of Chyle for the nutrition thereof, raiſed out of two Juices having a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> intermixt; Sulphure and Salt being its primary Particles, theſe alſo being allowed Juices when they are produced into Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Sanguinary maſs;
<pb facs="tcp:40826:24"/>
and hence the Chymiſt gives the name of the <hi>Third Mercury,</hi> when he writes that there's no Body framed by Nature, but carrieth in it <hi>Mercury</hi> or Liquor, Sulphure or Oyl, <hi>Sal</hi> or Salt; Salt by Coagulation giving ſolidity to Bodies, Colour and Guſt; Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phure tempering the coagulation of Salt with a benign mixture, and this allows the ſame ſtrength and tranſmutation; and <hi>Mercury,</hi> like an Elixir, yielding vertue, vigour, and ſecrets to the irriga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Vital and Vegetative Liquor. Again the ſuperfluities of Salt are ſeparated by the Urine, Sulpure ſecern'd by the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, and <hi>Mercury</hi> the liquor of Nutriment ſent into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and if any ſuperfluous part thereof happens to keep behind, this is thrown out by Sweat through the Pores, and the Blood
<pb facs="tcp:40826:25"/>
it ſelf having its conſiſtence from theſe three principles is hence made good; for Sulphure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently explains it ſelf in it by our Nutriments which we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, which are fat, oily, ſweet, and ſulphureous, for we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſulphureous and fatty parts of the Body generated out of the Blood, the which do gain their ſoftneſs, oilyneſs, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity from Sulphure; Salt we have from the uſe of ſalt Meats, which we do eat, and <hi>Serum</hi> does as evidently demonſtrate it ſelf as any of the former; Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the moſt ſubtile and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous part of the Blood conflated out of the ſulphureous and ſaline parts thereof dilated by fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart and there united together; the colour which it is ſeen to bear it takes from its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and dilatations which
<pb facs="tcp:40826:25"/>
are made in the Heart, for out of the permixture of the Salt, acid Particles with the ſulphureous a red colour is raiſed, as is evidently made good in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry by diſtillation of <hi>Sal Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which contains many ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Particles in it. Thus we ſee Pale Conſerves and Syrups, by having a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol added to them, thus runs them into a reddiſh colour, and if any thing of Sulphur be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to added, it gives them a more deep ruddy ſtain. Thus if you mix any acid ſpirit with Blood, you'll find the Blood hereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more or leſs coagulate; and this is thus made good, for if we take Oyl of Vitriol, or Sulphure <hi>per Campanum, Aqua Fortis. Regis,</hi> or the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Blood's being herewith coagulated, you'll find it chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:40826:26"/>
into a Cheſnut colour; if we alſo take ſweet Spirit of Salt, Juice of Lemons, diſtill'd Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and the like, whoſe acid Spirits are more temperate, theſe will give the Blood the thickneſs and conſiſtence of a Syrup, its colour remaining altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable and no ways injured. And hence is it that the uſe of Acids does keep Man from the Plague, not becauſe according to the opinion of ill Authours, they are Inciſive and attenuant, but becauſe they do keep up the natural conſiſtence of the Blood, and hinder the ſame, by how much it is leſs affected with an acid volatile Salt, or in an air in which we breath; and this was one cauſe which made <hi>Sylvius,</hi> in the great Sickneſs-time at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> before he ever viſited his people which were troubled
<pb facs="tcp:40826:26"/>
with the Infection, to eat white Bread dipt in Marygold Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, with which <hi>Alexipharmick</hi> he ſo well preſerv'd himſelf that no Infection ever reacht him. Acids alſo according to diverſity of things wherewith they are mixt, are ſeen to yield variety of colours. (And herein I muſt make a little ſtay, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof being of great concern in our humane Pile, as to its Health and its Diſeaſes:) Thus pour an acid Spirit upon Vulgar Sulphur diſſolv'd in <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium,</hi> and you'll find its Red colour turn'd White. Antimony calcin'd with Niter or Chalk, and boil'd in Water, its limpid cola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being ſeparated from its acid effuſion will look yellow. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Galls mixt to a ſolution of Vitriol, makes a black Ink, and adding hereto a little acid
<pb facs="tcp:40826:27"/>
Spirit of Vitriol, all its blackneſs will ſoon leave it, and it turns as clear as Water. Tincture of Violets by adding a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol or Spirit of Sulphure, turns into an excellent Purple colour. A Knife after cutting of a Citron in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, unleſs preſently wiped and purged from the acid Juice of the Citron, will make it turn black. Theſe verſions of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors are alſo very proper to be underſtood, by which we may make ſome probable conjectures compared herewith, with the Juices and Liquors in our Bodies. Admirable alſo is it to ſee the variety of Coagulums made by diverſity of Acids ſeverally plac'd in ſeveral Liquors; As by add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lemons, Verjuice, Vinegar, Vitriol, Sulphure, Niter, Sloes, Barberies, and the like, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:40826:27"/>
Veſſels wherein Milk has been put, and ſee their wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diverſity and Coagulums; all which are of near concern in us and with us, being compared to the variety of Acid, Acerb, Auſtere, Acred, Subacid, and the like Juices, mixing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves both with the Chyle, Blood, <hi>Lympha,</hi> Nervous Juice, Animal Spirits, and the like, in our Bodies; and whoever exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines Nature, in beſtowing her variety of Nouriſhments conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for our diverſity of Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of parts, ſhall find that they are not all fed alike; for ſome do receive greater and more ſubtile digeſtion, others leſs and more incraſſate concoctions. And thus we ſee ſome parts are made aſſimilated out of ſulphureous and ſaline parts equally mixt; And this is made good in the
<pb facs="tcp:40826:28"/>
fleſhy parts; other parts are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more Oleaginous and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous as is ſeen in the fatty parts of our Bodies; others more ſalt and tartareous proved in the Nervous parts and Bones.</p>
                  <p>Animal Spirits are allowed thin, ſubtile and volatile viſible exhalations made in the Brain, out of a few ſulphureous and ſaline parts, and many volatile parts of the Blood ſerving part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Natural and partly for the Animal actions; and the Matter out of which they are generated, is the Arterial Blood, whoſe conſiſtence is from a ſalt ſulphureous Juice and <hi>Serum,</hi> not of every one alike, for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line parts by a peculiar quality of the Brain, are in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure both diſſolv'd and ſeparated from the Sulphureous; their Sero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity being ſwet out, and ſo hence
<pb facs="tcp:40826:28"/>
becoming volatile, and ſo thin and ſubtile, as to paſs the moſt minute and inviſible Pores of the Nerves themſelves, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for two ſubſtantial uſes, as the performance of all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal actions and motions theſe commonly known by all; The other is, that natural uſe which is aſſigned them, whereby they are allowed to help forward nutrition of the Spermatick parts. And this is thus made good, for as we ſee the Blood continually does flow from the Heart and by its Arteries, ſo the Animal Spirits do continually paſs from the Brain by the Nerves, and that naturally, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of thoughts or wills of ours; Nay when our wills are lockt up by ſleep, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in ſleepy diſeaſes, wherein theſe are not idle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40826:29"/>
                     <hi>Lympha</hi> is a fermentatious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor ſeparated out of the ſerous parts of the Blood in the conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated Glandules, not ſimply perfuſed with much fuſe and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt, and impregnated with ſomewhat ſulphureous Particles, ſent partly to the Chyliferous Veſſels, and partly to the Veins, making the one thinner by its mixture, and giving it a larger dilatation perfected in the Heart; and preparing the ſame for the Venous Blood leſs attenuated for their dilatation in the Heart. And becauſe I deſign to deſcribe this and its uſes more fully in the Conglobate Glandules, when I ſhall offer at the Lymphatick Juice, I ſhall leave it to that place. Salival Flegm or Spat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, is allowed a light fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous Liquor both Serous and Lymphid, ſeparated out of the
<pb facs="tcp:40826:29"/>
arterious Blood, in the Parotides, or thoſe of the Auricular Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, or thoſe of the Fauces, Mouth and Throat, and ſent thence into the Mouth by their proper and common <hi>Ductus.</hi> What it is, is hence made good, for it is no Simple Body, but a Compound Sublucid Liquor, leſs fluid than Water, and more viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid; It readily mixing it ſelf with any or all our Nutriments, and requires no great courtſhip to bring it into an acquaintance with whatſoever we take into our Stomachs: Its uſe is ſeen of great concern in us and with us, for it readily makes an eaſie De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutition, extracts all ſapours and taſte from dry Meats, quenceth Thirſt, keeps all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages moiſt, promotes Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation when it enters the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and gives it a further Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:40826:30"/>
in its progreſs; and when it marcheth in its true order, as I have ſhewn in its proper place, it ariſeth from the ſerous part of the Blood, which makes the Lympha's more glutinous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the Arteries, and partly out of the Animal Spirits ſent by the Nerves to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned conglomorated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules. Now a Vitious <hi>Saliva</hi> may hence be made good as well by proper as common ſenſible qualities, and this proved by its taſte which ſometimes is ſeen ſalt, ſometimes acid, ſometimes ſweet, and ſometimes bitter; the ſalt part being given to the Salt <hi>Serum</hi> in the Blood, the acid to the plenty of acid humours in the Body, both as touching the Blood, as alſo the defect of the Animal Spirits; the ſweet ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing like <hi>Saccharum Saturni</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:40826:30"/>
the like <hi>Serum,</hi> it being no eaſie task exactly to explain all the innumerable qualities of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in our Bodies, not well underſtanding the common Diet made uſe of, by which theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours may ſo readily take their variable alterations; The bitter ariſeth either from Choler ſuckt upwards, leaving ſome of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques in the Mouth, or having ſome of the ſame mixt with the <hi>Serum,</hi> and ſo ſent into the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules: The glutinous part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ariſeth from the flegmatick part of the Blood, or from its more fluid or aqueous defect.</p>
                  <p>Flegm is reckoned the crude part of the Blood newly made out of the Chyle, not much cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated or dilated in the Heart; and the truth is, if we will give this humour its true merit, it ought not to be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb facs="tcp:40826:31"/>
excrementitious humours; it by all indeed is allowed Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a crude humour, by reaſon of its undue digeſtion in the Ventricle, which is both tedious and no ways anſwering the others in its Concoction. The Blood alſo is preternaturally concervated in the Conglobated Glandules, by reaſon of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment of refluxion, and its firſt obſtruction in the capillary Veſſels, frequently occaſioned by Flegm in the Arterial Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, or in the Venoſe interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the Blood being coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, is ſeldom ſeen contingent; Now Blood and Flegm are ſeen to be coagulate in the Conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated Glandules as well as in the other parts, which makes them both unapt for motion being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the Veſſels or their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate
<pb facs="tcp:40826:31"/>
Channels, and here ſtopt in their progreſs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſt into the neighbouring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Glandules, raiſing the ſame into greater bulk, and diſtending them into Strumous Diſeaſes; and wherever any humour is cloſely pinn'd up in the ſubſtance of the Glandules, making the ſame more ſolid and compact, this breeds a hardneſs therein; and this may ſerve as one reaſon of its Coagulation concreted there, and its being a proper Nurſe and Matron of Strumous Effects. Choler is a fermentaceous Juice or Liquor preſt out of Venous Blood and Splenetick Juice, by a ſpecifique digeſtion in the Liver it's bred out of the ſulphureous and olea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous Particles of the Venous Blood; for the Sulphureous Juice, although of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:40826:32"/>
it is Subdulcid, yet being for a while Excocted with a ſubſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Ferment, it becomes bitter, and is ſeen to change its colour; and this part of Bile thus excoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Liver, any thin part of it remaining unmixt with the Blood, and ſo carried to the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> does bear in it a fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative quality which it gives to the Blood, the other parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it ſends by the Bilious Pore to the Guts; ſome part thereof ſent into the <hi>Veſicula Fellis,</hi> where it is made both more acred and bitter, and therein requires a more ſtrong fermentative qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: The natural colour of Choler is yellow, its taſte bitter and ſubacred, and its ſubſtance fluid, but all theſe are ſeen to take their changes and chances in us according to the temper and conſtitution of the Body, the
<pb facs="tcp:40826:32"/>
chief uſe hereof being aſcribed to Fermentation, of which we have already writ.</p>
                  <p>Pancreatick Juice, ſo called when it attains the <hi>Pancreas</hi> and paſſeth through its <hi>Ductus,</hi> is Sublimpid, and as it were, a Salival Juice ſomewhat auſtere, bearing in it alſo ſome relliſh of a Subacid nature; It's ſeen as well moderate in quantity, as it appears uſeful and neceſſary in reſpect of the ſpecifique or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subacid quality it carries in it; for the ſetting forward and promoting of the fluxion of Bile, mixing it ſelf therewith by its new efferveſcenſy of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted Aliments, lapſt from the Stomach into the Guts, and therein making an uſeful ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that which is Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious, and this efferveſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy is made from the Volatile Salt
<pb facs="tcp:40826:33"/>
of Bile and Sulphureous Oyl, getting acquaintance with the acidity of this Pancreatick Juice. And hence hath our Health its great dependance, we having a ſound <hi>Pancreas,</hi> the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſeaſed, is the only mother of many Diſeaſes which former Ages attributed to the vitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spleen, Liver, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, and the like parts; and whoever deſires more hereof, let him peruſe <hi>Regnerus de Graaf,</hi> who hath a whole Book of the ſame ſubject already communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Serum,</hi> by all Anatomiſts, is allowed the wateriſh parts of our Nutriments excocted with the ſulphureous and ſaline Juice of the ſame in the Ventricle and other Bowels, plentifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the Blood, giving it its tenuity and flexibility, the
<pb facs="tcp:40826:33"/>
which mediating herewith makes it run through its narrow paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, waſhing away its Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Crudities, and diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf by Spattles, Sweats, and Urine. Urine is a great action of the Kidneys, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and diſcharging a redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſerous humidity from the Blood, ſending the ſame on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in its journey by the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Arteries, and ſo thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Renal Glandules, Urinary Fibrilla's, and Papillary Carun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, a great part of the <hi>Serum</hi> whereof is diſtill'd and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> and thence diſpatcht from the Kidneys by the Uriters into the Bladder, and what remaining of the Blood is left behind and mixt with that part of the <hi>Serum</hi> (the whole <hi>Serum</hi> not being ſeparated from the Blood) is thence ſent out by
<pb facs="tcp:40826:34"/>
the Emulgent Veins to the <hi>Cava.</hi> And this is thus made good, For as the beſt and moſt uſeful part (but fluid and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with a milky colour) and call'd Chyle, ſent by the milky Veſſels to the Heart, is ſecerned by the Nutriments taken into the Stomach and there ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the thick and more fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent parts thereof diſcharged <hi>per Anum,</hi> or the greater Guts; So out of the Chyle converted into Blood, is ſeparated a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous part of the <hi>Serum</hi> in the Kidneys, the which may vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly be obſtructed in its long journey, as by ill affections of the Caruncles, or Viſcid Flegm, or Glutinous Matter, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles herewith being preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, and ſuffer oft-times Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, a common calamity uſual with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40826:34"/>Sweat is ſeen ever more ſalt in taſte, and hence this may be allowed the cauſe thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that part of the Nutriment which was freſh and ſweet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted into Blood and Fleſh, leaving this, and Sweat granted nothing elſe than the part ſeparated and ſecern'd from the former. This is ſeen to ariſe more in the upper parts of our Bodies than in the lower parts of the ſame, they being more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſtockt with Spirits. And hence may we allow the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between heat and cold, the Pores being both opened by the one, and ſhut by the other, the one being but as Flame incenſt into Air, the other nothing more than Air condens'd.</p>
                  <p>We next come to the Juices of the Glandules, and whereas they are various, ſo their uſes
<pb facs="tcp:40826:35"/>
are alſo accounted divers; and here therefore are we to enquire of what uſefulneſs they may be accounted after their ſecretion from the Blood, and of what ſervice they may be to the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of the Body; and he who examines them with a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eye will find it no eaſie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to make out, eſpecially if we look into their motions; for when the Liquor of the Conglobated Glandules is ſent into the Thoracick Ducts, and mixt there with the Chyle, and to the chief parts of Nutriment, it marcheth along with the ſame into the Jugular Vein, or left Subclavian, whence neceſſarily with the deſcendent Blood it marcheth thus confuſe through the right ear of the Heart into its right Ventricle; and hence by no means allowed either
<pb facs="tcp:40826:35"/>
unuſeful or excrementitious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the excrementitious humors thus excreted from the Blood, having no further concern there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, are diſpatcht from the Body; the which is clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the Urine in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys ſecreted from the Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary maſs, and ſent thence by the Ureters into the Bladder, whence by the laws of Nature it is thence diſmiſt from having any further concern with the Body. Thus the Juice of the Conglomerated Glandules effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through peculiar <hi>Ductus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers Cavities of the Body, where they are allowed neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for nouriſhing ſome parts thereof, is no ways to be thought excrementitious. Thus the Spat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the Maxillary Glands ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted from the Blood and ſent forth into the Mouth and thence
<pb facs="tcp:40826:36"/>
diſpatcht into the Stomach, is no ways to be allowed excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious but very uſeful; as is that of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and the like, already made good: Now there is a great diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Liquors of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globate and the Conglomerate Glandules, as I have ſhewn in their proper place; for Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhews us, that out of the Conglobated Glandules, Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick Veſſels do ariſe, and <hi>Lympha</hi> it ſelf is prepared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and this partly bred from the acid part of the Blood ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted from the other part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the ſound Glandules, and partly from the Animal Spirits ſent through the Nerves thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therein permixt; and as theſe Conglobate Glandules in the Body are either entire or ill affected, ſo this ill affection
<pb facs="tcp:40826:36"/>
may either ariſe from the fault of Spirits, or the acidity of the Blood; or its ſecretion from the <hi>Serum,</hi> wherein and whereby is made a permixture hereof with the Volatile or Animal Spirits: How many ways therefore this <hi>Lympha</hi> may be vitiated, no Man yet hath undertaken to ſhew, it being a matter not only of great difficulty, but very near in kin to impoſſibility; for this preparation of Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Lympha,</hi> may be vitiated by being either more ſparing or more plentiful in quantity or quality, being more or leſs acid, ſalt or glutinous, and the like: And although I may not have followed the exact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Conglobated Glandules, yet I have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated ſome of its moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maladies, made good by
<pb facs="tcp:40826:37"/>
Tumour, Induration and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, all which are ſhewn in living Bodies, for dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies loſe both their heat and bulk. And hence it may be granted by how many ways theſe Glandules are injured, the <hi>Lympha</hi> therein receeds from its priſtine ſtate and natural qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and becomes both ſalt and acid; and out of this <hi>Lympha</hi> thus diſtributed and ſent through the Veſſels in the habit of the Body, theſe being lacerated by Effuſion into the neighbouring parts, do there produce Pains and Tumors, the laſt being the uſual product of Strumous effects. And as a <hi>Lympha</hi> in all the Conglobated Glandules is generated, ſo alſo in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glomerated Glandules is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peculiar Liquor begot, carried through every of their
<pb facs="tcp:40826:37"/>
Cavities. Thus in the Mouth two <hi>Ductus</hi> do apparently ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, called <hi>Salivales,</hi> throwing their plentiful Liquor into the Mouth, whoſe uſes I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed. Out of the Bile, Pancreatick Juice, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livary Flegm, ariſeth that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umviral humour which haſtneth the Liquor to the Heart, and gives it its natural conſiſtence and coagulation to the Blood, and according as the Blood it ſelf is vitiated, this is co-part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with it, joyns in its vitiation, and where theſe or any of them are exalted, they are ſeen to create inteſtine wars in us.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Glandules thus diſcourſed of, might be allowed Spinning or Unraveling, as it is the opinion of ſome few of our late and beſt Anatomiſts, this may very well make a Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb facs="tcp:40826:38"/>
for Conjecture, that any or all of either of theſe Acids, Subacids, Salines, Subſalines, Auſteres, Acreds, and the like Liquors or Juices, may run by or between theſe looſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous Contextures, as through ſo many Trunks or Channels; wherein Nature may evince and declare her times and tides of ebbs and flowes of Sickneſſes and Diſeaſes, and the better circulations of Liquors and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Juices, as well traced by the Lympheducts into theſe two ſorts of Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, as that of the Blood by the Heart and its Arteries, into the Veins. And from hence for ought I know, may more proper Conjectures ariſe how in Plenilunaries, the Brain ſhould be overſtockt with Rheumatiſmes, Catarrhs, and
<pb facs="tcp:40826:38"/>
Cephalick Defluctions, how Apoplexies, Epilepſies, and Convulſive Motions ſhall more readily declare themſelves then, and make their confident At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Man; how the Tydes become the preſages of Sickneſs as well as of Health, of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very or Death. If herein I may but raiſe a ſpark fetcht by the colliſion of conjectural Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which may be invigora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and impregnated by a better and more refined Alchymiſt, as to their ſeparatory Offices, or may have hereby made any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eſſay towards the more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the new ſtream and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the ſeveral paſſages in our Bodies: I ſhall think my ſelf extream fortunate in pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth a ſtone which may be of any uſe towards this great
<pb facs="tcp:40826:39"/>
Building. But I fear I have been too tedious in my entrance; If I find any new thing worth the Readers entertainment, that may abide the common Teſt and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for advance, I ſhall as readily promote it for publick good, and think my time well ſpent,</p>

                     <p>SInce Diſſection of man had its firſt ſteps, as to its birth and origination from our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it never arrived at that perfection which it is now ſeen to wear. Prudent Nature giving for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages her light touches barely, leaving them in their dead colour. But by breathing whiles of time ſhe hath been both more kind and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40826:43"/>
and ſome ages have more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly received a finer draught there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of than others, fetcht by the ſweat and ſtudy of its Induſtrious Sons, and not purchaſt but by their utmoſt Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And as former ages found it no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie task to break way for ſucceeding generations, for their better arriving at this Art; ſo in our times we have ſeen both the ſpark and the flame much invigorated, appearing more bright and clear, and freed from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thick obſcurities which it enjoyed in its early days.<note place="margin">The ſtudy of Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> This ſtudy of Anatomy is now viſible enough to ocular inſpection, whereby we may view the fabrick of Bodies both of Birds, and Bruits, and Men. But of theſe we ſhall find a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between their being alive and dead. The one giving the poſition, frame, ſight, figure, and connexion of all the parts thereof; whilſt the living mans Obſervation muſt adjuſt the account of their motions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, circulations, congruity or diſagreement; and declare how his humours do ſeparate, divide, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate, and digeſt his nutriment; as likewiſe demonſtrate the ſeveral
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40826:43"/>
excretions of the various Organs thereof, as to their proper functions, both as to the advancing the Spirits, as likewiſe touching their ſeparation. Where we may alſo premiſe, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things only accommodate to this preſent life, That in man there are ſome parts of greater uſe than others, and deſigned for more noble ends; others thereof being framed for more inferiour ſervices; and ſo according to their greater or leſſer degrees of uſefulneſs, their Knowledge ought to be more or leſs eligible. This ſtudy carrying recompence in its front, is thus made good, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering both its excellency and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; in relation it is concern'd with the moſt noble of all creatures, Man; as to his ſtation in this World, namely, a ſtate of regulated ſociety and government; as alſo for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowing of our ſelves, being not only uſeful to us for the preſent life in <hi>viâ,</hi> but alſo proportioned to that ſtate which is in <hi>Patriâ.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the knowledge of this Art, there are many <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature which have taken up the hours, thoughts and ſtudy of many
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40826:44"/>
learned men, who have more than with an ordinary heat exerciſed the ſame; and as well charg'd their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as forc'd many diſputes about it: And although its Knowledge is pleaſant, curious and delightful, yet it does not yield that fertile crop of ſatisfaction which may reward the ſtudious mind. Our Fore-fathers, and Induſtrious Indagators, ought to have our thankful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for our firſt rules which we gain'd from them in this Art of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy. And ſince our preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe tyes us wholly up to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of the Glandules, or glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous parts of the Body, which came into the World with the firſt man, and have from his infancy, been found as ſo many Scavingers, to ſuck up all excrementitious humours, which might otherwſe diſorder the humane Pile, and thereby diſturb the oeconomy of its parts.<note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Glandules in general.</note> I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume firſt to demonſtrate their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in general; they being by the moſt learned ever allowed Spongy Bodies, having in them a rareneſs, a fatty ſubſtance, not framed like other fleſhes, being more friable,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40826:44"/>
attaining many veſſels deſigned in them, appearing to touch like Wool, but upon ſtrict compreſſion, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Oleagenous humour thence exſtilling. They do ſeldome leave the body either in ſickneſs or in health, but do keep it company the whole age of man. When they are affected, they are generally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered with this ſtrumous or ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous malady, a diſeaſe being moſt familiar with them, whoſe ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Tumours do gain their incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a large repletion of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, collected from all the parts of the Body, paſſing thence hither by the Arteries, and whatſoever hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is thence diſpatcht and ſent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it no ſooner makes its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance here, but is readily ſuckt up by theſe glandulous Bodies. And this fluxion being much and morbifique (the Glandules in the other parts of the Body diffuſing the ſame hereinto) doth very oft occaſion a Fever, and alſo both enlarges and inflames them: being much like a Channel of a River, which being over-charged with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more than it conveniently can deliver out, it neceſſarily breaks
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40826:45"/>
over the banks, to make its ſelf room, and way for its diſcharge.</p>
                     <p>The Glandules are more large, and do appear in greater quantity in the concave parts of the Body, than in the exteriour parts of the ſame: And here (as Natures general Maxim is) we ſhall find that the moiſt parts of the Body do declare their chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode.<note place="margin">The chief place of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode.</note> And where theſe Glandules alſo are, and in what places thereof they are reſident, the hairy parts do alſo diſcover. For kind Nature fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med both of them for one and the ſame uſe, which is, to ſuck up the excrements they receive, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſame; for we ſhall find the hairs of the Body as readily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the moiſture which is ſent into the Glandules, and diſcharging it which arrives at the exteriour parts thereof, as the glandules do take the ſame into them, when it once do arrive at them. And as a certain concluſion, we may affirm, that we ſhall ſeldom or never meet with either glandules or hair, in any dry part of the Body, they being here out of their proper element as well as place. And as a further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40826:45"/>
hereof, whenever you ſee the <hi>Parotides,</hi> or glandules, placed behind the Ears, you will meet with hairs as their outward guard. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arm-pits where are planted the Axillary glandules, you will meet the ſame; in the groins, where the Inguinel glandules are planted, you will find them covered with hairs; about the privities, where are many glandules, you will find them well ſtored with ſociety of hairs, the glandulous parts being by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appointed as her Scavengers,<note place="margin">Theſe parts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as Scaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> and theſe hairs as her Beeſomes, by which ſhe ſweeps and wipes up all the excrements which ſhe ſends to theſe emunctuous parts, by ſweats and the like; all theſe wholly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the exteriour and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial parts of the Body, this diſcourſe in general only touching thereupon, and keeping within the outward guard thereof. Again, there are variety of glandules ordered and planted in diverſe parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, appointed for ſeveral uſes; as thoſe which are placed in the groins,<note place="margin">Their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</note> arm-pits, behind the ears, neck, face, eyes, and teſticles, and the like;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40826:46"/>
ſome of theſe being deſigned for commutation of the Blood, others given to the Breaſts for generation of milk; ſome bequeathed to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles for generation of ſperm, and others appointed for defence of the veſſels, and keeping them warm, as thoſe in the neck, and for the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the jugular veins and arteries, and for filling up ſeveral empty ſpaces in the Body, as the face, neck, and muſcles of the throat; ſome deſigned for ſucking up all ſuperfluous humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; as thoſe of the Parotis, Axil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries, Inguens, the which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called Emunctories, milking and ſtraining as it were the humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which ſhall happen to fall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for Nature hath placed the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotides, as its Sponges, for ſucking up all ſuperfluous moyſture which ſhall be ſent from the Brain, and hath given the axillary glandules for the ſame ſervice of the Heart; the Inguens performing the like office to the Liver, and ſhe having appointed a Scavenger to every noble part, they ſerve to clear in their proper places, theſe parts from all impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſuperfluous humidities, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40826:46"/>
may ariſe from the Lymphaducts, for theſe being ſtagnated, according to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s opinion, there is very oft-times ſeen to follow Convulſive motions in the head; and in his Book <hi>De Cerebro,</hi> he further writes, where any nervous humour meets with obſtruction in its paſſage, not only Spaſmodical Symptomes have thence ſucceeded, but ſtrumous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects have alſo apparently ſhew'd themſelves. But to return to the glandules: I hope there is no man thinks me ſo ignorant, (that is either honeſt to himſelf, or a friend to the Induſtrious) as to give this our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſcourſe as a general aſſertion to all the interiour glandules of the Body, every Anatomiſt knowing they are deſigned for better uſes; and becauſe I would not be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I ſhall preſume to touch upon them in a general order, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to expatiate more largely thereon, when I ſhall come to treat thereof in a more particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>I begin with the glandules of the Neck,<note place="margin">Of the Glandules of the Neck.</note> where we ſhall find them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently ſeated; others there
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40826:47"/>
are as neighbours to theſe, and theſe are the <hi>Tonſillae,</hi> by ſome called the Almonds, they in ſome meaſure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the ſhape of Almonds; but theſe are there placed for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſes. The Head being ſeated above all the other parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hollowed and rounded, and gathering a large quantity of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity from the other parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this tranſmitting the ſame, and ſending its fumes ariſing thence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in form of a Lymbick, the which are ſent back again, by and through ſeveral parts deſigned for this purpoſe, the body being all this while in a good temper, and habit, and void of all ſickneſs, after it hath remitted this retraction, this fluxion marches to the glandules and glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous parts no ways moleſting them, unleſs by coming ſlowly and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; the which were this humour either much, and that ſharp and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, it would ſpeedily run the glandules into Inflamation and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſo diſtend the Neck, and by its purſuit, paſſing or arriving at each ear, would ſpeedily breed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders therein; if therefore the Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40826:47"/>
thus happening, be either Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous, and much, this will make an inflamation like it, and when this humour is grown familiar and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the glandules, it doth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily form theſe <hi>Struma</hi>'s, or Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous ſwellings, the worſt diſeaſe belonging to them. But where a plentiful ſtock of theſe acrid and ſerous humours do appear, they do always produce Tumours, and the Inguinal glandules being herewith diſturb'd by the overplus thereof, it enters them, ſwelling and running them into inflamation, and ſo forcing them towards ſuppuration, as do thoſe of the arm-pits and neck. The Inteſtines have alſo their due health given them by meats and drinks ſent thither from the ſtomach, after digeſted, and do receive a moyſture under the Cuticula, by which it is alſo thence ſuckt up by the glandules there planted. The Head it ſelf is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its glandules,<note place="margin">The Brain by ſome improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called a glandule.</note> and the Brain by ſome (although improperly) is allowed a glandule, and by former ages was accounted nothing elſe but a friable glandule; and for its ſake were the reſt made which it keeps about it: And

according to its large ſituation, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming greater or ſmaller diſeaſes than any of the other glandules whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of the body, they allowing that all fluxions do ariſe hence, as from their chief fountain; the which it doth diffuſe and tranſmit through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral channels, which by nature are deſigned for the ſame purpoſe. Some of which are adjoyned to the Eyes, others thereof to the Ears, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, and ſome ſent down by the Palate and Throat, and ſo forwards into the Gulet; others by the veins paſſing into the Spinal marrow, and into the blood it ſelf: All which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their parts alike, and in good order, they do cleanſe and diſcharge all excrements from the brain, and do tranſmit every deſcending fume and vapour, which being ſtopt in their current, do moſt readily create a diſeaſe, and bring the ſame into the body, into which having once got footing, and theſe fluxions being as it were pinn'd up, where-ever they paſs not in their right order, they do give trouble to the parts wherein they enter, and pain; and pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common mother of inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40826:48"/>
this does ſpeedily produce a Fever to it, commanding an attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the parts, and ſending theſe acrid influxions back again to the Brain, and there cauſing exulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and having arrived there, and this fluxion being plentiful, does not ſtop here till its major parts be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and ſending this collected fluxion towards the extreme parts, and they as readily receiving the ſame, bringing with them an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted diſtemperiety, do both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe this attraction, and ſo frame diſeaſes; both which do ſpoil Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in her due courſe, and put her out of order, bringing much trouble upon her by breaking her intentions, and violently aſſaulting her quiet, by the iſſue of painful affliction and diſeaſe. Thus the Brain being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, and made infirm, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing robb'd of its former ſoundneſs, doth receive many unexpected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations: the mind hereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming diſordred, and the body of the Brain it ſelf convulſt, and the whole man put into a ſtrange frame, hence producing either ſuffocation, or a ſudden change in him by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40826:49"/>
Lethargy, Epilepſy, and the like. And ſince it is time to leave the grand Centre, and to come to its fair and ſtrong walls, which keeps and environs it in ſafety, that none of its channels or paſſages may by any overflow cauſe a deluge, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet any of its Rivulets in their true courſe, Nature hath ſafely prepared many fair channels for the diſcharge of the ſame; amongſt the which, we do firſt arrive at the Eye, the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Inſtrument which gives us the difference between light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But ſince ſin hath checquered our beſt appearances, and put a dark ſhadow upon our whole compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is found another fluxion which attends this beſt friend of ours, our ſight, and this by the <hi>Greeks</hi> is called <hi>Opthalmia</hi>; which ſhews its ſigns as evidently as the Sun, by its tumefying quality; and if this borrows an acquaintance with the <hi>Nares,</hi> it as readily ſtamps in them an <hi>Ozaena,</hi> or an Ulcer which comes not without pain, neither will it leave it without trouble; if it arrives at the Palate, and from thence creeps into the ſtomach (the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40826:49"/>
natural houſe of Digeſtion) it does moſt frequently occaſion Dropſies, and Scurvies, and other diſeaſes, bred from its unhappy ſociety. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if much fluxion doth paſs by the Palate into the Throat, as it's ſeen very oft-times happening in Conſumptive perſons, their Lungs are ſeen overcharged therewith, and by getting time and abode therein, they are exulcerated thereby, rotting and ſpoyling thoſe bellows which gave the poor man liberty to breath by. Neither is this humour ſo kind as to work the end of humanity by one particular method, but according to its variety of places on which it enters, it acts in diverſity of ſhapes, according to the parts on which it takes cognizance. Thus if it greets the Spinal marrow, by ſending a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion of humours from the head thither, hereby its impetuoſity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> or getting about it, and its adjacent parts, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly brings that pain which we commonly call the Sciatica; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it makes all its circumjacent parts take notice of its appearance therein; and by its cloſe twitches, bordring
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40826:50"/>
upon the nervous and tendinous parts thereof, makes the poor pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent perfectly weary of its tyranny, and by its continuance therein, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thence diſpatcht by Phyſick and other proper means, it doth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſhrivel him that endures it, into a Conſumption, by ſpending his vital Spirits, and making him truckle to its direful and painful cruciations. Sometimes we ſee fluxions playing their parts on man, as true Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, working by advantage, and winning by degrees, giving time for the exerciſe of their diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and deſigned end, whilſt at other times, like people in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, do ſhower down as a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, their ready wiſhes to their preſent humour. Hence fetching upon poor mortals, as their ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Votaries, either Delirium, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Convulſions, Epilepſies, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, and the like other dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Cephalick Diſeaſes; the which once taking fire, do inflame the whole Body, and make it ready to receive any diſtemper whatſoever, and when any part thereof doth feel of its cruel uſage, like <hi>Indian</hi> Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40826:50"/>
it takes not this alone, but calls all its neighbouring parts in to ſhare therewith. And nature being thus royl'd, and the glandules thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, what art and skill muſt be uſed for the bringing theſe into their right order again, eſpecially in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mankind, who ſharing in this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, any diſcreet man may judge; ſince we ſhall find their glandulous parts ſometimes affording Milk,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men and women, as touching their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and denying the ſame at others. Man indeed may be wrought upon in a ſtronger method, Courage being his Buckler; he being formed of a robuſt maſs, his paſſages being more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row than thoſe of Women, his growth and bulk giving him much more ſtrength and advantage, both as to all the parts of his body, and to his glandules amongſt the reſt, he being born a full and thick creature, both for ſight, ſervice and touch, who by his hard labour, trouble and ſweats, can more readily diſcharge theſe ſuperfluous excrements ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his glandules and glandulous parts; whilſt Woman by nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of a more delicate maſs, and better temper, and ſo gaining a more

excellent compoſition; Beauty and a fair make being her beſt dowry given by her Mother Nature, theſe being her beſt ſupporters, and being made of a finer mould than man, and of a more delightful ſtamp, of a more rare body, and ſo more fluid, and ſubject to the reception of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midities, living a ſedentary life, and deſigned as an idle creature by the Almighty, and ſo eſtranged to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and hard exerciſes, in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as well as in her temper, being both more looſe and more rare than him: yet we find although ſhe is thus finely framed, and thus curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly faſhioned, ſhe alſo is made a partaker of this diſtemper, and a great ſharer in her youth with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: Sin making both kinds as well ſufferers as doers thereof. For being in their humours ſometimes very ſharp, and theſe falling in earneſt upon or in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to their glandules, near their throats, we ſhall find them much addicted to ſalivation or ſpitting, accompanied with Scorbutick pains, and other Rheumatiſms falling from their heads, with defluxions falling in and about their teeth and other parts; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe

                     <p>WE began this diſcourſe with thoſe glandulous parts which are ſaid to belong to the Brain:<note place="margin">The Brain accounted a glandule by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</note> And here we ſhall firſt ſee <hi>Hippoc. lib. de Glandulis</hi> numbring the Brain it ſelf amongſt the glandules; where he writes, that the Brain is the largeſt of all the glandules, it being white, ſoft, moiſt, and as it were ſubpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued; but they err much who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this opinion of his, whereas any judicious man may ſee that both in its ſtructure and ſubſtance it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the contrary; beſides the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and uſe thereof ought to gain a better opinion thereof, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalneſs of its operation ſhewing better things thereof, declaring it a perfect bowel, as well as the Heart

and Liver; and hath in it, and doth enjoy its proper faculties as well as any of the other two. And in treating the Brain according to the Rules of Anatomy, we ſhall find the <hi>Plexus Choroides,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xus Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roides</hi> ſpun out of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules.</note> which is moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and bred from the fine and thin membrane of the <hi>Pia mater,</hi> ſpun and wove out of the moſt minute glandules and ramifications of veſſels complicated together, which rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications are ſupplied by the ſurcules of the Carotydal Arteries: This <hi>Plexus</hi> ariſing from the lower poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour parts of thoſe ventricles, which the branch of the Carotid Arteries do eitherways enter, the which do conſtitute the <hi>Rete mirabile</hi> for the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria</hi>; by this <hi>Plexus</hi> is carried the arterial blood for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the arterial ſpirits, from whence by the ſmall glandules, and ſcarce viſible in ſome, the more ſerous part thereof being unuſeful for the preparation of any animal ſpirits, is ſeparated, emulged, and collected in the ventricles, not as an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table excrement, as conjectured by ſome of the Ancients, but as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary humour prepared there for

ſome uſeful liquor,<note place="margin">A three<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fold uſe of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</note> of which there is found a threefold uſe; as by its coldneſs firſt, cooling and better tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering the blood paſſing this <hi>Plexus,</hi> and ſo better preparing it for a more uſeful confection of animal Spirits. Next, that this flowing to the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Tonſils and mouth, it there doth keep the <hi>Larynx,</hi> Mouth and <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> generally moiſt. And a third may be this, That mixing it ſelf with the Liquor which paſſeth through the <hi>Salival Ductus,</hi> it makes up the <hi>Saliva</hi>; and hence further moving it ſelf with the meat chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mouth, fit to be ſent into the ſtomach, it helps forward its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, by its peculiarly fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive quality, in the ſame way and method as the <hi>Lympha,</hi> flowing out of the liver and glandules, by the Lymphatick Veſſels to the Chylifique <hi>Ductus,</hi> doth prepare the Chyle by a ſpecifique manner, to which it mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf.

And whether this be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſe of this glandule, let us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examine:<note place="margin">Its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> Its ſubſtance being harder than thoſe of other glandules, and covered with a thin membrane, brought to it from the <hi>Pia mater,</hi> proceeding from the <hi>Infundibulum</hi>: And both Man and Beaſt are not without it; but in a dead Corpſe it's ſeen flagging; and in dead bodies not readily opened, it is ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, as I have oft-times found in ſuch dead bodies whoſe brains I have examined very accurately. <hi>Silvius de le Boe</hi> gives nerves to this

glandule,<note place="margin">Nerves gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this glandule.</note> and <hi>Wharton</hi> allows it two nerves, one on either ſide, ariſing from the upper part of the Spinal marrow, being very ſmall, and he that to view will demonſtrate theſe nerves, I am ſure will find no eaſie task to make good. But to enquire ſomewhat further as to its uſe;<note place="margin">Its uſe.</note> it's allowed to take, and continually to receive that flegm by the <hi>Infundibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> which comes from the third ventricle of the brain, the which ought by ſome way or other to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt and diſcharg'd thence, but there are no ways yet found out for its diſcharge, or parts appointed for the reception thereof; beſides, this glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule by ſome is ſaid to be exactly covered with the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and firmly fixed to the <hi>Sella equina,</hi> the which membrane is never open; how therefore can this happen, when it comes by the <hi>Infundibulum</hi> to this glandule, that it can make no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther progreſs; and ſhould this flow further, whether ſhould it tend, for there is no part near it to receive it with ſafety; neither can it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice borrow any further acquaintance with any part. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40826:54"/>
it ſelf doth convince, that a <hi>Serum</hi> and excrementitious humours have been found in the brain, I mean in its ventricles; and ſince it is ſo, it will be worth time to find out by what excretory paſſage theſe do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves: And for proof hereof it's allowed as a general opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion amongſt the beſt of Anatomiſts, that this ſerous humour ſent from the glandules of the <hi>Plexus Choroides,</hi> is thence exſtill'd into the ventricles, and this made apparent by Hydropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons, who have theſe ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles generally fill'd with liquor; the cauſe of which can only be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the more aqueous part of the blood, the which doth depoſe the greater Colluvies of the <hi>Serum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Circulation, the which is ſtill retained in the glandules, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the vein. Whereby we may ſatisfie our ſelves, that in thoſe who have a more aqueous part in their <hi>Cerebrum,</hi> or <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and ſo leſs apt for production of Spirits, this filling the veſſels, if herein a greater quantity of <hi>Serum</hi> be found, than can either be ſuckt up or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, all the overplus doth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40826:55"/>
fall into the ſubjacent cavity, and this declares whence and how this <hi>Colluvies</hi> is carried between the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles thereof; and nature here ſhews her care as well as her curioſity, by providing ſeveral pipes and channels for the diſmiſſing and diſcharging them, as we have already made good; planting in the front of it the <hi>Proceſſus Mamillares,</hi> and what ſhe ſends by them is diſpatcht by the <hi>Nares,</hi> or Noſtrils; at each ſide thereof ſhe hath in readineſs the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotides,</hi> and theſe ſhe makes uſe of by the Salival <hi>Ductus.</hi> But as a confirmation of this <hi>Glandula Pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria,</hi> whoſe <hi>Ductus</hi> is inſerted to its <hi>Infandibulum, Willis</hi> does offer, that it doth ſuck up the ſerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and do diſpatch them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which he thus does ſignifie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as he ſays, not only thoſe falling from the brains, but thoſe alſo ſecreted or ſeparated from the blood ſent into the brain, it admits between the pores; being thus made good, by injecting Ink into one trunk of an artery, you will find the <hi>Rete mirabile,</hi> and very oft the inward texture of this glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule covered with a black colour;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40826:55"/>
whence he aſſerts, that this glandule may and can ſuck up into it the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous humours, the which it not only receives from the brain, but alſo from the ſerous blood in its aſcent thither,<note place="margin">A double uſe ſhewn thereof.</note> here being a double uſe made thereof; the firſt taking into it the ſerous humours from the brain, which is but the leaſt; the other which comes from the blood, being of greater exiſtence in its paſſage thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And although we find in man no <hi>Rete mirabile,</hi> yet we cannot deny Lymphaeducts in the brain, or the like veſſels, which are apparently viſible; and this humour thus lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, is ſuckt up by the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules: In this glandule, <hi>Silvius</hi> writes he hath found many ſmall fibres ſpun out of a very fine texture;<note place="margin">Stones found in this glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> and he affirms, he once found therein a ſmall round ſtone, much in bigneſs to a fourth part of a Pea. <hi>Vanhorn,</hi> the moſt accurate Anatomiſt, writes, he found a ſtone therein in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of many of his Scholars, which took up the better part of this glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule, the which he kept as a rarity in his Cloſet. Various are the uſes of this glandule, according to the

doth much doubt of this high eſteem which is given to this glandule, and thinks that its proper uſe may be to ſuck up the excrementitious humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which may ariſe from the upper part of the Spinal marrow.

                     <p>AMongſt the external ſenſes, that moſt excellent faculty which produceth light to the globular orbs of our Eye is firſt to be had in eſteem, theſe being as the windows of the mind, and meſſengers thereof tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a great and viſible part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, and by the Ancients called the face of Love. In theſe ſtrong Orbits are the Eyes contained as in an enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or in a globular ſoft pillow, kept up by the ſafety of the eye-lids, as its coverings, keeping both duſt and vapours, and every thing that might otherwiſe be injurious to them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending them from too much light, and keeping them more pure and bright. <hi>Julius Caſſerius</hi> hath this Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken from the <hi>Palpebrae,</hi> that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40826:59"/>
they who have their upper <hi>Palpebrae</hi> elated,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> are commonly proud and fierce, whereas ſuch as have the ſame depreſt, as keeping the Eye about half ſhut, to be of an humble and mild conſtitution and nature. Theſe <hi>Palpebrae</hi> being open, they do frame two angles, called by the <hi>Latines Canthi</hi>; the outward being ſmaller, near which Orbit of the Eye is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a large glandule,<note place="margin">Here is planted <hi>Glandula innominata.</hi>
                        </note> which ſome do call <hi>Glandula innominata</hi> placed in the upper Region of this angle, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upwards, and thinner down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, divided into ſome lobes, and ſending forth many ſmall Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick veſſels, which thence paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the interiour coat of the <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pebrae,</hi> they do break through the ſame with ſmall <hi>Formula</hi>'s, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſtant from the <hi>Cilia: Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus Steno</hi> being the firſt which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame to the World in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection of Sheeps and Calves heads, and the like. The inward <hi>Canthus</hi> is greater and larger, in which the aforeſaid glandule (which indeed is the true glandule, and by ſome ſaid to be more thick,) cloſing the Lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Foramen or cavity, either of

Where alſo he thinks the Blood carried through the arteries into the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Eye, its ſuperfluous part thereof being ſuckt up by the veins, the veins being truly anywiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted or conſtringed (no ways per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this) and therefore by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40826:60"/>
of a more tedious delay of this plenty of Blood in the glandules, the <hi>Serum</hi> more plentifully being thence ſeparated doth iſſue forth: Now the veins may be conſtringed by the glandules being tumefied, produced by a more plentiful influx of animal Spirits, the which being inſerted in the glandules by ſmall nerves, according to the pleaſure or will of the Patient, more or leſs, as in pain, anger, joy or ſadneſs, may diſcharge the ſame out of the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, and ſo move them either more or leſs, according to the greater or leſſer conſtriction of them. This new Hypotheſis doth ſeem to carry in it a kind of ſpecious acceptance, but hath no great matter of truth in it, not being able to maintain the fountain of Tears; for if we compare the great plenty thereof ſuddenly flowing out, with the ſmall ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous veſſels of theſe glandules, we muſt allow it a little ſtrange that they thence ſhould have their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whereas the Arteries are both ſmall, and for the moſt part invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, which are carried to the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Eye. Again, if it might
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40826:60"/>
be allowed, that in the time of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Blood ſhould more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully arrive at the Eyes, and that the glandules themſelves ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with become more tumefied, and hence alſo both preſs and narrow the veins, Reaſon it ſelf muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this aſſertion, for in ſadneſs the pulſe of the Heart and Arteries is both ſmall and contractive, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts growing cold, the Heart calling from thence the Blood into its own Centre, and therefore doth not ſo freely ſend it to the exteriour parts; and ſo alſo into the Arteries of the Head, neither is there any reaſon to be given, why in ſadneſs a greater plenty of Tears or of ſeroſity ſhould be thus carried to the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, than to other parts.<note place="margin">Obſ.</note>

                     </head>
                     <p>HAving in my former Diſcourſe mentioned the paſſages by which Tears do make their deflux, theſe themſelves as yet by the beſt of Philoſophers being but obſcurely deſcribed, hoping it may ſeem no great digreſſion, amongſt the reſt to bring in my mite as to the Hiſtory thereof, to ſhew how theſe ſerous drops do deſcend and fall from the Eyes, and what they are, and whence ſhewn to proceed: We ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt introduce the Opinions of diverſe worthy Writers,<note place="margin">Diverſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tears.</note> who have writ of the ſame. <hi>Empedocles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves they are made and framed out of attenuated and eliquated blood. <hi>Joannes Baptiſta Scortias</hi> will have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40826:62"/>
them to ariſe and be generated in the angle of the Eye from the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the which being compreſt by any ſenſe of ſadneſs, doth ſpeedily diſtill into water; and gives this as his reaſon for his aſſertion, that as urin and ſweat are the excrements of the venous and arterious Blood, ſo Tears are the ſame which come from the nervous juice that proceed from the Animal Spirits. But this opinion of his can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand on firm ground, for we ſhall ſee many in their greateſt mirth have Tears dropping from their Eyes, without any thoughts of ſadneſs at all; neither hath ſadneſs itſelf that vigour in it to cauſe a tumefaction in the glandules, more than mirth, or pain, or ſorrow; for as to the Animal Spirits, which <hi>Steno</hi> ſaith, according to the command of the mind, do either work more or leſſer prevalently in us, and more or leſs ſparingly in the aforeſaid paſſions, and ſo according to their greater or leſſer quantity; this ſhall be more clearly demonſtrated by our ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe. But to proceed, <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Nyſſenus</hi> doth ſuppoſe that Tears do ariſe from many vapours carried
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40826:62"/>
to the Head by the perturbation of the Bowels, and by the coldneſs of the Brain being condenſed into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the which is thrown out thence as an unuſeful excrement. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Problem</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> writes that Tears are ſweat, or a certain vapour; and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſius</hi> ſaith, that there are not parts in the whole Body which do afford vapours like the Eyes. Now as Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters to theſe Opinions, both <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendens</hi> and <hi>Caſſerius</hi> do enter the Stage, as two ſtrong oppoſers, and do as readily affirm that Tears are a thin excrement of the Eyes, bred out of the reliques of the proper digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and collected in the fat and glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules. Others there are that think Tears nothing elſe but <hi>Serum,</hi> which is ſeparated from the Blood ſent up to the Head; the which by a certain motion of the Spirits (the pores be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus diſpoſed) do cauſe this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fluxion, but this goes as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And although <hi>Steno</hi> hath been very fruitful in his conjectures about Tears, and hath with moſt excellent arguments ſeemed to ſupport the ſame, yet whoſoever ſhall cloſely examine him about them, ſhall find
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40826:63"/>
that he hath not given the true cauſe of Tears, neither can involuntary Tears ariſe hence. Thus with him many others have not arrived at this true fountain of <hi>Lympha,</hi> although having filled many ſheets with their conjectures thereof, and likewiſe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they ſhould paſs as current. That we may ſeem to come and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a better and more true view thereof,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lachrymal and Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick humour.</note> let us with <hi>Diemerbroeck,</hi> firſt examine the difference between this lachrymal liquor, and that lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick humour, which is effuſed from the glandules to the moyſtning and levigation of the Eyes, paſſing through the moſt thin Lymphatick Veſſels; their differences being thus ſhewn, the Lympid being much thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than the Lymphid, the one flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Lymphatick Veſſels of the Eyes, the other from the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Brain; a ſecond reaſon is, this is leſs ſharp and ſaline, whereas Tears are to taſte both ſharp, ſaline, and eroſive. Another is this, being but ſmall in quantity, not offending the Eyes by its plenty, as do Tears, which do oft-times diſorder them by their being ſhowr'd. Again, this is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40826:63"/>
rather grateful to the Eyes than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, no ways corroding or fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, perfectly croſſing both humour and temper of Tears, which are ſometimes ſeen ſo corroſive, that they have conſumed the Lachrymal glandulous Caruncles, as we have already ſhewn. Theſe being premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, we arrive at the Tears them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their diſcourſe, beginning with their definition:<note place="margin">What Tears are, and how made.</note> And theſe by moſt Authors are allowed as the thin and ſerous particles made and framed out of a pituitous humour collected in the Brain, and thence flowing out of the Eyes;<note place="margin">Five cauſes thereof.</note> and there are alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed five cauſes which do make for the expulſion of theſe ſerous parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by the lachrymal cavities: One being the plenty of theſe pituitous ſerous humours collected in the Brain; a ſecond is their ſudden colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation, or ſtrong agitation; a third is the contraction of the Brain, and its membranes; a fourth, no exact contention of the lachrymal glandule being made by the glandulous carun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; a fifth may be the obſtruction of the ſpongy Bone in the <hi>Nares.</hi> For the moſt part two or three of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40826:64"/>
theſe cauſes do concur, as ſhall be made good by the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, when we come to examine how in diverſe cauſes Tears are ſeen to flow from the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Tears in ſadneſs ſhewn.</note>Thus in ſadneſs the membranes of the Brain, with the Brain it ſelf are contracted; and hence the ſerous humours of the arterious Blood, out of the ſubſtance of the Brain it ſelf, and <hi>Glandula Pituitaria,</hi> with the ſmall interjected glandules of the <hi>Plexus Choroidis</hi> are copiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed into the Ventricles, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſent into the ſpongy parts of the inward <hi>Nares,</hi> by and through the narrow papillary proceſſes of the ſpongy Bones, the which when they cannot readily entertain, coming fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon them than was expected by a copious and viſcid flux; the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and more ſerous particles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of do break forth by the ſmall lateral <hi>Foramina,</hi> or cavities, into the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er angles of the Eyes, and ſo waſhing them therewith, make them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge ſome part thereof, and thus do form Tears; the thicker and more viſcid parts thereof being much apter for making obſtruction in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40826:64"/>
ſpongy Bones of the upper <hi>Nares,</hi> and theſe by degrees thence diſpatcht and diſcharged by the <hi>Nares</hi> and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and ſo ſent out by the mouth; and by how much the more this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Nares</hi> is leſſened, by ſo much the more is the production of Tears leſſened therewith; for this being ſublated, theſe thinner and more ſerous humours deſcending in their paſſages as through the <hi>Nares</hi> and Palate, there's nothing that can hinder their proceeding in Natures appointment, and ſo no Tears can hence be expected, Nature going on gladly in her deſigns, and unleſs a new obſtruction be made by this viſcid matter, and ſo puts a ſtoppage to this her methodical proceeding, we ſhall find no new ſtock of Tears begot, nor no room left for any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commerce therewith. The ſame reaſon may be given for other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;<note place="margin">Tears in joy, and how.</note> Thus in laughter we have ſeen a plentiful ſtock of Tears have iſſued out, and yet not by the ſame reaſon as the former, for by this changing of the poſition of the muſcles of the Body, and the contraction of the membranes of the Brain therewith
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40826:65"/>
adjoined, a great plenty of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous humours are expreſt from the Brain, and its glandules into its ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles, and from hence into the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary proceſſes, the which do rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily flow to the Noſtrils and Palate, and theſe by extraordinary laughter cauſing a ſpumous or frothy <hi>Mucus</hi> from the <hi>Nares</hi> and mouth, they at the ſame time ſometimes coughing, do hereby occaſion and make an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the paſſages, in which ſtoppage the thinner parts of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour do ſeparate themſelves from the more thick and mucous ſubſtance, and ſo do force their paſſage through the lachrymal cavities, and thence do guſh out by the Eyes in the form of Tears, and becauſe this concuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which thus happens in laughter doth not long continue, hence is it that thoſe Tears which do thus alſo happen, do not ſhew themſelves in that plenty as they do in ſadneſs. The ſame cauſe may be given why young men, and ſuch as are given to amorous Courtſhip, whoſe minds are not eaſily converſant with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, being more readily reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt every appearance of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40826:65"/>
ſame, by enjoying the beſt things they can produce or procure; they being not ſo eaſily diſturb'd by ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or their brains contracted, and ſo not ſo readily bearing a part in Tears; whereas we ſee old men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants and children ſuddenly ſhewing their Tears: in theſe their glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous caruncles being much drier, more inequal, and more contracted, and they being in theſe both more ſoft and leſs firm, and the lachrymal cavity ſo weakly cloſed up, that by never ſo ſmall an impulſe of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous humour, it makes a very ready way for a new ſhower of Tears. There are many other cauſes of Tears,<note place="margin">Many cauſes of Tears.</note> declared by ſeveral Authors, and amongſt the reſt, as a common one, is that of Onions, theſe being ſeen both a ready and eaſie procurer of the ſame, and this they do by their attenuating and inciſing acrimony which they have in them, partly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating the humour in the Head, and ſo making it more fluxile, and partly by their tedious trouble and vellication ſent from their acrimony to the Eyes and Noſtrils, contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereby both the brain it ſelf, as

alſo its membranes, ſending forth and diſcharging the pituitous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours lodged therein, and diſpatching the thinner and finer part thereof by the Lachrymal cavities, and by their acrimony forcing the ſame out by the Eyes from their abſence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Smoke, Duſt, Wind, and the like, do fetch Tears from the Eyes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, for theſe do act by a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vellication induced to the <hi>Adna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> contracting herein the Lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal glandulous caruncle, and ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the cavity, the Brain with its membranes being hereby contracted by the painful ſenſe thereof, and ſending forth as well as expreſſing the ſerous and pituitous humours by this contraction, driving the ſame by the papillary proceſſes towards the <hi>Os Cribreforme</hi> and <hi>Nares,</hi> and whilſt the thicker parts thereof are ſent through the <hi>Nares,</hi> the thinner parts thereof do flow forth by the lachrymal cavities.<note place="margin">Obſ.

                     <p>THe Tongue in <hi>Latine</hi> called a <hi>Lingua à Lingendo,</hi> being the Inſtrument both of Speech and Taſte, and the help of ſending down both meat and drink into the Stomach, is placed in the mouth under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; and this in its upper part hath in it ſomewhat of a glandulous fleſh lodged under its <hi>Cutis</hi>; inwards and downwards it's ſeen perfectly muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and does every way ſhew the uſe of its muſcles.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Arantius</hi> will have the Tongue a glandule, although improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> 
                        <hi>Arantius</hi> is one who will have this to be a glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous part, and if we may credit him, he doth aſſign its compoſition to be framed out of three various ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; for immediately under its membrane, there's ſomewhat of a pulpy ſubſtance about its root eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, the other ſubſtance of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40826:72"/>
Tongue is framed of moſt thin and implext fibres, amongſt which is planted fat, peculiarly proper for keeping them moiſt, and making them more fit for uſe, and this may be one great cauſe why he was ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give it the name of a glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule, and this his aſſertion he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to confirm with theſe three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: As the Tongue hath in its ſubſtance all kind of fibres, and theſe ſo intertext, that they cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided one from another, as may in other muſcles. Secondly, There's no ligamental fibres planted in the Tongue for its ſtrength; as is in other muſcles. And his Third is, No muſcle taſteth, but the pulp of the Tongue is the inſtrument of Taſte, as <hi>Piccolom</hi>; and therefore <hi>Arantius</hi> affirms that the Tongue is no muſcle, but a glandule.<note place="margin">The Tongue proved to be a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> But we on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſhall find that the Tongue's fleſhy part is muſculous, when as in all the differences of animal motion, to the moſt ſubtile vowels, ſyllables, and pronouncing of Letters; all which do moſt ſuddenly expreſs the conceptions of the mind, never tired in their motion, being either contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40826:72"/>
dilated, doubled, or laterally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, according to the minds pleaſure performing all its actions; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this were a muſcle, and had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers joined in conſent therewith, theſe laudable motions were not thus to be performed by it. But our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at preſent not being concern'd with muſcles, I ſhall ſhew Dr. <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Anſwers to <hi>Arantius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        </note> where he firſt convinces, That the fibres of the Tongue do evince it to be muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and that its ſubſtance, for the moſt part thereof is muſculous, which appears from its various motions which it performs, and the variety of its fibres ſo diverſely intertext, do only ſuffice for the diverſity of its motions. Secondly, it's no ways neceſſary that every Muſcle muſt needs have a <hi>Tendon,</hi> but that which hath a fleſhy beginning may have the like end. Thirdly, That Nerves do paſs through its whole ſubſtance, and this is perceived in a <hi>Hemeplegia,</hi> in which is ſeen very oft one part may be ſound, and the other perplexed with a Palſey. And then laſtly, the muſculous part of the Tongue doth not taſte, but the membrane which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40826:73"/>
does cover its glandulous pulp, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially near its root; and thus by the intervention of this membrane it takes notice of all ſapours. Thus much of Dr. <hi>Wharton.</hi>

ſaith, although in ſound Bodies they are leſs protuberant, yet in a morbid body, where theſe are much inflamed or tumefied, they do carry a good reſemblance of an Almond; and hence it is preſumed they had this name given them.

                        </note> Under theſe Tonſils are planted two others, next to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Region of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> one on either ſide; at the ſides of ſome of the firſt <hi>Annulars,</hi> or Rings of the Windpipe, theſe becauſe they are guifted with many ſmall Veins and Arteries, do carry a more bloody and ſolid ſubſtance in them than other glandules, and do reſiſt the Knife in diſſection more than others. There's much controverſie about the uſes of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40826:74"/>
theſe glandules,<note place="margin">A Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their uſes.</note> ſome ſuppoſing they are framed for moyſtning the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx</hi> outwardly with a viſcous and pinguid humidity, and ſo making the Cartelages more apt for motion; but becauſe there is not much need of them for this uſe, I do ſuppoſe they may more properly give aſſiſtance to the Salival veſſels; others, with <hi>Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> do affirm, that they are framed for collecting the humidities which are ſent thither from the Brain; and with him do allow that theſe were here planted for preventing the fall of the ſame upon the Lungs; and that this may appear ſomewhat probable, he enlarges upon the blowing of the Noſtrils, and in ſucking in of the Palate, by which we find a kind of mucous ſlimy matter or ſpittle co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thence, which muſt neceſſarily proceed from the Brain; ſo alſo he ſuppoſeth that that which enters the Tonſils, may alſo diſtil and fall from thence, for in ſuch creatures who do want theſe glandules, as Peacocks and the like, who alſo want Teeth, nor do not chew their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, in ſuch it doth immediately fall into the cavity of the mouth, not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40826:75"/>
into the <hi>Thorax.</hi> Again, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the Brain muſt firſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall into the mouth before they enter the Lungs, and then into them likewiſe; theſe Tonſils will make nothing for their ſufflamination.<note place="margin">Four uſes allowed by <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                        </note> A ſecond uſe which ſome do attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to theſe glandules is, that they do convert the humidities ſent to them from the Brain into ſpittle: Againſt which aſſertion we offer this objection,<note place="margin">What the humour is which is ſent into the mouth by them.</note> The humour which is thus ſent into the mouth by the glandules is not ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but rather ſome mucous and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous matter, not much unlike that which is diſpatcht by the Noſtrils, and what difference this carries from ſpittle, every man may eaſily judge: but of this more fully, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly when we come to the Salival glandules of <hi>Steno</hi> and <hi>Wharton.</hi> A third uſe given to theſe, is to keep the Tongue moiſt, and all its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts; this uſe may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, the humour coming from them naturally being mucilaginous, and therefore moſt proper for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the parts moſt lubricous; and moreover, the ſmall Lymphatick veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels or Salival veſſels, as alſo the ſmall
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40826:75"/>
cavites of the membrane of the mouth may very well allow the ſame, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the Mouth and Tongue are moved, the which every one may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in himſelf when he pleaſeth. And hence when the nutriments are chewed in the mouth, partly ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly, partly by the maſticated nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, this liquor thus expreſt out of the glandules doth much more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully flow into the mouth, both for the framing a better mixture, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the fermentative preparation of nutriment, as alſo for a more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and more eaſie deglutition of the ſame: In reſt therefore when the Mouth is not moved, and when the effuſion of this liquor doth alſo ceaſe, as is generally ſeen in thoſe which are aſleep, the Mouth and <hi>Fauces</hi> do ſoon become dry, being robb'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this liquor, eſpecially if they do ſleep with an open mouth. A fourth uſe is, That they do help Taſting, the Which cannot be done without moyſture; of which Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our worthy <hi>Wharton</hi> is, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows theſe the primary Organ thereof, the moiſter parts moſt relating to ſpitting; both which do much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40826:76"/>
towards the extraction of the tincture of meats, as alſo towards a plentiful maſtication; and ſo may more properly be allowed to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the purpoſe of Taſting or Guſt's ſake. For dry things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having ſome tincture in them, are altogether unuſeful as to taſte; when therefore the mucilaginous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is leſs fit for the extraction of Tincture, and alſo leſs proper in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication for mixing with the meats, how far this may make towards taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, any one may judge; but how far it may conduce towards a guſt, when it is as its proper Organ, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed by him. The true uſes hereof, allowed by <hi>Wharton,</hi> are theſe five,<note place="margin">Five uſes allowed by <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                        </note> which I ſhall only name: As Firſt, he declares theſe glandules the primary Organ of Taſte; where he alſo writes, That in all parts of the Mouth in which Taſte is perceived, this glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule by its intervening membrane doth act the ſame; Nature never interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing between the gift which is to feel, and the Organ it ſelf which feels it; when as therefore the part is ſeen every way exerciſed in Taſte, this approaches near the guſtile object,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40826:76"/>
and this is neceſſary that it ſhould be the inſtrument of Taſte, and if it be the inſtrument, it doth thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince its gift, which is by him called the firſt uſe thereof. The Second uſe allows them as an excretory In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, its office being to ſeparate ſome mucous and pituitous matter, falling from the lower part of the Brain, by the nerves eſpecially; thoſe of the third pair diſtilling and flowing thence, partly from the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary maſs effuſed by the Arteries, and ſo refunded into the <hi>Fauces</hi> and Mouth, as is already deſcribed by him; but this is readily refuted by <hi>Diemerbroeck,</hi> when he writes, That whereas <hi>Wharton</hi> doth ſay that theſe glandules (without all reaſon) are endued with a notable ſenſe, and that they are the true and primary Organs of Taſte, and ſuppoſeth that the pituitous matter flowing from the Brain to them by the Nerves, (as if thick and viſcid matter could paſs through theſe minute and viſible pores of the nerves ſo plentifully) is a thing which requires not great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to refute, he allowing them to be a great productive towards this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40826:77"/>
faculty of Taſting. A Third uſe of theſe glandules he allows is, to moyſten the <hi>Fauces, Larynx</hi> and Tongue, for their better and more eaſie reſpiration, that the voice hereby may be more ſound, and that deglutition may thereby alſo with more eaſe be performed. His fourth is, That in plentiful Catarrhs of the Brain, the Noſtrils at this time being obſtructed, part of the matter being imbibed into their ſpongy ſubſtance, may hence be diſpatcht and diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the mouth. And his laſt is, That by its fermentative faculty, the liquor which thence comes into the Mouth, and ſo entring the Stomach, doth therein promote digeſtion; by whoſe acidity alſo it doth contract the ſame, the which doth chiefly tend towards the promoting a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and is the chief cauſe thereof.</p>

and as a guard to defend his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, he brings this reaſon, That ſome parts of the arterious Blood do fall into the Stomach and Guts, the which do there perform the office of Strong water, in promoting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of nutriments; and from theſe being hot, he ſays vapours may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily aſcend by the <hi>Aeſophagus</hi> into the Mouth, and by this method allowed there to form this <hi>Saliva</hi> or Spittle.

Arteries are ſeen to obtain but ſmall pores or paſſages, by which they do depoſe this liquor into theſe glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, and this large and great Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations do prove, be they either Spontaneous, or made ſo by Art, in which ſuch a large plenty of ſpittle is diſcharged, that nothing but the Arteries could yield them ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; and it's alſo very credible, that theſe do take into them the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of ſome Nerves, as I formerly have ſhewn, and do tranſmit the ſame into the next Veſſel, as it is the uſual cuſtome, amongſt ſeveral of the glandules: And when by chance a greater flux than ordinary is made by the Nerves to the face, than can be prolated by the habit of the part, and this remitted by the Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts to this glandule, the Face here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is apparently ſeen to ſwell, and blown up, as it were tumefied by an aedematous tumour, as we find it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens in ſuch who having had pain in their Teeth, at whoſe farewel we have commonly ſeen the Face to ſwell very much.

One great glandule is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the middle of the Breaſt, the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40826:87"/>
reſt being but ſmall, beſides which, infinite plexures of the Milky Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are interjected amongſt theſe glandules, the which mediating, not only the Milky Juice is carried to all of them, but the ſmaller glandules do alſo effuſe this Milk into the largeſt amongſt them. Again, in theſe glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules are many large and copious pores, in which, as in ſo many ſmall Cells, is the Milk reſerved, till the time of its being ſuckt up, unleſs it doth flow out thence of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, by its over plentifulneſs or thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Nipple is planted upon this great glandule, the which is a fungous ſmall Body, inveſted with a thin <hi>Cutis,</hi> and perforated with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretty Orifices, the Lacteal Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus doth terminate in theſe glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, and the Milk, as through a pipe, is let out thence, at the infants ſucking the ſame. This glandule is of exquiſite ſenſe, and carries and gives pleaſure in the ſucking or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting thereof, by which both the bulk of the Breaſt is leſſened, as alſo its weight.<note place="margin">The glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Breaſts allowed five Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</note> The glandules of the Breaſts have five veſſels allowed them, as Nerves ariſing from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtals,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40826:87"/>
plentifully arriving at the Nipples, giving them the ſenſe which we ſee they do obtain. Secondly, Arteries for their nutriment. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Veins appointed for bringing Blood towards the ſame, the which in Nurſes ſometimes having too much thereof, this is carried from the Breaſts to the Subclavian Veins, even as the Chyle is carried by the Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racick Ductus; and being numerous and great, for they do not only car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the remaining Blood, collected from the Nutritive, but in ſuch alſo as give Milk, they do diſcharge part of the redundant Milky Liquor to the Subclavians, the which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by theſe Veins. The Fourth are the Milky Veſſels, and the Fifth the Lymphaeducts beſtowed upon them. Thoſe Milky Veſſels are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Arteries and Veins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing variouſly interjected in the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Breaſts enated from the lower part, and meeting together in the Center thereof, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and continuity with the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liferous Ductus lodging in the Trunk of the Body, hath not till of late been found out by the beſt Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40826:88"/>
they not being conſpicuous; the Chylous juice not remaining in them, nor more detained in them than the Urine is in the Ureters, but by the compreſſion of the reſpiratory Muſcles, and thoſe parts through which they do enter, it's eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd, and through thoſe that it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Neither is it much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, that theſe ſhould not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew themſelves to the light, when as the Thoracick Chilifique Ductus it ſelf being large enough, running according to the length of the Spine, hath never till of late been found out by the moſt accurate Anatomiſts; nor by them could be demonſtrated, the which in our days appears as clear as the light it ſelf; the uſe and reaſon of the carriage of theſe to the Breaſt may very well grant the ſame, although denied and obſcured from ocular inſpection. <hi>Antonius Everard Tract. de Ortu Animal.</hi> obſerving a manifeſt deduction of the Milky Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in a ſucking Whelp, thus ſaith, That ſome of theſe Ductus's do ariſe from the deſcendant trunk running about the Abdominal Muſcles under the fat, and that the glandulous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40826:88"/>
of the Breaſts did carry the matter of Milk in them, the which having manifeſt pipes framed for them, doth convey this Milk into a common channel, and this is thence ſuckt out by the Nipple. And <hi>Pecquet, anno</hi> 1654. before <hi>Riverius,</hi> found and ſhewed in a ſucking Whelp, near her third upper Rib a Milky channel reaching to the Breaſts, from whence a great plenty of Milk ſucceeded; which experiment he hath very oft ſhewn in young ſucking Puppies; and as this of <hi>Antonius</hi> is found in Whelps to ariſe from the deſcendant Lacteal Trunk, ſo in Women they are ſeen to ariſe from the aſcendant Thoracick Trunk, planted at the Breaſts in the Breaſt. The which happened in a Scriveners Wife, who,<note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> after her having lain in about a month or five weeks, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a fall, complain'd of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Milk ſhe had in her Breaſts, and that if her Child ſhould ſuck with any ſtrength, ſhe felt a great pain deſcending from her Breaſts even to her Back, and about the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion between her Scapula's; but ſomewhat lower ſhe ſeemed to ſwell,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40826:89"/>
and began to perceive ſome pain about her loins, the which upon the Infants not ſucking, ſhe perceived nothing thereof: And without doubt this happened by reaſon of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment which hindred the tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Milky Veſſels to the Breaſts; and hence this Suction being made in the upper part thereof, a plentiful Chyle not ſucceeding from the Thoracick Ductus, this pain was excited by the ſame Suction collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Breaſts even to the Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racick Ductus, ſhe never having any great quantity of Milk coming thence, ſo that the Child was forc't to be put out to nurſe. Let this ſerve as one Hiſtory, amongſt many which might be introduced as to the confirming the ſame. And this may ſuffice to confute all ſuch who do ſuppoſe that the Chyle is not carried to the Breaſts by the Milky veſſels, but by thoſe Arteries which with the Blood is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed thither, and from theſe again ſeparated from the Blood, and ſo turned into Milk.<note place="margin">The uſe of the Breaſts.</note> The primary uſe of the Breaſts is to breed and to form Milk, and to prepare the ſame as proper nutriment for the Infant. Milk
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40826:89"/>
it ſelf being a ſweet and white Juice prepared in the Breaſt for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nouriſhment. I ſhall not here enlarge as to its frame and make, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſome allowed to be made of Blood, and others of Chyle; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Authors having ſpent much time in giving the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of its compoſition; my task more cloſely relating to the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules. All our beſt Anatomiſts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing its generation to proceed from Chyle, and this the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Chyle doth very well ſet forth, there being no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of difference between them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their ſubſtance, ſapour, or colour. And how this Chyle is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Milk, hath as yet but by a very few been demonſtrated; all the glandules of the Body being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for one and the ſame uſe, that they may take into them ſome Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick humour out of the Blood (as <hi>Saliva</hi> in the Mouth) and perfuſe the ſame with ſomewhat of a ſubacid quality; and this is given both to the Blood, to the Chyle, and to other humours, for their better and more ready ſeparation. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40826:90"/>
ſome may queſtion the truth hereof,<note place="margin">Milk ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from Chyle.</note> by asking if this be true, that Milk is generated from Chyle, and not from Blood, how happens it that in a large flux of Blood, the Milk doth leſſen in its quantity, or grow defective? To which I give this as a ready anſwer, Milk is not always deficient on this occaſion, if the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man eats well; and when this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, this happens becauſe Nature is more intent in taking care of, and providing for a greater neceſſity, as to the reſtauration of the Spirits of the whole Body, by calling and ſummoning in all the Chyle to the Heart, and converting the ſame to Blood; and doth ſend none of it, or if any, but a very ſmall quantity thereof to the Breaſts. And ſuch who do defend the Milks origination to proceed from Chyle, do ſtrengthen their aſſertion with theſe reaſons: That they do ſuppoſe that the Chyle is either directly carried to the Breaſts from the Milky Veſſels,<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</note> or firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Veins, and circulated with the Blood by the Ventricles of the Heart, and ſo thence effuſed by the Thoracick Arteries into the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40826:90"/>
Breaſts, and there the ſanguinary part ſecern'd from the Chylous, and this reduced by the Mamillary Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels into the Body. And that this is Milk it ſelf, and kept and reſerved in the poroſities of the Breaſts for the Infants uſe. The firſt uſe hereof is defended by all Patrons of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, but the crowning this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and confirming the aſſertion, would better appear when they would pleaſe to ſhew the peculiar Veſſel, by which the Chyle ſhould be thus tranſmitted to the Breaſts.</p>

                     <p>WE now arrive at the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules and glandulous parts which belong to the third Venter, and having there laid bare the Muſcles and the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> the firſt we meet with in this Region is the Kell called <hi>Omentum quaſi Operimentum</hi> covering the Inteſtines, it being a thin and double membrane, much reſembling the duplicature of a purſe, ariſing from the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> outwardly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering both the Ventricle and Guts; in its forepart it's tyed to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Stomach, and to the Spleen, in its back part to the <hi>Colon</hi>; perfuſed with much fat, and plenty of Veins, and is therewith intertext like a Net. This <hi>Omentum,</hi> as <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlingius</hi> writes, is accompanied with variety of glandules, and theſe not

by the ſame, they march on to the common receptable, and do diſcharge themſelves into it. The other ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſs, is planted near the Spleen, and this hath been ſeen doubled and trebled, and ſometimes manifold; he there tells you he hath ſeen it in a Horſe, as twelve large glandules, whoſe Spleen did weigh ten pounds.

                        <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> doth tell us of a very remarkable Hiſtory thereof, happening in a Woman, who being opened after her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, her bowels were ſeen very healthful, excepting her Kell, the which grew and encreaſed into ſuch a vaſt glandulous bulk, that whilſt the Woman was alive, it made ſuch a greatneſs about her Belly, as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is ſeen in Hydropical perſons; this bulk was every way membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, but inwardly glandulous, adipoſe and Scirrhous, in its middle was found a fetid cavity which was filled with ſordid <hi>Sanies,</hi> weighing fifty ſix pounds, and was taken thence without injuring the other bowels, and was ſeen wholly tyed to her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>

ſome ſubacid and light faculty, and ſent out of theſe into the great mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle glandule, by <hi>Fallopius</hi> and <hi>Aſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> called the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and by moſt Anatomiſts at this day called <hi>Pancreas Meſenterii,</hi> although im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly; the true <hi>Pancreas</hi> being more truly planted under the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and thus by right and ſhort Ductus's carried on to the Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Chyle, into which they do lighten the Milky Juice.<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40826:100"/>
And by reaſon of nutriment thus being denied its proper paſſage, an Atrophy hath neceſſarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the which at length ſpends thoſe that are thus afflicted, even to death it ſelf. And this ſhall be made good by many Examples, which ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter. By all which it will appear clear enough when you have read them, that both a Celia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal flux, as alſo an Atrophy may both hence ariſe from obſtructions formed in theſe glandules, and that thoſe general uſes beſtowed on them by Anatomiſts, as their ſerving to prop up and keep warm the Veins and Arteries dilated through the Meſentery are altogether invalid. But herein we may affirm,<note place="margin">Its uſe.</note> that in theſe as well as in other glandules, there is bred and begot ſomewhat of a ſubacid fermentative liquor or juice, mixt with the Milky Chyle, and this they do keep and reſerve for the Milky Veſſels; and theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any injury hereby, or gaining any ill conſtitution hence, ſuch as is frequently caught by a vicious fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is admixt to the Chyle in the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> oft-times this

Hence <hi>Fernelius</hi> writes it the cauſe of Choler, Melancholy, Diarrhaea, Dyſentery, Cachexy, Atrophy, of Fevers, and of Melancholick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, of Cholick pains, and of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tumours and Abſceſſes, theſe parts being very ſubject and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to miſchiefs, and bearing the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequent blemiſhes and ſufferings of our intemperance.</p>

                        </note>
                        <hi>Wharton</hi> ſhews five ways how theſe Veſſels may be obſtructed, which are thus: Firſt, in their entrance of the Milky Juice into the Orifice of the Milky Veſſels. Secondly, in their paſſage by and through the glandules of the Meſentery. Thirdly, in the tranſite of the Blood out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries into the Veins, and from them into the ſubſtance of the glandules.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40826:101"/>
Fourthly, in the aqueous and lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick Veſſels; and Fifthly, in the Nerves. Firſt, if obſtruction hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the narrow paſſage of the Milky humour, the Chyle is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of the Inteſtines, whence follows a dejection of Appetite, and the Chyle it ſelf frequently, as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in a <hi>Lienteriâ,</hi> is evacuated <hi>per anum,</hi> and the Milky Veſſels being deſtitute of the warmth and moyſture of the Chyle they uſually had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in time they grow parcht, and ſo runs the whole Body into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. Secondly, if obſtruction of the Chyle happens, after its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into theſe Veſſels by the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Meſentery, it cauſeth firſt a leſſening of the nutriment, and ſo conſequently produces an Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. Thirdly, if the paſſage of the Blood be obſtructed by theſe glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, and ſo alſo with it the Chyle loſe its paſſage, theſe do both leſſen the nutriment with their obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Fourthly, if it happens that the Lymphatick Veſſels be obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are very frail, and ſo eaſily rent, and ſo letting out their liquor into the cavity of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> hence
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40826:102"/>
ſuddenly an <hi>Aſcites</hi> does certainly follow. And Fifthly, if any obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould happen in the Nerves which are ſent to the Inteſtines, there would ſoon ſucceed a reſolution thereof; as is frequently perceived in a <hi>Palſey</hi>; and here for certain there muſt neceſſarily follow a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution and extenuation of nutriment, if not an Atrophy of the Spermatick parts, the vital conſtitution being entire and ſtrong enough. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of theſe Veſſels ſometimes do alſo make them narrow, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does happen in inflations both of the Stomach and <hi>Colon,</hi> in Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick pains, and alſo in ſome ſwellings of the Meſentery; and here we may ſee Tumours of two kinds, Windy and Humoral, as <hi>Wharton</hi> hath it. The Meſentery becauſe it wants ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is ſeldome diſtended by Wind. Tumours,<note place="margin">Three cauſes of Tumour in any part of the Body.</note> happen in what part of the Body they will, they do demonſtrate three eſpecial cauſes of their product, as afflux of the matter flowing to the place, its tranſition impedited, and their felling; for where there is no afflux of matter there can ſcarce any cauſe of Tumour be expected; thus
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40826:102"/>
in dead Bodies we meet with no Tumours, becauſe in theſe all afflux of humours do then ceaſe. Tumours with inflamation do argue ſome pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridneſs of matter going along in the ſwell'd part, and many of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations are allowed to ariſe in Dyſenteries ill cured: Tumours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inflamation, putridneſs and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are various, and theſe do take a long time for their growth, and theſe do frame Chronick diſtempers, of this ſort are reckoned <hi>Abſceſſes, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theroms, Steatoms, Meliceris, Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae, Schirrhus,</hi> and the like. <hi>Riolan</hi> doth place the root and foundation of Struma's to be lodged here, and doth declare that no Struma's do break forth and ſhew themſelves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, till the Meſentery be firſt fill'd with its Scrophulated glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules; after whoſe opinion <hi>Guido</hi> ſeems to be a follower, affirming that Struma's have no further affinity with the glandules of the Meſentery, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed for a further preparation of the Chyle; neither can Struma's be ſaid to have any cauſe or origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Meſentery, when as every days uſe thereof doth teach
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40826:103"/>
that moſt ſtrumous people being ſound in the Body, have ſuffered many troubles ariſing from this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenterick diſeaſe: of which opinion <hi>Wiſeman</hi> alſo is, when he writes, That whenſoever the outward glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules do appear tumefied, we may ſafely conclude the Meſenteries to be ſo alſo, they uſually being the firſt parts which are attacked with this mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Which opinion of his Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my doth very much confute, for I have diſſected ſeveral ſtrumous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whoſe Meſenteries have not been tumefied with glandules, and yet I have opened others which have been plentifully fill'd with the ſame, but this will not keep up his general opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Meſenteries being the firſt part attacked with this diſtemper; All which is contrary to the Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive method,<note place="margin">This aſſer-contrary to Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> the which for the moſt part is performed by Topicks, the which can no ways be allowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable here, if the fountain of this evil ſhould be in the Meſentery, and this is manifeſt in the diſſection of dead Bodies who have dyed Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulated, in whom ſome of theſe have been found to have had their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40826:103"/>
Meſentery no ways toucht with the ſame; and therefore <hi>Riolan</hi>'s opinion muſt neceſſarily meet with reproof as well as the other. In <hi>Wharton de Adenograph.</hi> you will meet with a Hiſtory of a Woman there cited by <hi>Paraeus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hiſtory 1.</note> whoſe Meſentery was ſwell'd with an immenſe tumour, which weighed near ten pound and a half, outwardly Scirrhous, in which was very many abſceſſes, included in their ſeveral bags, as you may read more at large fol. 49. <hi>ejuſ.

                     <p>The ſecond was of a Girl about eleven years of age,<note place="margin">Hiſtory 3.</note> who being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with ſuch another kind of flux, accompanied with gripes, and an extreme emaciation of Body, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards dyed; ſhe being opened, by the deſire of her Relations, in the company of many Phyſicians, in her Body was found many and almoſt innumerable hard and tumefied glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules in the Meſentery thereof, ſome of which exceeded the largeneſs of a ſmall Nut; others of theſe which were ſmaller, upon opening them, we found a moſt white Milky Chyle

iſſue thence, concreted into the form and hardneſs of Cheeſe, yet in her the Spleen nor <hi>Pancreas</hi> did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed its uſual bigneſs.</p>

                     <p>This fourth was an Obſervation of a Gentleman which came from <hi>Oxford,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hiſtory 5.</note> and was my own patient,

who having uſed ſeveral methods and medicines there without ſucceſs, came to his Majeſty to be toucht for the Evil, but at that time was ſo far ſpent with weakneſs that he was forc't to be carried to the King; ſome while after he was adviſed to come to <hi>London,</hi> to ſee what better hopes he might gain there, and was committed to Mr. <hi>Pearſe</hi>'s, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Chyrurgion, and my care, in whoſe ſickneſs Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> was alſo conſulted; upon examining of whoſe Leg, which was both a great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his lameneſs, Hectick Fever, and Atrophy, we found a very large Tumour had ſeized the upper part of his foot, and cauſed a rottenneſs or <hi>Caries</hi> in his Bones; <hi>London</hi> air not agreeing with him, he after three or four days reſt there, was ordered to <hi>Kingſenton</hi>; where the beſt of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and means were not wanting to him, but he ſtill conſuming daily under our hands, who from the firſt had been under our care not above twelve or fourteen days, at length cloſed up his day with the night of Death: I being deſired by ſome of his friends to open his dead Corpſe,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40826:105"/>
amongſt the things of note, as much as we could (for the dead Body had a very bad ſmell preſently ſeized it) we found his ſwell'd Leg, upon opening it, to have a perfect <hi>Caries</hi> paſt through it, ſo that I could ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily paſs my Probe through the ſame; his Inteſtines were extreamly tumefied and diſcoloured, and his Meſentery fill'd up with an infinite company of large Glandules, his Spleen was diſordred, and his Liver was very large, exceeding its uſual bigneſs in a great meaſure, his Heart and Lungs being both very ſound and entire.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40826:106"/>
may endure ſeparation one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from their looſe connexion they do form a ſoft body; ſo that by ſome the <hi>Pancreas</hi> is ſaid to be a ſoft and looſe glandule; again, every of the glandules conſtituting the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas</hi> hath a particular membrane gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them; yet all ſeem as it were coupled together by this ſtrong coat, it ariſing from the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> by whoſe benefit they are kept in their places.<note place="margin">Its Site.</note> In Man it is planted under the back part, and in the bottom of the Stomach, about the firſt Vertebre of the Loyns, where, to the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum</hi> it is firmly annexed, it is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the cavity of the Liver to the region of the Spleen, and gets a tranſverſe ſite there. If we take a view of its colour,<note place="margin">Colour.</note> it carries in it the pale colour of many or moſt of the glandules, for the Blood that paſſeth into it, is of a very bright and light colour. Its figure is longiſh,<note place="margin">Figure.</note> largeſt and thickeſt about the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> thinner and narrower towards the Spleen, obtaining a various conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in diverſity of Animals. In ſound Bodies this carries but a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bigneſs,<note place="margin">Quantity.</note> its length generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

about eight or ten tranſverſe fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and this it ſeldom exceeds in men of a good and healthful conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Its breadth is generally ſeen two tranſverſe fingers, and its thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in dead Bodies, as hath common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been obſerved, hath not exceeded the thickneſs of one tranſverſe finger. Its weight is various, according to the diverſity of mans conſtitution: And Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> ſaith it generally is ſeen to weigh about 4 or 5 ounces, and in Horſes it weighs about 11 ounces. It hath 4 ſorts of Veſſels allowed it.<note place="margin">Veſſels.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> Arteries, which it takes from the Caeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal Artery; Veins, which it takes from the Splenetick branch, Nerves which it hath from the ſixth pair, and a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, which it hath given it peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper to it ſelf, unknown to the Ancients, ariſing from its own <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma.</hi> This Ductus being membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and although thin, yet it is made very firm, whoſe greatneſs does very near equal that of a Gooſe quill towards the Gut called the <hi>Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> In its progreſs it ſeems divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and then attenuated into both greater and ſmaller lateral branches, and running hence to all the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40826:107"/>
of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> as to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of uſes given this Ductus, and the liquor which is kept in it, <hi>Regne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus de Graaf</hi> hath at large in his Book <hi>De Succo Pancreatico</hi> declared, to which I ſhall recommend the Ingenuous Reader. As to its uſe alſo,<note place="margin">Its uſe.</note> this hath as many given it, as Phyſicians can well put upon it. Thus ſome will have it as a Pillow to the Stomach; and this opinion <hi>Veſalius</hi> doth defend, as you may ſee in his Book <hi>de Omento cap.</hi> 4. but this opinion of his doth not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much validity in it, becauſe in Birds and Fiſhes, and many other Animals, this is ſeen to bear no uſe at all. Others defend that it lets out the Chyle from the Inteſtines; and this <hi>Baccius</hi> and <hi>Folius</hi> do vindicate, where they do ſtiffly maintain the Chyles paſſing out of the Inteſtines to the Liver and Spleen by the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick Ductus; and this alſo is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to the light of Senſe and Reaſon, for none of this Juice is ſent out of the Gut into the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> but ſent thence into the Guts. A Third ſort do write that this part doth purge the Chyle, of which number is <hi>Veſlingius.</hi> But he is readily confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40826:108"/>
both by <hi>Aſellius</hi> and <hi>Riolan,</hi> and others, and Experience doth joyn with them in their oppoſition; for this humour contained in the <hi>Pancreas</hi> is never ſeen bitter in taſte, and therefore can no ways be allowed acquaintance with Choler. Others there are who account it the bilious Veſicle of the Spleen, amongſt which the Worthy <hi>Bartholine</hi> appears, as to its conjunction therewith, as is ſeen <hi>Anatom. cap.</hi> 13. where he writes, That Choler is expurged by this Ductus, and ſo will needs have it the Biliary Veſſel of the Spleen, being made for its uſe. But this gets a ſpeedy refutation alſo, this Ductus not reaching the Spleen, neither hath the Spleen any commerce therewith, by having any of its Veſſels ſent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into its Ductus, or ſubſtance. Others alſo do write, That the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more feculent parts of the Blood are by the ordinary Law of Nature purged out into this. Of which opinion is <hi>Lindanus,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That this doth purge the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the Blood, and this ſeems to carry but little truth in it. When as the Pancreatick juice, as oft as it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40826:108"/>
hath been truly collected, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like the <hi>Lympha</hi> of Wine; and therefore what can be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this excrementitious humour which he puts upon it? Others alſo think that this part was formed for the reception of excrements which do fall from the Nerves: And this our worthy Countrey-man <hi>Wharton</hi> doth affirm in his <hi>Adenograph. cap.</hi> 13. where he writes, That this glandule doth adminiſter as all the other glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules to the Nerves, being as an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory glandule, and doth receive the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities from the Nerves, the which doth diſpatch thence by this proper Veſſel into the Inteſtines. But becauſe Nerves are made and framed for the diſpenſing of the Animal Spirits, I cannot perceive how this moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man would have an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humour paſs through them, and why they ſhould be more depoſed into the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> than into the Spleen, or any other part of the Body, I cannot well underſtand; for the <hi>Pancreas</hi> is a long way from the Brain, and too long, I am afraid, to receive its excrement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his leave, his opinion muſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40826:109"/>
meet with the ſame contradiction as the former. Others alſo do ſuppoſe that in the <hi>Pancreas</hi> both every uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary humour is ſecerned and ſeparated herein. And here <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius de le Boe</hi> gives the ſeventh opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereof, who writes that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is carried from the Inteſtines through this Ductus into the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> nor that any unprofitable excrement is in the <hi>Pancreas</hi> ſecreted by the ſame to the Gut; but a laudable humour prepared out of the Blood and Spirits in it is thence carried to the Guts, and this he thinks mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf there with the other ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And becauſe perhaps he thought that nothing could be ſent to the Guts, unleſs firſt having paſt by the Stomach, and ſo ſuckt up by the <hi>Ductus Biliarius</hi> or <hi>Pancreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and did leſs conſider that not only in Intermitting Fevers the ſick people are perplexed with various troubles about their Lumbar Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in other diſeaſes relating thereto, as Hypochondriack affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons produced from the Scurvy, or a <hi>Cholera,</hi> accompanied with gripings and the like, ſucceeding them, by
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40826:109"/>
raiſing corrugations and acid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in them. This Pancreatick juice being in its own nature ſubacid, tempered with the Animal Spirits; and he judging Choler, which is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo a perfect enemy to acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leaves the purſuit of its genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to others, he himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging it being paſt his knowledge to define.

Thoſe called conglomerated glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40826:110"/>
which are form'd out of many ſmall glandules put or joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of which ſort may be reckoned the <hi>Pancreas</hi>; and many other in the <hi>Fauces, Nares,</hi> Eyes, and the <hi>Thymus</hi> it ſelf. The diſtinction between each of which Glandules is not fictitious, but real, as experience doth evidently evince:<note place="margin">Made good by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</note> For take off the Membrane or Coat which covers either of them, and ſend into the <hi>Ductus Pancreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> or <hi>Salivalis,</hi> any liquor by a Syringe being thereto fixed, or to the Arteries belonging to either of them, we ſhall ſee the conglome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated glandules eaſily to ſeparate, and part from one another; eſpecially if there be care taken in the diviſion of the membranes, as they ſpread into bulk. The which, uſe the greateſt care you can, you never ſhall expect to do the ſame with the conglobated glandules.<note place="margin">By their ſubſtance.</note> Another thing which ſhews their difference, is their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for by Natures Decree and Law, we find a Cavity in the middle of the conglobated glandules, where I am ſure none is to be expected in the conglomerated glandules. To the confirmation of which, worthy
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40826:110"/>
                        <hi>Steno</hi> doth readily aſſent; where writing of the conglobated glandules, theſe are his words: Outwardly they are globous, not hallowed inward with any <hi>Pelvis,</hi> yet if you trace their ſeparation aright, you will meet ſome lips, and cleft every way between their protuberancies. Again, beſides their differences as to their ſubſtance,<note place="margin">And in their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels alſo.</note> their peculiar veſſels do alſo declare the ſame. For the conglobated glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules are properly framed for the Lymphatick Veſſels, which march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upwards towards the common Thoracick Ductus, whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glomerated Glandules do depoſe their liquor into peculiar cavities, as the Salivals into the Mouth, the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick into the ſmall Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious are the paſſages of Glandules, and diverſe are their ſubſtance; ſince therefore we have traced thus far into their differences between theſe two ſorts of Glandules, we muſt not leave off here, but ought to ſearch whether the liquor or humour which is found in them be one and the ſame in quality. And here we ſhall find much difference as to their quality,<note place="margin">In reſpect of their quality.</note> for we ſhall find one humour in the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40826:111"/>
conglobated, and another in the conglomerated glandules; for that which is ſeparated in the congloba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted glandules is always of one and and the ſame nature; which is not only proved and made good by their ſubſtance being always alike, but by their paſſages by which they do exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and diſcharge the ſame. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, upon a ſtrict enquiry we ſhall find that the liquor which ordinarily does proceed from the conglobated glandules hath more of ſoftneſs, and leſs of acidity in it than that which comes from the conglomerated glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and yet that this hath more of acidity and ſaltneſs in it than thoſe of the conglomera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Salivals. For upon taſting either of theſe liquors we wall find a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difference; for the <hi>Saliva</hi> is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and inſipid, the Pancreatick juice is acid &amp; Saline, or thereabouts. And ſince we find their juices to be various,<note place="margin">As alſo in their uſes.</note> let us enquire into their uſe, and this is thus made good; all the liquor of the conglobated glandules is ſent into the Thoracick Ductus, and mixt there with the Chyle; as the chief part of nutriment, going
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40826:111"/>
along with it throughout its whole journey: and runs along the Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Subclavian Vein, whence neceſſarily deſcending with the Blood being as yet confuſe, it paſſeth along with it through the right Ventricle of the Heart, from or by the right Ear of the ſame: And this, I hope, muſt no ways be allowed excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious or unuſeful, excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours being altogether ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Blood, ſo that by Natures Laws they are to have no further converſe therewith, but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſmiſt thence; the which is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceived in the Vein, ſecreted from the Sanguinary maſs in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and ſent thence by the Uriters into the Bladder, the which after a ſmall while lodging therein do make its laſt <hi>exit.</hi> Thus the juice of the conglomerated glandules being effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through particular Ductus's into various cavities of the Body, where it meets with other humours nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame; this alſo is not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed excrementitious, for this works as the former, in their various places and uſes. Thus the <hi>Saliva</hi> in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xillary Glandules, as well upper as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40826:112"/>
lower, ſecreted from the Blood, is carried by the ſame Salival Ductus into the cavity of the Mouth, where having met with the nutriments taken therein, and mixing it ſelf with the ſame, doth march thence with it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Stomach, and there creates a ferment; and ſuch therefore who do think this unuſeful or excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are as much to blame as thoſe who accounted the former as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.<note place="margin">What the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Juice ſerves for.</note> Thus alſo the Pancreatick Juice lodged in the glandules of the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas,</hi> do work as the former Ductus, where we ſhall as readily find this Juice, ſecreted in man four tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe fingers under the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſpending it ſelf into the <hi>Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum,</hi> and there mixt with the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented nutriments which thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the Stomack, and driven thither downwards by the Periſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick motion of the Guts: In which propulſion its greater part, together with the more pure and liquid part of the Chyle is thence diſcharged into the Milky Veſſels, and hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its proper Cyſtern, whence by the Thoracick Ductus it is ſent to the Subclavian Vein, and ſo marches
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40826:112"/>
along till it arrives at the right Ear of the Heart, and gets thence into the right Ventricle of the ſame. And if theſe be excrementitious humours, thoſe which do ſupply the whole Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of the Body may as well be allowed the ſame. Theſe uſes of theſe glandules I do believe were altogether unknown to the Ancients, who thought that they were framed as Sponges, to ſuck up all excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious and ſuperfluous humours; but our learned men of late, having with more care, ſtudy and labour lookt into this ſtructure, do eaſily ſhew how lame they were in the uſes deſigned thereto; and how former ages have lived in their errours, as touching the noble uſes of this <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas,</hi> every reading man may judge, by the arguments already diſcourſed of the ſame. I ſhall cloſe up this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſome Hiſtorical diſcourſes hereof, where we ſhall find <hi>Riolan</hi> and <hi>Plempius</hi> granting the <hi>Pancreas</hi> the ſeat of intermitting Fevers, and of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondraick melancholy, and the only cauſe of many Chronical Diſtempers.</p>

                     <p>THe Liver is a vaſt Bowel, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the right Hypochondry, under the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> in its convex or gibbous part it's round and light, in the lower part thereof concave; it hath a ſoft and reddiſh ſubſtance,<note place="margin">Its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance made of glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.</note> much reſembling concreted Blood. <hi>Malpighius</hi> who by his Microſcopes hath moſt accurately ſhewn the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof. <hi>Lib. de Hepate cap.</hi> 4. obſerves firſt, That its ſubſtance in man is framed of many lobes, and that theſe are formed of glandulous Kernels, the which do afford this heap of Ramifications, and covered with a proper Membrane. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the whole ſubſtance of the Liver, conſiſting of diverſe glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous kernels and ramifications of Veſſels, that they may perform their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40826:114"/>
offices together, Nature thought it neceſſary to place theſe glandules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them for the more ready exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their offices. Then,<note place="margin">That the Veſſels are not joyned by any <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomoſis,</hi> but theſe glandules.</note> that the aboveſaid Veſſels are not joined by any Anatomiſts, but theſe glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous kernels chiefly framing the ſubſtance of the Liver are planted as a mean between them; from which obſervations he concludes, that the Liver is a conglomerated glandule ſeparating the <hi>Bilis</hi>; and this he ſeems to confirm by the aboveſaid reaſon. And becauſe this office is particularly due to conglomerated glandules (as is ſeen in the <hi>Parotides, Pancreas,</hi> and the like) he ſaith this Veſſel is the Biliary pore in the Liver, where, with the felleous veſicle, it joyns. Theſe new obſervations of <hi>Malpigius</hi> have diſcuſt many things of the Liver left in the dark by the Ancients, and have given the ſame a better face of light. And that the unfortunate ſtate of this Bowel being by them call'd the principal Bowel, and put by <hi>Galen</hi> as the great Throne of ſanguification, and had in the higheſt eſteem with them of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Body, that in our

Some do affirm that they have found conglobated glandules in the Joynts, and without doubt doth thence deduce their Origination, and as to their inſertion, they do hence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onerate themſelves into the Chylifique Veſſels, and diverſe Veins.<note place="margin">Its Veſſels.</note> The Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Liver, by this glandulous ſubſtance or lobes, are mixt after a wonderful manner, as is made good by a friable Liver, as <hi>Gliſſon</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>

Chyle.<note place="margin">The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Liver, Spleen and <hi>Pancreas,</hi> made and deſigned for one and the ſame end.</note> The action of the Liver, Spleen and <hi>Pancreas,</hi> are by moſt Authors allowed to be framed for one end; for they together do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the ferment both of Blood and Chyle; for the preparation of which there is required three ſeveral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and this is not to be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any one or two of them. This, as Flower,<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> being put into warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, mixeth it ſelf with the ferment readily, and by this the more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial and thick parts thereof are diſſolved, and the more ſpirituous parts lying occult and conſopite, are hereby likewiſe attenuated, and thus framed into a whole lump or maſs; and theſe attenuated Spirits being thereupon poured, it becomes light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and eaſier of digeſtion. Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is it neceſſary for the mixing the ferment to the Chyle and venous Blood, whereof the Spirituous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles herein lodging, are attenuated, and thus the whole maſs is made more apt for a <hi>Hematoſis,</hi> and nutrition. The ferment of this Bread alſo (by which we may eaſily find out both the knowledge of the Blood and Chyle) is generally made of ſome quantity
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40826:116"/>
of Flower, to which warm water is added, as alſo ſome ſalt and acidity; and this kept in a warm place, till both the Salt and ſubacid Spirits are by this heat ſomewhat volatiliz'd, and this gets poſſeſſion into the maſs, and ſo doth both dilate and ſeparate the ſame; and thus does by degrees make the whole maſs ſubacid and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative. This being done, a ſmall quantity thereof is ſufficient to leven the whole Loaf; for this ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity entring into the Dough or Paſte, doth both attenuate and divide theſe Particles, and diſſolve the Spirits lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein. And be the ferment what it will, this for certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt be allowed, that it is framed of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acid, ſubſaline and corroſive parts, a moderate heat interpoſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, with ſome volatization and liquefaction; the which ſhould they be either more thick or denſe, the force hereof would not ſo ſuddenly ſhew it ſelf, but require much more time to act the ſame part: If therefore by ſome Sulphureous Particles theſe grow more Spirituous and Volatile, they do ſooner and more readily run into ferment; as we ſee in Ale, the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40826:117"/>
which in the ſpace of half an hour or leſs, doth abſolve: this work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe ſpirituous acid Particles hereby getting freedome, do alſo attain a more penetrating quality, and ſo ſhew a quick demonſtrance of their intents and inclinations, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a more ſpeedy diſſolution of the thicker parts, and ſo force alſo a more ſpeedy ſuſcitation of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſpirits; but a moderate heat is a main agent in this work, for this is the maſter both of the acidity and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the volatization. Thus ſtands it with both the Blood and the Chyle; the which if they be not attenuated before an <hi>Hematoſis,</hi> and prepared by an admixt ferment fit for the ſame, they do not ſufficiently ſpirituize it in the Heart, that is, the Spirits ſo lodged therein not being diſſolved from the more thick and ſerous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein remaining, the Blood hereby doth ſoon become thick and aqueous, and ſo leſs capable for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the Body, making it hereby leſs able to perform its functions: And thus the whole frame of Nature is put out of order, her natural and animal faculties wanting that life and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40826:117"/>
vigour, which gave them courage to proſecute the ſame.<note place="margin">The fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Blood and Chyle made by the Liver, and how this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> This ferment both of Chyle and Blood is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Liver, for whoſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing whereof, the Chyle firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Stomach, is afterwards entertained by the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> where it meets with the Pancreatick Juice as its aſſiſtant; The matter of which the Liver frames this, is the venous Blood ſent from the Gaſtrick and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeraick veins flowing hereinto by the <hi>Porta,</hi> to which there is therein mixt a ſubacid or ſaline <hi>Succus</hi> or Juice, made in the Spleen out of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Blood and Animal Spirits, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the Nerves, the which is carried through the Splenitick branch into the <hi>Porta,</hi> and thence conveyed with the Blood to which it is annexed in the Liver; and thus whilſt it bears a ſharp and corroding quality in it, by the Specifique and Digeſtive virtue of the Liver, both the ſaline and ſubacid Particles lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Blood are both diſſolved and attenuated, and ſo becomes fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentated, and their thinner parts, like the moſt fine and thin water, paſſing the conglobated glandules in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40826:118"/>
the caveous parts of the Liver, and ſo receding from the thicker part of the Blood, are hence diſmiſt by the numerous Lymphatick Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels out of the Liver to various Veins, preparing the venous Blood towards the Heart; for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of which performance, the <hi>Saliva</hi> paſſing by the Mouth, as alſo the ſubſaline and ſubacid <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> collected out of the glandules of the Axillaries, <hi>Inguens,</hi> and other places, as alſo of the Pancreatick Juice out of the Guts, doth ſuſtain the Chyliferous Veſſels, together with the Chyle.<note place="margin">The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> And if any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how theſe ſharp, hot and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Particles do or may ariſe in our body, I ſhall give them this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, They do ariſe out of Sulphur and Salt; the firſt being from Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, but the chief acrimony doth take its ſubſtance from Salt; the which beſides its Sulphurious quality it bears in it, is innate in all our nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triments, for we eat nothing which doth not carry in it a ſaline quality; this Sulphur diſſolves this Salt, and brings it into a fuſion, this being looſned and attenuated, doth by its
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40826:118"/>
acrimony both corrode, enter and diſſolve all parts of our nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo doth fetch out the Spirit lodging in them, whoſe operation is Fermentation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man can be kept alive; and when this is either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated or vitiated, his life is but very troubleſome to him. And that we may trace this Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more happily, we by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Saline inſtinct of nature, which is in all nutriments, do add our help thereto, by putting Salt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the meats which we uſually do eat, making them of a hard ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, hereby giving them both a greater fermentation, and a more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious ferment for their digeſtion; by ſo much the more we love or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a greater ſaltneſs in them, as in Beef, Pork, or the like; becauſe Salt in ſuch is the only cauſe of their eaſie digeſtion; a manifeſt example whereof we have in Herrings, the which being Salt, do eaſily digeſt in the Stomach, but not being ſalt, and much boiled, they are not digeſted therein without difficulty. And thus the true action of the Liver, Spleen,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40826:119"/>
and <hi>Pancreas,</hi> is ſaid to make the ferment; whence follows, that where theſe bowels are well, and do enjoy their proper functions, the whole Blood is excellent good and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and the Body becomes active and brisk; but where they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordred, innumerable diſeaſes do ariſe from an ill ferment of the Blood and Chyle. And hence although the Liver doth not carry the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with us as it did with the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who reckoned it as one of the principal bowels, and the office of Sanguification, yet it wants not the reputation of an uſeful Veſſel, whoſe uſe we cannot well be without, its diſeaſes being dangerous, and the cure thereof not eaſily performed without difficulty.</p>

The true uſe of the Spleen is to make a ſubacid Matter out of the Arterious Blood,<note place="margin">The true uſe of the Spleen.</note> from which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again excocted with ſulphureous Particles in the Liver, in a ſpecifique manner, it there frames a Bilious Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Chyle and Blood,<note place="margin">How the Spleen doth make the ſower Juyce.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo this Acid Liquor herein ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, is not readily explained, we ſhall ſee it thus performed. A ſubſaline Subacid, and ſower Juyce we have already ſhewn, is made out of the Arterious Blood in the Spleen, by the large Splenetick Artery, ſending the ſame vigorouſly into this Bowel; the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40826:124"/>
which by a plentiful affluxion of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits by the Nerves, and alſo by this Bowels own mediate virtue, is inſtantly varied; and that ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit which was formerly ſeen in it, is now obtunded, fixt, and ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and the ſalt and acid Spirit therein remaining, is produced into action; and the ſaline parts being ſomewhat ſeparated do take predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy. And hence is it, that the fervid and ſweetiſh Blood flowing by the Arteries into the Spleen, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a while kept therein, the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Fervour with its ſweetneſs loſe themſelves, and it becomes ſubſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and ſubacid, and ſo marcheth from the Spleen by the Splenical Branch to the Liver. And that this primary matter of Ferment, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Liver, doth firſt come from the Spleen, is thus made good by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment: For take the Spleen of an Ox, Swine, Sheep, or any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and cut it into pieces, and put them into warm water, and put ſome of this warm water, wherein theſe have for ſome ſmall time been laid, and put the ſame to Dough or Paſte, you will ſoon find it dilate the ſame,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40826:124"/>
and frame a Ferment therein, as well as Yeaſt or the like, the which will better declare it ſelf, if you will but add a little Vinegar thereto. We come now towards its concluſion,<note place="margin">How Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of the Spleen do ariſe.</note> where we may make ſome enquiries how diſeaſes do ariſe from the Spleen; if therefore the Spleen be weak, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its ſubacid quality, not being well liquefied, attenuated, or volatiliz'd, but remaining thick, tartareous, and terrene, a large part of the Spleen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accumulated with a plenty of this viſcous Subſtance, giving a great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the Spleens increaſe into a larger bulk; this ſpirit lodging in it, not being timely ſtirr'd up, but boiling in its narrow confines, doth in a great meaſure occaſion its larger diſtention, hereby making it very ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any diſtemper whatſoever.

In the greater end of this Glandule is ſeen a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Cavity, into which many Cavities ariſing from the ſubſtance of the Glandule, do terminate with open mouth, and this Cavity opening its ſelf into the next Vein, is defended with a Valve opening towards the Vein, and ſhut backwards.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40826:133"/>
there is found a certain white, and thick Body, not much irreſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the <hi>Vas Deferens,</hi> furniſhed with no apparent Cavity; or if with any, a very ſmall one, aſcending from the bottom of the Teſticles to the upper part thereof, into the inward part of the albugineous coat into which it is ſtrongly implanted; neither is it only affixed to this coat, but doth perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ſame, and is ſeen to inſert its ſelf into the head of the <hi>Paraſtatae,</hi> to which it ſo cloſely adheres, that it's not thence ſeparable but by inciſion, tied in the lower and middle part of the Membrane by the intervention of Veſſels. <hi>Wharton</hi> in his Book <hi>De Adenograph,</hi> writes, that the ſubſtance of the Teſticles is both glandulous, white, ſoft, looſe, cavernous or ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; the which altho it doth want a manifeſt Cavity, yet it is perviated into a nervous Channel running through its middle, its whole length. But when you have read the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all theſe great Men, you may eaſily ſee how they have walk'd in the dark, as to the ſubſtance of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles: Their Opinions carrying in them, no ſhadow or appearance of

Truth, they writing that the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are glandulous Bodies, they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by creating a ſtrange miſtake, they having in them no reſemblance at all of a glandulous ſubſtance; and he that exactly examines their fabrick and ſubſtance, ſhall eaſily find their errors,<note place="margin">They are made of nothing elſe but of minute Veſſels.</note> for they are made out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a maſs of minute Veſſels framing the Seed; for they are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen unravel'd, and that ſometimes to a good length, the which no glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule can admit or allow: and for the proof hereof <hi>Regnerus de Graaf de Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganis Virorum, fol.</hi> 56 <hi>ejus lib.</hi> he there brings this Obſervation; Take the Veſſels of a large Dormouſe, and you will readily ſee the Veſſels of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles appear tranſparently, white with Seed by the Albugineous coat; the which being laid bare from the aforeſaid coat, if they be thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Baſon full of water, and ſtirred a little about therein, you will ſee each part ſeparate from other, the which if they were not made of the ends of Veſſels, they would not thus admit this ſeparation and diviſion.

                     <p>THE Epididymides are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by Anatomiſts, called <hi>Paraſtatae,</hi> and by <hi>Fallopius</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed long Bodies tied to either end of the <hi>Teſtis</hi>; planted at its head. <hi>Veſalius</hi> doth very acurately deſcribe their Figure,<note place="margin">Various Opinions about their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> and ſo doth <hi>Regnerus de Graaf</hi> in his Book <hi>De Organ.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40826:136"/>
and being cut or divided, you will find it woven out of many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Glandules. To whoſe Opinion both <hi>Bartholine, Veſlingius</hi> and many others do willingly aſſent. And <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> ſeems willingly to erre with them, when he ſays, <hi>lib.</hi> 1.

And altho <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> hath writ the beſt of the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatae,</hi> of any of the former; yet in this Opinion of his, he apparently errs: For whoſoever doth ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the <hi>Epididymis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">It is made of ſeveral flexures.</note> ſhall find, that it is a Body made out of various flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, and that this is evident, its firſt and upper Membrane being laid bare which covers its Body, and tied to the Teſtes, you will find many are fractions and windings, the which may with eaſe be ſeparated each from other by the knife, without any hurt to the Veſſels, and theſe have after this ſeparation, been ſeen drawn out to a ſufficient length; for they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſeen revolved from one ſide
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40826:136"/>

generally allowed a <hi>Gonorrheal</hi> Flux. For Phyſicians and Chyrurgeons do not make any difference between this and the Seminal Flux, ſave only that they do declare the one to be more virulent than the other. And that ſuch a Flux may happen, is proved from Tears and grief, in which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual plenty of Salival Matter, or pituitous Humour is excern'd by the vitiouſneſs of the Glandules. And that alſo a great <hi>Colluvies</hi> of other humours by the illneſs of theſe Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules may hence be excern'd, nothing can contradict or gain-ſay: for the Patient having taken any Medicine, this hath either ſpontaneouſly, or by ſome way or other depoſed the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of theſe ill juices of the whole Body; the which alſo may be allowed to have the ſame property and place in this glandulous Body, eſpecially it being debilitated by Venery, or any other Malignity. For our Humours do keep in our Bodies, like <hi>Theives</hi> in a Priſon, where when they do intend to get free thence, they do not begin their <hi>exit</hi> with the ſtrongeſt parts thereof, by undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, but do ſeize the weakeſt.

Thus ill Humours lodged in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, do not enter the ſtrongeſt parts thereof, but do force their malignity upon thoſe parts which are the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and ſo the more ready to give them entertainment; neither doth Reaſon only, but experience alſo prove, that this glandulous Body may be thus affected.

do very much vary alſo in their Magnitude,<note place="margin">Their Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> for thoſe in the Thigh are by <hi>Wharton</hi> allowed to be Eight, and theſe ſeen very large; the Arm-pits have Three uſually given to them, but theſe are leſſer than the former; thoſe in the Flexures of the Knee and Thigh ſmaller than both the former, and that leſſer than all the reſt, which is planted near the Elbow; their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures alſo are various, ſome being round, others Oval.</p>

                        <hi>Wharton</hi> in his Book <hi>De Glandul. Artuum.</hi> tells us of a great Affinity and Commerce between theſe Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules and the Nerves,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Wharton</hi>'s Opinion of theſe Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules.</note> ſo that he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Nerves do conveigh to, and take from theſe Glandules; for its proper enough to allow the Nerves bringing ſomewhat to them, as by ſending them ſome of their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious juyce; where alſo he writes, that theſe Glandules do not diſcharge themſelves into excretory paſſages, but into the neighbouring Veſſels next to them, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought the only reaſon of their being planted at the greater diviſion of the Veſſels, for the more eaſie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the ſuperfluities of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40826:144"/>
Nerves depoſed into theſe Veſſels, to which they are ſtrongly annext.</p>
                     <p>And that they do alſo carry ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what away from the Nerves, is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, (<hi>vid.</hi>) a certain nutritive juyce, the which being milkt out by a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar attraction of this glandulous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, doth throw forth this mixture of its Lympha into the Lpmphaducts, and by their virtue doth keep the ſame thus received from them, and this their own ſubſtance doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently make good, which is both ſweet and delicate, and does carry a very near Nature with that of the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Juyce.</p>
                     <p>Diſeaſes happening in theſe Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, are either ſimple Tumours, commonly called Buboes, or compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with venereal or peſtilential ſwellings. And theſe Cauſes hereof by <hi>Wharton</hi> are generally reckoned Two, the Firſt being the Blood, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in its circulation, and hence a Tumour ariſeth, from the hindrance of the Bloods impetuous Flux from the Heart by the Arteries, and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe back again out of theſe by the Veins. The Second may originally ariſe from the Nerves, as from their
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40826:144"/>
ſuperfluities which they let fly and ſpend into the Glandules, vitiated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by quantity or quality; now where theſe ſuperfluities do only erre in quantity or quality, as occaſioned by viſcidity, thickneſs, or the like, this occaſions a ſimple ſwelling only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when a venenate or contagious Matter arrives here, it begets a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour like its ſelf, anſwering the ſame Matter of which it is made, be it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther venereal or peſtilential.</p>

                  <p>SInce it is the Mode of the Age not to let any Book look into the World without a Preface, it may well ſeem a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that amongſt the multitude of Books with which the World hath been ſo plentifully ſtockt, ſo little hath hitherto been writ of this Strumous or Kings Evil Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; it evermore having been a Diſeaſe of ancient ſtanding, and
<pb facs="tcp:40826:151"/>
ſo general concern with the Sons and Daughters of Men; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince there is ſcarce any kind of Skill but may be learnt by Art, and brought into the Rules of a Curative Method, for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Advantage of poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed Mortals.</p>
                  <p>It was a Law among the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> That every new Act ſhould be heard with ſilence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe: which cuſtom, as it gave a favourable and reſpective ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to the Actors thereof, and their Endeavours; ſo it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht and compleated the ſame with an inevitable danger of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace for the future, if any lapſe ſhould ſucceed. The truth is, Men of Learning, Reaſon and Experience, and ſuch who have been free from Fumes, have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more encouraged the Induſtrious
<pb facs="tcp:40826:151"/>
Hand: But we live now in ſuch an Age, that an Author muſt as well ſtudy the little Plauſibilities of the People, who are the great and brisk Maſters of Fame, as the value of the Diſcourſe, the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Matter, or the general good of the Deſign, (theſe being very kind and zealous where they affect, and as cruel and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous where they reſolve to contradict) and where Men do once build their Wit upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, the beſt Subject muſt hazard their Teſt, and ſuffer their Cenſure. And this I have evermore obſerved, that never any yet entred the Liſts with an Ignorant Bugbear, but he loſt much by the Encounter.</p>
                  <p>But to leave theſe: That I may ſomewhat relieve the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders patience, I ſhall enter the
<pb facs="tcp:40826:152"/>
Subject Matter of our Diſcourſe, wherein although I may well enough agree with <hi>Columella</hi>'s Opinion, that <hi>Nihil perfectum aut à ſingulari Induſtriâ Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum,</hi> That no Man can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all; yet I hope that Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is not to be blamed that catcheth ſome, although he may miſs others. And becauſe I know there are ſome ſort of Men may think that I live better upon Tranſcription than upon produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing new Matter; yet in this I hope the Crime is not very great, ſo long as the Reader hath it brought home clean. Others I full well know there are, who will readily ſuppoſe that I have borrowed a part of my Treatiſe from others; yet ſince I had it from the common Stock, and have diſtributed the ſame for the
<pb facs="tcp:40826:152"/>
advance of publick good, I would willingly know where lies the Injury.</p>
                  <p>If in this alſo I have ſeem'd to ſtep aſide from the Opinion of the Ancients as touching theſe Strumous Effects and Diſeaſes, I being rather inclined to raiſe a new Pile of Matter for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and Generation, yet I ſuppoſe I am not the firſt which have ſwum againſt the ſtream of their grave Suppoſitions, or gray-headed Thoughts, I evermore having been converſant in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery almoſt from my Cradle, being the ſixth Generation of my own Relations, all eminent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of our Profeſſion, ſome of the latter of which have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary well known for their Parts and Skill by many of the moſt worthy and knowing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb facs="tcp:40826:153"/>
of our Society. I came ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo to the practice thereof in this great City, and have for above Twenty Four Years ſeen the Practick, as well as read the Theorical Part thereof; and this not at Whiles and Intervals, but I had the Eye of the Hoſpital as my firſt and early Gleanings: And ſince I could write Man, the late Wars had my Skill ſhewn on my ſelf as well as many others who were committed to my Charge.</p>
                  <p>But to come nearer our Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Diſcourſe, ſince I have been bleſt by my Dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's Command to attend as one of His Chyrurgeons at all Healings, (although the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt) and have ſeen ſeveral Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands approach his Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence for Eaſe and Cure, I thought it my Duty as well as my Zeal
<pb facs="tcp:40826:153"/>
to ſearch into the Roads and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits of this Evil, which is ſeen thus frequently to viſit the Court. And the only reaſon which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me to this Undertaking, was partly intended to prevent the tedious Journeys of many poor People, who unhappily have undertaken the ſame upon pretence of their being troubled with this Diſeaſe, and partly to ſecure His Majeſty from being cheated of His Gold: The firſt of which is intended and made good in this, the latter demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
                  <p>I have herein therefore (kind Reader) preſented thee with a more plain diſcovery of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, than hither hath as yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the World, and this perform'd with that plain and

eaſie Dreſs and Method, that the meaneſt Capacity may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a ſufficient Judge in the deſcription thereof by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to prevent confuſion.</p>

Mankind are generally ſeen more or leſs tinged therewith) and do keep equal pace with the ſame by Seminal Traduction: Both of which being much altered from their firſt Beings, by getting an acquaintance almoſt with every Diſeaſe, they having a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and common dependance one upon another, bred and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got from a tainted Fermentation in the Blood, and an Ebullition of vitiated Humours, by which a common exchange of Symptoms is kept up and maintained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, according to the Inclinations of ſuch weakly and debilitated Bodies on which they do make their entrance. But leſt, kind Reader, I may be thought tedious in keeping thee too long in the Paſſage, I have this only to ſay, That I have

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S ſome Diſeaſes are nearer of kin to <hi>England</hi> than to other Nations, ſo by the general received Opinion of Phyſitians, they do hence take their Cauſes; their relation to Diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, aſſociating with Diſeaſes which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40826:158"/>
are moſt general and common with them. Thus we frequently ſee a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Conſtitution of Place continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome time amongſt us: or if for ſome ſmall ſeaſon leaving us, and then making its quick returns upon the Sons and Daughters of Men, this in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great meaſure gives being and growth to a Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>And hence is it that divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have their own proper Diſeaſes allowed them,<note place="margin">Divers Countries allowed various Diſeaſes.</note> (proved and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all Ages.) Thus to <hi>Egypt</hi> is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Leproſie as its proper Diſeaſe; <hi>Attica</hi> kept up the Gout; <hi>Hungary</hi> has its particular Fever, Chriſtned by its own name; <hi>Apthae,</hi> or Ulcers of the Mouth and Palate in young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are very frequent in <hi>Syria</hi> Some have laid the firſt appearance of the French Pox upon <hi>Naples,</hi> although it long ere that time dwelt in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and had longer being ere that in the World, as ſhall be ſufficiently made good in this Diſcourſe. <hi>Plica</hi> is generally granted the <hi>Polony</hi> Diſeaſe, and the Scurvy believed to Sail from the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea. <hi>Sphacelus</hi> was firſt thought to ariſe from a cold Country near the Northern Pole, bringing with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40826:158"/>
it a Mortification on the Nervous and Membranous parts. <hi>Carbunculus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an Evil of the Province of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſenſis, and <hi>Bronoochele</hi> is ſo common a Diſtemper in <hi>Bergomy,</hi> that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof do not take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ſame, they living without pain that have it, generally granted to take its Origination from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Liquor they Commonly make uſe of. And whilſt we have thus far tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd, we have only taken a view of the Diſeaſes of other Countries, let us come nearer home, and behold our own Iſland, and here we ſhall find it to bear a part with Diſeaſes and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperiety as well as other Nations; and as <hi>England</hi> had once the Name of an Engliſh Sweat,<note place="margin">Engliſh Diſeaſes.</note> ſo it hath been very fertile in producing Strumaes, or Kings-Evil-Swellings, Jaundies, Rickets, Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Conſumptions, and the like. And without our Bodies had, and ſtill were ſubject to change, we ſhould not find them ſo readily aſſume theſe ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſſions. But Reaſon doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evince the ſame, theſe ariſing either from the Diet therein made uſe of, or ill Habits therein bred, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Temper made by Air, and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40826:159"/>
like. Thus we read the Scab of <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia</hi> did ariſe from their exceſſive Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they commonly feeding upon Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts, which bred this depraved diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in them. The Gowt in <hi>Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> alſo had its being from delicious Food, &amp; their over frequent uſe of Venery. And, that Air may very well be allowed an expert Ingredient in forming Diſeaſes, our own Country can readily confirm, by ſending of their numerous Ofsprings (of this Evil we diſcourſe of) up hither ſo frequently to be healed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>England</hi> very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifique in producing Diſeaſes.</note>For whoſoever examines <hi>England</hi> in its Nature and Conſtitution, ſhall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily find that it is as prolifique in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Diſeaſes, as ſhe is fertile in procuring of Conceptions; and its forty to one, if ſhe gives not as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a Remark of the one, as of the other, ſhe being no more barren in the one, than ſhe is in the other. And hence is it that not only the ſtrong and Vigorous Man, who enjoys the delight and bleſſing of Wealth, but the weak and infirm Perſon does propogate and beget Children, as every day makes good. And that Women alſo who are infirm, and of an ill habit, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymick
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40826:159"/>
Conſtitution, do moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily bear Children, this alſo is as plain. And whoever do conſider theſe both as they ought, may reaſonably allow, that a Child begot and bred from ſuch a Parent, may both eaſily and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily derive a Diſeaſe from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Nature made like ſoft wax, which every one knows doth with eaſe receive every Impreſſion which the Seal gives to it.</p>
                     <p>This Child therefore coming into the World diſtempered from its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, enervated,<note place="margin">Diſeaſes from the Mothers Womb.</note> and every day giving greater and better Signs and Symptomes of its depraved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, what can deny its ready yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any Diſeaſe whatſoever? I would not willingly be here miſtaken, (this not reaching the whole race of Woman-kind) that they themſelves are either all infirm, or that they muſt neceſſarily ſerve the World with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed Off-ſpring. But this I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to aſſert, that where ſuch a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ill conditioned Parents do meet <hi>in Coitu,</hi> and therein and thereby do uſe their endeavours to raiſe a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stock; where ſuch a product is made, their Children are very ſeldome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40826:160"/>
ſeen to carry better metal in them, than they have derived from their Parents; and may as well be allowed to ſhare of their depraved Natures and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, as of their Eſtates and Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.<note place="margin">Several Reaſons to make good the Aſſertion.</note> Several Reaſons alſo might be given for the confirming the ſame; for how oft alſo hath this been found to ariſe from the abuſe of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities cheifly and moſtly in uſe in the Country where theſe diſeaſed People do inhabit? Thus by eating too much Fruit, how many have we ſeen readily ſurfeited? by drinking too much Wine, too many enfeebled with the Palſie and afflicted with the Scuvy and Gout? by living very high, and at eaſe, not uſing much Exerciſe, have ſhewn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the moſt ready Maſters for Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, Debauch, and <hi>Lues?</hi> All which may well enough be allowed to have ſufficient Efficacy in them, to give Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Breath to Diſeaſes, and do moſt readily either <hi>ex toto,</hi> or <hi>ex par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> daily make good the truth hereof, according to the Times, Places, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Tempers, and Conſtitutions of the Agents or Actors thereof.</p>
                     <p>And that this Struma, or Kings-Evil, may well enough alſo be allowed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40826:160"/>
with Pox, Scurvey, Gout, Jaundies, and other Diſeaſes, ſhall be ſufficiently made good by convincing Arguments enough: For if the Pox ſhould perchance keep company there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or ſent, or derived thither, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Contagion begot from Nurſes, or an Hereditary Right of Parents, this makes it quite another Diſeaſe from what we have already been diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of, both in its Nature and Eſſence, which by no means may be allowed to have any commerce therewith: But this by time may alſo be granted to ſuffer a ſufficient change in its form and nature by the ſame, and may be allowed to gain Affinity therewith, and take ſome meaſures of its Praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Indiſpoſition, as ſhall be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently made good in my Diſcourſe of the Cauſes. The Scurvey we ſee alſo gets very near acquaintance with this alſo, and this is either contracted by Chance, or procured by an Hereditary Right in the tender Conſtitution of the young Patient; or collected and gathered out of its ill Regiment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as to its Order of Diet, Air, and the like, all or any of which are power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to promote the ſame: for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40826:161"/>
this has no more relation in Children in theſe Diſeaſes, than it hath in others of a longer continuance; in which, by length of time, the Blood becomes tainted, contracting a greater illneſs, and to this it eaſily yeilds, by reaſon of the Infants a verſion to Motion, and Exerciſe, the which does expoſe, or rather depoſe the Body to a Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick habit; and thus, according to the thick and viſcid humours which the Blood contains in it, ſcattering the ſame about ſome parts of the Body, does force theſe parts which are thus therewith perplexed, to carry the ſame Marks, and bear the ſame Symptomes as it declares and bears in its ſelf.</p>

                        <note place="margin">What <hi>Glandula</hi> is.</note>
                        <hi>Glandula,</hi> which by <hi>Guido</hi> is ſaid to take its name from <hi>Glans,</hi> it very well reſembling a Hailſtone or Kernel, is ſoft, moving and ſeparate from its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent parts, bred generally in the Emunctories. And that which ſhews the difference between this and Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma is this: They being generally made both of one and the ſame Matter, and bordering about the ſame places, the <hi>Strumae</hi> generally living, if not always in the Glandules; and the Humours which feed them being different from others; And herein lies the difference between <hi>Glandula</hi> and <hi>Strumae,</hi> the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40826:169"/>
Matter of the Glandule being more ſubtile and thin, that of the Struma thick and viſcid; and hence <hi>Galen, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Loc. affect.</hi> writes, that when this thin and ſubtile Matter does incraſſate and grow viſcid, it readily forms <hi>Strumae</hi>; and this is alſo defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Aeginetta</hi> and <hi>Avicen.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indurate Glandules are more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Fleſh, ſo that although without much difficulty they may be known from the ſame, by the touch, yet it will not eaſily appear, how theſe <hi>Strumae</hi> may be known from theſe Glands acting the ſame parts in its Neighbouring Fleſh. <hi>Avicen</hi> tells us, theſe are generally found in the Hands and Feet, as alſo in many other Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts of the Body, calling them Glandulous Apoſtems bred from Flegm. <hi>Valeſcus</hi> ſays they are ſeen larger or ſmaller according to their greater or leſſer quantity of Matter or Humour which gives them their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, allowed ſometimes to grow from a ſmall Pea or Cizer, to the largeneſs of a Melon, as <hi>Rhaſis</hi> writes he once ſaw. <hi>Glandula</hi> therefore is an Excreſcence framed by indurate Flegm, and <hi>Strumae</hi> differs from this becauſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40826:170"/>
they are conjunct, and many planted together, neither are they vexatious, or accompanied with much pain, <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulae</hi> being fewer in number, and not ſo eaſily traduced from one place to another.</p>

                        <hi>Nodus</hi> or <hi>Ganglion</hi> is alſo bred from a hard, thick, and viſcid Flegm, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening moſtly in the Nervous and Tendinous parts, but chiefly in the Head and Joynts, on the Hands and Feet.

                        <hi>Scleropthalmia,</hi> or <hi>Lippitudo,</hi> being ſometimes ſeen an Inflammation of the whole Eye, but chiefly in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, with redneſs, hardneſs, pain and Rheum, ariſing either from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſcon, extraordinary heat, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſight, and a plentiful defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Humours happening in young Children, and others who are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a weak ſight, may in a great meaſure be allowed to bear a part with Strumous or Kings-Evil-Swellings, the Glandules in the Eye being Agents powerful enough to beget the ſame;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40826:170"/>
and as a general remark hereof, I have generally obſerved, That when ever this Humour hath met with any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, it generally and uſually cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates a hardneſs and ſwelling of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lip; and this I preſume alſo is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ſome ſmall paſſages deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Lachrymal Glandule ſent thither. And when-ever ſuch who have thus been troubled have been toucht by the King, theſe Swellings have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry readily abated, and ſome immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon the ſame have been ſeen to vaniſh. Beſides this <hi>Scleropthalmia,</hi> there is alſo another kind of <hi>Lippitudo,</hi> and this by the Greeks is called <hi>Pſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropthalmia,</hi> or <hi>Lippitudo Pruriginoſa,</hi> ariſing from ſalt ſharp Rheum falling down into the Eye, and both theſe ſometimes are ſeen to meet together, the laſt increaſing the pain of the other.</p>

Or if you pleaſe,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40826:171"/>
it is a large round Tumour, generated from a Flegmatick Matter, ſometimes ſeen to take up the greateſt part of the Neck and Throat, wherein variety of Matter hath been found ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that of <hi>Atheroma,</hi> ſometimes that of <hi>Steatoma,</hi> or <hi>Meliceris,</hi> ſome Countries affording more plentiful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples hereof than others. Thus the Inhabitants of <hi>Piedmont</hi> are thought to take this Diſeaſe ſo common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, from the Liquor of which they make their uſual Drink, being for the moſt part as is reported made of melted Snow. And this by moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors is taken for another Companion of the <hi>Evil</hi>; and if you do accurately diſſect the Anterior part of the Neck from the right ſide to the left, you will aſſuredly find firſt the Wind-pipe whence this <hi>Bronchochele</hi> takes its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and upon this you'll meet very large Glandules, quartering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Larynx, which makes up theſe exuberant Swellings, commonly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gozza</hi> in the Country it's ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in.

                        <hi>Atheroma, Steatoma, Meliceris,</hi> are generally allowed Flegmatical Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and Excreſcencies; and they do differ from other Tumours by their being lodged in ſeveral Bags or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, and do every of them carry in them diverſity of Matter, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hapning in the Membranous parts, and in thoſe places which are different diſtance from Muſcles; and every of theſe do take their Names from the variety of Matter which they do carry with them.</p>

                           </gap>. Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Strumaes.</note>I Begin this with the Antecedent Cauſes hereof; and here we ſhall obſerve, That ſuch Diſeaſes which may be allowed a near relation and affinity with this, may alſo be granted to agree with the Eſſence thereof; as thoſe which are of a cold intemperiety, or moiſt, or relating to both: for this temper is the proper Baſis of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, by which it produces ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerous off-ſpring of little ſoft Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, the which afterwards are ſeen to run into Concretion, and at length becomes incraſſate and indurate; whereby we may alſo preſume to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce this Obſervation, That vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diſeaſes do not ſo eaſily and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily change into mild Diſtempers, as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40826:175"/>
theſe do, or may do into Diſeaſes which are more forcible. Thus if a cold and dry intemperiety ſhould happen in a Child, it would from its own temper ſpeedily beget a change as to a cold and moiſt diſtemperiety; and hence is it that cold Digeſtions are made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and hence Crudities and crude Homours do ſucced, the which in this tender age of Infancy and Youth may well admit of a moiſt intemperiety to keep company with them, every Man knowing that the Sperm of Creatures, by how much it is more moiſt than the Creatures which are thereby produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by ſo much alſo is it more ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, the Fleſh of younger Creatures being more ſoft and ſlippery than that of Old age, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Another cauſe hereof alſo may be referred to an inequality of Nutriment;<note place="margin">2. This alſo may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to inequality and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment.</note> not an inequality of Nutriment aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to it, for when we ſee one part thus exceſſively increaſe, and another wants its due and decent quantity, ther's a neceſſity of allowing a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and inequality of Nutriment, having ſome prae-exiſtency in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, where one part borrows and gets from another, whilſt the other loſes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40826:176"/>
and leſſens in its mediocrity and true proportion: for uneven Swellings do declare ſufficiently the Liberal Nouriſhment in their tumefied parts, which the extenuated parts do as readily ſhew in their loſs and want thereof. But ſeeing this inequality of Nutriment is a depraved action, and does appear and ſhew its ſelf as a cauſe of the Organical Vices, we hence ought not to allow theſe Organical Vices the firſt Radix of this Diſeaſe, whilſt we ſhew agility and activity of Body to heat and warm, and the coldneſs and denſity thereof declaring themſelves by their tardineſs and ſlowneſs. Take this therefore as a plain Demonſtration thereof, when and where we ſee theſe helps which do excite, increaſe and cheriſh heat in the outward parts, does in a plentiful meaſure add to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Matter or Humour contained in theſe Swellings; the which being caſt together in a Lump, hath power ſufficient to diſcard and baniſh this Diſeaſe, whereas a cold Diſtemper in its own natural Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution being firſt herewith affected, may very well be granted the primary cauſe and eſſence of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:40826:176"/>The Spirits alſo being defective in the affected parts,<note place="margin">3. Another cauſe from defect of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> do alſo declare and demonſtrate an evident ſign of their Lubricity; and as their flaccidneſs doth comprehend a looſeneſs, ſo they do ariſe both from one and the ſame cauſe; and as theſe two do include a certain vacuity or emptineſs, its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that from the Stupefaction of the inherent Spirits, the plenty and vigour thereof being augmented, the lank or flaccid member or part is eaſily hereby rendred turgid and tumefied.</p>
                     <p>Provident Nature as a Guard to this hath not excited Vital Spirits in the Arterial Blood for their own ſake on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither are they diſtributed to the parts, and joyn'd to them only for their own advantage, but rather that they might enliven and brisk up the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Conſtitution of the ſolid parts; and hereby actuate, invigorate, and promote their Faculties. Hence we ſee all Creatures, the more liberally they do feed, the fatter and more fleſhy they grow, unleſs ſome impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment does intervene: but if the due quantity of Nutriment be ſubſtracted, they grow lean and extenuated; when therefore any one part hath a more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40826:177"/>
diſproportion thereof than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, reaſon muſt allow this to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and grow into a Bulk, whilſt the other becomes as it were ſtarved, being robb'd and ſtript of its juſt and even meaſures. For when the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, retentive, and digeſtive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do recede from their firſt Vigour, and do unduly and ineffectually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute their Offices and Functions, theſe may well enough be allowed alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther primary cauſe of this Diſeaſe; and for clearing hereof, where looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſoftneſs, and lubricity of parts, as I have already mentioned, does appear, the expulſive Faculty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with becomes vitiated, and the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is too eaſie and diſſipative, and the Circulation of the Blood becomes ſlippery, the retentive Faculty alſo through weakneſs of parts loſes its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Vigour; and where the Expences do exceed the Incomes, there muſt conſequently follow a decay of the publick Stock, the Exportation being found to exceed the Importation.</p>

                     <p>Theſe two following may appear as good cauſes of this Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">5. Two other cauſes.</note> as when the Matter out of which theſe Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are made being thick and viſcid, having a contumacy therewith adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and here the beſt of skill may be ſhewn to eradicate theſe Strumaes, and extirpate both them and their Radix, by taking hence a new ſupply of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour fitted for its purpoſe, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining here ſome Aſhes (as <hi>Galen</hi> hath it ſpeaking of Fevers, Agues, and the like) which are apt enough to blow up a new Fire, being already warm, corrupting the next Humours, and inflaming them, whence he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth doth ſucceed the Renovations or Returns of Diſeaſes which are daily ſeen to bear. A ſecond may be the <hi>Folliculus,</hi> or Bag to which every of theſe little Tumours are ſo cloſe adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that they are ſcarce thence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible: whence it happens, that the Matter thus left in them, although
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40826:178"/>
partly diſcharged, yet the remaining part behind does give a very great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the increaſe to a new Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Strumaes, bred from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Humour: and were this Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the Induſtry of Chyrurgery totally extirpated, yet there may be ſome Ramifications left behind like Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments which may give being to a freſh growth and increment of the ſame.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>But here may ariſe a Queſtion, How it happens that ſometimes theſe Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes ſhall be ſeen lodged in Bags, and other-whiles they ſhall be found free thereof?</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Reſp.</note>To which I ſhall give this Anſwer; Theſe <hi>Folliculi,</hi> or little Bags, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than ſome ſmall Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Veficles, in which theſe various Humours are lodged, and that theſe Membranes (as <hi>Hipp.</hi> hath it in <hi>Libr. de Carnibus</hi>) are made of the dryer part of the Blood, and that part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which is moſt glutinous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed by cold, (he alſo writing that all Membranes are made from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their Origination) while therefore this glutinous Matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is congealed by cold, we ſhall find
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40826:178"/>
it covered with a thin Membrane, as we ſee the Blood is in Diſſection of Humane Bodies, or in Phlebotomy, where the thinner part of the Blood flies out briskly, being hot and moiſt, the which when it is cold, we ſhall find the ſame as it were covered over with a thin Membranous Vail. Thus <hi>Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi> in which the Matter is void of viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſity and glutinoſity, although it may in time ſomewhat thicken and congeal, yet it does not make any of this Membranous Coat: But on the contrary, when as there is found a glutinous part therein, and when the Matter therein lodged is concreted, as Hail is out of Snow by Coagulation, this kind of <hi>Cutis</hi> is made about it as its proper Tegument, the which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly takes to its ſelf, and in it does frame and form its Incraſſation.</p>
                     <p>Tumours alſo which do obſcurely and by degrees fall into the Nervous parts by the Membranes from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of the head into the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,<note place="margin">6.

beget a virulent and fierce Ulcer, which we commonly call <hi>Struma Carcinoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>todes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Another cauſe is Congeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</note>Another efficient cauſe hereof alſo may be allowed Congeſtion of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the Glandules; Now the cauſe of Congeſtion is Fluxion of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a place, and attraction, expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or concited Motion in Humours is the cauſe of Fluxion, the cauſe of all which is the Congeſtion of the ſame in the Body. Again, ill Diet, looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weakneſs of parts, as I have already ſufficiently made good, are great inſtrumental occaſions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; and hence is it that young Children are ſo frequently ſeen trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with thoſe Swellings, and moſt ſubject to theſe Diſeaſes, they neither uſing any regular method of Diet, much abounding with Crudities, and coacervated with many Excrements by want of Exerciſe.</p>

And the truth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40826:179"/>
is, whether Flegm be taken for the colder and moyſter part of the Blood, or the Whayiſh part thereof, or for Spattle, or for the Mucous Subſtance which paſſeth from the Noſtrils, or Jaws, or for the Pancreatick Juyce, take it for which you will, if this be long continued and contained in the Body, it hath a direct reference to this diſeaſe, and may well enough be allowed the cauſe thereof: for as it is cold and moyſt, ſo it is ſlow and thick, benumming the parts, being but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Spirituous, and affected with an Internal Lubricity; all which does evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrate this as a primary eſſence of the ſame. Wherefore upon a ſuperfluous Accumulation of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, managing a production of this affect, it in juſtice ought to be allowed a proper cauſe, and primary Agent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

this Strumous Diſeaſe as to its Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditarineſs from Parents to Children; wherein, that we may fully ſatisfie the World, we ſhall make this good by comparing Diſeaſes which are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from thoſe which are ſo improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called: wherein alſo the Parents faults are to be laid open in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as giving being thereto. Next we ſhall ſhew the Cauſes of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, being ſo incident to Children: wherein we are to take notice of the five non-natural things in their uſe, as to the Air, Meat and Drink, Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reſt, Sleeping and Waking; of the other five things praeternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally caſt out and retained, and why this Diſeaſe happens more frequently in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> than in any other part of the World; and the reaſon of its natural inclination to them; and as a concluſion to the whole, I ſhall make good, That the POX and SCURVY are very great Clubbers towards its advance and growth, eſpecially in this our Age, where Debauch is ſo frequent, and Venery become the common Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot of the Times.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:40826:180"/>We begin with the firſt,<note place="margin">8. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Diſeaſe be Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</note> of which I ſhall preſume to offer, That before we ſhall or can ſatisfie this point ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt make good theſe two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of an Hereditary Diſeaſe; the one properly ſo called, the other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſo termed. That which is to be allowed properly ſo, is ever ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be pre-exiſtant in both, or one of the Parents, and from thence derived to the Succeſſors; whereas an improper Diſeaſe ſo called hath not the ſame kind of pre-exiſtence in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Parents: yet the ſame fault preceeds which imprints the like in the Children, which thence ſo readily fall into this improperly Hereditary Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Again, A proper Hereditary Diſeaſe is two-fold, either in Conformation,<note place="margin">An Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe two-fold.</note> as a lame Father begetting a lame Child, or a blind or deaf Parent acting in its like, or in the Similary Conſtitution, as when a Gouty, or Scurvy, or Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Parent begets the like Children. An improper Diſeaſe ſo called, may alſo likewiſe appear in Conformation, or Similary Conſtitution: In Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, when neither of the Parents are blind or lame, yet theſe have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40826:181"/>
a blind or lame Child, by the very fault of Formation. And in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2+ letters">

                        </gap>ary Conſtitution alſo there may lodge an Hereditary Diſeaſe ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called, as when a Melancholy or intemperate Parent begets a Gouty Child, or a Strumous Brat, although the Parent never himſelf was ever troubled with either of them. And this we have apparently ſeen, that although neither of the Parents were in their Infancy or Childhood afflicted with this Strumous or Evil Diſeaſe, yet Symptomes thereof have ſuddenly ſhewn themſelves, and their diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereto in their Infants and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; eſpecially in ſuch Parents who before Coition were evilly diſpoſed by vitioſity of Body, or errour of Life, having enough in them to tranſmit and tranſplant the relation thereof to their iſſue: but of this more by and by, made good by Arguments preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent enough.</p>
                     <p>Again, Children however they may borrow ill diſpoſitions from their Parents, as we frequently find it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, which may produce the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in them; yet they are ſeldom therewith troubled before they be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40826:182"/>
born; and when at any time they ſhew themſelves therewith perplext, their effects are both violent and turbulent; and for proof hereof we do affirm, (as worthy Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> does in another caſe) That this Diſeaſe does conſiſt chiefly in a cold Diſtemper of the firſt affected parts, with an inequality an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next thereto. And this inequal cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſame parts is of ſo great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Diſeaſe, and that alſo in relation to the inequality its ſelf, that it does much advance the inequal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the Vital Blood to the parts thus affected. But in the Womb this inequality of Nutriment is much amended by an equal heat, the Womb equally in each ſide embracing and cheriſhing the Body of the Embryo, and hereby drives away a great part of this Diſeaſe, or at leaſt does much hinder its invaſion to it.</p>
                     <p>We come next to give ſome account of the Parents cauſe of this Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">10. Cauſes on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſide for beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Diſeaſe.</note> as being neareſt in kin to them; and here may the faults of their Sperm enter as a great Agent thereof in relation to the Generation of the Embryo, others ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reference to the Embryo ready conceived, and carried in the Womb.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40826:183"/>
The faults of the firſt proceed either from the Man or the Woman, or from the whole Body, or ſome parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of deſigned by Nature for Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faults de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the whole Body.</note>The Parents faults depending upon the whole Body, muſt neceſſarily be allowed to have a powerful influence in the Child, tranſmitting ſuch Matter to the Seed in its Generation, as may improperly be thought fit to have abode in thoſe parts deſigned for this Office. And when we come to reckon up theſe parts, we ſhall find them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to four Claſſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Four Claſſes hereof.</note>The firſt containing in it a cold and moiſt diſtemper of the Matter whereof the Seed is generated, and this is bred from a cold and moiſt diſtemper of the Parents, from whence unto which we alſo may refer a predominancy of ill Juyces, eſpecially that which is moiſt and flegmatick. To this alſo may be referred the French Pox, Scurvy, Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Rickets, and the like, in all which affects the Blood is polluted with filthy Excrementitious Humours, corrupt Exulcerations, and the like; all which are not eaſily to be changed into a laudable and fruitful Sperm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:40826:183"/>The ſecond ſhews the ſlenderneſs and paucity of Natural Spirits, which ſhould be generated in good Seed; a good Seed never iſſuing from ſuch a kind of Matter; and the Cauſes which haſtens this impure Matter to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerative parts, are the extenuated Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Parents, waſted or conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either by abſtinence, or ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Evacuation of Hepatical Flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or Chronical Diſeaſes, all which are powerful enough to ſpend the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Moiſture, to create an indigeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the parts from an imperfect and defective Concoction: And ſince ſuch a conſiderable part of the Diſeaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the paucity of Natural Spirits, it cannot otherwiſe be, but the iſſue which thence proceeds, and is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by ſuch a crude and almoſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritleſs Seed, ſhould be tainted with ſuch a Natural Propenſion to this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the which is afterwards deduced into act.</p>
                     <p>A third ſhews the Stupor, or Dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Matter tranſmitted to the Generative parts, whereof the Seed is framed and produced; and hence is it that Phyſitians do produce theſe cauſes of Diſeaſes, when they allow
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40826:184"/>
the Blood and Humours being either too fluid, or moving diſorderly, or that ſometimes it is found unapt for motion, being leſs fluxile, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active to anſwer expectation. But now as to Parents in this Strumous or Scrophulated concern, wherein as in a Glaſs the Childs ſoft, looſe, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate Conſtitution, and its weak Diſpoſition, or (as I may better ſay) its Indiſpoſition to exerciſe, and then examine its great intemperiety of Diet and Epicuriſm, the two great products of Crudities and Flatulencies, where meeting with an eaſie and ſedentary life, ſtript from perplexities, anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or vexations, as well as exerciſes, ſeldom or never accuſtomed to labour, care or danger, theſe being the never-failing Companions of peace, eaſe, and tranquility; all which does moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate a lazineſs and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in parts. And whereas the Blood in its Circulation and paſſages through theſe parts cannot readily paſs thorow without borrowing ſomewhat of their nature and acquaintance, as well as cognizance of their temper, it muſt neceſſarily therefore bear a part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and carry ſome ſhare thereof to the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40826:184"/>
Generative parts; and I hope where ſuch Influences are derived in the Seed, it ſhall not need or require much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prove, that that Child who takes its Origination from ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, muſt with it alſo take ſome of their Nature therewith, or at leaſt ſome proportions conformable to this ſtupidity; and that this proportion after birth, when the aforeſaid preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is leſſened and taken away of its equal cheriſhing whilſt it was in the Womb; this may as readily be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into act; and ſince this ſtupidity, as I have already ſhewn, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as a part of the primary eſſence of this Scrophulous Diſeaſe, there muſt conſequently follow ſome vitiated principles, which may lurk in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ready to create and ſtamp the like effect derivative from one or both of the Parents.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ſhews a vitious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if any ſuch there be of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who themſelves in their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood were thus affected: for theſe do properly indeed imprint a <hi>Continuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> thereof, and tranſmit the ſame to their ſucceſſive Generations. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in our Diſcourſe hitherto the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40826:185"/>
fault of the Parents may well enough be referred to any of theſe Claſſes, or all of them, let this ſuffice,</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal parts allowed proper Agents of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note>And come we now to a nearer En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry as touching their Genital parts, and oft-times we ſhall ſee theſe the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faults or framers of this Diſeaſe, they ſometimes ſuffering a cold and moiſt intemperiety in them; and when ever an over-plenty of moiſture does enter theſe parts, it doth create a looſeneſs and weakneſs therein, wherein and whereby the Seed thus ejected becomes either no way fertile, or if ſo, it proves fruitful for Diſeaſes. Again, we find theſe parts frequently affected and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with Gonorrhaea's, French Pox, and the like, where the Seed thus thrown forth is either putrid, or not ſufficiently elaborated, or no ways ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing a firm or ſound Embryo.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40826:185"/>
and diſpoſeth the ſame without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to their Progeny or Stock; and this as readily receives the true effects thereof. And having traced thus far in our intended deſign, by opening the very Womb, to ſearch out the firſt cauſe of this Diſeaſe from Parents, by examining their prolifique Seed, the great Production both of Patient and Diſeaſe, we proceed now in a more gradual manner, and open the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fault, Man alone not being the great Inſtrument hereof: And here we may begin with the time of her bearing this Embryo. Now where there happens a cold and moiſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the Womb it ſelf, this may with eaſe I hope be allowed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the ſame to the Embryo which is kept in it by contact, or where cold and moiſt Juyces do here arrive, theſe converted by Excrementitious and corrupt Humours, in ſtead of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Aliment or Nutriment, pray what may hinder a cold and moiſt imperfect digeſtion, not being timely concern'd, and ſo ſent and tranſmitted with the Mothers Blood for the Nutriment of the Embryo? And if a cold and moiſt intemperiety with this Matter does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40826:186"/>
a Woman with Child after her Conception, no queſtion but this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Nutriment which nouriſhed and cheriſhed the Seeds, or the Diſeaſes, may eaſily be allowed tranſmiſſion and diſpenſation to the Embryo. But hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto we have been diſcourſing of the Embryo whilſt it was framing, and dwelt in its Mothers Womb; now let us look upon it as it came into the World, and examine and trace its way of living, and getting this Diſeaſe of the Evil which our Diſcourſe hath chiefly aimed at, and this alſo comes under the Names of <hi>Its Cauſes.</hi>

Cauſes of this Diſeaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Children.</note>Our ſubject Matter therefore now is to ſhew the Child as it appears in the World; where we may offer, That thoſe Children which are prone to this Strumous Diſeaſe from their Nativity, are eaſily therewith affected: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others free from diſtemperiety do not ſo readily fall thereinto, but upon more powerful Cauſes, and yet theſe Cauſes muſt have ſomewhat of affinity therewith, and do only differ in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>And here a Queſtion may be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Whether Contagion may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted amongſt the number of Cauſes of this Diſeaſe.</p>

                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:40826:186"/>Indeed by its Circuits and Travels about the World, whereby it hath made it ſelf ſo well known and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Sons of Men, and diſperſt it ſelf through many Countries, any one at firſt view might think it carried a Contagion with it:<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> But he who more cloſely looks into it, and its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will find it far otherwiſe; for all Diſeaſes conſpire to change, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate thoſe Bodies which are neareſt to themſelves, &amp; yet this is not enough to make them be call'd contagious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: For to frame a contagious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as <hi>Sennertus</hi> well obſerves, is to create a certain Seminal Fermentation of its ſelf, the which ſecretly getting abode in our Bodies, may by degrees introduce a Diſeaſe of the like Species into our Bodies. But in this, here's no ſuch Fermentation ever ſeen or found: for the firſt beginning of this Diſeaſe, (as I have already ſufficiently made appear) does ariſe from a cold and moiſt diſtemper, where, not meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſufficient inherent Spirit to invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate it, and this endeavours an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation in any parts of the Body, they do not only attempt, but enter the ſame with or by open violence:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40826:187"/>
For we have ſeen Children much of an age, brought up in the ſame Houſe, whereof one or two perhaps have been troubled with this Strumous Diſeaſe, whilſt we apparently find others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no whit concerned therewith; and therefore if any Contagion went along therewith, or this were catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſome people do fancy, this could no ways thus happen.</p>
                     <p>And if we examine this Diſeaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, we ſhall find that the five non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural things in their uſe may be well allowed advancers hereof; and this was my next Task to make good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Aſſertion.<note place="margin">13. Air a main cauſe of this Diſeaſe.</note> Air there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may well enough be allowed a great Promoter and Procurer of theſe Strumous Diſeaſes, as ſhall more appear when we come to ſpeak of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations as well as our own. A cold and moiſt Air therefore doth very much contribute to the begetting this Diſeaſe: for ſeeing it generally ſeiſeth and enters the Circumferential parts, before it gets being in the fenced Bowels, it directly imprints in them this inequal and tumefying diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety. And whoever further traceth this Diſeaſe in its progreſs, ſhall find
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40826:187"/>
that places near the Sea and Mariſh Grounds, where Rains moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do fall upon, and fed with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Springs, are very fertile and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends to this Diſeaſe, theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a more or leſs looſeneſs in the parts, and making the Circulation of the Blood too ſlippery; and hence is it that Chyrurgeons are never ſeen to apply any cold or moiſt Medicine to theſe Strumous Swellings.</p>
                     <p>As touching Meat and Drink alſo,<note place="margin">14. Meat and Drink another cauſe hereof.</note> whatſoever Diet is moiſt and cold, viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous and obſtructing does manifeſtly nouriſh and cheriſh this Diſeaſe, as Fiſh, Cheeſe, Curds, and the like plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fed on: Feeding too liberally alſo is a great advancer of this Diſeaſe, by choaking the heat, and thereby accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating many raw and crude Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
                     <p>And for Motion and Reſt,<note place="margin">15.

cheriſhed, whence ſteals in this cold diſtemper, accompanied with its Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious and ſuperfluous moiſtures, which ought to have been thrown forth by due tranſportation. And here it looſens and ſoftens the parts where it enters, the Pulſe hence and herein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſtupid, the Blood alſo waxing ſlow, and leſs in quantity, and more ſlippery, the Vitals leſſening of their Vigour, growing weak, all which do wonderfully evince the ſame an effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious cauſe of this Diſeaſe.</p>

                        <note place="margin">17. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe.</note>All our former cauſes may alſo in a great meaſure be reduced to this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: for whatſoever is contained in the Body, and praeternaturally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, as it is praeternatural, it requires ablation, and may ſo far be allowed to be thrown forth nevertheleſs of its being praeternaturally retained. And Nature hath provided ſo many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ways of Excretion, or throwing forth into the Body, that ſcarce any Humour can be produced by altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40826:188"/>
which does not relate to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretive or excretive faculty of ſome Bowels, or ſome other parts appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for its evacuation. Thus the whole Maſs of Blood being any ways prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally altered or infected with ſome Humour, the peccant Matter which cannot be overcome by altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is quickly exterminated by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, made from ſome part or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, unleſs therewith the expulſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty thereof be ſome way or other obſtructed.</p>
                     <p>We come next to ſhew why old Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not ſo ſubject to this Strumous Diſeaſe as Youth;<note place="margin">19. Why Old Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not ſo ſubject to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe as Youth.</note> and here we may take in Children from a year or two, to ten and upwards: then we take and make the difference between Young Men and Old, by calling the firſt <hi>Juniors,</hi> and naming the latter <hi>Seniors.</hi> And upon examination here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſhall find, that younger Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are of a colder temper than el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, every day adding heat to their temperament even to Mans eſtate. And here it is thought to ſtand at a ſtay; and when it arrives at Old Age, here it is ſeen to decline daily, and leſſen. And ſeeing younger Children
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40826:189"/>
are more cold, no wonder if they be thus ſubject to cold Diſeaſes: And this makes the difference between Youth and Old Age, the one being ſo fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Nature in temper, the other being robb'd and ſtript thereof by their continual expence of Spirits, which gave Man thoſe warm ſparks which formerly did both enliven and invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his Faculties and Functions. As young Children therefore are more cold, ſo alſo are they more moiſt than elder; for the heat of the temperament is advanced from the time of the birth, even to Mans eſtate. Young Children alſo, becauſe of their tenderneſs of parts, are much prone to diſſipation, and colliquation of the inherent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and therefore by conſequence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leſſer and ſmaller cauſes they are the more ready Subjects and Objects of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Again, Their compoſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of parts makes them more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to diſeaſes, being form'd like young Twigs forc'd to yield to every blaſt of wind, they wanting that ſtrength and confirmation which Old Age en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys. Again, young Childrens Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes are not to be named in the hour
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40826:189"/>
with thoſe of elder Age, who enjoy both a greater and larger degree of heat, which both nouriſhes and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes them; and ſo this cold and moiſt Diſtemper is ſeen with more eaſe to be got looſe from them. And as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to the whole hereof as to their Nature and Temper, we ſhall ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more find younger Children as they are leſs capable to maintain the ground of this Diſeaſe, ſo alſo are they moſt ready to comply therewith, they not in their own Nature, Temper, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, being either able to reſiſt it, or defend themſelves when it once ſeizeth them.</p>
                     <p>We come now to ſhew ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why this Strumous Diſeaſe is known to be ſo frequent with us in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and the like,<note place="margin">20.

a <hi>Calenture</hi> under the Torrid Zone; and <hi>Sphacelus</hi> near the Northern Poles by extremity of cold, with many others which I have named at the beginning of this Treatiſe. A new and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Diſeaſe is that which is brought into a Country by ſome common cauſe, and this is threefold, this ariſing either from faults of the Country prevailing over the health of its Inhabitants, or by ſome innovation or alteration hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to the Country it ſelf, or ſome diſcongruity between the place, and the complexion of the Natives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As to the firſt, it poſſibly may be granted, that the ſtrong and firm Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of its firſt Inhabitants might pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully reſiſt the unwholſome Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Country, and yet the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity afterwards may ſuffer a change therein both in Complexion and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo made the Subjects of a common Diſeaſe. Thus <hi>Poland</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained both the <hi>Plica</hi> and the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> which are both common Diſeaſes to the <hi>Samaritans, Polanders,</hi> and its Neighbouring parts; and yet theſe are thought no old Diſeaſes. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond may happen by Innovations in Countries, or Inundations of Waters, or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40826:190"/>
ſome Malign Aſpect, or bad Influence of the Stars. Thoſe places alſo are moſtly the occaſions of Diſeaſes which have power enough in them to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant and form a Diſeaſe, being quite of another temper and nature from that place wherein they formerly inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; and this is very oft ſeen the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Diſeaſes more prevalent than others. Thus <hi>Ireland</hi> is known to be a fruitful place for producing the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, or Bloody Flux,<note place="margin">

And ſince a cold and moiſt Diſtemper is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of this Strumous Diſeaſe, pray what can or may hinder its raging thus amongſt us, more than in other hot Countries? And as a cold and moiſt Diſtemper is a common part of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this Diſeaſe, and yet not ſo much as that every cold and moiſt Diſtemper does produce the Evil, ſo we find <hi>England</hi> more readily diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Bodies of its Inhabitants here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to than any dryer Regions whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Again, Both ſtrong and weak Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are both very fertile in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and not over ſubject to Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Now where infirm Parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

And although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in this following Part I have and ſhall recede from the common Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ancients; yet I preſume I am not the firſt that have ſwum againſt the vulgar ſtream thereof. And this makes me fall upon the two eminent Diſeaſes of our Times, where if we examine their Nature, Exiſtency, and Origination, we ſhall find them of longer continuance than our late Writers have been pleaſed to allow them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:40826:192"/>I begin with the Pox,<note place="margin">23. The French Pox no new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was formerly warmly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Naples,</hi> and had a plentiful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> yet it had being in the World long before this, as Hiſtory teſtifies.</p>
                     <p>The Scurvy alſo,<note place="margin">24. The Scurvy proved a Diſeaſe of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</note> although by ſome reckoned a Diſeaſe of late date, yet we ſhall prove this to be of longer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt the Sons of Men. And who-ever looks into the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall find it more than once by its proper Name mentioned there: What may we think of the firſt, when we read in <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.2. <hi>When a Man ſhall have a Riſing in his Skin, a Scab or bright Spot,</hi> or rather as it is in the Margent, <hi>a Swelling, then he ſhall be brought to</hi> Aaron <hi>the Prieſt, and to the Sons of the Prieſts.</hi> In this next you will meet them both together, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.20. where it is written, <hi>That no Man ſhall offer Bread to his God that is either crook-backt, or dwarf, or that hath a blemiſh in his Eyes, or be Scurvy, or ſcabbed, or his Stones broken.</hi> And in the 23 Chapter of the ſame <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> Verſ. 22. you meet all theſe three together, where we read that <hi>neither blind, or broken, or maimed, or

                     <p>And for a more ready clearing up of which, becauſe I well know that theſe Scabs here mentioned will be commonly taken as the marks of the Leproſie, I ſhall next take the whole a pieces by examining the near affinity and acquaintance there is between them both in their Nature and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">What the French Pox is.</note>The French Pox therefore is a prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural diſpoſition, by which the Body is ſenſibly hurt in its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diſordered in its Functions: And Philoſophy allows that ſo many ways as the Body is hurt by diſtemper praeternaturally, and ſo hindring its action, ſo many kind of Diſeaſes it eaſily aſſumes. And this explains its ſelf with all imaginable eaſe to ſuch as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40826:193"/>
underſtand the natural action thereof, which is diſcovered by Complexion, Compoſition, and common unity of Body: for in this Diſeaſe, as well as in the <hi>Struma,</hi> many parts of the Body are extenuated, whilſt others gain greater bulk thereby, as alſo thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and theſe not only Similar, but Organick parts. Whence we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conclude, that this is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitional Sickneſs; and this we do thus make good, the firſt kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitional Nature we calling Plaſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or formal: for the better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of which there is required a good Figure, and a convenient Tone, accompanied with a due Aſperity, and decent Lenity. Now if any Member falls from hence, and gains a new qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it frames a Diſeaſe in form, and hence we take both its ſigns and cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance. And that the Members are made groſs by this Diſeaſe, is apparent by the Puſtles and Puſtulous <hi>Cutis,</hi> the Face oft-times ſeen ſwell'd, and the Body appearing Satyrick. Juſt as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> mentions of the Leproſie, where he writes that they are of that near kin each to other, that they are ſcarce to be diſtinguiſht by their marks or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40826:194"/>
ſymptoms: for in the one, ſo in the other are many Puſtles found in the <hi>Cutis,</hi> and theſe ariſing from abundance of black Melancholy, throwing it ſelf outwards; of which kind alſo is the Leproſie; and in our days where we ſhall ſee the Pox moſt common and frequent, we ſhall as readily perceive the ſame, ſometimes their Botches ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing white, ſometimes red, with a kind of Livid colour admixt, both which do only repreſent the matter of which they are made, being framed either of Melancholy Blood, Aduſt Choler, or Viſcid Flegm. And <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> is of my Opinion, when as it grows populous, he writes it to be allowed an <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi>; and in his Book <hi>de Atra Bile,</hi> he ſays there are many Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in this Diſeaſe without Fever, thickning, drying, and cruſting up the <hi>Cutis.</hi> And whereas the Blood of pale Women does generally look pale, ſo ſuch as are black have a more Grumous and Melancholy Blood go along with them in their Conſtitution. The Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of theſe Puſtles alſo does make well for the knowing of their cauſe; and whoever deſires further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge herein, let him but examine

Thus when an ill Scorbutick Ferment comes any way into the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40826:195"/>
Liquor of the Blood, and turns it into an Acid Ichorous and Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſtate; this will corrupt the whole Maſs of Blood: and this he further affirms, that the main cauſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid ſtate of this Blood ariſeth from the abatement of its Sulphur and Spirit, the which he confirms by comparing it with good Wine, which ſoon turns Acid upon its Sulphurous part, being ſtript from its Saline by Evaporation or otherwiſe; and ſo that Salt which was formerly Volatile, becomes now fixt and Acid, which is the true cauſe of its thus turning into Vinegar, which is made good by putting Vinegar to a Candles Flame, and you'll not ſee it burn, it being robb'd of its Sulphur, and its Winey Spirit extinct, and the more this Sulphurous Matter and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is loſt, the nearer it is drawn from its true Body and Subſtance.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I given you a ſhort and general Diſcourſe of the Scurvy alſo, of both which I may well enough offer, although our Region was not the firſt Miſtreſs which they courted, nor the Engliſh the firſt Man that they greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet if I miſtake not, we are here as well acquainted with theſe two Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40826:195"/>
in our days, as any other Nation or Country whatſoever; and ſince both of them have found the way to <hi>London,</hi> they have given ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques of their cloſe affinity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and we have received the Faults as well as Faſhions of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations.</p>
                     <p>Now that the Pox hath a very near affinity with this Strumous Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">How both agree with the Evil.</note> is hence eaſily made good, by ſending forth of its Venereal Venome into the Glandules, there tumefying them; and as other Symptomes by which we may know its Complication herewith, we ſhall find it either from the Parent or Nurſe which were firſt infected; and thus therefore if Ulcers in the Head or Face, Mouth or Noſtrils, or eminent Puſtles, or cruſty Tumours do hence ariſe, not giving way to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Medicines; if hard or Nody Tumours keep company herewith, or carry a rottenneſs of Bones in the Head, Feet, Thighs or Legs, or any other parts; if Nocturnal Pains go along with the reſt; if Inguinal Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes infeſt the Glandules with viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Matter, or keep them tumefied by Venereal Poyſon, all theſe may be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40826:196"/>
accounted apparent Signs and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of the Pox, as well as of the Evil.</p>
                     <p>If the Scurvy be herewith compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, frequent looſeneſs attends the Scrophulated Patient, with difficulty of breathing, many Athritick pains go along with this Evil, they have a more frequent and inequal Pulſe, and frequent Palpitations of their Hearts. And where we meet Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes untoward and unlucky, this gives us no ſlender ſuſpition of ſome ill lurking inwards, eſpecially where they meet with a curted Neck, a ſhort and narrow Forehead, compreſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and large Mandibles. Beſides the former, we ſhall find the French Pox and Scurvy both of them ſo ſtrangely altered from their firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that we ſee them rather daily advance in their number, than in their nature, and almoſt creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acquaintance with every Diſeaſe as well as the Evil, and in ſome meaſure do bear their Colours, and deſcribe their Deſcriptions and Symptomes, and are ſeen as often preſented to the King under the diſguiſe of the Kings-Evil, as if they were really nothing elſe, they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40826:196"/>
getting that familiarity and common dependance upon one another, that no mean Artiſt may pretend to be a true Judge between them: for as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance of Dyet, and Luxurious Debauch does as well procure a tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fermentation, as an Ebullition of ill and vitiated Humours, by which a common intercourſe and exchange of Symptoms is kept up and maintained; ſo when the Evil hath got either a Pocky or Scorbutick Ferment going along with it, bred from a vitious Habit of Body, this may as readily be granted to be a ſharer of the whole; for theſe two Ferments do put on other Formalities, whether they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed joyntly or ſeparately, and do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe themſelves under the Habits of ſeveral Diſeaſes, according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of ſuch weakly Bodies on which they do make their entrance, they ſometimes appearing like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they march in the common road, but when theſe Ferments do propagate themſelves, they ſeldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like branches of ſuch a ſtock, but being tinctur'd in the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Body, they do aſſume ſuch a ſhape of Diſtempers as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40826:197"/>
is able to afford and allow them. And whoever reads <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus Prax. Hiſtor. Cap. de Morbo Gallico,</hi> will find that he ſaith, the Pox is an Univerſal Evil, and may be well enough complicated with any other Diſtemper: for Diſtempers do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with unite either through likelineſs of matter, or ſome other the like viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Humour. And thus I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have in ſome meaſure made good my Aſſertion of the Pox and the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy's being Clubbers to this Strumous Diſeaſe, or Scrophulated Evil, by their affording this Diſeaſe a taſte of their tainted Ferments, and a vitiated tincture of their vitious and depraved Humours, by which they creep into its acquaintance.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. The proper Signs of <hi>Strumaes,</hi> or Kings-Evil-Swellings.</head>
                     <p>OF what great concern an inequal Nouriſhment of Parts in this is, we have in our laſt Chapter very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully diſcourſed: This preſents you with the Signs of Strumaes, which gives the faireſt view and figure of the Parts thus inequally diſcovered: where we ſhall meet with a greater fulneſs in the lively Complexion of the Face, being compared with the other parts of the Body; and yet this more apparent in ſome perſons than in others, this Diſeaſe lying ſometimes more obſcure before its publick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and as it were unperceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and therefore this may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned as one of the Signs, which is a greater fulneſs of Face, it being and appearing thus, whilſt it is as it were
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40826:198"/>
in the Embryo, and arrived at no great matter of growth, or hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much ſubſtance or matter to give it a greater being and bulk.</p>
                     <p>This again having got ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance amongſt the Glands, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects them, and advanceth into growth, it is moſt commonly ſeen to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Maſtoideal Muſcle of the Neck, and this requires time to give it ſuch a progreſs, and where ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is made thereof, this infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly denotes the abode of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                     <p>When we ſhall perceive knotty Swellings and Excreſcences in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in other parts of the Body, as in the Eyes, Noſe, upper Lips, Breaſts, Axillaries, Inguens, and the like, all which do declare their acquaintance therewith, where theſe ever happen, they give us a Pathognomonical Sign of its Habitation, and without all doubt do ſet forth the moſt clear ſpecies of its reſidence.</p>
                     <p>Where-ever outward knotty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences do apparenly ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, theſe may juſtly give ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of inward Glands in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; but if they do only inwardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40826:198"/>
no certain Sign can be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated thereof.</p>
                     <p>Such as have ſhort Necks, low and narrow Foreheads, compreſt Temples, and wide Mandibles, are moſtly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe Strumatical Tumours and Excreſcences, and this is the general received Opinion of the beſt Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Chirurgeons, as being a moſt ſignal Obſervation of the Evil or Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Affect.</p>
                     <p>Again, other of theſe Strumaes are taken from their ſight whereſoever they do appear, and in what part of the Body ſoever they do ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they appear either round or longiſh, much of the ſame colour of the <hi>Cutis</hi> under which they lay, for the moſt part hard and without pain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rogerius</hi> gives us this method of them, and thus diſtinguiſheth them, by taking Leaves of Ground Ivy and Cedar, the which being beaten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and applied to the Scrophulated parts, if the Tumours ſhall hereupon be ſeen to vaniſh and diſappear in three days, its a perfect ſign they are <hi>Glandulae,</hi> not <hi>Strumae:</hi> but if the Medicine thus applied does occaſion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40826:199"/>
pain in the part, ſo that it becomes both inflamed and painful upon this Application, this perfectly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates them to be Strumaes.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Bergomy</hi> where Scrophulous and Strumous Tumours are very frequent in both Sexes, you will meet them very large planted in the fore-part of the Neck, being commonly moveable, ſoft, and pendulous, the which as they do bring no great matter of pain along with them, nor hinder any action in Humane Body, ſo they give them their acquaintance and company all their lives; and this Diſeaſe is reported to be in their Nation bred from their Water which they commonly drink, this having in it as ſtrange an Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to the Glandules and Glandulous parts, as <hi>Cantharides</hi> have to the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and Bladder; the People in thoſe parts neither giving themſelves or their Chirurgeons trouble of ever being concerned therewith.</p>
                     <p>Again, theſe <hi>Strumae</hi> are ſeen to differ from <hi>Glandulae</hi> in their Colour and Conſtitution, the one made from Melancholy, the other begot by Flegm, every of which does declare their Frame and Conſtitution by the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Strumae</hi> do not enter one Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule only, but many, wherein they ſhew both their hardneſs and inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: for herein the Pox ſhews its ſelf acquainted therewith, but does ſtill keep this difference, that the Pox ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeizeth more than one, its vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate matter poſſeſſing the ſame, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a hardneſs and Tumour therein, and yet this not to be accounted a Struma; and therefore for making of <hi>Strumae,</hi> there muſt be more Glandules than one concerned; for theſe are ſeen to ſpread themſelves like a Vine, ſwelling, increaſing, and growing hard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:40826:200"/>
                        <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith he hath found Strumaes in Womens Breaſts, as alſo in Mens Breaſts; and reaſon it ſelf cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this Aſſertion of his, becauſe theſe are Adenous parts; and he further tells us, that in the year 1537. in the month of <hi>April,</hi> he ſaw a Woman Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulated all over her Body, even to her Groins.</p>
                     <p>Scrophulous Swellings are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bred in thoſe parts, where crude and viſcid Dyet is made uſe of, as well as in the Air that is of a cold and moiſt temper, where alſo the Water of the place is viſcous or muddy.</p>
                     <p>Again, the Signs of Strumaes are to be divided three ways, as conſidering their Quality, Quantity and Eſſence. As to their Quantity, and hence they gaining their largeneſs; as to their Quality, this ſhewing their Nature and Temper; as to their Eſſence, this demonſtrating their Origination and being.</p>
                     <p>The multiplicity of Strumaes, and their overſpreading the Body, and the extraneous heats which go along with them, do frequently ſhew that they are the product of interiour Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulaes, as <hi>Arnoldus</hi> obſerves. And
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40826:200"/>
hence he further writes, that we may gueſs at the inward Swellings by the outward numerouſneſs of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberancies; and that theſe do more frequently happen and fall upon Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than upon Old Men, by reaſon of their guloſity and rarities of Bodies, the which are not ſo in Elder People.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Henricus</hi> ſaith, That thoſe Perſons who have a curted Forehead, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt Temples, and large Mandibles, are moſt ſubject to theſe Swellings; for in ſuch Perſons this Scrophulated matter is more readily derived and conveyed into the Neck.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> writes, That Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes and ſick People do give much trouble to the Phyſitian and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon; becauſe let them be treated as well as poſſibly Art can, and Nature likewiſe ſerve them, yet they will fly out again; and although the beſt methods imaginable are uſed for their extirpation, yet we uſually find them relapſe, and gain new birth again.</p>
                     <p>Strumaes, if they be benign, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a moderate hardneſs, and free from pain, inflammation, and Ulcer, being purely bred from Flegm, are
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40826:201"/>
proper ſigns of its good Nature: but when this Flegm gets any commerce with Aduſt Choler, this makes it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign, and here wait on it pain, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, a hot pulſe and trouble, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing inequal to touch, and vexed with every application of Medicine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ambroſe Farrey</hi> ſays Strumaes are Aedematous Tumours ariſing in the Glandules, bred from a cold, thick, and viſcid Flegm, having in it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Melancholy adjoyned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aqua Pendens</hi> tells us, Strumaes are no Strumaes, but rather ought to be called Cancerous, they not being made from Flegm, and Melancholy only, but having an <hi>Atra bilis</hi> or Aduſt Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler joyned therewith, which gives them this Cancerous Nature and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, <hi>Joannes Colle Bellonenſis</hi> gives this as a ſign of Strumaes, which ought to be underſtood as well in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi> as in <hi>Specie,</hi> conſidering the place, the form, and the effect thereof; It being a hard Tumour of the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, ſometimes equal, otherwhiles inequal; ſometimes appearing few in

number, ſometimes many; if white and indolent, they ariſe from Flegm; if blewiſh or black, from Melancholy; if hard, exquiſite, painful and red, from Aduſt Choler; this laſt ſign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending a great part of moſt of the reſt. Thus much of its Signs.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>EVery Phyſician and Chirurgeon, according to the Rules of Art, ought diligently and prudently to contemplate on the Prognoſtick Signs of a Diſeaſe, that he may the better be inſtructed in foreſeeing the ſeveral events thereof; and here both <hi>Diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſis</hi> as well as <hi>Prognoſis</hi> is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be underſtood, the one ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent eſtate, containing and declaring the Origination thereof; the other foretelling its growth, increaſe and conſummation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, this Diſeaſe being properly Natural, is moſt dangerous, and do ſeldom, if ever, end in health, without new eruptions: For <hi>Zaculus Luſitanus</hi> writes, that there is a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Excretion in the Seed, or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40826:202"/>
occult quality infecting the ſame, and inherent in it, which imprints the like Tincture in the Off-ſpring; for the diſeaſed defects of the Parents are derived by force of the Seed to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, by which they do perfectly and exactly reſemble their Behaviour, Gate, Countenance and Conſtitution. And becauſe ſome are very apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this paſſage, and aſſert, If this were true, it would continue thus for ever; whereas others have as plainly ſeen, that it hath miſt ſome of the ſame Stock, and hath only fixt upon others of the ſame Family, the firſt Generation having ſometimes been ſeen wholly to miſs and eſcape it, and this has given none of its appearance perhaps till it came to the Grandchildren of the ſame Family.</p>
                     <p>Small and Superficial Strumaes are more healthful in Children, and more eaſie of Cure, than thoſe that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign, and more deeply fixed.</p>
                     <p>The more early the invaſion of Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes is after the Birth, the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it carries with it; for hereby the Spirits are both robbed, and much weakned; we commonly alſo ſeeing as they grow up, they are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40826:203"/>
therewith, and are better able, and more eaſily cured than younger Children.</p>
                     <p>That Struma which is bred natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from Parents is harder of cure, than that which is contracted by the meer errour of the Nurſe or Mother.</p>
                     <p>Again, That Strumous effect which the Infant brings with him from his Mothers Womb, is of harder cure, and proves more deſperate than that which is occaſioned by Air, Viſcous Diet, or any other outward Effect.</p>
                     <p>The greater the Heads of Infants and Children are, the ſhorter their Necks, the more compreſt Temples they have, and the wider Mandibles, the more ſubject theſe are to Strumous Diſeaſes than others.</p>
                     <p>All thoſe who do attain to the conſiſtence of this Diſeaſe, do eſcape the danger thereof, being carefully examined, unleſs by chance ſome other Diſeaſe be therewith adjoyned, or does afterwards come after it, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Patient with a higher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:40826:203"/>If the French Pox therefore be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with this Strumous Diſeaſe, be it either Hereditary, or contracted by Infection, it makes it almoſt inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of remedy.</p>
                     <p>If the Scurvy alſo be herewith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, this does very much retard the cure, although not ſo much as the French Pox.</p>
                     <p>All Strumatical Tumours, either Internal or External, do not very much ſuſpend the hopes of Cure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though otherwiſe of themſelves they are not eaſily ſubdued in this tender age: for the external parts being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with pain, do waſte the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; but the internal much more, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they do invade the noble parts with their weight and bulk.</p>
                     <p>Every Struma again is not to be overcome with eaſe, but ſuch as do happen in Children are better mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, than thoſe which happen in old People.</p>
                     <p>Where-ever they happen without pain, they are not eaſily to be extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated.</p>

                        <hi>Avicen</hi> declares that thoſe who are acquainted with Struma, or Scrophula in the Head or Neck, are generally ſeen to be of moiſt Complexions.</p>
                     <p>He alſo writes the places wherein they do generally breed, are the Neck, Armpits, Inguens, and the like, where the Fleſhes are ſoft, but their empty ſpaces are fill'd up with Veſſels.</p>

                        <hi>Avicen</hi> writes that <hi>Strumae</hi> which have pain, and a hot Apoſtem ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to them, with hot matter tending to Suppuration, are thereby eaſily cured.</p>
                     <p>Purging Potions, and Diuretick Decoctions, and Specifique Alterant Drinks, do all much conduce to the curing of theſe Tumours.</p>

                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:40826:204"/>Children by reaſon of their rarity of Body, and intemperance in Dyet, are ſeen frequently troubled with this Diſeaſe: Old Men on the contrary are ſeldom ſeen troubled therewith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Strumae</hi> at beſt are troubleſome to the Chyrurgeon, for they never give way to Medicine readily; and ſhould they be cured either by Medicine or Inſtrument, yet they are ſeen to break out afreſh before a perfect extirpation be made.</p>
                     <p>Inciſion of theſe Abſceſſes in as much as may be is to be avoided, eſpecially happening about the Belly, Neck, and Commiſſures, by reaſon of their affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the Veins, Nerves and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, leſt hereby ſuch an Hemorrhagy be raiſed by inadvertency, that is not eaſily to be allayed by the greateſt of skill.</p>

                     <p>THis Curative Method is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally guided by the two Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of Reaſon and Experience,<note place="margin">Reaſon &amp; Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the ground of practice.</note> both which together do comprehend the greateſt skill of the Artiſt: For by Experience was founded the Hiſtory of Diſeaſes, the Succeſs of Medicine, and the Judgment of its events: all which being weighed in the balance of Approbation, are ſeen either to get or loſe in their Weight and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon therefore is the Judge of Truth; for hereby Man is ſeen to comprehend the deſign, to give rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the ſame, to apprehend, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or divide it. And for the

proof hereof, he muſt needs be thought unkind to Nature in burthening her with the name of a Propoſition, who is not himſelf apprehenſive of its Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, or ignorant of its propoſe on which its ſeen to conſiſt; every indication or intention ſeeming to call in Mans reaſon to conſent as to the Curative part, as well as his Opinion and Judgment. Now as every Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation does declare ſomewhat which is to be done, or ſo intended from whence this Term it ſelf doth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſe; the thing therefore which chiefly relates to our preſent diſcourſe is, either a Modical or Chyrurgical Act, or both; the firſt making good the deſign, the ſecond proſecuting the ſame, he himſelf being the Agent, and his Medicine the Curative Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40826:206"/>
and therefore no part of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to maintain Impoſſibilities.</p>

                     <p>Another was the due Obſervation of the Tone of the parts, and their due Harmony, the which being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoft, looſe, or flaccid, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do require the favour of ſome warming and ſtrengthening Medicines, having ſomewhat of aſtriction added to them.</p>

                     <p>And although theſe common cauſes do not immediately ſeem to attain to the production of the Eſſence of a Diſeaſe, yet in reſpect that they do hinder Nature in her deſigns, they may be allowed retarders of the cure, and therefore their removal is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

                     <p>All Conſtitutions therefore in this Strumous Affect being for the moſt part weak and infirm, which may well be allowed from the Conſideration of the Patients tender Age and Nature, do therefore require both a general and particular regard as to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>In this Strumous Affect therefore the election of the beſt Nouriſhers, and ſuch as are eaſie of digeſtion, are neareſt of kin, and moſt agreeable to the Age and Nature of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>Benign and gentle Evacuations therefore well corrected, are herein both very proper and uſeful, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, and may be given in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate quantity, and in juſt and due time, all violent Purges being here utterly forbidden.

of theſe, theſe three Rules are to be obſerved, that the Stomack be not herewith nauſeated by any ingrateful taſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which may beget an abhorrence in the Patient of all Medicine for the future, nor load it with too great a quantity, nor yet ſo made as it may be immediately thrown up again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors to be ſeverally treated.</note>The Humours which alſo are thus to be prepared, are either Flegmatick, and ſo cold and moiſt, which ought to be tempered with heat; thick, and ſo requiring attenuation; or viſcous, and ſo expect inciſion, or Cholerick, and thus being burning and corroſive, are to be allayed by lenifying and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating Medicines; or Melancholy, and this either feculent or terene, and this to be rendred fluxile. Now where theſe, or any of them do enter in any part of the Body, they do require ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Medicines, and Remedies proper for the diſcharging of any of theſe Humours.</p>
                     <p>Again, the matter of the Diſeaſe it ſelf being prepared, and the paſſages opened,<note place="margin">The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be expurged.</note> we are next to ſtudy the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of this peccant Matter; and this bears in it a double relation, as both looking towards the Humours,

alſo the parts to which they flow, or are ſeen to lodge. And here we muſt alſo (as I have already obſerved) give every Humour its juſt way of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and always direct our Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks at the Eſſence of the Diſeaſe, as its moſt proper white or mark, which in its own nature ought to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hot and dry, diſpelling all Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefaction of parts, ſtrengthning the ſoftneſs and looſneſs thereof, cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and nouriſhing the vigour and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the inward parts, and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforting the outward, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways having a regard both to the age, ſtrength and complexion of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.

                     </p>
                     <p>And now for our General Rules here to be obſerved as touching the Patients Inſtitution of Life, we ought
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40826:210"/>
here (as I have already well noted) to frame our Medicines according to the Temperament, Strength and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution with whom we are or ſhall be concerned: for we are not to deal with Children as we do with Men and Women, who have arrived at a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter age and ſtrength, who are as much different in theſe, as they are in their age, complexion and abode. Great care therefore is to be had to the flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent matter which is already got into the parts from whence it is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and that the Flux it ſelf may be abated, and ſtopt in its motion.</p>
                     <p>And he whoſoever intends to deal with Children as to purging Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, muſt alſo have the purile age both in his thoughts and view, and conſider that it is but infirm, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requires a moſt kind, gentle, and eaſie method; this rather alſo to be oft repeated &amp; reiterated, than adviſing ſtronger Medicines, and more forcible Remedies, they very oft bringing more hurt than good along with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Bleeding.</note>As for Bleeding, neither the Age or Diſtempers of Strumous Patients
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40826:210"/>
do very well admit thereof, unleſs this Strumous Affect does or ſhall happen in ſuch who are able to bear it, and then it may be allowed as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary as any other Remedy whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Various are the Opinions amongſt Authors concerning Emeticks in this Strumous Diſeaſe;<note place="margin">Vomits.</note> 
                        <hi>Aetius</hi> is ſeen to commend and highly approve of them, others altogether do condemn them; to which later Opinion I preſume to make my ſelf a true Devoter: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the antecedent matter may or might hereby be ſomewhat leſſened by Emeticks, yet the impact matter is but a very little hereby abated, but rather more acerbated. Beſides, it's certain that the Head is much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted by Vomits, the Jugular Veins hereupon tumefying, and the whole healed by being brought into conſent therewith; and this was the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which made <hi>Hippocrates</hi> cry ſo on't, or exclaim againſt Vomits in all Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects either of the Eyes or Ears.</p>

Long Sleeps are to be ſhunned, Fear, Sorrow, Sadneſs, Melancholy, and every thing that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40826:211"/>
may create, produce or force a plenty of Humours to the Head and its parts, are utterly forbid.</p>

In his Broaths may be boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either Mint, Balm, Marjoram, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rygolds, or Pennyroyal; let him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all things which may be thought either to engender Crudities, Rheumatiſms, as ſuperfluous Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, too much Eating, and the like; let him drink Wine but in a ſmall quantity, or mix the ſame with Small-Beer or Water.

                  <p>SInce our Minds do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hunt after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Novelties, and ſcarce reſt ſatisfied with the preſent ſtate of things, (ſuch being the boundleſs limits of our Conceptions): Man is generally ſeen to meaſure the length of his Age by the
<pb facs="tcp:40826:226"/>
fathom of his Knowledge: Judgment being as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident over all his Actions, whil'ſt Senſe and Motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the two Interpreters of his will and pleaſure. As Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory therefore is ever allow'd the moſt proper direction for the Life of Man, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted the only Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which can enrich his Mind: The one better teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by example than Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; the other making ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Diſcoveries of Mens Lives and Actions. If the actions therefore of Princes may be granted the ſubjects of Hiſtory, ſure this of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:40826:226"/>
ought to take place, where it is not only to be recorded as Hiſtory barely, but deſerves regiſtring amongſt the moſt Divine Gifts, and Eminent Qualifications of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick Vertues.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the beſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of which Worthies, I ſhall preſume to preſent this Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vertue of our Dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns, in which action he appears as the Soul to the Body; and is ſeen to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his three Nations in Health as well as Peace: as Nature does rule in her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire with three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, for as her Animal, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb facs="tcp:40826:227"/>
and Natural Faculties are kept up and preſerved by their Nerves, Arteries and Veins, by which Mankind ſhews both his Motion, Senſe and Life: So whoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the daily Bleſsings our three Kingdoms do receive from his Sacred Majeſty, muſt neceſſarily be convinced, That as the animal Faculties lodge in his Royal Head, which gives that ſenſe to every af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair we proſecute, ſo his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hands are ſweetned with that ſacred Salutiferous gift of Healing, which both ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the Body Politick, and keeps up the Denizens and
<pb facs="tcp:40826:227"/>
Subjects thereof in vigor and courage.</p>
                  <p>And if we can give Faith to the vertues of inanimate Elements and Vegetables, as Stones, Herbs, Plants, and the like, what ſhall we allow the Living Stones of the Church, our Kings and Queens, its Nurſing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers, where we ſhall find both their hands moſt admirably qualified? In whoſe right Hands are the Nerves and Sinews of the Church and State, which gives them that decent Form, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Motion, and admirable Diſcipline we ſee them enjoy.
<pb facs="tcp:40826:228"/>
In their Left, we ſee the life and ſpirit of the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſupported and preſerved by their miraculous Gifts of Healing: and as the firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd them the Defenders of the Faith, the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd them the Preſervers of their People: The one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the Royal Emblems of their ſacred Piety and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: The other engraving the Remarks of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Clemency and Charity. The former, making the whole World pay Veneration and Reverence to our <hi>Engliſh Kings,</hi> and their Royal Names: The later, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
<pb facs="tcp:40826:228"/>
with wonder the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Riches of their Divine Natures: Their Royal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er manifeſting their Majeſty, and this ſoveraign Gift of Healing, their higher Rays of Divinity. And as one does ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Order and Peace, which gives life and being to Devotion; ſo the other brings health and eaſe, which keeps up Society, and makes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication flouriſh in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>As Nature therefore, the Miſtreſs of <hi>Society,</hi> does e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore prefer publick before private Good, and Man was born for converſation ſake;
<pb facs="tcp:40826:229"/>
ſo by the ſtream of Duty, I have preſumed to Elect your Lordſhip as the beſt Patron of this Treatiſe, Entituled, <hi>The Royal Gift of Healing.</hi> Where if Congruity makes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication bear correſpondence with Deſign, I'm ſure I am very happy in my choice, if Your Lordſhip will grant me the freedom of my Election; Where although I begin the ſhew of my Devotion with a mean <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> wrought up by an unskilful hand, yet I hope your Honor will not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my good-will by the value of the Preſent, but by the brightneſs of your own Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb facs="tcp:40826:229"/>
who are a great Maſter of Excellent Learning, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life, and Pious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. <hi>My Lord,</hi> The eminent and well-deſerved place your Honor enjoys in the Kings preſence, as well as in his Princely and Royal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, being <hi>Clerk to the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of his Sacred Majeſty,</hi> do's not only place you near your <hi>Soveraign,</hi> but puts you at his Right hand, by whoſe clean hands the Royal Gold which is uſed at our daily <hi>Healings,</hi> is preſented to our <hi>Sacred Majeſty.</hi> And this makes you as great a Judge as Obſerver of theſe his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

and miraculous Cures ſo frequently made good by his <hi>Sacred Hands</hi>: the which as they have been infinite in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo ought they to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted miraculous in their Nature.

                  <p>IN this I have given thee the firſt on-ſet, who might'ſt otherwiſe well wonder to ſee me ſo ſuddenly again in Print; (the truth is, I cannot well blame thee) Perhaps thou, like ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, may'ſt think me vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious; as alſo ſuppoſe that I pretend to know, that I may be publickly known in Writing. But aſſure thy ſelf, the Vanity of the Writer ſhall never poiſon the Nation with his Winter En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, nor give Mankind the trouble of a Fly with any more of his Summer Undertakings.</p>
                  <p>The Matter hereof, however mean it is, I call it my own. And although others may refreſh
<pb facs="tcp:40826:232"/>
themſelves with the ſweet Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Rhethorick, or pleaſe their fancies with the gaiety of its ſmell; or ſatisfie their humors with the beautiful Tapeſtry of its Figure or make: yet who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall lend this a few hours Reading, will find this mean Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to be the Iſſue of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborate Endeavor. Wherein although I have ſhewn my laſt Follies to the Worlds diverſion, if my Zeal, or publick Reſpect made me ſo apparently idle, I hope the Ingenuous will with better Candor pardon my raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And although it cannot be denyed that I have been as great a Scribler in Chirurgery, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any of my Time and Age, yet I have this as my Guard, I never yet Writ or Publiſh'd any thing, which did not bear my own Name: Neither was this
<pb facs="tcp:40826:232"/>
ever purchas'd by the eaſy terms of Familiarity, but forc'd from me by the ſtrong hand of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, or deſired by the venerable and juſt demand of ſuch Nobility as were able to give Life to its intended deſign, and ſhelter to the work it ſelf: I being never tickled hereto by the itch of Printing, or puft up with the publick deſire of Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but readily yielding a generous obeyſance to univerſal converſation, as well as ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Friends, who put me upon this work in my own def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; not miſerably attackt, or drawn thereto by the blind guids of Self-intereſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fame, the two general Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots of our preſent age.</p>
                  <p>The Truth is, in all my Books which ever yet ſaw Print, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the happineſs of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:40826:233"/>
by another Mans Eye, or turning over my Books by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mans Hand, but without any kind of aſſiſtance (but what I purchas'd by no mean endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from Authority) of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Phyſical help, or Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical co-operation; ſo that this may ſerve as a Salve to cure the Men of little Thoughts, as touching others. And amongſt the reſt, they may, if they will give themſelves the trouble to Read all the Books I have writ, by the ſtile of the Penning, as well as the method of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with eaſe, ſee that they all had but one Father, which any honeſt Man, void of prejudice, may convince himſelf of, and every one elſe, but he that wears Spectacles, which are made of contradictory metal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40826:233"/>And ſince my skill for ſome late years paſt, hath been que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, as touching this Diſeaſe; and my Judgment thereof hath met with many uncivil rubb by ſome of our Profeſſion (altho I cann't ſay many) my thoughts thereof might well have cool'd, and my reſolutions chill'd, had I not with new ſupply taken up freſh courage to out-brave the ſpleen and malice of theſe deſperate Opponents. But ſince I am obliged to give the world ſome reaſon for this my ſo ready appearance again in Print, to make good my former Aſſertion, <hi>Neceſſe eſt ut aliquid haereat</hi>; and indeed to prevent any longer looking aſquint, and leſſen the mean Thoughts I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd, I like a good natur'd Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, have taken this task upon me, to demonſtrate the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatical
<pb facs="tcp:40826:234"/>
appearances of the <hi>EVIL,</hi> that every Man may ſee I am not afraid to appear for the Evil Cauſe, that is, to ſhew all the apparent Cauſes of the <hi>Evil</hi> in publick, more fully than hath hitherto been ſhewn; And ſince I have taken this publick reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am as ready to defend the ſame, if I be at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after forc'd thereto by ſuch Men of our Profeſſion, who muſt be better ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe I would not have this Treatiſe of the <hi>Evil</hi> march abroad without having its parts firſt viewed and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and ſee what ſhape it bears in the World, as well as Figure, that it may not appear monſtrous evil, I have preſumed the Favour as well as the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to get my Brother Mr. <hi>James Molins,</hi> one of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties

Chyrurgeons, a Man of as great Reaſon and Judgment, as of Art and Experience to look into, and trace this Diſcourſe all over in its Three Parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſigned it ſhould ſee the Light, whoſe approbation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with the moſt eminent of the Colledge, and His Majeſties Phyſicians; as alſo His chief Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, the which they have allowed by their Hands thereto, hath given Reputation enough to its Paſsport, and is a ſufficient Defence againſt all ſuch who may be ſo evilly minded to Treat it ill upon the account of the Author only. But leſt I may be thought to write with Vinegar inſtead of Ink, I come now to the ſubject Matter it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40826:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>But now to the Matter it ſelf. When this <hi>Royal Gift of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> doth preſent its ſelf: I hope its Name bearing Majeſty in its firſt Front, continued and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by many Ages of Princes, will be Argument enough to bleſs my Undertaking, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire your calm acceptance.</p>
                  <p>And as our Bleſſed Saviour, his Apoſtles, and good Men in former Ages enjoyed a Healing Vertue, as well as other Divine Qualifications, of Propheſying, caſting out Devils, and the like; all which were tranſmitted to their Succeſſors: So whoſoever conſiders both the length as well as the ſtrength of their Divine Qualifications, may likewiſe ſee, that as they abated in their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo they leſſened in their nature and appearance. And
<pb facs="tcp:40826:235"/>
ſince I have tract the ſteps of moſt Fathers, and ſhewn the Gifts of the Apoſtles and Holy Men, I ſhall begin next with <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, the firſt Undertaker of this great Work in our Engliſh Nation, known from the others of his Name by the Sacred Titles of Saint and Confeſſor. Of whom ſo much hath already been writ, and that with no ſparing Pen of his praiſe, that I ſhould but appear idle to live long on it. In the Diſcourſe I begin with him as the firſt Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of <hi>Struma's,</hi> by Contact or Impoſition of Hands. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign thereof, preſents you with the Origination of the Gift of Healing proved, in which are delineated both its definition, and its efficient Cauſe, Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allow'd the Inſtrument, and his Maker the Agent. In it are
<pb facs="tcp:40826:236"/>
ſhewn various Cures performed by diverſity of Hands, as by the Apoſtles and good Chriſtians; with the difference between Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Miracle, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of theſe Miracles, even to the 600 year of our bleſſed Saviour, proved and made good by Hiſtory and Authority.</p>
                  <p>Where Kings and Queens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as Nurſing Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have been always thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with this Sanative Virtue ever ſince the Confeſſor, and <hi>England</hi> proved to have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more kept up the ſame in the Regal Line, long before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince or Potentate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And although the French King doth Cure by Contact, yet he derived the ſame from the Engliſh by Sprig of Right, and he muſt evermore account our Engliſh Monarchs the eldeſt
<pb facs="tcp:40826:236"/>
Brothers thereof, confirmed by Hiſtory, and made good by example, both which received this ſalutiferous Gift with their juſt Rights to the Crown, confirmed and made good to them at their Inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations. In this Treatiſe alſo you have the Chyrurgeons Duty laid down, who diſcovers the Diſeaſe by examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, by whom Certificates of the Sick People are to be taken in, and Tickets delivered out to them. Herein is alſo ſhewn a ready method for eaſing the Diſeaſed of their tedious journeys, and a preſent remedy of ſending them back: He brings them to His Majeſty on his Knee, and delivers every ſick Perſon to the Kings Sacred Hand to be Toucht. The next concerned is the Clerk of His Majeſties Cloſſet, and Chaplains, the Firſt preſenting the Gold to the King, the other Reading the Ceremonies and Prayers appointed for this purpoſe; in all which is ſhewn the great Charity, Piety, Clemency, and Humility of our Dread Soveraign; the
<pb facs="tcp:40826:237"/>
admirable effects and wonderful events of His Royal Cure, throughout all Nations, where not only <hi>Engliſh, Dutch, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> have reaped Eaſe and Cure, but <hi>French, Germans,</hi> and all Countreys whatſoever, far and near, have abundantly ſeen and received the ſame; and none ever hitherto, I am certain miſt thereof, unleſs their little Faith and Incredulity ſtarved their Merits, or they received His Gracious Hand for curing another Diſeaſe, which was not really evermore allowed to be cured by him: And as bright evidences hereof I have preſumed to offer, that ſome have immediately upon the very Touch been cured; Others not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily quitted from their Swellings, till the favour of a Second repetition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Some alſo loſing their Gold, their Diſeaſes have ſeized them afreſh, and no ſooner have theſe obtained a Second Touch, and new Gold, but their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes have been ſeen to vaniſh, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid of His Majeſties Preſence;
<pb facs="tcp:40826:237"/>
wherein alſo have been cured many without Gold; and this may contradict ſuch who muſt needs have the King give them Gold as well as his Touch, ſuppoſing one invalid without the Gift of both. Others ſeem alſo as ready for a Second Change of Gold, as a Second Touch, whereas their Firſt being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrung upon a White Ribond, may work as well (by their Favour.) The tying the Almighty to ſet times, and particular days, is alſo another great fault of thoſe who can by no means be brought to Believe, but at <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> and the like particular ſeaſons, this Healing faculty is of more vigor and efficacy than at any other time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho performed by the ſame Hand. As to the giving of Gold, this only ſhews His Majeſties Royal Well-wiſhes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Recovery of thoſe who come thus to be Healed. This Gold being hereat given as a Token of His Sacred Favour, and Pledge of His beſt deſires for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40826:238"/>In this Treatiſe alſo you have the marvelous and miraculous efficacy of the Blood of our late Sacred Martyr King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt; wherein by ſtrange Examples are diſcovered this efficacious Virtue of Healing, by many true Devoters of His Great Name, the which, altho ſtript of its Life, yet not robb'd of its vigor, made good by many, who col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the ſame in Linnen, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof to their Scrophulous Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, by which they found immediate eaſe, and preſent relief. His very Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers alone miraculouſly working and effecting the ſame in the time of His Troubles; and this alſo made good by eminent Authority.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons of their Ceremony and their Uſe, ſerving only as Prayers, and giving of Thanks for the Sick, and their Recovery; theſe being nearer akin to the Solemnity, than aſſiſtant to the Cure, the bare Hands and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our Kings effecting the ſame to a
<pb facs="tcp:40826:238"/>
Miracle; the which Sanative Gift hath for above 640 years, been confirmed and continued in our Engliſh Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Line, wherein is not ſo much of their Majeſty ſhewn, as of their Divinity, conſidering the Liturgy thereat uſed is Holy; the Reverence of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies performed with all Decency; he that exerciſeth it being thereto call'd by Divine appointment: The Author of the whole Work being the Holy Ghoſt, and the Gift thence ariſing: Where God is only Worſhipped, His Holy Son Venerated; The King thus Sacredly Gifted, and His poor and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed Subjects perfectly cured; where no difference is made between Peer and Peaſant, delicate or deformed, not acted in the dark, but in the face of His People, in His Royal Palace, and places appointed for Divine Worſhip, in his Maſters Temple; where the Holy Spirit meets His Sacred Hand, and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the ſame with its Sanative Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. In the conſummating therefore of
<pb facs="tcp:40826:239"/>
the whole, you have the variety of Opinions ſhewn about this Curative method; concluding the ſame with many Hiſtorical Illuſtrations of ſtrange Cures performed by their Sacred Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Touch, Blood, and the like.</p>
                  <p>And now altho this rich lading hath been hitherto hid from the publick view of the curious Eyes of ſtrangers, and never as yet ſaw the face of Day, till unhappily puſht forward by my mean Pen; I have preſumed to offer it as neceſſary, that this Princely Vail might no longer be kept over our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but that all the World may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire our Engliſh Iſle, and have the moſt Venerable and Sacred Thoughts of her Mighty Monarchs, who thus can baniſh Diſeaſes by their Touch, and heal the Countrey Infirmities by their Sacred Hands. I hope this ſmall labour will get ſo much kindneſs in the World as to raiſe Men of greater parts to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and refine this Diſcourſe, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as it were a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or indigeſted lump; If its greatneſs of Cures be not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb facs="tcp:40826:239"/>
to make it paſs current, I hope the certainty of its reality may advance it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken what is herein writ from the infallible teſtimony of mine Eyes, in a great part, the which, altho perhaps they may not be allowed the quickeſt ſight, yet they have ſeveral times had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Advantage of reiterating their ſpeculations, as to theſe His Majeſties Healings. And if he which vieweth a long time, altho his Sight may not be of the beſt, yet doth commonly ſee more, than he that looks haſtily, be his Eyes ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver ſo good: ſo I who for ſeveral years have had the opportunity of ſeeing, as well as the late Honour of Waiting at theſe great Solemnities, have certainly ſeen as much as I write, and can confirm the ſame with more certainty, altho with leſs Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. And where you meet other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, you meet their Names in the ſame line with their own obſervations; about which alſo I have been as careful to take the valuable meaſures of Truth, as the Worth and Quality of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributers.</p>
                  <p>And now kind Reader, if thou doſt
<pb facs="tcp:40826:240"/>
deteſt Anarchy, and expect to ſhare in the good of this Bleſſing, acknowledge thy own happy Nation and preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, where our preſent Bliſs, and Engliſh Intereſts are ſafely wrapt up in the ſafety of our Prince, as well as in our Religion; where its Diſſenters are daily ſeen to crumble into Atomes, and its Churches Enemies ſo cowardized, as not daring to tread any longer on Engliſh ground; where the greateſt Sects are found ſhifting themſelves under divers marks, aſhamed of their own Follies, and frightned by their own inconſtancies. Let every Loyal Subject therefore, (for with any of the Canting Tribe, I hope this will never get favour) offer publick Thanks and Prayers for His Majeſties Sacred Health and miraculous Preſervation, who Cures not only His Subjects, but Preſerves alſo His Three Kingdoms in Peace, Order, and Tranquility; under whom I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to conclude, That <hi>England</hi> doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy as many more Benefits and Bleſſings, than ever <hi>Rome</hi> did ſuffer Miſeries and Calamities under the greateſt Tyrant.</p>

The truth is, whether theſe do happen by viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Things, Sins of the People,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40826:245"/>
ill Habits, or worſe Conſtitutions, we cannot ſo eaſily ſatisfie. Sure I am, Sin is as great a procurer of this, as it is of any of the former Diſeaſes; for we daily ſee it ſporting its ſelf ſlighly under ſeveral Diſguiſes to afflict the Sons of Men.</p>
                     <p>But having in my former Treatiſes been more large as touching this, I ſhall preſume, with hopes to offer, that there is no Chriſtian ſo void of Religion and Devotion, as to deny a Gift of Healing: A Truth as clear as the Sun, continued and maintained by a continual Line of Chriſtian Kings and Governors, fed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with the ſame Chriſtian Milk, which Divine Healing Faculty did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the firſt time of Chriſtianity, having thence been derived from the great God of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                     <p>Hence may we preſume to take a view, and behold the great Monarch implanting Soveraign Dignity on his Earthly Majeſty; giving him his Laws, making him his Vicegerent, guarding his Tongue, preſerving his Lips, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Hands with this Salutiferous Gift, and defending his Body from outward Injuries and private Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40826:245"/>
Thus we read, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination lodgeth in the Kings lips, in Judgment ſhall not his mouth err,</hi> much leſs his heart, which is governed and directed by the Almighty: For as the diviſion of Waters, ſo is the heart of the King in the hand of the Lord. And in another place, where there is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Wiſdom, it appears as the health of the Nation, much more in a wiſe King, as the Foundation and Baſis of his People: For we are daily Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe great and Divine favors which are tranſmitted from above to his Sacred Majeſty, ever denyed to his Subjects, as being too High and Holy for their reach and capacity. Thus Nature her ſelf doth by a Chain of Cauſes carry us up to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of a Deity, by bringing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thinking Man to an Original of every ſucceſsful Individual by courſe of Generation.</p>
                     <p>And as to this great Gift of Healing, peculiarly given to his Gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Royal hand, by the reception of the Holy Oyl which at his Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he made uſe of, and which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled him the Soveraign of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Where I ſhall further ſatisfie, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40826:246"/>
                        <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as to their Kings, had the honor of receiving this Holy Oyl with their Sacred Titles, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally anointed in three parts, as hath been well noted. As firſt, on their Heads, to ſignifie their Glory: Next, on their Breaſts, to ſhew their Sanctity; and then on their Arms, to denote their Power. And from hence did ariſe the three equalizing Fames given to them, of being Holy, Sacred, and Divine. And from thoſe early days, whoſe Power and Sanctity was ever given to their Sacred Perſons; ſuch Perſon whoſoever ſhould dare to ſtrike upon the Sacred Ground on which they did tread, ſhould loſe his hand for this his preſumption. And amongſt the reſt of his Divine Favors beſtowed upon him, let this Sanative Faculty amongſt all Mankind, be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned one, which doth denote both his Right, Title and Merit, and as a ſecond Gift given from Heaven, by thoſe many Thouſands cured by him ſince his happy Reſtoration; and this acknowledged not only by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons themſelves who have been thus Cured, but by relation of Phyſicians and Chirurgions, and others through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40826:246"/>
his univerſal Realms and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: all which in a great meaſure doth declare his excellent Charity which ſweetens the Gift, as alſo his Piety and Clemency in granting poor Souls his Sacred and ready Touch.</p>
                     <p>We come now to prove the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Healing Faculty,<note place="margin">The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> and this is proved out of <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of Wiſdom: To another, the word of Knowledge by the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: To another Faith by the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: To another the gift of Healing by the ſame ſpirit: To another the working of Miracles: To another Propheſie: To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the diſcerning of Spirits: To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other divers Gifts of Tongues: To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the interpretation of Tongues.</hi> And this Scripture alone is enough to prove a Gift of Healing.</p>
                     <p>The next Queſtion which hence will ariſe, is,<note place="margin">Whether every one may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this Gift.</note> Whether every one may pretend to this Gift, or whether it be diſtributive to all perſons at all times, and in all places? And this is as readily anſwer'd as the former: For when our Saviour aſcended up into Heaven, he gave Gifts unto men; as to ſome the Gift of Wiſdom, to ſome the Gift of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40826:247"/>
Knowledge, to ſome Faith, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Gift of Healing, and the like. And as in this no Man can affirm that he enjoys all the above-mentioned Qualities, ſo cannot any Man ſay that he is ſtript of all.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt Face therefore of the Primitive Church, as an Orient Gem, or Fulgent Adamant, did this Gift of Healing appear with ſplendor and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Form, ſo that the Church was perfum'd with its Divine Qualities, where was Wiſdom declaring her ſelf amongſt the Learned, whil'ſt others did as readily demonſtrate their great Knowledge; ſome ſhewing their Faith by their Works, others curing the Sick and the Lame: And whil'ſt ſome lent the World the ſweetneſs of their Diſcourſe, others as readily Propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of things to come. And thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their variety of Gifts, they had diverſity of Names given them: ſome being call'd Apoſtles, ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and others Prophets: ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in Virtue, others as richly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified in this Gift of Healing. Thus when poor indigent Souls had ſought out Remedy from Phyſicians in vain, God in his own time ſent them eaſe by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40826:247"/>
the aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, and made thoſe rebellious Diſeaſes which ſcorn'd Medicine, and trampled on the beſt of Remedies compoſed by the wiſeſt Phyſician and moſt able Chirurgion, in a moment yield to Gods command, and retreat at His Majeſties Sacred Touch.</p>
                     <p>And might there any Queſtion ariſe about the firſt Phyſician which cured by Touch, the Anſwer is very ready:<note place="margin">Chriſt the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Healing.</note> The firſt and laſt, the beſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Recoverer of all Diſeaſes is our Saviour Chriſt: For he aſcended into Heaven, and gave gifts unto men: He paſt through <hi>Galilee</hi> and its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Nations, curing thoſe which were oppreſt with evil Spirits, the which he diſcharged from them by his Virtue, and the Holy Spirit; and not only theſe, but ſuch as were troubled with the Palſie, Leproſie, Lunacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Incurable by others, as you may ſee Luke 6. and Matth. 6. v. 14, 15, 16. <hi>When Jeſus was come into</hi> Peters <hi>houſe, he ſaw his wifes mother laid ſick of a fever; and he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and ſhe aroſe and miniſtred unto them. And when the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40826:248"/>
evening was come, they brought him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poſſeſſed with devils, and he caſt out the evil ſpirit with his word, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that were ſick.</hi> And all this done without the help of Pharmacy, or compoſition of Medicine, for he cured by his own Virtue.</p>

It is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all contradiction that there were twelve which did ſhare therein: But
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40826:248"/>
whether others ariſing from them had this Gift conferr'd to them, and ſo tranſmitted to their Succeſſors, will thus appear, from their being called into Society with them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 8.

And he called unto him the twelve, and ſent them forth two by two, and gave them power over unclean ſpirits, and they anointed with oyl many that were ſick, and healed them.</hi> God Almighty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did wonderful works by the hands of <hi>Paul</hi> at his coming to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſo that from his Body were brought unto the ſick, <hi>handkerchiefs, and aprons, and their diſeaſes departed

from them,</hi> v. 12. And that of <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>'s Father laying ſick of a Fever and Diſentery, <hi>Paul</hi> viſiting him, Praying with him, and laying his hands on him, he was preſently heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which is evidence enough to convince the tranſmiſſion of this Gift from our Saviour to his Apoſtles.

                     <p>The Knowledge of Man dies with him, as well as his hours and his age; but this Almighty Gift doth continue to the very laſt Age of the World, ſo that we may affirm, That not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the great Apoſtles, but their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, have been ſharers in their moſt excellent Endowments, as well as in their Natures and Conſtitutions.

                     <p>OUr firſt Chapter looks but as the Rigging and Sails of a Ship which we are Lanching into: This gives us the dimenſions and its proper uſes, where we are to examine, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Diſeaſe be naturally curable or incurable, not hitherto fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: And that we may not keep it too long upon the Sands, we ſhall find it the Gift of God which makes it ſail thus univerſally throughout the World, Fetching and procuring Health by the Holy Spirit to the Sons of Men, by whoſe aſſiſtance, one Man may as well guide her in her Curative Paſſage as an hundred.</p>
                     <p>And as this is a Gift or Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on Chriſtians, given to them by the Holy Spirit for the Cure of one or many Diſeaſes, and this by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40826:250"/>
of their Hands on them, and Prayers, and Gold put over their Necks, is a great Gift beyond all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and next to a Miracle done by any of the former Apoſtles. And that this comes from above, I hope no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Man will deny: For ſinful Man can only call Sin his own. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> joyned to this Gift, Charity, Mercy, Clemency, and Sanctity; theſe being as the four Pedeſtals on which this Royal Gift doth fix its proper Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis: It is performed by the Holy Spirit, from whom doth proceed every good and perfect Gift; and this is not given to all Men, nor to all Church-men, for every Man hath his particular Gift al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, and Health doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the particular nature of Cauſes ariſing from the habit and uſe of the Gift. God Almighty having an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and Immenſe Goodneſs in him, not to be drained out by Time, or leſs'ned by the utmoſt of Age. As therefore in the early Times of the Church this Gift received much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; ſo becauſe we do live in Times which do bear equal weight, and ſhare with the like Diſeaſes; I ought to bring again to life this Divine Gift,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40826:251"/>
ſent by the Almighty to our Sacred Majeſty, thus exerciſed as the laſt and beſt Remedy. To him therefore be given the greateſt Reverence and Honor, to whom the greateſt Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is due.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of this Gift.</note>We come now to examine the Gift it ſelf, what it is, as alſo in what times it was firſt uſed: And that I may enter the Scene without fear, Truth being my great General, I ſhall begin its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition which the Apoſtle makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. which declares both the efficacy and action thereof: For the greateſt praiſe of this Gift con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the action thereof. Who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall preſume to make any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doubt, but acknowledge, that he which hath this admirable Gift in him,<note place="margin">The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe thereof.</note> may make uſe thereof at his own will and pleaſure, for the Curing of poor Mortals which ſhall approach his Royal Touch? Sure there is none but inconſiderate Men, which either can or will deny this Healing Faculty, or make any queſtion of it, and that it is as plain as it is Hereditary, is as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be aſſented to. For it is laid down as a general Maxim amongſt the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40826:251"/>
moſt grave Senators, That they which are beſt gifted, or do excel others ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Art, Wiſdom, Knowledge, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, or the like, moſt excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, theſe are confirm'd and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd upon them as Divine Habits running in their Veins, and excellent Qualifications going along with them throughout the whole courſe of their lives, and tranſmitted more or leſs to their ſucceeding Generations. And although theſe may ſeem ſtrange to the Man leſs knowing, yet every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and conſiderate Perſon which hath the rules of Underſtanding in him, will find, That Wiſdom doth lodge in the Kings lips, and that the words of the Wiſe are as goads and nails faſtned by the Maſters of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: In the ſame manner, he that hath Faith, and is beſt inſtructed for the doing and underſtanding of all things, hath a greater degree of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity implanted in him. Heb. 11. v. 32, 33. <hi>Thus by faith, the Fathers of old did overcome Kingdoms.</hi> And what ſhall I ſay more? for the time would fail me to tell of <hi>Gideon,</hi> and of <hi>Barack,</hi> and of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and of <hi>Jepthae,</hi> and of <hi>David</hi> alſo, and of <hi>Samuel</hi> and the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40826:252"/>
Prophets, who through Faith ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kingdoms, wrought Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, obtained Promiſes, ſtopt the mouths of Lions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Faith being like Virtue, evermore active: And ſuch as the habit of Humane Body is, ſuch Fruits uſually we ſhall find it yield, either to its excellency or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit. But as to this Virtue of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the like ſublime Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as of Propheſying, Gifts of Tongues, examination of Spirits, theſe do riſe much higher than the former; for this puts Man upon the thinking and conſidering part. Thus when pious and good Men are ſtirred up by the Divine Spirit, they open Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles themſelves, and puts advantage to the beſt of Thoughts. Amongſt theſe may I well place this moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Healing Gift of our Dread Soveraign, appearing herein as a fixt Star in the midſt of his People, or as a greater Light among the leſſer diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting according to his own will and pleaſure, of this his Curative Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to his poor miſerable and diſeaſed Subjects of all Ages, Sexes, Orders and Degrees whatſoever,<note place="margin">Its dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> by which they are ſtript from their Diſeaſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relieved
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40826:252"/>
from their Pangs, and this not palliated or diſmiſt for a while, or done by chance or good fortune, but he cures by deliberate and ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, prepared thereunto by the Almighty Power tranſmitting his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit for the better accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.</p>
                     <p>They muſt needs therefore be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed no good Subjects, who dare deny this Sanative Faculty, which ſo many thouſands have received even to a Miracle. And without doubt amongſt the worſt of Mankind, it muſt be allowed an Act of Grace, and a great and pious condeſcention of his Gracious Majeſty thus to give eaſe and relief to every ſick and lame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by his Sacred and gracious Touch, wherein and whereby we may ſee the Almighty revealing many things to his, which are denyed to others; which doth implant a greater Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in them, and yet they do not enjoy all Science, the perfection of the Divinity whereof he reſerves to himſelf: Neither are they ignorant or unknown to him, for were they ſo, where would be their familiarity with the Holy Spirit, by whom this great
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40826:253"/>
work is performed: for ſo oft as they have therewith been concerned, they could foreſhew many things to come, as converſions of Republicks, ruines of Kingdoms, Death of Nobles, and many other the like Obſervations.

His Majeſties Royal Healing, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and affording hereby this Health to the Sick, which we daily ſee and find they do hereby purchaſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy: But there is and muſt be God Almighties hand going along with it, for no Mortals Virtue, or Piety, or Power, hath ſtrength or efficacy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in it to perform this Soveraign ſanative Faculty: Nor can the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or Veſtments any wiſe effect the ſame; for as to theſe, thoſe which were carried to <hi>Paul (viz.)</hi> the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs and aprons, were only ſigns and tokens for begetting and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Faith of thoſe who were cured in <hi>Paul</hi>'s abſence. And for a more clear underſtanding hereof, this Gift which he received from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, was not fixed or tyed to his Body, and ſo much the leſs diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſick people which thus came to him for help, or ſent to him, and which ſaw him not: But God wrought theſe Miracles by his hands, and his hand was the only Inſtrument by which this great Work was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whil'ſt his Maker was the great Agent thereof: Much leſs could the Ceremonies and Veſtments procure
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40826:254"/>
this which are put upon it: Gods Hand is the hand of Health, and his Arm wants no ſtrength to perform every kind of Cure beyond humane capacity: The which <hi>Peter</hi> well knew, when he tells us of a Man, <hi>which was lame from his mothers womb</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Acts 3. <hi>who ſeeing Peter and John about go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Temple, asked an alms; and Peter fastning his eyes on him with John, ſaid, Look on us: In the name of Jeſus of Nazareth riſe up and walk; and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up, and immediatly his feet and ancle bones received ſtrength, and went into the temple praiſing God.</hi> And although <hi>Peter,</hi> through Gods aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, did give this great cure to this Cripple, yet primarily he received this Divine Power from above, before any effect could be wrought. And that alſo is very remarkable, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. when <hi>Peter</hi> did paſs through all Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, arriving at <hi>Lidda,</hi> where he ſaw <hi>Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years, and was ſick of the palſie, and</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid unto him,</hi> Aeneas, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt make thee whole,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This ſhews the great Gift of the

Almighty, performed by the leſſer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument Man, even as the Sun is no ways leſſened in its ſplendor by the light of the Moon, or leſſer Stars: For thus Man doth receive this Gift from the Divine Giver, as the Moon and leſſer Stars do borrow their light from the Sun: For the Almighty doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play and communicate his Gifts to Mankind, whoſe Rays are implanted in his mind, clear'd up, and freed from all cloudineſs, there to be kept in him as his choiceſt Treaſures and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Qualifications.

                     <head>CHAP. III. Whether Diſeaſes Curable or Incurable.</head>
                     <p>WHat the <hi>Struma</hi> is, or <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> ſo commonly called from the Kings healing thereof by his Sacred Touch, I have already ſatisfied in my ſecond Book, wherein is ſhewn both its Definition, Cauſes, Preſages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the unravelling this skain, ſpun out of ſo many fine threds, in which are found many knots about curing Diſeaſes curable or incurable: We muſt begin to unty it in its proper place, by examining its Age and Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnity. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> when he cured the Father of <hi>Publius</hi> of a Diſentery and Fever, the Cure was admirable, although both the Diſeaſes naturally curable: for a Fever we ſee, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo vexatious, its forc'd to quit its ſtation by true Phyſick and a right method uſed. The Diſentery alſo is as readily conquered and by the like
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40826:255"/>
means. When our Bleſſed Saviour alſo cured the Palſie, or the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagy: No man can deny but that both theſe Diſeaſes in themſelves are curable, but our Saviour cured theſe by his own Power, which by others were not to be performed but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means, and therefore this ought not to be allowed an ordinary way of Healing.</p>
                     <p>Hence Chriſt forbids not the curing of the Sick by the hands of Chriſtian Kings, Princes and Governors,<note place="margin">Apoſtles and good Chriſtians allowed in former times to cure Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</note> who do follow his Rules by Prayer and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands: For we have read of many Holy and Pious people who have cured Diſeaſes after ſeveral man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and where any thing of a Divine Influence is implanted, what ſhould deny the hand thereof to declare the ſame? and although this Diſeaſe is natural, no queſtion but this Method is ſupernatural, the which may be made good by Hiſtorical Illuſtrations. For as this <hi>Struma,</hi> or <hi>Kings Evil</hi> Swelling is a popular Diſeaſe (bred out of Matter and Blood, ſent into the Glandules, and therein making a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bulk according to the Quantity
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40826:256"/>
of Matter ſent thither) and ſparing neither Age or Sex, and yet curable if any man conſiders its nature well; unleſs it be ſuffer'd to run into a great extream, whoſe Malice bids defiance to all Cure, the time being neglected which might more mildly have given it its diſpatch: and ſince its Curable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Incurableneſs conſiſts in its Matter, it muſt needs truckle to him who hath this Divine Gift of Healing tranſmitted to him. And as a further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the clearing of this Point, we never ſee his Sacred Majeſty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the age of the diſeaſed, or the Diſeaſe it ſelf, being relative ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to youth or old age, Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Children, rich or poor, all which he cures by his Sacred Hand; with ſome Ceremonies and Prayers therewith annexed for the Poor thus waiting on him for their Health and Recovery: The which I have had the Honor of being an eye-witneſs in the Place and Quality which his Sacred Majeſty hath been pleaſed to confer on me, as one of his Chirurgions at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending at this great Solemnity, where I muſt, with St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> preſume to Offer, that this great Gift of his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40826:256"/>
may well compare with a Miracle and we ought to give it the ſame name, if not allow it the nature thereof, when we ſhall ſee ſo many Diſeaſed People come from all parts of the World, even tired out of their Lives by their Diſtempers, and perplex'd with troubleſome Swellings, thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to gain Victory over them, and become ſound, and ſtript from all their enormous Swellings; and this with extraordinary ſpeed, only by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Sacred Hand, and this ſeen to be done without, and beyond all expectation of the poor People themſelves, their Friends or Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: their Faith being as a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient to this Compoſition. All which may well enough come within the Pale of a Miracle, being done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our knowledge and the courſe of Nature.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Nature and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</note> 
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Contr. Fauſt. cap.</hi> 3. doth there thus diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Nature and Miracle in its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminancy. We commonly call that Nature which is known by its courſe and cuſtom: On the contrary, when God works or makes any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this, this properly comes under
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40826:257"/>
the notion of Miracle. Under which laſt, this Gift of Healing may well take place, whoſe miraculous Efficacy, although there may be ſome inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with it with Miracles, yet the Dignity thereof is to be admired, and the uſe and benefit thereof being not much unlike, they ſhould bear alike date with us.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt tells his Apoſtles, <hi>That thoſe who believe in him, the works which he did, they ſhall alſo do, and greater than thoſe: and whatſoever they ſhall ask in my Name, that I will do, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be glorified in the Son.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of Miracles, may be reckoned the falling back of the Sun, and the ſtanding ſtill of the Moon; both which do declare the Divine Will and Omnipotent Power of the Almighty. But to give ſight to the Blind, to make the Lame walk, to give Life to the dead, and cure to the ſick of their Diſeaſes, and this only by the Impoſition of Hands, is much greater: wherein is ſhewn a greater Meaſure of Divinity, which ought to be reckoned amongſt the greateſt of Miracles.</p>
                     <p>Rarefaction and Denſation of Air,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40826:257"/>
or reſolution of the ſame into drops, by the Prayers of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> is a thing very great and ſtupendious: Yet this is no Miracle. To give Health to <hi>Struma</hi>'s, to help the Paralytick, and to diſcharge and baniſh other Diſeaſes, may not ſeem ſtrange to a knowing Phyſician, and to an able Chirurgion, where a curative Method is uſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art: But to Heal by the Touch, or by Contact, and by Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prayers, to procure Health to the Sick, and to baniſh Diſeaſes from poor Mortals without the help of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; and this done immediatly, this ought not to come much beneath a Miracle.</p>

                     <p>THat the apoſtles have had this gift beſtowed on them, hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been ſhewn and made good: And that their Succeſſors have been ſharers therein with them, may be cleared as bright as the Sun. For no Age of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, by the light of Examples, hath ever been without it, although ſome Ages hath had it more frequently than others, and the Repetition of its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Effects hath frequently evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and made this good. That we may therefore ſatisfie all Objections, and prevent Calumny where ever it may meet or offer its ſelf, we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce ſome Examples of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.<note place="margin">Its long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writes, That few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles hapned in his time, neither were they permitted to laſt long which ſo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40826:258"/>
hapned. Thus he writes, <hi>Lib. de vera Religione, cap.</hi> 25. in theſe words, <hi>Leſt the Soul ſhould evermore hunt after vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, and Humanity in its ſearch ſhould hereby grow cold therewith, and its novelty.</hi> This is true, that until their hands were put to be Baptized, they never thus received the Holy Spirit: By which they enjoyed theſe Gifts of Tongues of all Nations, or arrived at the Shadow or Tranciſion of the Teachers of Chriſt: By which the Sick were thus healed, the which then hapned, and then afterwards ceaſed. But our curative Gift runs not along in this Stream, and if we look into the Times of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> we ſhall find admirable effects gaining ſtrength in the times of the Apoſtles, even to the Age of <hi>Simeon,</hi> in whoſe time the Church appeard incorrupt, and as a pure Virgin: and after him, it carried the ſame vigor to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors thereof. For as <hi>Euſebius</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, The Divine Spirits did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelves in his times, and ſhewed their admirable Virtues and excellent Qualifications, even to the times of <hi>Adrianus,</hi> under <hi>Antoninus</hi> and <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> then Governors; by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40826:259"/>
which it abundantly appears of what value and eſteem this ancient Virtue of Healing was in former Ages. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived a little after <hi>Tertullian,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a long time in theſe Gifts: Thus <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> altho a Lad, heard <hi>Polycarpus</hi> in <hi>Aſia: Polycarpus</hi> alſo a Diſciple of the Evangeliſt St. <hi>John,</hi> maintained the ſame Gift of Healing, the which he thus expreſſes, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>We have heard many Brethren in the Church, having the Gifts of Propheſie, and of Healing, and of Speaking univerſal Tongues by the Spirit, producing and bringing many things to view, obſcured and hid from former Ages, for uſe and explaining the Myſteries of God according to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the ſame Spirit</hi>; as alſo Lib. 2. cap. 58. <hi>Some of theſe having in them the Knowledge of things to come, and of Viſions, and of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Sayings; and others of curing the Sick and Lame of their Diſeaſes, by laying their Hands on them, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Its numberleſs to tell the Gifts of theſe from God throughout the World, done in the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, not by Invocation of evil Spirits, or Inchantment, or black and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40826:259"/>
dark Curioſity, but by pure, clear, and clean Prayers made to him, who directs us in every thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gives a Bleſſing and Succeſs to this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of his own Anointed, which have been obtained above 600 years; all which may be made good by the cleareſt light imaginable, and ſhall more fully ſhew it ſelf in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Origen</hi> ſaw all theſe Divine and admirable Gifts perpetuated and continued in the Church, and that as clear as the brighteſt Light, the Eyes of all People being open to ſee and vindicate the Truth thereof, againſt any Opponent whatſoever, he thus replies thereupon:
<q>Theſe Miracles, (ſaith he) are to be examined by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rules of Judgment, leſt they bring Damnation unto men, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to their manners: That we may diſtinguiſh between thoſe done by the help of Satan, from thoſe which are performed by a pure and pious mind, adorned with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit; ſome may enter and offer here, that in the Bloody times of the Church, when it laid under Perſecution for near 300 years, all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40826:260"/>
theſe Gifts or moſt of them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vigor, but when it once aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of its Flame and Troubles, it loſt of its power and efficacy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more ſparing in its appearance to mankind.</q>
It would be an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, as well as troubleſom task, to bring all things into number, omitting St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who lived in the time of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and one of the ſame Judgment, where he num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>Baſilius, Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de Spiritu Sancto,</hi> where he writes the Gifts of the Holy Spirit to be, Delight, Joy, Peace, Goodneſs, Prudence, Wiſdom, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, the Gift of Healing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But who is more curious in the ſearch thereof than St. <hi>Baſil</hi>? And if any will ſtill doubt of theſe Gifts, and of their perſpicuouſneſs, he is to be brought into a mean; and if credit therefore cannot be given to St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> or St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> both evermore accounted good and pious Men; or to <hi>Origine</hi> or <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who were ever eſteemed men of great Learning; nor to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> or others of his Faith and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, the Faith of all Hiſtory muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. And if we cannot lend our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to theſe worthy Church-men, in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40826:260"/>
whoſe times theſe great Miracles were wrought, we may as well ſlacken and tye up our Faith to any other thing whatſoever. I know, and do expect that this Aſſertion will not go off ſmoothly, or paſs by the blaſts of the Envious without a Reprimand, but muſt take as much contradiction as their pleaſures ſhall think beſt to put upon it; yet in this I ſhall think my ſelf happy, that I have a Cure for their evil Breaths, when I ſhall offer no Authority but ſuch as hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more been accounted faithful and praiſe-worthy in their Generations. And in order thereunto, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly know, who ever was a more Luculent Author than <hi>Divus Hieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> or a more happy witneſs than bleſt St. <hi>Augustine</hi>? who more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in their times for Prediction of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable effects of theirs and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times? all their Books being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Wiſe Sayings, and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Worthy Examples; neither could any thing lie hid in the dark, which ever arrived at the light of their Writings.</p>

And that he might not ſeem erronious herein in his Hiſtories, he gives every of them their proper names, and proper places: And hence this Holy Father concludes, That out of ſo many accidents, many Miracles have been performed by the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by and through ſuch Inſtruments as he ſhall pleaſe to appoint, and when he pleaſeth: That a more ready con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation may be given to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, he adviſeth, That thoſe who have thus received their health, ſhould let the World ſee what great things he hath done for them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord the ſame, that future Ages may behold and admire his Wiſdom and Goodneſs to poor Mortals.

Upon his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> he tells him, If he would pleaſe to touch him he ſhould be whole: St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it is ſaid, laying his hands on him, he went home ſound and cured of his Diſeaſe. And <hi>Poſſidoneus</hi> writes this as one of St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> great Miracles: He dyed the fifteenth of <hi>September, Anno Chriſti</hi> 430. but left this Gift of Healing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him; for we ſhall find, after his

                        </note> it ran in the ſame ſtream near eighty years, in which many and wonderful Gifts of Healing were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, as Hiſtory doth fully ſatisfie; and ſo continued even to the ſeventh Age, that is, the Six hundred and tenth year of Chriſt, even to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice.</hi> We ſhall not trouble you with any other methods and by-ways uſed for Cures, taken up in theſe days by evil Spirits, or unclean Pſeudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mungers, rather naming the Virtues and Divine Gifts of Pious and Holy Men. And that this Virtue hath been tranſmitted through all Ages of the World, not only <hi>Africa</hi> bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but our <hi>Aſia,</hi> called <hi>Europe,</hi> can teſtifie the ſame. And as the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Orient times were illuſtrated by theſe Gifts beſtowed on the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God above 670 years and upwards, ſo alſo our Occidental times do receive the ſame by the Septen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trional Light.

his Authority it appears, that <hi>Germanus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Auocerre</hi> was ſent into <hi>Britain</hi> from <hi>Celeſtine. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> ſaith, that this <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Troys</hi> (ſeeing all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fair to willing minds) were both Men of ſuch Learning and Holy Lives, that a grave Father of their Time, called <hi>Lupus,</hi> the Father of Fathers, and the Biſhop of Biſhops, and yet but a Second to <hi>Germanus</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, much reſembling <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas.</hi> They being ſent as two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates into <hi>Britain,</hi> as the Chief and Principal of the reſt; theſe by their great Learning and Virtue did ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a great part of the Country with their Doctrine, and confirmed the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Faith, and made many of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> whoſe Religion, or rather way of Worſhip, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, to revolt from that which they had formerly taken up, and reclaimed the Erronious Preaching in Fields and High-ways; and as the Kings preſence did make a Court, ſo theirs did make a Church. For at this time <hi>Pelagius,</hi> which was a <hi>Britain,</hi> and had ſecured many Diſciples to himſelf which came out thence, and infected the People
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40826:265"/>
with the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſie, did begin to leſſen both in his number and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. For God Almighty, as it were by a wonderful <hi>Compendium,</hi> did confirm the Catholick Faith, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Miracle performed by a Man of the Tribunative Power, who coming into Church with his Wife, and having his Daughter blind for about ten years, they carryed her to the Prieſts, where they joyned in Prayers with her Parents for her Recovery (whil'ſt on the contrary the <hi>Pelagians</hi> waiting to ſee the ſucceſs) <hi>Germanus</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving invoked the Holy Trinity, the Daughter immediatly was ſeen cured in the publick view of all the By-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Constantius</hi> remembers, that in the laſt Legation of this <hi>Germanus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into this Iſle, that <hi>Elephias</hi> a great Man hapned in his way, and plac'd his Son, who although in the flower of his Age, had his Members wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Knee contracted, and could not walk by reaſon of this contracted dryneſs which hapned in his Ham: this <hi>Germane</hi> made him preſently to ſet down, and did extend the contracted parts, and gave him a ſpeedy cure, ſo
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40826:266"/>
that his dryneſs received moiſture, and the Nerves regained their proper fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: The Son return'd to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the People hereat were all ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and the Catholick Faith by this means grew very firm and ſtable in the Breaſts of all Men. This Gift of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> as I have ſaid, was founded on the Orthodox Faith, which both eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and readily did confound its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> This <hi>Pelagius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as he was a <hi>Britain</hi> by birth, was by ſome called <hi>Morgan</hi>; and every Man, as Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> writes in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, is born a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> naturally proud of his Power, and needs little Art to make him think well of himſelf, and <hi>Britain</hi> only bred him, and he himſelf begot and bred his Hereſie; and in this, our Iſland is as happy as unfortunate, for as it bred him it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Errors; even as the beſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may have an unhappy Child, who by the fore-ſight of his Sons extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy may quit him from his favor, and ſo give no countenance to his evil Courſes. And that which is almoſt as great a Miracle, is that one relates of him, The ſame day that <hi>Pelagius</hi> was born in <hi>Britain,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was born
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40826:266"/>
in <hi>Africk</hi>: The Almighty ſending both the Poiſon and the <hi>Alexapharmick</hi> together into the World, in one and the ſame hour or day.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not preſume to appear ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as to look into the courſe of Gods thus confirming his Truth with ſuch Seals and Miracles done in the Church; we ought rather to conſult the Scriptures, which are the proper Fountains of Truth.</p>
                     <p>But to pretermit many Authorities with which I could eaſily ſwell up this Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Some Cures wrought in the Church, and after the time of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory.</hi>
                        </note> I proceed to the time of <hi>Gregory the Great,</hi> who writes, That he ſaw Holy Men working Miracles by many Virtues, as cleanſing the Lepers, caſting out Devils, healing the Sick by touching them, and Propheſying by the Spirit of Propheſie: and he brings <hi>John</hi> to the example of ſome of theſe; one of which, was the blind Man which he cured; another was one born Lame and Dumb at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>; yet all Ages of the Church did not receive the purity of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, nor charity of Learned Men. Whence I cannot be ſo readily brought
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40826:267"/>
to believe, but rather demur to their ſayings, and the frequent miraculous Performances which are ſaid to be done by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, of which both <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> makes mention; neither can I believe all the Miracles ſaid to be done by him, but ſhall rather joyn in Opinion with Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> who ſaith, That he who believes all which St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> and his Companions are ſaid to have done, had need to have a hard Plate in his Front that reports it, and he a ſoft place in his Head which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it: Many Miracles ſaid to be done by him, being rather but lightly to be touch'd, leſt by long handling they come to be cruſh'd, and ſo vaniſh either into Smoak or Vapor. Let King <hi>Edward</hi> the Single and Famous be our Engliſh Hero, and the Glory of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles about this time of the Church, be alone had in Veneration, of whom I ſhall more enlarge in its proper place.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Its Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients and Moderns.</note>Here St. <hi>Malachias,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Armach,</hi> of whom St. <hi>Bernard</hi> writes in his life-time, is ſaid to perform many Miracles, the which he acted not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40826:267"/>
according to the form and method of former times: For if we read him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, we ſhall find, he neither want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Propheſie or Revelation, nor the Gift of Healing, nor changing of Minds, nor raiſing the Dead. And St. <hi>Bernard</hi> doth place him before his Companions, for he is ſaid, in one day the Dioceſs of <hi>Conſtantinianus,</hi> to cure eleven which were Blind, and ten Lame Creatures. And if <hi>Antoninus</hi> may be believ'd, the true Witneſs of theſe Times, the Miracles of the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Age of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and St. <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi> of <hi>Senens</hi> there Recorded, are plainly ſaid to be incredible: Let their Faith be according to their Authors. As to the main thereof, this I can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, as all the Miracles ſaid to be done by them may in no means be allowed falſe, but ſomewhat of Truth may go along with them, yet what part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which is ſo, is ſo intermix'd with falſhood, that it is no eaſie matter to diſtinguiſh between them: And as I ſhall not much pin my Faith upon their Miracles, ſo will I not detract from the Virtue of Gods Servants, or rather the Finger of God working by them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:40826:268"/>All Ages have had their falſe and ſeducing Lights of Faith in them, by which we have ſeen the infinite ſhapes of Vizards, Prodigies, and Romantick Stories moſt excellently delineated; all which were deſigned to cheat the fooliſh, and to bring the illiterate into the ready Knowledge and Worſhip of unknown Gods. Hence had our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Idolatry its firſt Birth and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: hence followed the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Idols, Invocating of dead Souls, Adoration of Statues, ſending Indulgences from their dead Caves, and the like unheard of Fallacies. Hath not <hi>England</hi> its miraculous way of Healing, and in this do we meet any of theſe Figments go along with it, or concern'd with any part thereof? Doth not St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf ſay, That all Saints have not this Sanative Power given them, nor all the Gifts of Divination, more than the Gift of Propheſying, and the like. St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> doth ſhew ſome ſigns hereof, and anſwers the Queſtion when he faith, Signs are made that Men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by might be brought to believe: and he further enquires, Why in the times
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40826:268"/>
of the Apoſtles theſe ſigns were made, and not in his time; he reſolves this likewiſe, when he ſaith, By how much the more certain and neceſſary theſe things are, the leſs Faith they do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them; and by how much the Argument is the more certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, by ſo much the value of its Faith is detracted: therefore Signs in preſence are not to be done.

This is not to be paſt with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſaith <hi>Magdeburgenſis,</hi> that the Apoſtles did affirm the Gifts of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Miracles, ſhould reach all Ages: for without doubt, amongſt the reſt theſe would foreſhew the Evangelical Doctrines being confirmed: But they do not mention this Healing Faculty amongſt the reſt of their Miniſterial Functions: <hi>I exhort therefore, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for Kings, and all that are in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 13.

of Healing, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>which was not diſtributed to all alike, for all have not this given to them.</hi> Thus much thereof from Eccleſiaſtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories: it is moſt probable this ſtill doth continue amongſt us, yet it is not allowed as a Miracle, nor brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Number, nor Species, nor Dignity: It is a great Gift, and no vulgar one, not proper to all ſorts of Men; not to thoſe of the Church, although otherwiſe gifted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But is a Gift confirmed on Chriſtian Kings, whoſe Patrimonial Virtue of Sanative Power doth run in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Line, who do peaceably poſſeſs the ſame to them and their Heirs, holding the ſame of the Almighty in chief; and this may not much come beneath an External Miracle, the Church calls it. The inward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed the Spiritual Miracles, and theſe are performed in all places, and at all times, by Adminiſtring of the Word, the Prayers of Holy Men, by the virtue of our Bleſſed Saviour, and this diſpenſed by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; amongſt which are reckoned the raiſing from the Dead, the keeping

                     <p>HItherto hath our Diſcourſe kept company with its Witneſſes, which hath plentifully declared its long continuance; and this atteſted as well by the light of Examples, as by the fulneſs of Reaſons, to take off all Calumny that dare interpoſe upon this Soveraign and Royal Gift. This Gift and its uſe evermore keeping time together, and are neither to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned or diſcluded by time or place: If therefore we would defend the Truth thereof, we ought to conſider the Qualities of the Perſons thus gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what kind of Men they are, how well Qualified, with what Holineſs endowed, with what Faith exerciſed, with what Manners inſtituted, with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40826:270"/>
what Religion polliſhed, with what Dignity adorned, and with what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Virtues cheriſhed? all which do declare the aſcent of their Honor; being as ſo many ſteps to their heighth of perfection, every of which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center in the ſearch of the Cauſe by which they do arrive at this Sanative Faculty. Its credible alſo that Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, and Antichriſt, and with him Antichriſtians and Hereticks, and ill Chriſtians, ſomtimes have been ſeen making Signs and Prodigious things. But ſuch as do the ſame in the light, and in the view of the Church, muſt needs be of the number of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, being in the order of pious Men, and ſuch as do obſerve Religion in its true order and decency. And <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> doth affirm this as a reaſon of the ſame, when he ſaith, Every fair work doth adorn the Houſe of God: And then he adds, We have ſeen Holy men doing great and wonderful Things, as cleanſing the Lepers, caſting out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, curing the Sick and Lame by the Touch, and the like. Theſe ſomtimes being ſhewn and done by perſons of another rank, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. who ſhall in Chriſts name be ſaid to caſt out evil
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40826:271"/>
Spirits, and yet keep the ſame Spirit within themſelves: And this <hi>Gregory</hi> juſtifies when he ſaith, Many come, and ſay they do work Miracles in Chriſts Name, many in the name of Antichriſt; and of theſe Tribes are many falſe Prophets, and many work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Dark, who dare not venture at the light of the Sun their miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous proceedings.</p>

And whatſoever this black kind of pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Curers may do, I am ſure whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is thus done, is compleated by the Devil their Tutor: Of this kind was the Magick of the Gentiles, writ by St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> And without all doubt, This Maſter of Black Art inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing with theſe his Pupils, can work wonderful things. <hi>Suetonius</hi> is not to be contemned, who declares, That <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperor did reſtore ſight to the Blind man of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and made the Lame walk. But <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> with more truth denies the Poſition; for this Cure was procured
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40826:271"/>
by ill method, affirming, That thoſe Diſeaſes which are in their own Nature curable, do require and deſerve leſs of Diabolical Art to aſſiſt them. This <hi>Evil</hi> named by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> was a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe wholly generated from the Evil Spirit, the which falling in one of his Eyes, and into one of his Feet, did hinder the uſe of his Members; and therefore the means which hurt him, was found to be the beſt Remedy to cure him.</p>
                     <p>Satan is a wonderful Artiſt, and a great Profeſſor of admirable Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: The ſame may be ſaid of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and his followers, all which are not to be reckoned in the ſame day with the ſublime gifts of good Men. Magicians and Antichriſtians do work much after one and the ſame method, but neither of them after the good Rules of pious and good Chriſtians. For as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> writes, Magicians do work Miracles one way, good Men another way; ill Men only by Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal Contract,<note place="margin">If any Miracle wrought, this to be attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Church.</note> good Men by publick Juſtice, evil Men under the reſemblance of the ſame. Ill men do work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the ſanctity of the Church, not in the ſanctity of the Perſon, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40826:272"/>
and eſtabliſhing of his Faith: The which alſo is imitated by the worſt ſort of Men, but in another form and manner. <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us, That Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Miracles do ſomtimes ſhew San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, not make it, but Spiritual Gifts wrought in the Mind, do not ſhew the Virtue of Life, but do form it: But this is ſcarce the property of any Saint. And St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth give a very good reaſon for the ſame, when he ſaith, Theſe Miracles are not given to all Holy men: Nor are the infirm to be deceived, for in theſe acts are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er good things ſhewn, than in the works of Juſtice, to which Eternal Life is compared. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle raiſed the Dead, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did many Wonders which were beyond many Chriſtians power and skill to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at or attain. But whence had they this? Their names were writ in Heaven. In Miracles the curioſity of the Eye is deſired, but this is not from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The true Rule therefore of Miracles is this, If God gives the power of doing good to any one, let him proſecute the ſame and proſper in the action. Theſe being given accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will which can and will do
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40826:272"/>
what he pleaſeth: In former times we have ſhewed that this Gift was beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Pious and Religious Men, of which ſort in thoſe times were great plenty to be found. But our ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages have much leſſened in the number thereof: For in our days, not only paucity of People are thus gifted, but the Gift it ſelf is celebrated and known of uſe by its effects by very few; and thoſe which are ſeen thus to enjoy them are the Heads of the Church, and the chief Rulers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and People; as Kings, Princes, and Governors.</p>

                     <p>Thus to <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> he gave the Gift of proclaiming the firſt of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelick Emperors, commanded by him to his Succeſſors: To <hi>Theodoſius</hi> he gave power to entrench and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Religion, as with a quick Hedge, made and confirmed by a knot of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Law, which had heretofore been ſhaken with the various Storms and troubleſom Tempeſts of Hereſies.

Power of our Engliſh Kings, under whoſe Government moſt of the French Provinces were once ſubjected. For it appears by uncontroulable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Evidences, that both the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France</hi> have for many years been inveſted with this Miraculous Gift: ſo that our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Kings are the eldeſt Brothers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and had this in its firſt poſſeſſion: For if St. <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> of whom we have already made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who was contemporary with our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, was the firſt of that Royal Race which healed the Evil; his Cradle was more than 160 years after the Coffin of our <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor,<note place="margin">

                     <p>The truth is, dark and obſcure was the Morning of Healing, till cleared up by the bright Sunſhine of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor; and <hi>Polydorus</hi> doth declare many admirable Virtues which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40826:277"/>
he had in him; and ſome Authors do write, and amongſt the reſt, the Monks of his time had too heavy a hand in ſpicing his Life with Miracles, making the relation thereof too hot for any Guſt of moderate belief. There is no queſtion but that there are many things recorded of this great Man which do carry abundance of truth in them; but again, many other things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him, which with ſafety of truth are not to come within the rule of a general acceptation; and amongſt the reſt this may ſerve as one, That he was declared King by conſent of his Parliament, when as yet he was in his Mothers Womb, his Father ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many other Sons alive, the holy Monk <hi>Brightwold</hi> of <hi>Glaſſenbury</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring their loſs, had in Viſion this <hi>Edward,</hi> then an Exile, preſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who then anointing him King in his ſight, telling him his Reign ſhould be peaceable, and Twenty three years for continuance: <hi>Brightwold</hi> being yet unſatisfied who ſhould next ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, demanded the Reſolution, and was by <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered, That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi> was Gods own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40826:278"/>
for whoſe Succeſſors himſelf would provide: with ſuch vain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions our otherwiſe true Stories of him are overcharged, that <hi>Comineus</hi> being hereby therewith moved, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tax the Engliſh with over-much credulity that way. As to this great Man's Birth, he was born at <hi>Iſlip</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and was Son of King <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theldred,</hi> Queen <hi>Emma</hi> being his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who by her Maternal affection ſent him into <hi>Normandy</hi> to Duke <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> her Brother, to reſcue him from all Domeſtick Quarrels; and before the dead Corps of his Father was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, with a general conſent of the Nobles, he was choſen King: his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation was at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of which was performed by <hi>Edſine</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Eaſter</hi>-day 1040. he being then towards forty years of age, and was in number the 37th Monarch of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he Reigned with that Juſtice and Clemency, that he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Venerable Name of Saint, and is diſtinguiſhed from the other <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> by the Title of Confeſſor; and that he deſigned his Crown ſhould continue in the Engliſh Blood, he

ſent for <hi>Edward</hi> his Nephew, the Son of <hi>Edward Ironſide,</hi> who ſo long kept out of <hi>England,</hi> that he was called <hi>Outlaw,</hi> and him he intended Heir to the Engliſh Crown, had not haſty Death prevented, and put a ſtop to his Inclinations: He Reigned Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three years and ſix months, and died the fourth of <hi>January</hi> 1066.</p>
                     <p>And now as to his excellent Deeds; He appeared in the World not like a Mortal Creature, his Miracles and Preſages much keeping reſemblance with thoſe of the Apoſtles, the which here to aſſert, were to fill up whole Leaves with a needleſs ſurcharge, and create a ſuſpition of other great and admirable things done by him. He was famous for many perſonal Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the which he is ſaid to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed as an Hereditary Virtue on his Succeſſors the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> only with this condition, That they do ſupport and maintain the Chriſtian Faith, as to the cure of this Struma, or the Diſeaſe commonly called The Kings-Evil; the which Diſeaſe this King cured only by his laying his hands on the ſick party; and this hath ever ſince continued in the Princely
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40826:279"/>
Line, where the Scepter hath been weighed by Gods Vicegerent. But as to the Origination of this Cure, there is ſtill much controverſie kept up amongſt the Learned,<note place="margin">Divers O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions about this Gift.</note> ſome num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the ſame amongſt <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, whoſe reaſon is not to be ſhewn; others do bring it to the power of fancy, and an exalted imagination. Thus when a poor Creature who never ſaw the preſence of a King, ſhall behold his Princely and Royal Hand with a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable confidence and touch to chaſe away his troubleſome and loathſome Swellings; to ſee a Hand ſo humble, of an Arm ſo high, ſhew ſuch conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention; of a King ſo great to ſtroak the Sores of ſo mean, and low, and deſpicable a Subject; to ſee Him who ſits in his Royal Chair, vouchſafe his Preſence and helping Hand, where many or moſt of his Subjects would both ſtop their Noſtrils, and ſhut their Eyes at, as ſcorning to come near them; this may well raiſe and enlarge the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients fancy, ſummoning his Spirits to aſſiſt Nature for the encountring this Diſeaſe with the utmoſt might.</p>

                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:40826:279"/>Other Learned Men, and amongſt theſe particularly <hi>Caſper Peucerus,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though acquitting this Cure from Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Conjuration, yet taxes the ſame as guilty of Superſtition; and with him all ſuch others do leſſen the brightneſs thereof, who do or dare quarrel at the Ceremonies uſed at this Healing; being either diſpleaſed at the Collect read here, as nothing relating to this purpoſe, or unreſolved at the efficacy of the Gold put about the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients neck, or ſecretly unſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: All which Exceptions muſt needs fall to the ground, when it ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed and made good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the omiſſion of ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies (being nearer kin to the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity than aſſiſtance to the Cure) the bare Hands of our Kings having oft effected the ſame to a Miracle. Some there are again who make this a clear Miracle, with Gods own Finger put into the Healing hands; ſo that when the Art of Phyſick is <hi>nonpluſt,</hi> and Chirurgery tyed up, and all other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane means baffled, that then this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which was made by the hand of God, ſhould be thus cured by the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40826:280"/>
hand of his Vicegerent, doth not come much beneath one.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, I would willingly ſee what ſhould give any denial to any reaſonable Man hereof, ſince we find every Vegetable hath its virtue and energy given to it, and allowed it: And that neither Stones, Metals, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or Herbs themſelves, and the like, do but ſhew forth and declare the honor of their Maker, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us their various Virtues, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers diſtributive uſes for the good of all Mankind. And why ſhould we Men, and Chriſtians, and true Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> be ſo narrow Soul'd as not to conceive, that Chriſtian Men, the moſt noble of all Corporeal Creatures; and Kings, the moſt of Chriſtians; and Kings of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> the firſt-fruits of all Chriſtian Kings, ſhould not receive this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian peculiar Priviledge and Sanative Power; whereof daily inſtances do give us a greater light of the truth thereof. And here we may ſee the difference between Papiſts and ill Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants: the firſt courting theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, even in their Embrio, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

they come at any appearance of Birth, greedy to catch hold at the very empty ſhadows and reſemblances thereof, whil'ſt the ill-natur'd Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Diſſenter are ſo far from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving credence to the truth thereof, which every day manifeſts to their eyes, that they bend that little Faith they have utterly againſt it, be it brought to them by the pureſt Light and brighteſt Reaſon. This Royal Gift hath been preſerved in the Royal Line, and maintained by theſame above 640 Years and upwards, and is ſeen every day more and more to flouriſh amongſt us, to the eaſe, comfort and relief, of many thouſands of poor Souls: If therefore there be any that can pretend to have had an earlier poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion thereof than we have, they muſt be of a more ancient Standing, and they muſt take it (as the School hath it) from God himſelf: and from the firſt of Chriſtianity to its eldeſt ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:40826:283"/>And becauſe I have been oft conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and attending at many of theſe laudible Operations, having waited on his Sacred Perſon both at publick and private Healings, as one of his meaneſt Chirurgions, where I have ſeen many thouſands of poor Souls touch'd and cured by his Sacred Hand (and as a more particular account hath lately been given in, that he hath healed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Six thouſand this very laſt year) I am obliged both by Duty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to give my Faith to his Royal Touch, ſeeing the daily and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable effects thereof: Many of which, as if amazed at the ſpeedy farewel of their Diſeaſes, have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly been cured to admiration, even in the Preſence, before they have got out of the Banquetting-houſe at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where his Majeſty doth moſt uſually heal; and ſome, although brought in Lame and Blind, yet have within a very little and ſhort ſpace of time, recovered their Limbs and gained their Sight, as will plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be made good by divers Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in our laſt Chapter. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Opinion ſome men may have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40826:284"/>
of our Prince and of our Religion we do profeſs in <hi>England,</hi> as alſo of his great Piety, Charity and Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; yet this I will not be afraid to affirm to any Man, of what averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſoever, That when both in Town and Country, the beſt Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Chirurgions have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted for curing the Sick troubled with this Evil Diſeaſe, and their beſt Skill and utmoſt Art hath been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and yet proved uſeleſs and of none effect, ſuch afterwards who have come and obtained his Majeſties Gracious Touch, their Diſeaſes have been ſeen immediatly to vaniſh, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid of approaching his Royal Touch. If he therefore were not the right Heir to the Crown (which I hope the worſt of Mankind dare not pretend to confute) and conducted thither by Divine Authority, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd in his Throne by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, theſe wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects would not ſo apparently be ſeen performed by him: For this Work carries more of Divinity than Majeſty in it, and is wholly the Gift of Divine Majeſty; and when both
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40826:284"/>
theſe meet together, and Center in their right Lines, you will ever find a Divine Bleſſing interpoſing.</p>
                     <p>And as a farther acknowledgment of His Majeſties ſucceſs herein, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I may, perhaps, by the beſt of Authority, give as full an account of <hi>Struma</hi>'s as any before me, as to a Curative Method; Yet when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his Majeſties gracious Touch, I find my ſelf readily <hi>nonpluſt,</hi> and ſhall ever affirm, That all Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever muſt truckle to the ſame, and come ſhort of his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and miraculous method of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and for further manifeſtation hereof, I do humbly preſume to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, That more Souls have been Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by His Majeſties Sacred Hand in one Year, than have ever been cured by all the Phyſicians and Chirurgions of his three Kingdoms ever ſince His happy Reſtauration. Whereas ſhould an Uſurper or Tyrant ſurreptitiouſly, by Pride and Bloody Maſſacre, forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enter his Royal Throne and touch at the ſame Experiment, you'l ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee ſuch happy ſucceſs; as tryed by the late Uſurper <hi>Cromwell</hi> in the late Rebel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lious
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40826:285"/>
Times, Influences flow from thence, he having no more right to the Healing Power, than he had to the Regal Juriſdiction: His Tryal rather chequering and darkning the bright Rays hereof and ſo bringing it into Obſcurity, than affording it any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Light. Let no Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſume to lay violent hands on Gods Anointed, he having from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as a particular Mark and ſignal Token, this Curative Faculty tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, and implanted in him as a Seal of his Mercy, Clemency, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Providence, Omnipotence, and Truth thereof. And let this Healing Virtue of our King, amongſt our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> bear the time of a Miracle, if not allowed to keep equal pace and touch with the ſame.</p>

                     <p>WE come now to ſhew the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Form of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Gracious Healing, wherein we ſhall preſent the Ceremonies thereat uſed; in which Diſcourſe, we muſt acknowledge His Religion, Piety, Charity, Clemency and Humility, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing as ſo many Gems belonging to His Royal Perſon; into whoſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Hand, above all His People, is this moſt Divine Gift ſetled and confirmed, the which He exerciſeth as frequently as He pleaſeth, being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupplicated thereto by ſome of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40826:286"/>
His Nobles, or of the Poor themſelves who are thus afflicted, which He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms both by publick and private Healings: And as a ſignal favour of Him herein, He never makes any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Perſons, being either Young or Old, Rich or Poor, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful or Deformed, every of which do receive a like ſhare of His Sacred Touch.</p>
                     <p>And that none may approach His Royal Preſence but ſuch as are really troubled with the Evil, ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are appointed for this great Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; amongſt the firſt of which are His Majeſties Chirurgeons in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who are to take in Certificates, and deliver out Tickets in order to a Healing or Healings; where this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing method is to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p>No Patient having this Diſeaſe ſhould come to the Chirurgeons for a Ticket, without he or ſhe brings with them a Certificate, ſigned and ſealed under the Miniſters and Church-wardens Hands that they were never before Toucht by his Sacred Majeſty. And that no Perſon whatever may loſe their labour, as a very proper Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment by way of prevention for the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40826:286"/>
future of any further Cheats by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Certificates and the like, great care would be taken of the method of Certificates, and their form: for as theſe are the only proper Inſtruments to procure Tickets, ſo they ſhould alſo come with that juſt conduct which may defend the Bearer, and preſerve the Kings Gold. Wherefore I preſume to offer, If Printed Blank Certificates were ſent to every Biſhop of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and theſe ſigned with their own Hands and Sign Manual, and thence communicated to every Surrogate throughout his Dioceſs, who at their ſeveral Meetings &amp; Viſitations ſhould acquaint their Brother-Miniſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or diſtribute of the ſame to them, that ſuch who have the Evil may have their Names certified therein, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Miniſters and Church-wardens Hands and Seals likewiſe, and the Name or Names of ſuch diſeaſed Perſons entred in their Church-Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Book, with the day of the month, and the date of the year when ſuch Certificate was delivered out. This would be an infallible Remedy againſt all counterfeit Certificates whatever. And although this may at firſt view
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40826:287"/>
ſeem to carry trouble in it, yet being once put into practice, it will prove both very eaſie, and of great ſervice to the King and Country.</p>
                     <p>And to prevent all tireſome Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and tedious Travels of many indigent and ſick people, who do venture to march many hundred of miles not really having this Diſeaſe, ſave only on their own ſuppoſition; for a more ready piece of ſervice to theſe, to bring them to a ſhorter paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, they ſhould do well to go to ſome Neighbouring Phyſician and Chirurgeons, and get them to ſearch and examine them, to know whether their Diſeaſe be the Evil, or not: and if they find it ſo, to ſignifie the ſame under their Hands in the aforeſaid Certificate; ſo that this Certificate may very well be allowed of double uſe and advantage, as by giving eaſe and ſatisfaction to the Patient, and quiet to the Chirurgeon; the one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying that the Patient never before this came to crave His Majeſties Touch, the other confirming the Diſeaſe by Men of Art to the Chirurgeon in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:40826:287"/>This being cleared thus far, the Chirurgeon in Waiting ſhould or ought to keep a Regiſter-Book, where every Parties Name is to be kept Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabetically therein, and their Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates fill'd up. This Book alſo will ſhew its ſelf of great ſervice and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to other ſucceeding Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for as Chirurgeons are no more Immortal than other Men, ſo we ſhall find that People do not always inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and dwell in one place, or part of the World; and he that perhaps might have lived this year in one County, may the next year live in another; and ſince where-ever he lives, if he has the Evil, and be not cured thereof, and may in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gain a Certificate, and by that, Gold; ſo in another place where he goes to dwell, he may endeavour to procure another Certificate, and by this cheat the King of a ſecond piece; a trick not now to be learnt by many, but rather ſtudied by divers, who look more after the Gold than the Cure: for prevention of this, where any ſuſpected perſon ſhall come to the Chirurgeon, for the cure of ſuch Cheats, he may look over the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40826:288"/>
in his Book, and there ſee if he can find the Name of him whom he may or ſhall ſuſpect therein. I know of no other way imaginable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this Cheat; and if there were ſuch who can find out a better, they would do great ſervice to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Another advantage he will have hereby, when by this true account-keeping he may ſatisfie both His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the whole World how many are yearly Healed by His Sacred Hand.</p>
                     <p>Thus far have I preſumed to clear the method for poor Peoples making ready for their Journey towards their being healed: But after this, great care would be taken, (when they are arrived at their Happy Port, as I may well call it, it being the only aim they had in all their Travel) to meet with a quick diſpatch, in order to their ſpeedy return, and not to be kept ſo long in Town till both their Money and Credit is gone, (which God knows amongſt the generality of theſe ſort is not much nor great) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth both require and merit a ſhort, ready, and ſpeedy diſpatch.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40826:288"/>
But as the caſe now is, its harder to approach the Chirurgeon, than obtain a Touch; and more tireſome for them to wait day after day upon him, whoſe chief buſineſs ſhould be to attend their coming, than it was to get every thing in readineſs for his diſpatch of them. But there may be a convenient Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy found out for this Evil alſo, which is as bad, if not worſe, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Could His Majeſties Pleaſure be known of his times of Healings for Summer, I mean at <hi>Whitehal, Windſor,</hi> and the like, publick Notice ought to be given hereof in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> by which all people may readily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand His Majeſties Pleaſure of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the times thereof, after which none ſhould dare to preſume any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble. This being done, as an abſolute cure to delay, or any ſiniſter blind way of management, if His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would be graciouſly pleaſed to appoint ſome place in <hi>Whitehal,</hi> or other place, for the performance of this Service, where a Phyſitian and two Chirurgeons ought always to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to view, examine, and diſpatch the poor, diſeaſed, and maimed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and there, after having His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40826:289"/>
order for a Healing, acquaint them thereof, and when they are to wait to be healed: This I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will be found an excellent, as well as joyful method to the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a great deal of eaſe as well as ſatisfaction to the Chirurgion, and prove a ſignal remedy of leſſening the ill opinion the Chirurgion goes under at their continual and tedious wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at his Houſe, and abate ſomwhat of the hard cenſure is put upon him by ſeveral people.</p>
                     <p>In Winter alſo, when his Majeſty touches altogether at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> the ſame method ſhould be maintain'd, and His Majeſties pleaſure underſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, which may eaſily be known by the former directions, and the Sick with abundance of eaſe be conducted to His Majeſties preſence to be Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>It would alſo be well, that the whole World might take notice how many, and what great Cures have been performed by the King, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready offered, and how they have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at a better ſtate of health. And here may we very well bring in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other great miſtake of ſeveral People,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40826:289"/>
who when they have received His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Gracious Touch, that this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be doubled upon them, and their Gold muſt as readily be changed, elſe their Cure muſt conſequently be ineffectual, the Kings Majeſty not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed capable of curing them, without he obſerves and complies with their Humors and abominable Fancies: a confidence only grounded upon uncertainty, and kept up with immutability: a Diſtemper which ought to be inſpected as to its cure, as much as the <hi>Evil</hi> it ſelf; for its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is dangerous and deceivable; for here we have an <hi>Anguis in herbis,</hi> which doth both readily and greedily feed upon the glittering change of Gold: and this <hi>Legerdemane</hi> trick is finely performed, by putting the Change upon his Majeſty, and yet this with a diſhoneſt Man is not eaſily found out or diſcovered, but where Truth, Juſtice, and an honeſt Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion maintains the Principles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits in the Center a perfect deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch things does readily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p>I would gladly ſee any Man of ſenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the eaſineſs of the aſſertion, who may
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40826:290"/>
at a very little hole perceive how a Man, whoſe humor does cloſely ſalute advantage, and whoſe mind does keep company with ſelf-preſervation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, looking ſtill forwards to the yellow glittering Metal, to purchaſe to himſelf an advantageous parcel of Gold in time, by taking leave of changing an old piece of Gold for a new Ticket; or as I may ſay, cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King of his firſt Medal, by giving a new Ticket for a ſecond: Theſe things I have heard were in uſe very frequent formerly, and it were well if they be not by ſome to this day yet put in practice. A Remark in this Point I hope is enough, for I dare preſume to aver and offer, that there is nothing which does more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon his Majeſties Sacred Honor, or upon the welfare of them who come to receive the Bleſſing, as well as the benefit of his Healing, than the leſſening this Royal Virtue communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his Sacred Hand by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, than for ſuch who ſhould pay all Obedience and Veneration thereto, either to obſtruct the ſame if poſſibly, or abuſe to it by their dark ſiniſter or purblind bribery: As a Cure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40826:290"/>
for this alſo, if His Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſhall be graciouſly pleaſed to allow any poor Soul a ſecond Touch, let him or her, or whoever they be, bring up their own Gold to the King, and put a new Silk Ribbon into it, which if he pleaſes to put over them, will be ſufficient for them without any further charge of Gold.</p>
                     <p>There are another ſort of People who makes it their ſtudy to cheat the King of his Gold, who having been Touch'd and received their Gold, are ready to ſell and part with it; and were this not true, and very common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in practice, without all queſtion His Majeſties touching Medals would not be ſo frequently ſeen and found in Gold-Smiths ſhops; and ſince theſe Cheats are too apparent, great care ought to be made as to their Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherefore I preſume to offer, that having, as I have already mentioned, a Phyſician and two Chirurgions rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to inſpect and examine people, ſuch Cheats will not eaſily be detected, for as the Proverb ſaith, <hi>Plus vident oculi quam oculus</hi>; and the Names of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being ſet down in an Alphabetical order and method, the King cannot
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40826:291"/>
ſo eaſily be cheated, nor his Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, whoſe care it ſhould be to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſame, be either deluded or queſtioned. Thus much as to the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions Office and Duty.</p>
                     <p>The next Perſon which comes in order, is Clerk of the Cloſet to His Majeſty, who is the only proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for keeping of His Majeſties Gold uſed both at private as well as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Healings, he being Check to the Chirurgion. The great Maſter of this Office, is the Right Reverend Father in God, <hi>Nathaniel</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> who always being in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doth preſent to His Majeſties Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hand upon his Knees, ſuch Gold as is delivered out to every diſeaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Under whom Mr. <hi>Tho: Donkelly,</hi> His Majeſties Cloſet-keeper, doth alſo attend with Gold on his Arms ready ſtrung, and likewiſe doth preſent the ſame to the Clerk of the Cloſet; his Office being alſo to take an account from the Chirurgion how many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals hath at every Healing been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by His Majeſty, and to have the ſame ſignified under the hand of the chief Chirurgion in Writing in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40826:291"/>
his Regiſter Book, which he keeps on purpoſe for the ſame uſe, with the day of the Month and the date of the Year, and the numbers of them that have been Healed: He alſo, as I am well informed, doth give a Receipt to the Exchequer for all the Gold he receives, to ballance the Privy Purſe; ſo that from his Office a true and juſt account may yearly be given in, how much Gold the King doth expend on this charitable Office, and how much is annually received for this purpoſe, a draught of which ever ſince his being in this place, I have with his careful aſſiſtance, given at the end of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Evil.</p>
                     <p>Thus much of theſe Perſons and their Places.</p>
                     <p>The Tickets being delivered out, His Majeſty does generally appoint his day of Healing, of which the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is to acquaint thoſe who are to be Touch'd, the which for the moſt part does happen on Sundays; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on Sundays or other Days, it matters not much, the effects of his Cure being as good at one time as at another. The Day being come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Majeſty doth approach to His
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40826:292"/>
Royal Chair,<note place="margin">The Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies laudable.</note> which is generally after Morning Prayers, the Chief Officer of the Yeomen of the Guard doth place the ſick People in very convenient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for their approaching the King without trouble or noiſe: The which done, His Majeſty enters his Royal Chair uncovered, at whoſe beginning there are generally two Chaplains at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending: One of which reading the Ceremonies appointed for this Service, His Majeſty all the while being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by his Nobles, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spectators: The ſick and diſeaſed People being kept back by the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions till the appointed time, where after having made three Obeiſancies, they do bring them up in order. The chief in waiting delivers them one by one to the King to be Touch'd; the which done, the other takes him or her from him, and this method is uſed throughout the whole number which comes to be Healed.</p>
                     <p>The whole Method is as followeth. The Chaplain thus begins: The Goſpel written in the 16th <hi>Chapter</hi> of St. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Jeſus appeared unto the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as they ſat at meat, and caſt in their teeth their unbelief, and hardneſs of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40826:292"/>
heart, becauſe they had not believed them which had ſeen that he was riſen again from the dead. And he ſaid unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to all creatures, he that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned: all theſe tokens ſhall follow them that believe. In my name they ſhall caſt out devils, they ſhall ſpeak with new tongues, they ſhall drive away ſerpents. And if they drink any deadly thing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Where the infirm Perſons are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King on their knees, the King lays his hands upon them.</note> 
                        <hi>it ſhall not hurt them. <hi>They ſhall lay their hands on the ſick, and they ſhall recover.</hi>
                        </hi> The which Saying is continued between every Healing of His Sacred Majeſty, till all the Sick be touch'd by him; the which being finiſh'd, he begins this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So when the Lord had ſpoken unto them, he was received into Heaven, and is on the right hand of God. And they went forth and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word with miracles following.</hi> The which done, he begins the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel written in the firſt Chapter of St. <hi>John, ver.</hi> the firſt: <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40826:293"/>
God, and God was the Word; the ſame was in the beginning with God, all things were made by it, and without it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing made which was made: in it was life, and the life was the light of men, and the light ſhined in the darkneſs, and the darkneſs comprehended it not. There was ſent a man from God, whoſe name was</hi> John, <hi>the ſame came as a witneſs, to bear witneſs of the light, that all men, through him might believe. He was not that Light, but was ſent to bear witneſs of that Light.</hi> Here the Chirurgions come up the ſecond time, making their three Obeiſances as formerly, where the Clerk of the Cloſet on his Knees doth deliver to the King his Gold ready ſtrung upon a white Silk Ribbond; and when theſe following words come to be read, the King puts over the Gold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King, add the King puts the Gold about their necks.</note>
                        <hi>That Light was the true Light, which lightneth every man which cometh into the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This running through the whole courſe of the Ceremony, which words are continually repeated between eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one which receives the Gold. This
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40826:293"/>
being finiſhed, Theſe following words are read: <hi>He was in the world, and the world was wade by him, and the world knew him not; he came amongſt his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them he gave power to be made ſons of God: even them that believed on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor yet of the will of man, but of God. And the ſame Word became fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us, and we ſaw the glory of it, as the glory of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of the Father, full of Grace and Truth.</hi>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40826:295"/>
the Author of the whole Work being the Holy Spirit, and this Gift ariſing thence with both its uſe and fruit. Here's nothing but Benediction, and Prayers for the recovery of the Sick, Impoſition of Hands, and Contraction of Health, the ſame Ceremony uſed as is uſed at Baptiſm, the putting over the Gold being but as a Sacred Gift and Pledge of His Charity. In the whole, there is nothing but God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, Chriſt venerated, and poor Chriſtians cured, without any Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Cheats of Black Arts, Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Evil Spirits, Characters, or the like deluſions, all which I hope may not come ſhort of an Engliſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. How therefore ſhould all true Engliſh-men, and Sons of the Church, adore, and have in high reverence that great Soveraign, who can give eaſe to the Diſeaſed, by his Touching ſuch as are not only deſpicable to view, but fetid to ſmell, who makes no difference, as I have already ſhewn, between Great and Small, Peer and Peaſant, Delicate or Deformed? What therefore can there be which might not make the moſt Ungrateful Man change his rude temper, and ſweeten
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40826:295"/>
it with a better belief? Let all the World therefore admire our Engliſh Monarch, who can by His Salutife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gift diſtribute Health and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all His diſeaſed Subjects, not performing this in corners, but in the publick view of all His Subjects, in his Royal Palace, and in places appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Divine Worſhip, and in the Holy Sanctuary. And this I hope may be a convincing Argument enough againſt any Gainſayer or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter whatſoever, who are neither kind to themſelves, or civil to others.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VIII. This ſhews the Certainty of its Events, and the Admirable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of its Cure.</head>
                     <p>THe truth is, this great Gift of Healing doth call the Chriſtians Faith, and alſo Humane Reaſon into conſent therewith; for without theſe do march together, the Events will not anſwer expectation. And in truth would be againſt <hi>God</hi> himſelf as well as His Sacred Majeſty, to wiſh for Health, and not preſerve the memory of thoſe great Cures done by Him; to read their Names thus cured, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to Poſterity, if Faith did not march along with it: For what is worſe than to bury the knowledge of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Favours done? the only black mark of Ingratitude, and nothing more kind than to allow the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40826:296"/>
memorable Cures done: For what is Piety but a willing conſent thereto in its Parents? and what more kind than to allow the ſame to the Father of our Nation? Our Faith doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore command our keeping in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Health we receive from our Gracious Soveraign, and to regiſter the ſame in our belief; ſince we find theſe Diſeaſes do no more ſpare the proud Citizen, than the deſpicable Country-man, and that both theſe have found benefit by His Majeſties Gracious Hand, is as clear as the Sun that ſhines: Hath not the French,<note place="margin">The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all Perſons of the World.</note> Dutch, Scotch, Iriſh, Welſh, and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, been all happy partakers of the benefit of His Majeſties Gracious Touch? Hath there been ſcarce any City, Town or Country which cannot ſpeak well of His Curative Faculty? Has there or is there ſcarce a Street in this Populous City, that hath not found the benefit of His Sacred Hand? And yet as if this Diſeaſe did get a new Birth by Converſation, it meets the King where-ever He goes, with as much vigour and plenty as if the work were now to begin. And as a very ſtrange remark hereof, although I do
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40826:297"/>
believe near half the Nation hath been Toucht and Healed by His Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſince His Happy Reſtauration; yet upon any new appearance of a freſh Healing, they are ſeen to come in afreſh, and as faſt as if not one had yet been Toucht by Him: A thing as ſtrange as monſtrous!</p>
                     <p>To my own knowledge I have known many perfectly cured the firſt time,<note place="margin">Some cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the firſt time. Others not cured till the ſecond Touch. Some ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Gold, their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe hath ſeized them afreſh.</note> they having been Touched by His Sacred Majeſty. Others again ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſeen healed upon His ſecond Touch, which could not receive the ſame benefit the firſt time. Some again having received His Majeſties gracious Touch, and loſing their Gold, their Diſtemper has <hi>De Novo</hi> ſeized them again; and theſe alſo upon gaining a ſecond Touch, and new Gold, their Diſeaſes have been ſeen utterly to have been chaſed away, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves perfectly cured.</p>
                     <p>Now as to particular times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Healings, as <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> and the like,<note place="margin">As to the Healing on <hi>Good-Friday.</hi>
                        </note> which do carry a ſtrong Faith with ſome people, who unleſs they can be Toucht by the King that time, their belief is ſo weak and tender, that they do preſume and ſuppoſe any
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40826:297"/>
other time in the year is not ſo fitting, or do or can carry the ſame efficacy. But to theſe delicate ſort of people,<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome not being cured.</note> who I am ſubject to believe are as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in their Faith as they are in their Opinions; and unleſs the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will pleaſe ſo far to condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend as in every degree to anſwer their Humours, by working more than an ordinary Miracle in them, they may with abundance of eaſe be brought to think that there is little or no effect of cure in the whole. A ſin I am ſure it is to tie the Almighty to particular times and ſeaſons, and therefore not to be accounted (amongſt Men of ſenſe) to have more efficacy than at other times.</p>
                     <p>And to put ſtop to another old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion of the Gold;<note place="margin">The put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over the Gold only a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Charity.</note> which is, If the King doth not find, and give the Gold, as well as put the ſame over their Necks, this will not anſwer expectation, ſome of theſe ſort putting a higher eſteem upon the Gold, than upon the Hand that put it about their Necks. But all ſuch may know that this Gold thus uſed and imployed, is no more than a reſemblance of Health, for the Cure has oft been ſeen done
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40826:298"/>
without any Gold at all given, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſame has been performed only by Silver, as ſhall be made good by ſeveral Examples in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Another ſort of people alſo there are,<note place="margin">About changing the Gold.</note> who if they can procure the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from the Chirurgeon to procure them a ſecond Touch, they muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have their Gold alſo changed, (ſome effect of which I have already toucht at) as if the later Gold had any more effect in it than the former, they both coming from one and the ſame Royal Hand; an unneceſſary trouble, as little efficacious, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more deceitful. And that Gold is not the great Ingredient in this Cure, may eaſily be thus proved, by calling into remembrance the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Times, when Tyrants turned this once happy Nation into an Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of Confuſion, and by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful upſet High Court of Juſtice, or rather Injuſtice, forced the beſt of Kings, where He was wont to ſhew the Grandure of His Majeſty due to Princes, there to make His Funeral Pulpit, laying down the Sacred Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of His Greatneſs, whereon the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40826:298"/>
Enſigns of Renown had formerly been planted, by their curſed Hands, and compell'd to quit His three Nations by their moſt curſed and barbarous Cruciations; and yet all this done under pretence of Devotion and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, bringing Him under their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Judgment, to ſubmit to their bold and bloody Aſſaſſination; in whoſe horrid Maſſacre, and after whoſe inhumane and barbarous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collation, its pretious Blood left not its vigour which it kept whilſt it was warm in His Purple Veins, being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken up by Handkerchiefs, or collected by other things, with which theſe Strumous Swellings being but touched, or therewith concerned, they have ſeen ſuddainly to vaniſh and diſappear: and this alſo ſhall be made good by ſome Obſervations thereof in my laſt Chapter. And if His Royal Corps, ſtript from Life, was thus accompanied with this Divine and Heavenly Virtue, what ſhall we think and ſay of the Action perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Life, as by the Bleſt and Sacred Hands of our Dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign? Beſides, if the Virtue did wholly lodge in the Gold, I would
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40826:299"/>
have ſuch as give this great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſame, to make tryal of a piece of their own Gold, in putting the ſame about their own Necks, and ſee then if this will in any meaſure anſwer their deſired ends: The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs I leave to them who ſhall ſhew their folly as well as give themſelves trouble to make ſuch a tryal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two may be very well gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted convincing Arguments enough to prove the truth hereof: for this of His Majeſties pretious Blood was ſeen done, and known to be performed in the midſt of the Kings Enemies, and in thoſe times when Trayterous Uſurpers took leave to enter the Royal Throne; where not only the troubleſome Mobile, but the rigid Maſters of Presbytery and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, were ſo far from agreeing and conſenting to His Majeſties Healing Faculty, that the little Faith they had, they employed to confound the ſame: ſuch were the great Reverence theſe Rebellious Tribes gave to this Divine Virtue. And in this I may preſume poſitively to affirm, that ſuch as do not give Credance to the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40826:299"/>
King as Gods Vicegerent, and to the many thouſands cured thus by Him, they do, ever did, and ever ſhall be thought to give as little belief to God Himſelf, let His Miracles be never ſo many, or never ſo great, ſuch being their churliſh Humour, and ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Diſpoſitions.</p>
                     <p>To the believing Man, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, That according to their proportion of Faith they do, may, and ſhall be great Sharers in this Sanative Faculty. And as a farther Confirmation of the ſame, he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus every unbelieving Man may reſt ſatisfied, that without he brings Faith enough with him, and in him, that His Majeſty hath Virtue enough in His Touch to Heal him, his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation will not be anſwered: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Man of Faith, who confides on the ſame, will as readily find the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the ſame. And although this method doth not always anſwer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40826:300"/>
yet its Effects are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and its Cure moſt frequent, as is and hath been ſufficiently and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily made good. And this may appear as a Vindication of the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of its Events, as alſo of the Admirability of the Effects of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Sanative Power.</p>

And in undertaking hereof, I hope I have made ſome on-ſet already: but leſt this ſhould not be prevalent enough to conquer their incredulity,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40826:301"/>
I ſhall offer this as a farther Anſwer: Whereas there are ſome who do whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny the ſubſtance of the Action, and preſume to call the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;<note place="margin">Various Opinions as to this Cure,</note> and others, who do not ſo much blame the thing it ſelf, as the ſubſtance thereof and its Ceremonies, bringing hereby the whole Operation under Superſtition, whil'ſt others by ſpleen, diſdain, ridicule, and private injury, will needs put a blind upon this moſt excellent Operation, altho confirmed to them by Ocular Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration as clear as the Sun; and are not to be brought to the belief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, although they ſee it done before their eyes, no ways allowing a Divine Power going along therewith, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed by Man. To what an Age of Incredulity are we arrived at, where reſolution, ſpleen, and injury, ſhall confirm a Mans oppoſition to the very light of Reaſon and Truth it ſelf? where we ſhall have Men bid defiance to His Majeſties humility which he ſhews in this Operation; to his Piety and pious bounty which he liberally beſtows on his Diſeaſed Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to the Cures thus daily performed by his Sacred Hand, who

And as a cloſe to their black lips, I will preſume to offer, That when the moſt Learned have worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with all reverence writ here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and have neither been aſhamed nor afraid to proclaim to all the world the many miraculous Cures which have been thus performed by His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſties Hand, and for many hundred of Years kept up by the Princely Line, their Incerdulity may well be called into queſtion, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving validity enough in it to ballance thoſe weighty and great Opinions which ever have, and ſtill do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame: And where I have as a guard to my Opinion, the beſt of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity oppoſing the greateſt Scruples that can be made as to this matter, ſeeing ſome ſo extraordinary hot for leſſening wholly any Virtue in the Gold or Silver, or the like, which ſhall be put about the Patients necks, and abominate the uſe thereof with all their hearts, in any other but in

                     <p>There are another ſort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who are inward enemies to this Sanative Gift, evermore doubting of its clearneſs; and theſe do hug them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in oppoſing and contradicting all ſuch as ſhall ſpeak well thereof. Of which ſort may <hi>Caſper Peucerus</hi> be well reckoned one, of whom we have already given you an account, both as to his Religion, and unhappy Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And I believe we have too many more of his Opinion at this day, who ſhould they ſee our Soveraign heal, and exerciſe the ſame Gift daily, yet this their curſed Opinion and Humor ſticks ſo cloſe to them, that they will ſcarce give it leave to breath, or gain any reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: And although it may get footing into a more favorable O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion amongſt ſome of them, that all this is done without any Inchantment, or ill and black methods uſed, yet they do receive it with that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it muſt gain upon them by degrees, and takes ſometime before
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40826:303"/>
they can work them into any belief thereof. And ſince it doth require no eaſie task either to pleaſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute theſe Adverſaries as to the Fact it ſelf, who cannot aſſent to the manner of performing thereof, although ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leſs reaſon to diſſent from the ſame: Theſe following Reaſons, I hope, may in ſome meaſure make the task neither ſo uneaſie as may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Thus therefore this Healing Faculty is not produced, <hi>ex ſemine,</hi> by an Ingenite Faculty which may be produced with the nature thereof, as many Phyſical Virtues are thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and by ſimilitude of Bodies and Manners taking their firſt <hi>Idaea</hi>'s thence, as one Body being productive out of another, but no Soul thus produced out of another, every Man generating his like in Specie, not in dividual Quality. Such therefore who would thus preſs down with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition this Healing Faculty, have leſs need to doubt of that which the Learned hath ſo highly writ thereof, and maintained as in the Inaugurated Rights of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France.</hi> Since God himſelf is he that createth Kings, and Anoints their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40826:304"/>
Royal Hands with the Sacred Oyl, as with a Royal Balſamick Virtue, by which doth ariſe other Gifts of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Councel, Prudence, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance like Chriſtian Kings, as well as in this of Healing. <hi>Peucerus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly calls this, <hi>The admirable paſtimes of Events,</hi> at which I wonder more, than at his other odd Perſwaſion, whereas there is ſuch a diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them of Miracles, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Gifts of Healing (not only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by us, but by all our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Nations) that our Engliſh have that perfect abhorrence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that we are as much purged and cleanſed from the ſame, as the Houſe of God with <hi>Hezechia</hi> and <hi>Joſias</hi> was purified from all its corruptions. But what need I bring Examples to confute this ridiculous Opinion of his, ſince we find that he himſelf doth fall to the ground, and acts in the dark? Let us therefore recede from this one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, to prevent our falling into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, by keeping the middle way. <hi>Peucerus</hi> only fell from <hi>Augerius,</hi> even as the Meteologer doth from the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, and both from true Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. <hi>Augerius Ferrerius de Gordonis</hi>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:40826:304"/>
ſaith, That he and other Phyſicians being much addicted to the Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Charms, which were preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent againſt Bleeding, and other Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſtempers, having in them the Faculty of curing intermitting Fevers, and many other Diſeaſes of that ſort, thus proceeds therein. The event of which Cure is not to be taken from the Characters, nor from the Chatm only, but this working ſuch power in our minds, that we therewith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, this gets fancy alſo to joyn therewith, by which it gains ground of the Diſtemper and overcomes it. Thus one Man acting by the power of Perſwaſion, he gains on the Man on which he thus acts, with which he does powerfully proceed in the ſame; he joyning therewith, and giving a coadjutant Faith to the Operation thus performed, the intended deſign does take a ſpeedy effect; and thus working by Characters or Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the like, for curing of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and the Patients therewith ſo troubled, they believing they ſhall hereby be cured, the Diſeaſe hath ſuddenly been ſeen to vaniſh, and they acquitted from their Diſtemper to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40826:305"/>
admiration. Confidence and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion being two great Aſſiſtants in this Curative Method, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the illiterate and unlearned, where Opinion having once got poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion amongſt ſuch as to their Charms and Characters, there's no farther need of outward Applications, theſe in themſelves leaving ſatisfactory Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amongſt theſe ſort of People to work their effects. But leaving theſe dark and black methods thus general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed amongſt the ignorant, and leſs knowing: With his favor, known Miracles may be brought to light by the ſtrength of the mind.</p>
                     <p>And leſt I may ſeem tedious in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good my reaſon for the ſame, as to this Healing Faculty: This is not a gift of Nature, but of Grace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does it live in Man but in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; not in human confidence as theſe Charms and Characters, but in the power of Faith derivative from the Almighty. Moreover, our Gracious Soveraign doth acquit all idle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences whatſoever hereto, by neither queſtioning their Faith who come to be healed, nor asks their Belief about the ſame; he only prays for them,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40826:305"/>
bleſſes them with his Sacred Touch, gives them his Gold, and thus doth impart health unto them; from which clear conſequence, ſuch as the Faith of them is who thus are touched by him, his Curative Effects does moſt clearly evince and demonſtrate. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebrard</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> is very nice in allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Gift of Healing to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> when he ſays, <hi>Some of them have exerciſed this Healing Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>: But he would have been much kinder, and a better Maſter of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, would he have been pleaſed to ſhew the difference between thoſe which had this, and thoſe which want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame. But I need not to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel far for an anſwer ready minted for him, which partly falls in one of his own Country-men, which hapned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the midſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, after Pope <hi>Pius</hi> had let flown his Excommunication againſt her: There was a ſtiff Roman Catholick (as they do delight to call themſelves) who being caſt into Priſon,<note place="margin">See <hi>Tooker</hi>
                        </note> and in a high meaſure viſited with the <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> and having with pain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence long uſed the advice of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians without any ſucceſs, at length
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40826:306"/>
humbly addreſſed himſelf to the Queens Majeſty, through whom, by Gods aſſiſtance, he was compleatly cured; and being demanded what news, I perceive, ſaith he, now at laſt by plain experience, that the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication denounced by the Pope againſt Her Majeſty, is of none effect, ſeeing God hath bleſſed her with ſo great and miraculous a virtue, as Dr. <hi>Tooker</hi> hath it in <hi>Chariſmate, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 92. And as a ſecond ſatisfaction to this French-man, he tells us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hiſtory of a Maid, when the Queen being in <hi>Glocesterſhire,</hi> and many poor People afflicted with this Diſeaſe, who in uncivil Crowds did ſo preſs upon her Majeſty, that ſhe let fall theſe words, <hi>Alaſs poor People, I cannot, I cannot cure you, it is God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone who can do it.</hi> The which words ſome ill affected perſons did interpret, as her utter renouncing of this Divine Gift: whereas ſhe only removed her Subjects Eyes from her ſelf, to deſire their looking up to Heaven. Before ſhe left the place, ſhe was pleaſed to admit a general Healing; amongſt which, the afore-mentioned Maid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Touch'd by Her Sacred Hand,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40826:306"/>
went away immediatly recovered and healed from her Diſeaſe. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is no need of Miracles, when the Truth of the Scriptures do ſhew the <hi>Dogmata Fidei,</hi> our Chriſtian Faith not being founded on demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Churches, or dead Martyrs, nor in Murdering of Men, theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted by us as no Faith, and if any to be allowed, but as an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith: But by ours we do give honor to the memory of Martyrs who dyed for the ſame; we do not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their Pictures with St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but can look upon them with reſpect; we do not damn the Faith of Signs, for Signs do not much conduce to the confirmation of Errors, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the glory of God and his worſhip.</p>
                     <p>This Divine Function is performed without any ſeducing Method: The King gives freely, not calling the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to witneſs, nor ſinking ſo low as others do, to perform the ſame by Black Art or Inchantment; he does it with a pure Heart, in the preſence of the Almighty who knows all things, without Superſtition, curing all that approach his Royal Touch. And this
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40826:307"/>
I may frankly preſume to aver, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any of his Predeceſſors have ever exerciſed it more, or more willingly and freely, whoſe wonderful Effects and certainty of Cures, we muſt and ſhall acknowledge as long as we can ſpeak, and tell our Children thereof, that they may relate what wonders have been performed by his Sacred Hand to their ſucceeding Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                     <p>ANd that no Man may ſay the Nut will not be worth crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he finds good Meat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; as our Diſcourſe hath hitherto gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you a taſte of the truth of this Healing Faculty, ſo this comes like a happy Commander, bringing up the Reer; wherein ſhall be ſhewn part of thoſe Gleanings which I have gathered up from the large and fertile Crop of Strumous Perſons, and theſe cured by the Majeſtick Power of the Kings Sacred Hands. And ſince it cannot reaſonably be expected that I ſhould gradually proceed from <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, even to the time of our Dread Soveraign, which would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be a Task more troubleſome than
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40826:308"/>
deſirous, ſo I am ſure of greater bulk than I deſigned or intended. And that I may not live altogether upon the ſuffering point, I would gladly know of any contrary Humour, which of our Kings of <hi>England</hi> did ever go without it, that lawfully arrived at the Crown? my preſent Diſcourſe not reaching any Uſurper, or Tyrannical Governour. But paſſing theſe by, as we begin from <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, we ought to bear Record of ſome of his Miraculous Methods ſaid to be done by him: And here, as ſome ſort of Men were not wanting to give too high a Character of his Deeds, ſo the meaneſt Act which was performed by him, was not let fall without an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Reverence. Amongſt ſome of which we read of a poor Man who chanced to come to him,<note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> one who might have ſtockt an Hoſpital with Maladies, whoſe ſight made all By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders commiſerate his condition; the Sick Man had a ſtrong Fancy and a bold Face, who deſired the King himſelf to carry him on his back to the Church, on aſſurance (as he ſaid) that he thereby ſhould be recovered. The good King grants his deſire, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40826:308"/>
this Royal Porter bears him into the Church, where ſo ſtrange an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſaid to happen, that although he was carried in on all four, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence ſtreight, and upon two; and it is ſaid the Church into which he was thus carried was St. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> built by him on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Next to St. <hi>Peter</hi> he is ſaid to be much in favour with St. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, who is reported to have appeared unto him in the ſhape of a begging Pilgrim; the King not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving preſent Money to ſupply his wants, did pluck off his Ring from his Finger, and beſtowed it upon him, by virtue of which Ring given he is ſaid to perform many and great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. The ſame Ring ſome years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſaid to be ſent him back again by two Pilgrims out of <hi>Paleſtine</hi>; and if any do doubt of the truth hereof, they are deſired to repair to <hi>Havering,</hi> a Town in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> ſo called as they ſay from this Ring, where, by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, ſatisfaction will be given.</p>
                     <p>This great and moſt Pious Prince being dead, <hi>Harold</hi> the Son of Earl <hi>Goodwin</hi> next ſucceeded him, who
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40826:309"/>
aſſumed the Throne, and was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King by <hi>Aldred,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> next to whom was <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, from whom began the Computation of our Kings of <hi>England.</hi> I might after him name his Son <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the Second, and ſo proceed to <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, King <hi>Stephen, Henry</hi> the Second, <hi>Richard, John,</hi> the <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> and others, ſo to the time of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; but ſince I can find by no Authority that this Sanative Faculty have been ever wanting, or removed from the Princely Line, I ſhall preſume to take leave, and begin with Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> where amongſt many other Cures done by her Sacred Hand, take theſe following as they appear, the firſt two whereof I have already deſcribed in the foregoing Chapter of the French-man, and the other of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> the which I do here forbear to mention to prevent Tautology.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Tooker</hi> alſo tells us of one <hi>John Capel</hi> of <hi>Exon,</hi> the Son of an honeſt Citizen, and a Daughter of the ſame Perſon, both troubled with the Evil, and both quitted from their Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers by her Majeſties gracious Touch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:40826:309"/>Another of his is of a Maid, who was of the ancient Family of the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervils,</hi> who was for ten years trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this Evil Diſeaſe, ſhe being Toucht for the ſame, alſo recovered: he afterwards beholding her Gold gone from her Neck, demanded of her the reaſon thereof? ſhe tells him her neceſſity compell'd her to ſell it, and yet ſhe remained well, whence He, as other wiſe Men, have conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured that the Gold given is only as the Kings Charitable Token, and no more, for ſhe lived many years after very well, without any relapſe. Yet this does not always ſo ſucceed, for I have ſeen many upon the loſs of their Gold, their Evil has come afreſh, and proved troubleſome, as ſhall be made good by many Examples following. Many thouſands are reported to have been cured of this Diſeaſe in her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Reign; King <hi>James</hi> ſucceeded her, and continued the ſame Sanative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his Life-time. After whom was <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of ever bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, who performed theſe Cures in a very ſtrange and miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with and without Gold, by his Prayer and Benediction only, by his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40826:310"/>
Sacred Touch, as alſo by his Sacred and precious Blood. Of each of which in their Order, where for remark, bleſſing and cure, none ever of his Predeceſſors were able to be named in the hour with him. I begin with that wonderful and miraculous Cure done by him at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> only by his Prayer, related to our Dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and his Brother his Royal Highneſs <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter-Colledge,</hi> by Doctor <hi>John Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> Warden of the Colledge this laſt Summer, where I had the Honour not only to hear it, but afterwards ſaw the Bottle. This following Hiſtory I had from the aforeſaid Doctor under his own Hand, ſent me in a Letter from my very good Friend Mr. <hi>Shadrack Lyne,</hi> Apothecary of the ſame place, and is as followeth.</p>

The Perſon that labored un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Infirmity, was <hi>Robert Cole,</hi> well known in <hi>Winton,</hi> being a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Inn-keeper, firſt of the <hi>Three Crowns,</hi> next of the <hi>Katherine Wheel,</hi> both Houſes near the Colledge of that place: 'Twas evident to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that he was highly Diſeaſed, and great Scars remained as evidences of it after the Cure: His Throat was the place of his Soars, where there were great Wounds, and the encreaſe of them gave the Man daily and juſt fears, that the paſſages for his Breath could not long continue whole and uſeful, he ſought for relief by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Water, which he received from an Apothecary of <hi>Sarum</hi> (I think he told me his name was <hi>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock</hi>)
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40826:311"/>
but as he, when alive, aſſured me, although the waſhing with that Water did keep the Wounds clean, yet it did not ſtop the increaſe nor the pains: He then in diſpair of all other help but from His Majeſties Touch, endeavored to procure that means of Gods mercy. But it being in the time when that Sacred Perſon was removed from the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and brought through <hi>Winton</hi> (where this object of Charity dwelt) in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the laſt of his Sufferings. There were Soldiers, Guards and Spies, ſufficient for to prevent ſuch a gracious Act, and thoſe had malice enough to have hindred that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs doing good if they could. The poor diſtreſſed Man, on bended knees, at that time in the preſence made ſeveral Exclamations, and preſſed nearer to the King that he might procure notice from him, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill loudly, <hi>God ſave the King</hi>: which provok'd thoſe inhumane At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, to deal with the Petitioner as they did with their Soveraign, barbarouſly: They ſtrook him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved him, and allowed him no opportunity to come within the good
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40826:311"/>
Kings reach: The only effect was, that the importunate cries of him which was impatient to be denyed the laſt hopes of eaſe and life, made the good Prince obſerve him; and ſince he could not be hindred from reaching him with his Prayers, he gave the weak and now diſpairing Man his Bleſſing, in the like words to theſe: Friend, I ſee thou art not permitted to come near me, and I cannot tell what thou wouldeſt have, but <hi>God bleſs thee, and grant thy deſire</hi>; after which, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed Man without the Kings ſtroak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was forced to return to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that he had formerly waſht his Soars with: But although the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that he kept it in had been ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Cup-board, and is to this day without any crack in it, yet the Water was much waſted: The next day he found a greater decreaſe in the Liquor, and ſo daily until it was dryed up. At length, the Bottle became ſcabbed in its ſides, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Botches appeared in it, the gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the Bottle breaking off through the round bubbles or botches that aroſe in the Earth: And
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40826:312"/>
as theſe effects appeared in the Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Veſſel, the Face and Throat of the Patient healed with equal ſpeed. I my ſelf knew the Man ſo whole, that the Scars were the greateſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony that he ever ſuffered by that Diſeaſe. He was ever after freed from any running iſſue, or pain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at one time, when (as he told me) a Gentlewoman that ſaw the Bottle, attempted to pick off ſome of thoſe Excreſcences that budded out of its ſides: After this, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that had been affected in his Throat gave him new trouble and grief, but nothing was vented there, which being over, he lived above twenty years in eaſe, and in that Sickneſs of which he died, the Kings Evil had no ſhare.</q>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40826:312"/>
to his Profeſſion to have expoſed it to his Cuſtomers, yet he regarded his Safety more than his Profit, and concealed it with all the Art he could; ſo that it was not ſeen but when an intimate Acquaintance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted that reſpect from him, with good aſſurance that it ſhould not be roughly handled; he being dead, the Bottle is until this day in the Hands of his Widow here in <hi>Winton,</hi> where there are many other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of this which you receive now from</q>

The effect hereof was as followeth: The Father being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered and ill, keeps the Gold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his own neck, which kept him in health, and gave him ſpeedy eaſe and relief: The Son falling ill, he borrows his Fathers Gold from his neck, and puts it about his own, which likewiſe gave him eaſe and relief. The Father after this by leaving his Gold, had his Diſtemper ſeized him afreſh, and then took the Gold again, and this made it as readily vaniſh. And thus by the intercourſe or change of Gold from Father to Son, and from Son to Father, whoever of them kept the Gold, was defended againſt any new approach or appearance of his Diſtemper; and this was kept and maintained by them for many years together.</p>

She after this going over into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> where ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards dwelt, met there with one Mr. <hi>Heath,</hi> a <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Merchant, who was likewiſe ſo extraordinarily trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the <hi>Evil,</hi> that he was ſaid to be near eaten up with the ſame: And although he made all the means he poſſibly could to get over to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to come to be touch'd by His late Sacred Majeſty for the ſame, yet the illneſs of the Weather, and the badneſs of the Seaſon prevented his deſigns. The great thing here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is this, Madam <hi>Hebden</hi> lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Merchant her Gold which ſhe received from the King, and he for ſome time wearing the ſame about his neck, within a very ſmall time after the uſe thereof, he found benefit, and upon his continuance of the ſame in uſe, he very ſpeedily amended, and became ſo well, that he had no farther need of His Majeſties Touch. The Lady her ſelf is now alive, and ready

to atteſt the truth hereof, as I had it from her Sons own hand.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Foſter,</hi> now an Inhabitant in <hi>Windſor,</hi> when he was about ſix years of Age, and perfectly blind for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years, ſo that he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee Sun, Moon, Fire or Candle, who being perplexed alſo with many Scrophulous or Evil Swellings about his Throat, and many others ſeizing his Face, Arm, Hands and Fingers; and after having ſpent much mony with Phyſicians and Chirurgions, to little purpoſe, was after all this brought to his late Sacred Majeſty to be Healed, by the benefit whereof, within fourteen days, he preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his ſight; and his Swellings which did frequently run into Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and healed in ſeveral parts of his Body, were as ſpeedily dryed up, and he hath ever ſince remained ſound without any appearance of relapſe. This I had from himſelf this laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer at <hi>Windſor,</hi> who I am certain will be ever ready to maintain the Truth thereof to his dying minute.</p>

                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:40826:314"/>There was a Woman Quaker which lived at <hi>Guilford</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> who being ſo perfectly blind, that ſhe was rob'd of all light and ſight: She coming to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where our late King was then a Priſoner, to be touch'd by His Sacred Majeſty; ſo ſoon as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſame, or within leſs than an hour after the reception thereof, ſhe went down to the Kings kitchin, and did there tell the number of Spits which were turning upon the Range, and did there fall down upon her knees, praying to God to forgive her for thoſe evil thoughts ſhe formerly had of her good King, by whom ſhe had receiv'd this great Bleſſing. Mr. <hi>John Stephens</hi> of the Kings Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtairs, was an eye-witneſs of every part hereof, he being then at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and afterwards ſeeing her in the Kitchin: At this time the King did only put over her Neck a Silver Two pence, ſtrung in a white Silk Ribband; and this may prove, that other Metal uſed and imployed by the Sacred Hand, does the ſame as Gold. All People which did here come to be touch'd had only Silver given to them, and yet moſt of them
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40826:315"/>
known to be cured; and ſuch as fail'd thereof, hapned chiefly from their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and incredulity. Mr. <hi>Henry Ewer,</hi> four years of age, was brought by the former Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> to be touch'd by His late Sacred Majeſty at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> at the ſame time; his Eyes being ſo ſore and ill-affected, that he could not look upon any Fire, or behold the light of the Sun or Moon, they were ſo weak and troubleſom to him: within a Month or ſix Weeks after his being healed by the King, he was ſeen perfectly diſcharged from his pain, and recovered to admiration, and lived many years free from all trouble: Both theſe Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> is ready to maintain, if at any time he may be queſtioned about the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Halford,</hi> one of His Majeſties Heralds, tells me this following of one <hi>Helena Payne</hi> of <hi>Windſor,</hi> who having the <hi>Evil</hi> in that meaſure as it made her Blind; this bred from a great Rhume and <hi>defluxion</hi> of her Eyes, with which ſhe was perplexed for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years together.

the Regicides to <hi>London</hi>; this poor Woman preſs'd to be touch'd by His Sacred Majeſty as he was paſſing over the Bridge, and preſumed to take hold of his Coat, humbly ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting His Majeſties Sacred touch: The good King tells her he had no Gold; ſhe ſtill begs for Chriſt Jeſus ſake, that he would grant her His gracious Touch; the which ſhe having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, within three days after ſhe grew well and recovered, and did after that retain her Sight to her dying day.</p>
                     <p>Another old Man came to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at <hi>Windſor</hi> this laſt Summer, who told me, That he having been Lame for ſeveral Years together, ſo that he could neither go or ſtand; he being brought to our late King, of Bleſſed Memory, to be touch'd at <hi>Windſor,</hi> he thereupon ſoon amended, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his ſtrength to that capacity as I then ſaw him in, and hath had the uſe of his Limbs ever ſince to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

This being in the time of our late King, of Bleſſed Memory, when he was at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi>; ſhe goes thither and was healed by him, ſhe having received His Majeſties gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Touch, and a piece of Silver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Neck, immediatly grew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and within a ſmall time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfectly recovered, ſo that her Soars dryed up, and ſhe acquitted from all running Iſſues. But as a very ſtrange Remark hereof, upon the day of our Bleſſed Soveraigns cruel Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, her Sores broke out afreſh, ſhe being in the Country and hearing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the ſame: But within a ſmall while after they healed up again, and ſhe appeared very well without any appearance of Relapſe.</p>

By this time it arriv'd at His Majeſties Ear, who came to the Girl as I ſtood by her, and in my hearing ask'd her how long her Eye had been cloſed; ſhe anſwered, above a Fortnight: Do you ſee now, ſaid the King? to which ſhe replyed (putting her hand on her other Eye) I ſee your Majeſty; I ſee any thing about the Room; at which His Majeſty pauſing awhile, with a kind of Venerable admiration, took her by the hand and kiſs'd her.</q>

This very night after the King had Touched him, and put a ſhilling about his Neck which he brought with him, and ſhewed me, his Tents, which were of a very great bigneſs, fell out of his Wounds, and could not be kept in: In three days he quitted his Crutches, and made uſe of a Staff only.

Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeing this ſtrange and frightful change, enquires the reaſon thereof, and finding her not wearing the Gold about her Neck which had been given her, did attribute this new and freſh appearance of pain and ſwelling to her want of the ſame.

                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:40826:322"/>There was a Scotch Merchant, who made it his buſineſs every Spring and Fall to bring People from <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> troubled with the <hi>Evil,</hi> to the King where ever he was in his Troubles; as at <hi>Bruſſels, Breda, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Anwerp,</hi> and the like; and before his return from the King, he general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted Serjeant <hi>Haynes</hi> of His Majeſties Chappel (from whom I had this obſervation) how thoſe Perſons were which he carryed back with him, after they had been Touch'd: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of which, he related this remarkable Story, of one amongſt the reſt that came who was refuſed a Ticket by the Chief Chirurgeon then in Waiting (where he aſſured him, that all ſuch who had obtained His Majeſties Touch, received Cure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with): But this poor Man being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the Touch of the King, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Chirurgeons not giving him a Ticket, telling him, He had more need of an Hoſpital than of His Majeſties Favor; affirming, That his Diſeaſe had more of the Pox than of the <hi>Evil</hi> in it: And he making great complaint to Serjeant <hi>Haynes</hi> of his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40826:322"/>
hard meaſure, with many proteſtations of his Innocency with all or any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-kind, and that he ſhould think himſelf utterly undone if he might not receive the honor of his Majeſties Touch with the reſt of his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, deſiring nothing more, they all bringing their own Gold with them. The Serjeant having more pity on him than the Chirurgion, made his application to Dr. <hi>Erles</hi> on his behalf, that he would pleaſe to move the King for his being Healed; the which having done, and the King granting his deſire, The next time the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant came to the King with freſh Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he acquainted the Serjeant, that this poor man was perfectly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and although his face was ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous to view, and accompanied with many deplorable and fetid Ulcers, that he was forced to cover them with green Silk, yet he received that great meaſure of health by His Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as any one could expect to enjoy.</p>
                     <p>When the King was at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> there was a Daughter or two of the Marqueſs of <hi>Caraſceens,</hi> who was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40826:323"/>
of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> which were brought to be healed by the King for their <hi>Evil</hi>; both which, within a very little ſpace of time after the reception thereof recovered to admiration: At the ſame time Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <hi>Haynes</hi> told me, That not only <hi>Scotch, Iriſh, Engliſh,</hi> but ſeveral <hi>French, Spaniſh, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Walloons,</hi> who were troubled with this Diſeaſe, were all healed by his excellent Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faculty.</p>
                     <p>From Dr. <hi>William Payne</hi> of <hi>Winton,</hi> I had this following Narration ſent me under his own hand: That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wait upon Dr. <hi>Erles,</hi> Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and diſcourſing of the <hi>Evil,</hi> Dr. <hi>Erles</hi> told him, That when he was in <hi>Holland</hi> with the King, there was brought on a Bed a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Woman, ſo weakned with that Diſeaſe, that they were all unwilling to ſuffer her to be brought to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties preſence: The Chirurgeons were very much againſt it alſo, and Dr. <hi>Erles</hi> himſelf did much diſſwade it, leſt ſhe ſhould dye under His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties hand, as was very much feared. But upon the Womans earneſt deſire,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40826:323"/>
they did acquaint His Majeſty with her condition and with her requeſt: His Majeſty was pleaſed to permit her to be brought in, and did touch her, none ever thinking to ſee her alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Dr. <hi>Erles,</hi> a few days after walking in the ſtreets, did meet this Woman with a large Basket of Fruit upon her head; he enquired of her the way to ſome place whither he had occaſion to go: The Woman knowing him becauſe he did attend at her Healing, did preſently ſet down her Basket of Fruit, and ſaid, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

This Dr. <hi>Payne</hi> had from Dr. <hi>Erles</hi> own mouth, and doth atteſt the Relation thereof to be true, as he ſhall anſwer before God. And as a ſecond Vindication hereof, when I read the ſame to the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Mr. Serjeant <hi>Haynes,</hi> he tells me he can juſtifie the truth hereof, he
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40826:324"/>
at the ſame time waiting upon Dr. <hi>Erles</hi> beyond Sea.</p>
                     <p>A poor Man that came out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to <hi>Bruges</hi> to be touch'd in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> for the <hi>Evil,</hi> by the King when he was there, having a neck as big as four or five necks, and his Head very monſtrous: He being touch'd by His Sacred Majeſty, and waſhing himſelf with the Water. By that time this Man reached <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> onwards on his Journy to his return for <hi>England,</hi> ſtaying there two or three days, he ſent a Letter thence to Mr. Serjeant <hi>Knight</hi> then in waiting, that he was diſcharged from his Swellings, his Neck abated of his Tumor, and by the advantage of his Touch, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived perfect health and cure. Mr. <hi>Tho: Morley,</hi> Avenor to his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> gave me this Obſervation, being both an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of this Touch, as alſo of the Letter ſent to Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> being then at <hi>Bruges.</hi>

                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:40826:324"/>I could mention many other Cures performed by His Sacred Majeſty in his Exile beyond Sea; but I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſeveral Cures acted by Him ſince His happy Reſtauration.</p>
                     <p>After the Kings Return from abroad, and entring His Royal Throne, where there were frequent Healings at His firſt coming, as ſometimes three in a week, and theſe in great multitudes, as ſix hundred at a time, Mr. Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Haynes</hi> tells me he hath obſerved amongſt the reſt that many which have been brought perfectly blind to the King to be Toucht, who having received the ſame, have been ſeen ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly cured, and freed from their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</p>
                     <p>One Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Curry-rivall</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorely afflicted with the Evil, that both the ſides of his Face were Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulated and Ulcerated, he being hereby not only made a ſad ſpectacle to view, but his Eyes alſo made blind therewith, ſo much that he could ſcaree ſee the Sun or Moon, he coming up to <hi>London</hi> at His Majeſties happy Reſtauration, in order to be healed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40826:325"/>
by His Sacred Majeſty, within ſix weeks after His reception of the ſame, he was ſeen ſo whole, that his Eyes regain'd a perfect ſight, and his Face was covered with new Fleſh like that of a young Child, and lived many years afterwards without any relapſe. This I had from Mr. <hi>Alford</hi> of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Chappel, who will always be ready to make good the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> Miniſter tells me of a Country-man, who having a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very much troubled with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, ſhe being about twelve years of age, about the time of His Majeſties firſt coming into <hi>England,</hi> ſhe being for ſome time made blind therewith, this Country-man getting her Toucht by our Sacred King, ſhe no ſooner received the ſame, but her Eyes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately opened, ſhe looked upon the King, and that very hour ſhe was touched ſhe received cure, and hath ever ſince continued in perfect health. This he had from the Father of the Child who was thus miraculouſly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> tells me, that within a ſmall time after our Kings coming into <hi>England, Elias Aſhmole</hi>

King coming nearer him with his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants which waited on Him, ſome of them told His Majeſty that he was His Majeſties Prophet; the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at him, he kneels down, and cries, <hi>God bleſs Your Majeſty:</hi> The good King gives him His Hand to Kiſs, and he rubbing his ulcerated and ſcabbed Noſe therewith, which was plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtockt with purulent and fetid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: within two days after his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His Majeſties ſacred favour, the aboveſaid Mr. <hi>Aſhmole</hi> ſaw this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans</hi> cured, and his ulcered Noſe dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and healed. This Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> tells me he had it from Mr. <hi>Aſhmole</hi>'s own mouth.</p>
                     <p>From Mrs. <hi>Watſon</hi> in <hi>Kingſtreet Weſtminſter,</hi> I received this of her own Daughter, who was ſo ſeverely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the Evil, and her Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings did ariſe to that bulk, that they very oft threatned her ſuffocation, by too cloſe compreſſing the Windpipe, ſhe uſing ſeveral means, and all fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, at length gets her toucht by our Sacred King; and when all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies fail'd her, at His firſt touch her Swellings abated, ſhe found ſpeedy eaſe and relief, and within a ſhort time

perfectly was cured and diſcharged from her Fears and Tumours.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>John Plummer</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi> I had this, of his own Child, who being put to Nurſe to one <hi>Harſnetts</hi> Wife of <hi>New-Windſor,</hi> who was her ſelf troubled with the Evil, after his Child had for ſome time ſuckt her Milk, ſhe ſuckt her Diſtemper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alſo: The Child being Toucht the laſt Summer by the King for its Diſtemper, did immediately recover thereupon. The great remark here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this, That when the Child left the Nurſes Breaſt, ſhe her ſelf fell ill, and grew weak, and for want of her being Toucht as well as the Child, ſhe died of the ſame Diſtemper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſmall while after the Child had left her.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>George Peryn,</hi> Gentleman-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger to His Majeſty, gives me this Obſervation of a Maid coming from <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> the Kings Builders Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who was ſo miſerably afflicted with the Evil, and a Perſon ſo deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to view, that ſhe affrighted her Spectators; ſhe coming to <hi>Windſor</hi> to be Toucht, and getting to ſee the King at Dinner, her Face being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40826:327"/>
and ſhe being taken notice of, was forc'd ſpeedily to quit her place. This ſad Object being within few days Toucht by our Sacred King, ſhe ſuddainly amended after it, and her Face grew ſo whole, (which was furniſhed with many Ulcers) that there were but very few marks left of her former miſerable aſpect.</p>
                     <p>From the Earl of <hi>Starling</hi> I had this following, who told me his ſecond Son being much troubled with a Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous Swelling in his upper lip, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had the beſt advice he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the moſt eminent Phyſicians and Chirurgeons to conſult and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe about the ſame, they not giving him any appearance of Cure, adviſed his Lordſhip to get his Son Toucht by the King for the ſame; the which ſome ſmall while after he obtained: he no ſooner received His Majeſties Touch, but received immediate eaſe therewith, and he hath remained well ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>From the Mayor of <hi>Wickham</hi> I had this, who having a Son about five years of age very much troubled with the Evil, that he was blind, and could not ſee, with a hard Swelling on his

upper Lip, and finding no good by all other means he uſed, he brought his Son to <hi>Windſor</hi> to be Touched; which ſo ſoon as he had received, his Eyes amended, the Swelling of his Lip abated, and he in a very ſhort time reſtored to health, the which he hath ever ſince enjoyed without any relapſe.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Roger Haſnet,</hi> eldeſt Serjeant at Arms to His Majeſty, tells me of a Child of ſix years of age, who having ſeveral Evil Swellings about her Neck and Throat, and ſo perfectly blind that ſhe could neither ſee the light of the Candle, Fire, or Sun, ſhe coming to <hi>Whitehal</hi> to be Toucht, ſhe having been formerly Touched and loſt her Gold, her Diſtemper ſeiſing her again, upon her ſecond Healing by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and new Gold given, her Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſpeedily vaniſhed, and within two hours were ſeen to leave her, and in fourteen days ſhe was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored to her former health. Sir <hi>Roger</hi> undertook her ſecond Touch, and ſaw the effects thereof, and will ſatisfie any man which may queſtion the truth thereof.</p>

ſmall, that he did not believe the Kings Touch could much help him, or that there was any Power or Virtue therein, but reſolved notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make uſe of his Favor. This Quaker no ſooner ſees the King, but his Spirits immediately raiſed to a higher degree of Faith, and begot a greater belief in him, telling Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> that his mind was quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and he was certain His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty would heal him. This Quaker, within leſs than 48 hours after his being Touch'd, was very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and before he could get home, was wholly diſcharged from his Swellings in his Neck: and as a publick acknowledgment to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God for his great Cure, he went to the Cathedral Church at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> the firſt Sunday following, to pay his publick Thanks: And when he heard the King prayed for, he was taken notice of being more concern'd than at any other part of the Prayers, by lifting up his Hands as a greater and more ſincere acknowledgment of the extraordinary Bleſſing he lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and is and hath ever ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a true Son of the Church.</p>

be an Evil humor cruiſing about her Body; others were of another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſhe being for ſome time kept under the Phyſicians hands for ſome years; about the ſeventh Year of her age, the Humor gathered afreſh upon or very near her left Breaſt, which was ſo violent that it drew the child crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made her to bend like a Bow: this ſore was opened and dreſt by an eminent Chirurgeon of our City of <hi>London</hi>; it being for ſome time kept open, at length healed up of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, but it very quickly gathered again inwardly: The Relations then remembring the opinion of one of the moſt eminent Phyſicians who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been conſulted, &amp; that he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be an Evil humor, or the ſame Humor that begets the ſame Diſeaſe, uſed all imaginable means of having her Touch'd by the King: But he that had the moſt immediate care of her, ſaid it was the <hi>Evil,</hi> and if it were, it was not Touching that could help her, but it muſt be other means that muſt effect her Cure. The Relations not being herewith ſatisfied, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Child to Mr. Serjeant <hi>Knight,</hi> Serjeant Chirurgion to His Majeſty,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40826:337"/>
who was of opinion that it was not the Evil: A year or two after, this Diſtemper ſeized her Eyes, where ſhe met with ſuch a violent Rhume, that it not only bliſtered her Eyes, but made Scars alſo in her Face: They made their ſecond Addreſs then to His Majeſties Chirurgeon, who ſeeing the Diſeaſe ſo apparently diſcovered its ſelf, that ſhe had a Ticket, and was touch'd by His Sacred Majeſty; the which ſhe no ſooner had received, but ſhe immediatly found eaſe in her Eyes, and hath continued very well for theſe laſt ten years together, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon leaving off her Gold, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe ſaith ſhe hath met with ſome ſmall ilneſs in her Eyes, which upon putting her Gold on again, hath as ſuddenly vaniſhed.</p>

able to walk about the Room; and in two days after ſhe was ſo perfectly recovered, that ſhe went into the Country freed from her former Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and diſcharged from her Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulated Swellings.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame Healing another young Woman which was very near blind, and very much diſturbed with Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Swellings, and had alſo ſeveral running Soars about her, ſhe being touch'd then alſo by the King, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved perfect Remedy by the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of his Sacred Hand.

over to the King (his own Method being uſed ineffectually:) the Father ſeemed very ſtrange at his advice, and utterly denyed it, ſaying, The Touch of the King was of no greater efficacy than any other Mans. The Mother of the Child adhering to the Doctors ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſtudied all imaginable means to have it over, and at laſt prevailed with her Husband to let it change the Air for three Weeks or a Month; this being granted, the Friends of the Child that went with it, unknown to the Father, carried it to <hi>Breda,</hi> where the King touch'd it, and ſhe returned home perfectly healed.

                     <p>A poor Country-woman came with her three Siſters from <hi>Oxford,</hi> to be healed by His Majeſty in the Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laſt Eaſter: this Object of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty came to my Houſe in a very miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition, and was as well by Serjeant <hi>Pyle,</hi> His Majeſties Serjeant Chirurgeon, as my ſelf, viewed, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40826:340"/>
her Diſtemper was concluded by both not to be the Evil; her Legs were both extraordinarily bliſtered; her Stomach was ſo weak, that ſhe for ſome days could not eat any Dyet. I being upon pure Charity perſwaded by her earneſt Intreaties and Requeſts to have her Toucht, the which on her bended Knees ſhe humbly requeſted, with that perfect aſſurance, that could ſhe attain it, ſhe ſhould certainly gain her Cure; ſhe at the publick Healing at <hi>Whitehal</hi> was Toucht by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: that very night ſhe eat two Eggs, that for above ten days before nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated any Dyet. The day following ſhe was Toucht again, and with it ſhe received His Majeſties Gold: upon which her Sores and Bliſters in her Legs dryed up, ſhe ſpeedily thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amended, and within a very few days to admiration was perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved from her Diſeaſe, and to this day is a viſible Object of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties great Cure, (the beginning and ending of which I ſaw) to His Sacred Thanks and Glory.</p>
                     <p>From Mr. <hi>Whitacre</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> I had this following, of a Child of one Mr. <hi>Harbins</hi> of the ſame place, who
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40826:340"/>
being perfectly blind with the Evil, and ſhe being Toucht by His Sacred Majeſty for the ſame at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> ſhe immediately received great benefit thereby, and recovered her ſight to that great degree, that walking the ſame day along with her Mother by the Maypole in the <hi>Strand,</hi> ſhe askt her Mother what that long Pole was for? which ſhe thankt God ſhe then perfectly ſaw, and hath continued ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Elizabeth Dewolders</hi> of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> was touched by the King for the Evil about thirteen years ſince, who having many running Sores about her Neck, ſoon after her touching ſhe immediately received benefit, and within a little while after her Sores perfectly dryed up. I ſaw this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man my ſelf, who came with her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter who was troubled with the Evil to be Toucht this inſtant <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and ſhe is perfectly healed, and hath continued ſo ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>William Luke</hi> of <hi>Eaſt-Packham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> a Blackſmith, who having the Evil very much in his Eyes, was toucht by the King for the ſame, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved immediate benefit thereby: he
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40826:341"/>
was toucht about <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and every year about the ſame time he meets with a freſh return hereof: he comes about forty miles, and every year he gains the Kings Touch, he receives Cure therewith, and goes home very well, and follows his Calling. This I had from Mr. <hi>Doublebrook,</hi> who is one of His Majeſties Yeoman-Uſhers, and who always brings him to the King to be Toucht.</p>
                     <p>From Mr. <hi>Millart,</hi> one of the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Uſhers to the Yeomen of the Guard, I had this, of a poor Woman who was his next Neighbour, who being ſo grievouſly troubled with run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sores about her Neck, that ſhe was near waſted and conſumed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſhe was brought in a Chair to the King to be Toucht, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately found benefit thereby, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſhort time after ſhe returned home to <hi>Breda</hi> in <hi>Brabant</hi> perfectly recovered, and ſince that ſent him a Letter, with thanks, of her continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well to this hour.</p>
                     <p>From Mr. <hi>Doublebrook</hi> I had this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing alſo, of a Woman who came from <hi>Virginia,</hi> whoſe Noſe was almoſt eaten away with the Evil, and her
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40826:341"/>
Eyes conſumed with that Humour, ſhe being brought by him to the King to be Toucht, immediately received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereby, and returned to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> ſince, and as a token of Thanks to him, ſhe ſent him a Pair of Gloves, with a Letter, wherein ſhe certified him that ſhe was recovered from her Diſeaſe, and was perfectly healed. This he received from her within a year and a half after, from <hi>Virginia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I might have introduced many more Examples of the great Cures which have been performed by the Sacred Hands of our Kings and Queens: but I hope theſe may be ſufficient to ſatisfie the reaſonable Man.</p>
                     <p>May our Bleſſed SAVIOUR there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the great Phyſician of the Soul and Body, evermore add many years to our Sacred Majeſties Age, that he may always appear more glorious, as the Riſing Sun over his People, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing of his Healing Rays: May For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Glory be ever the Fruit and Pleaſure of his Sacred Perſon: And may he ever be himſelf free from all ſuch Sickneſs and Diſeaſes as he cures in others; whoſe Health is the Health of his Nations, and whoſe Life is the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40826:342"/>
Life of his Kingdoms: And as the great KING of Kings hath hitherto mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly preſerved his <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> ſo may He evermore keep Him from the Malice of his evil Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Tongues, and from the ſickly Contagion of their ill Manners. May the Preſerver of Mankind furniſh his Royal Perſon continually with a ſtrong Army, a faithful People, a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Nation, a peaceful Church, a ſerene Sea, an invincible Throne, and happy Iſlands; that as all the World doth pay Tribute to our Soveraign's great Name, ſo they may alſo reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his Divine Healing Nature.</p>
