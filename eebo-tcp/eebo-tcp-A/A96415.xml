            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>In order whereunto I crave leave in all humility to

repreſent (having lived ſome yeers in the Countrey,

on his work <hi>there,</hi> which I have done in this ſmall
Treatiſe following.</p>
            <p>And for your more full ſatisfaction, give leave to
remove ſuch falſe ſurmiſes and aſperſions, ſuggeſted on
purpoſe to retaed the work. Some are heard to queſtion
the affections of <hi>New-England</hi> towards the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
and preſent ſtate; To which I muſt anſwer,
that the Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and generally the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>New-England,</hi> ſo farre as I know or have
obſerved, or can learn, have been faithful and cordial
to the Parliament from the firſt, and do own this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Government, and Common-wealth, giving in this
as a reall argument, in being your Honours Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers
at the throne of grace, both praying to God for
you in your ſtraits, and praiſing God for the enlargment
of his good hand upon you. Others endeavour more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to prejudice the work, by ſuggeſting that the
charity of the wel-affected hath been abuſed, in that
there is no ſuch work, or that there is a greater noiſe
made of it in the world then there is cauſe; To this I can
ſafely anſwer, that there hath been, I beleeve in no
mans obſervation, greater faithfulneſſe found in any
buſineſſe, both for truth of relation in what hath paſſed,
or diſpoſing what hath been contributed; the perſons
that are concerned in it, whether they be the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
eſtabliſhed by you, or that have the managing of it
<pb facs="tcp:117834:3"/>
in <hi>New-England,</hi> being perſons of known integrity,
and much honoured of all that know them, in this very
reſpect; Moſt of theſe accounts I have ſeen, both what
monies have been received and disburſed, both what,
how, and to whom. Theſe alſo are ready to give your
Honours ſatisfaction about this, if need require, and it
will be an eaſe, and an honour to them to be called to
ſuch an account.</p>
            <p>And now the way being thus cleared, I proceed to
make it my humble requeſt to your Honours, that you
would be pleaſed to accept of this my humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
and thankful remembrance of what you have
already done; and that it would not be troubleſome to
you to be intreated, and ſtirred up by my meanneſſe, to
proceed in the continuance of your favour, as to the
whole Country, ſo eſpecially towards this work, that
your hands may be ſtill held up to the farther advance,
and perfecting theſe happy beginnings. And as you have
given it feet, ſo you would give it wings, that it may get
above al difficulties, which may be caſt in the way. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the work is honorable, and worthy your care, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
affections, and to be laid in your boſomes, that it
may feel the warmth and influence of your favour, and
beſt reſpects, it tending ſo much to the good of the ſouls
of theſe poor wild creatures, multitudes of them being
under the power of Satan, and going up and downe
with the chains of darkneſſe ratling at their heels. This
I may alſo ſay for your Honours encouragement, there is
farre greater cauſe of promoting this work then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:117834:4"/>
there being more perſons, and places which have
received the Goſpel amonſt them. Our Lord Chriſt and
his truth gets ground, and the Devil Ioſeth, they daily
break from him, and renounce him, and all his curſed
works of darkneſſe, as you will find in this following
<hi>Narrative.</hi> And laſtly, let me adde but this, The Lord

it a means to advance that common comfort,
which all good Chriſtians do ſhare in with the Angels
of heaven, about the converſion of ſinners to God. This
will appear by ſhewing there is a doore of hope opened
for the poore Indians, of whom it may be thou haſt
not yet heard; I thought alſo by relating the truth of things, as they
ſtand at preſent, concerning the Indians you have heard of, and Gods
dealing with them, I might undeceive ſuch as are either apt, or do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that things reported of them are but a fable, and a device or engine
uſed by ſome to cheat good people of their money, and ſo diſcourage them
from yeelding any help towards this great work. The Lord forgive
them this great ſinne, that have raiſed theſe evill reports.</p>
            <p>Vnderſtand therefore (good Reader) that my ſelfe intending (by
Gods help) my returne into my native Countrey; It pleaſed the Lord
by his providence, before we could come to the place where we were to
take ſhip for <hi>England,</hi> that, by reaſon of contrary winds, we were faine
to put in at an Iland called <hi>Martins</hi> Vineyard,<note place="margin">Some call it Marthaes Vineyard.</note> which is the most Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Iland that lies in that tract of Land called <hi>New England,</hi> where
there is a ſmall Plantation, and a Church gathered, where we stayed
about ten dayes, in which time I had the more leaſure and opportunity to
informe my ſelfe of the ſtate of the Indians there; having heard former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that divers of them began to taſte the knowledge of Christ: For
this end I had recourſe to Mr. <hi>Mahu,</hi> who is the Pastor of the Church,
and having attained a good underſtanding in the Indian tongue, and
can ſpeak it well, hath laid the firſt foundation of the knowledge of
Chriſt amongſt the Indians there by preaching unto them; who gave
me full information of what I deſired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had alſo ſpeech with ſome of the
Indians (Mr. <hi>Mahu</hi> being my Interpreter.) Above the reſt my deſire
was to ſpeak with the Indian who now preacheth unto them every Lords
day twice, whoſe name is <hi>Hiacoomes,</hi> who ſeemed to me to be a man
of a prompt underſtanding, of a ſober and moderate ſpirit, and a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117834:5"/>
man well reported of for his converſation both by the Engliſh and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.
I thought him to be about 30 yeers of age; with this man I had
often ſpeech, and I asked him divers queſtions about Christian Religion,
and about his own eſtate before God. I remember once I asked him theſe
queſtions. 1. <hi>Whether he had found ſorrow for ſin, as ſin. 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had ſorrowed for his ſins as they had pierced Chriſt. 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had found the Spirit of God as an inward comforter to him;</hi>
Vnto all which he gave me a very good ſatisfactory and Chriſtian an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
After this I had the opportunity to go to a private meeting
of the Indians (of which you ſhall understand more in the Letter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing)
with Mr. <hi>Mahu,</hi> where having ſpent three or foure houres in
Queſtions and Anſwers, which paſſed too and fro between the Indians
and my ſelf; at our parting I deſired that one of them would deſire a
bleſſing upon what they had heard for their edification, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
done; for they choſe out a young man who prayed a quarter
of an houre, and ſomewhat more, with great reverence and affection,
as farre as I could judge by his voyce and outward deportment: Maſter
<hi>Mahu</hi> alſo told me that he had many pertinent and ſignificant expreſſions
in his prayer; ſo that God hath poured on ſome of them the gift, and I
hope the ſpirit of prayer.</p>
            <p>The next day we rode to the Indian Lecture, where Mr. <hi>Mahu</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and catechiſed their children, who anſwered readily and modeſtly in
the Principles of Religion; ſome of them anſwered in the Engliſh ſome
in the Indian tongue. Thus having ſeen a ſhort model of his way, and
of the paines he took, I made ſome enquiry about Mr. <hi>Mahu</hi> himſelf,
and about his ſubſiſtance, becauſe <hi>I</hi> ſaw but ſmall and ſlender appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of outward conveniences of life, in any comfortable way; the man
himſelf was modeſt, and I could get but little from him; but after, I
underſtood from others how ſhort things went with him, and how he
was many times forced to labour with his own hands, having a wife
and three ſmall children which depended upon him, to provide neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for them; having not halfe ſo much yeerly coming in, in a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
way, as an ordinary labourer gets there amongſt them. Yet he is
chearfull amidſt theſe ſtraits, and none hear him to complain. The truth
is, he will not leave the work, in which his heart is engaged; for upon
my knowledge, if he would have left the work, and imployed himſelf
otherwhere, he might have had a more competent and comfortable
maintenance. I mention this the rather, becauſe I have ſome hope, that
ſome pious minde, that reads this, might be inwardly moved to conſider
his condition, and come to his ſuccor for his encouragement in this great
work.</p>

At my parting from this Iland I deſired Mr. <hi>Mahu</hi> that he would
take the pains to write me the Story of Gods dealing with the Indians,
from the first time of their coming thither, to this preſent time; which
he accordingly did, and I received before my going out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
which Letter of his to me, finding many remarkable paſſages in
it, I thought fit to publiſh it, that the Lord might have the glory of
his free grace, in regard of theſe poor Heathens who ſeeme to be the
dregs and refuſe of <hi>Adams</hi> loſt poſterity; and to put an edge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the prayers and prayſes of Gods people, the fruit of which will
returne into their owne boſomes. And if there be a right ſet of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in you, you will bleſſe God for ſuch as preſent ſuch kinde of

the preſent mercy of God that theſe Indians were
bleſſed with, you found an occaſion farther to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what the former diſpenſations of God have
beene to bring them hitherto. Now aſſuring
my ſelf that it is from your deſire that the Lord
may be glorified in the ſalvation of theſe poor Indian ſouls, I
ſhall, by the aſſiſtance of God, declare the truth, and that which
ſhall, by his grace, adminiſter alſo a ground of prayer to be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

of the Lords workings, turning all things, yea ſeeming hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
to the furtherance of the work of grace amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Now for your ſatisfaction you may pleaſe to know that this
work amongſt the Indians had its firſt riſe and beginning in the
yeere 1643. When the Lord ſtirred up the heart of an Indian, who
then lived neer to the Engliſh Plantation, whoſe name is <hi>Hia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coomes,</hi>
a man of a ſad &amp; a ſober ſpirit, unto whoſe <hi>Wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wam</hi> or houſe
ſome of the Engliſh repairing, &amp; ſpeaking to him about the way of
the Engliſh, he came to viſit our habitations and publike meetings,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117834:6"/>
thinking that there might be better wayes and means amongſt the
Engliſh, for the attaining of the bleſſings of health and life, then
could be found amongſt themſelvs: Yet not without ſome thoughts
and hopes of a higher good he might poſſibly gain thereby, at
which time I took notice of him, and had oft diſcourſe with him,
inviting him to my houſe every Lords day at night. About this
time it ſo fell out, that this Indian went with ſome Engliſh men
to a little Iland, where meeting a ſurly <hi>Sagamore</hi> whoſe name was
<hi>Pake Poneſſo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">By this name they call their Kings and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.</note> who reproached him for his fellowſhip with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,
both in their civil and religious wayes, railing at him for his
being obedient to them: <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> replyed that he was gladly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to the Engliſh, neither was it for the Indians hurt he did
ſo; Upon which the Sagamore gave him a great blow on the face
with his hand; but there being ſome Engliſh men preſent, they
would not ſuffer the Sagamore to ſtrike him again. The poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
thus wronged, made this uſe of it, and ſaid, <hi>I had one hand
for injures, and the other for God, while I did receive wrong with the
one, the other laid the greater hold on God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was a very ſtrange diſeaſe this yeare amongſt the Indians,
they did run up and down till they could run no longer, they made
their faces as black as a coale, ſnatched up any weapon, ſpake great
words, but did no hurt; I have ſeen many of them in this caſe. The
Indians having many calamities fallen upon them, they laid the
cauſe of all their wants, ſickneſſes, and death, upon their departing
from their old heatheniſh ways, only this man held out, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
his care about the things of God: and being deſirous to read,
the Engliſh gave him a Primer, which he ſtil carries about with
him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1644</label> Now whilſt <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> was feeling after God, he met with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
tryall; for going into an Indian houſe where there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Indians, they ſcoffed at him with great laughter, ſaying, <hi>Here
comes the Engliſh man,</hi> who by their noyſe awaked his old enemy
<hi>Pakeponeſſo,</hi> who was aſleep, who joyning with the other Indians,
told him, <hi>I wonder</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that you that are a young man, having a
wife and two children, ſhould love the Engliſh and their wayes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Pawwawes; what would you do if any of you ſhould be ſick?
whither would you go for help?</hi> I <hi>ſay, if I were in your caſe there
ſhould nothing draw me from our gods and Pawwawes.</hi> At this
time he replyed nothing, but told a friend of his that he then
thought in his heart that the God in heaven did know and heare
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117834:6"/>
all the evill words that <hi>Pakeponeſſo</hi> ſpake. Thus the changing of
his way cauſed much hatred to him, neither was there ſo much as
the leaſt appearance of any outward argument amongſt us, that
might weigh againſt it.</p>
                  <p>After this there fell a great judgment of God on this Sagamore;
for in the night when he and his company were in the<note n="*" place="margin">An Indian houſe or Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam is made with ſmal poles like an arbour covered with mats, and their fire is in the midst, over which they leave a place for the ſmoak to go out at.</note> Wigwam, it
beginning to raine, he and a young man ſtood up upon the floor of
planks which lay about two foot from the ground, to put a Matt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Chimnie, there came a great flaſh of lightning, and after
it thunder not very loud, yet full of the vengeance of God, which
killed the young man out-right, and ſtrook <hi>Pakeponeſſo</hi> down dead
for a long time, and he fell off from the floore of planks along up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ground with one legge in the fire, and being much burned,
it was took out by ſome that lay in the other ſide of the Indian
houſe. Now <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> as himſelf ſaith) did remember his former
thoughts of God, and then thought God did anſwer him, and
that he was brought more to rejoyce in God, and reſt more upon
him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1645</label> Now in theſe times, as I did endeavour the good of theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
by diſcourſe with diverſe of them, ſo in particular with <hi>Hia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coomes,</hi>
who did communicate that knowledge he had amongſt
thoſe he could; for ſome of them could not endure the light he
brought; ſome were more attentive to hear, and more ready to
follow the truth, yet they did not well behold the Majeſty of the
Lord by theſe perſonal particular works; at laſt the Lord ſent
an univerſal ſicknes, and it was obſerved by the Indians, that they
that did but give the hearing of good counſel, did not taſte ſo
deeply of it, but <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> and his family in a manner not at all.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1646</label> This put the Indians who dwell about ſix miles from us, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conſideration of the thing, being much affected, that he
which had expoſed himſelf to ſuch reproaches and troubles, ſhould
receive more bleſſings then themſelves; hereupon they ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
to <hi>Hiacoomes,</hi> who was with him about the break of day,
and delivering his meſſage, told him that he was come to pray
him to go preſently to <hi>Myoxeo</hi> the chief man of that place, and he
ſhould have a reward for his labour; for the Indians were very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to know from him all things that he knew, and did, in the
wayes of God; ſo he being glad of the opportunity, went with
the meſſenger, and when he came, there were many Indians ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, amongſt which was <hi>Towanquatick</hi> the Sagamore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:117834:7"/>
then after many requeſts (the general whereof was this, that he
would ſhew his heart unto them, how it ſtood towards God, and
what they muſt do) he ſhewed unto them all things he knew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God the Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt; <hi>Myoxeo</hi> asking
him how many Gods the Engliſh did worſhip, he anſwered one
God, whereupon <hi>Myoxeo</hi> reckoned up about 37. principal gods he
had, and ſhall I (ſaid he) throw away theſe 37. gods for one? <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acoomes</hi>
replyed, what do you think of your ſelf? I have throwne
away all theſe, and a great many more ſome yeers ago, yet am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
as you ſee this day; you ſpeak true ſaid <hi>Myoxeo;</hi> therefore
I will throw away all my gods too, and ſerve that one God with
you. <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> told them all, he did fear this great God only, and
alſo in a ſpeciall manner that the Son of God did ſuffer death to
ſatisfie the wrath of God his Father, for all thoſe that did truſt in
him, and forſake their ſinnes, and that the ſpirit of God did work
theſe things in the hearts of men, and that himſelf did feare this
great God only, was ſorry for his ſinnes, deſiring to be redeemed
by Ieſus Chriſt, and to walk in Gods commandments; this, with
many truths more he ſhewed unto them, As <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion,
and the miſery of the world by it, and did conclude, that if they
had ſuch hearts as he, they ſhould have the ſame mercies. He rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
up to them many of their ſins, as having many gods, going
to Pawwawes; and <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> told me himſelf, that this was the
firſt time that ever he ſaw the Indians ſenſible of their ſins; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they did but hear it as a new thing, but not ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, for they were exceeding thankful, ſaying, alſo <hi>now
we have ſeen our ſins.</hi> Thus it pleaſed the Lord to give both light
and courage to this poore Indian; for although formerly he had
been a harmleſſe man amongſt them, yet, as themſelves ſay, not at
all accounted of, and therefore they often wondered that he which
had nothing to ſay in all their meetings formerly, is now become
the Teacher of them all; I muſt needs give him this teſtimony, after
ſome yeers experience of him, that he is a man of a ſober ſpirit, and
good converſation, and as he hath, as I hope, received the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt in truth, ſo alſo I look upon him to be faithful, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and conſtant in the work of the Lord, for the good of his
own ſoul and his neighbours with him.</p>
                  <p>Now,<note place="margin">Though I have written this paſſage to Mr. <hi>Winſlow</hi> in my Letter to him, which is print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet it is not ſo full a story as here, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it.</note> after theſe things it pleaſed God to move the heart of
<hi>Towanquatick,</hi> encouraged by ſome others amongſt them, to deſire
me to preach unto them. At my coming, this man ſpake thus unto
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117834:7"/>
me; <hi>That a long time agon they had wiſe men, which in a grave manner
taught the people knowledge; but they are dead, and their wiſdome is
buried with them, and now men live a giddy life, in ignorance, till they
are white headed, and though ripe in yeeres, yet then they go without
wiſdome to their graves.</hi> He told me that he wondered the Engliſh
ſhould be almoſt thirty yeers in the Country and the Indians fools
ſtill; but he hoped the time of knowledge was now come; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
himſelf with others deſired me to give them an Indian meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to make known the word of God to them in their own
tongue; and when he came to me to accompliſh his deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
he told me <hi>That I ſhould be to them as one that ſtands by a
running river filling many veſſels,</hi> even ſo ſhould I fill them with
everlaſting knowledge; So I undertook to give them a meeting
once a moneth; but as ſoone as the firſt Exerciſe was ended, they
deſired it oftner then I could well attend it, but once in a fortnight
in our ſetled courſe. He hath alſo ſince told me the reaſon why
he deſired me to preach to them, as that he was greatly deſirous to
have the Indians grow more in goodneſſe, to have their poſterity
inherit bleſſings when he was dead; and himſelf was deſirous to
put the Word of God to his heart, to repent, and throw away his
ſins, and to be better, and after he was dead, to inherit a life in
heaven.</p>
                  <p>Now there be three things in this beginning that were greatly
inquired into. 1. Earthly riches, what they ſhould get. 2. What
approbation they ſhould get from other Sagamores and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.
3. How they ſhould come off from the Pawwawes; but in
neither of theſe could they finde that which might give motion to
a carnal minde; for the firſt kept off many, I have had much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
with ſeveral of them about it, wherein they have ſtrongly
ſtood for their own meetings, wayes and cuſtomes, being in their
account more profitable then ours, wherein they meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but talking and praying. The ſecond alſo remaines an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle,
the Sagamores generally are againſt the way. The third is the
ſtrongeſt cord that binds them to their own way, for the Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wawes
by their witchcraft keep them in feare, many of the Indians
got over the two firſt difficulties, and in ſome meaſure the third;
now there were about twelve which came to the meeting as it
were halting between two opinions, others came to hear and ſee
what was done, for although they had heard and ſeen ſomething
of the one God of heaven, yet ſuch was their unſpeakable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117834:8"/>
their captivity in ſin, and bondage to the Pawwawes, that
they hardly durſt for feare take the beſt way, for though a few of
them were better enlightned, yet the Heathen round about ſtuck
faſt in their old brutiſhneſſe.</p>

<hi>Towanquatick</hi> met with a ſad tryal, for he being at a Weare where
ſome Indians were a fiſhing, where alſo was an Engliſh man, as he
lay along upon a matt on the ground aſleep, by a little light fire,
the night being very dark, an Indian came down, as being ready
fitted for the purpoſe, and being about ſix or eight paces from him,
let flie a broad headed arrow, purpoſing by all probability to
drench the deadly arrow in his heart blood, but the Lord prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it;<note place="margin">This man when I was in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land I often ſaw and spake with, ſeeing al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo the skar upon his eye-brow and noſe.</note> for notwithſtanding all the advantages he had, inſtead of
the heart he hit the eye-brow, which like a brow of ſteele turned
the point of the arrow, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> glancing away, ſlit the top of his
noſe to the bottome. A great ſtirre there was preſently, the Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
ſate up, and bled much, but was not much hurt through the
mercy of God; the darkneſſe of the night hid the murtherer, and
he is not diſcovered to this day. The next morning I went to ſee
the Sagamore, and I found him praiſing God for his great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
both himſelf and all the Indians, wondering that he was
yet alive. The cauſe of his being ſhot, as the Indians ſaid, was
for his walking with the Engliſh; and it is alſo conceived, both by
them and us, that his forwardneſſe for the meeting was one thing,
which (with the experience I have had of him ſince) gives me mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of ſtrong perſwaſion that he beares in his brow the markes of
the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>After this, through the mercy of God, we proceeded on with
the meeting, to the rejoycing of ſome Indians, and the envie
of the reſt, who derided and ſcoffed at thoſe that did follow the
Lecture, and in their way of wickedneſſe blaſpheming the Name of
God, which damped the ſpirits of ſome of them for a time in the
wayes of God, and hindering others from looking thitherward,
but the Lord gave courage and conſtancy to ſome of them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> and <hi>Towanquatick</hi> who was hurt with the arrow,
who were not aſhamed of the way of God.</p>

for without any knowledge thereof,<note place="margin">Although I was preſent at this meeting from the beginning to the end, yet it was done without my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or putting them on upon it, but it came meerly from themſelves.</note> they appointed a meeting, and
there came ſome younger men, and brought with them the ancient
men of their kindred and acquaintance to ſpeak for them, whereof
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117834:8"/>
the very old man that your ſelf ſaw and heard at the meeting, was
one, who began the meeting with a relation of the old cuſtomes
of the ancient Heathen, preferring them before thoſe wayes of
their own they were now in, yet acknowledging they were farre
inferior to thoſe wayes of God they had now begun: Then twelve
of the young men went and took <hi>Sacochanimo</hi> by the hand one by
one and told him that they did love him, and would go with him
in Gods way, and ſome of them made a long ſpeech to him to this
purpoſe;<note place="margin">This was <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anqueticks</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest ſonne.</note> and the old men encouraged them in their way, &amp; deſired
them never to forget thoſe promiſes they had now made; then
one of the young men told me the ground of their meeting, <hi>viz.</hi>
They were ſorry to ſee that the meeting did go on no more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that there were no more at it, and that they were deſirous
to ſtrengthen themſelves in the way of God, to have good hearts,
and one heart, and to walk together in love in the wayes of God.
So after they had eaten together the victuals of their own provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and we had ſung part of a Pſalme in their own language,
and I had prayed with them, they returned with the manifeſtation
of much joy and thankfulneſſe; and this I can ſay, they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
conſtant in the way of God, and I have great hopes of ſome
of them, bleſſed be his name.</p>

to appoint another meeting, and many Indians being met, they
fell to a great diſcourſe about the Pawwawes power to kill men,
and there were many ſtories told of the great hurt they had done
by their witchcraft many wayes (here you muſt know, that though
the Indians many of them were brought by the knowledge they
had of God, to renounce the Pawwawes help in time of ſickneſſe
or otherwiſe, yet they found it hard to get from under the yoake
of cruelty that they and their forefathers had ſo long groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
for I know ſome, that then groaned under it, acknowledged
they did ſee that in God which would free them from it, if they
had but confidence to truſt in him. Then the queſtion was asked,
Who is there that doth not fear the Pawwawes? anſwer was made
by ſome who favoured them, there is not any man which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of the Pawwawes; then looking upon <hi>Hiacoomes,</hi> who was
one that proteſted moſt againſt them, told him that the Pawwawes
could kill him; he anſwered they could not; they asked him againe,
why? he told them, becauſe he did beleeve in God and truſt in
him, and that therfore all the Pawwaws could not do him any hurt;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117834:9"/>
Then they all wondered exceedingly when he ſpake thus ſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Then divers of them ſaid one by one, though before I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of the Pawwawes, yet now, becauſe I hear <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> his
words, I do not fear them, but beleeve in God too. Then the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at this time was carried on, and <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> is deſired by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
to reckon up their ſins unto them; he preſently found 45. or
50. and as many good duties; his work was very well liked, and in
the concluſion twenty two Indians were found to reſolve againſt
thoſe evils, and to walk with God, and attend the word of God.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1650</label> But I may not here forget an Indian called <hi>Hummanequem,</hi> who
exceeded all the reſt, to the wonderment of the Indians; he with
much ſorrow, hatred, and courage, related about twenty of his
own ſins, and profeſſed to follow the one God againſt all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
He told them he was brought into this condition by <hi>Hiacoomes</hi>
his counſel from the Word of God, which at firſt he ſaid he liked
not, afterwayes laid it by him as a thing to be conſidered, not
knowing well what to do; at laſt, looking over things again, he
came to this reſolution which you have now heard; I confeſſe
this action makes me think he ſpake more then from a natural
principle, conſidering that the man hath been ſince an earneſt ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of more light both publike and private; as alſo for refuſing the
help of a Pawwaw which lives within a bow ſhoot of his doore,
when his wife was three dayes in travel, and waited patiently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, till they obtained a merciful deliverance by prayer.</p>
                  <p>And whilſt we were making progreſſe in the work of the Lord
on a Lecture day, an Indian ſtood up, and ſaid he had been a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and committed many evill things, but now was ſorry for them,
and did repent, deſired to forſake his ſins, and to walk in Gods
way. Then he went to the Sagamore <hi>Towanquetick,</hi> and took him
by the hand, ſaying, <hi>I do love you, and do greatly deſire to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

and then came to me in like manner, ſaying, <hi>I pray love me, and I
do love you, and am deſirous to go with you for Gods ſake;</hi> ſo
he was received with many thanks, and ſince I know him to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and laborious. I confeſſe I marvelled to ſee them act with
ſuch a ſpirit, but I conſidered, it was ſutable to their own meeting
in 48.</p>
                  <p>Now the Indian accompanied his friend that ſuddenly loſt his two
ſons; he I ſay remaining ſtill in his obſtinacy, is alſo found out, and
feeles the wrath of God, being ſtricken with a dead Palſie, all one
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117834:9"/>
ſide of him, but his eye and eare; The dead Palſie is a ſtrange
and unwonted diſeaſe amongſt the Indians; I have beene ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with him; when I ſpake to him, he fetched many ſighs; he is
at this day a living and a dead monument of the Lords diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
having hurt himſelf moſt, and done them moſt good he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Another thing is a remarkable combate between two Indians
and a Pawwaw, who, on the Lords day after meeting, came in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
angry, ſaying, I know the meeting Indians are lyars; you ſay
you care not for the Pawwawes; then calling two or three of them
by name, and railing at them, told them that they were deceived,
for the Pawwawes could kill all the meeting Indians if they did
ſet about it; with that one of the young men replyed with much
courage, ſaying, it is true, I do not fear the Pawwawes, neither do I
deſire any favour at their hands, pray kill me if you can. And <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acoomes</hi>
told him alſo that he would be in the midſt of all the Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wawes
of the Iland that they could procure, and they ſhould do
their utmoſt they could againſt him, and when they did their
worſt by their witchcrafts to kill him, he would without feare ſet
himſelf againſt them, by remembring <hi>Jehovah;</hi> he told him alſo
that he did put all the Pawwawes under his heel, pointing unto it;
which anſwers did preſently ſilence the Pawwawes devilliſh ſpirit,
and had he nothing to ſay, but that none but <hi>Hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>oomes</hi> was able ſo
to do.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved the wiſe diſpoſing hand of God in another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of his; there have not as I know, any man, woman or child
died of the meeting Indians ſince the meeting began, untill now of
late the Lord took away <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> his child which was about five
dayes old; he was beſt able to make a good uſe of it, and to carry
himſelf well in it, and ſo was his wife alſo; and truly they gave
an excellent example in this alſo, as they have in other things;
here were no black faces for it as the manner of the Indians is, nor
goods buried with it, nor helliſh howlings over the dead, but a
patient reſigning of it to him that gave it; There were ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
at the burial, and many Indians to whom I ſpake ſomething
of the Reſurrection, and as we were going away, one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
told me he was much refreſhed in being freed from their old
cuſtomes, as alſo to hear of the Reſurrection of good men and
their children to be with God.</p>
                  <p>There are now by the grace of God thirty nine Indian men of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117834:10"/>
this meeting, beſides women that are looking this way, which we
ſuppoſe to exceed the number of the men, though not known by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
entrance into Covenant as the men, but are now near it. Theſe
in general have the knowledge of the fundamental points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
your ſelf when you were with us, had ſome tryal of it; it
was a great while my maine work to adminiſter light in general to
them; and there now, through mercy, appears ſome life, hoping
that ſome of them have received this great mercy of God
in Chriſt. This is a great incouragement to me, as alſo that their
hearts are engaged in the way of the Lord for the ſalvation of their
own ſouls upon Gods ends. One of theſe meeting Indians ſaid (and
I hope feelingly) that if all the world, the riches, plenty, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of it were preſented without God, or God without all theſe, I
would take God. And another ſaid, that if the greateſt Sagamore in
the Land ſhould take him in his armes, and proffer him his love, and
riches and gifts to turn from his way, he would not go with him
from this way of God. I heard one of them of his own accord
(and to the ſame purpoſe) in complaining againſt head knowledge
and lip prayers, without heart holineſſe, loathing the condition of
ſuch a man, ſaying, I deſire my heart may taſte the word of God,
repent of my ſinnes, and leane upon the Redemption of the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt. Some of them having a diſcourſe with <hi>Vzzamequin</hi>
a great Sachem or Governour on the maine Land (coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them) about the wayes of God, he enquired what earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good things came along with them, and demanding of them
what they had gotten by all they had done this way? one of them
replyed, we ſerve not God for cloathing, nor for any outward
thing. I have obſerved many ſuch like paſſages; but my occaſions
at preſent will not permit me to ſet them down, I only bring you
thoſe things which are moſt ready in my minde.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing that I took ſpecial notice of, is, the receiving
of the five men when your ſelf was preſent, into the meeting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
number, one of them (the young man you ſaw) was ſent at
firſt about two or three months before by one of the greateſt Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wawes
upon the Iland to learn and ſpy what was done at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and carry him word, but at the laſt he learned ſo much as he
then openly profeſt to hate the Pawwawes and their witchcrafts,
and that he did repent of his ſinnes, and deſired to go with the
meeting Indians in Gods ways; another ſaid he deſired to joyn with
the meeting Indians that he might have a renewed good heart, the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117834:10"/>
other were much like affected, only one of them reckoned up the
commandments, and as he proceeded he proteſted againſt the ſins
forbidden, and profeſſed obedience to the duties commanded; the
laſt anſwered the queſtion put to him by your ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> by what
power they did think to do this? who anſwered, Firſt, by his
good deſire; and ſecondly, by the help and bleſſing of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Juſt now whilſt I am a writing, there comes an Indian unto me,
and tels me his minde in theſe words, I ſhall long for your returne
back again out of the Bay, that we may hear the good word of
God; the former ſins of my heart in the time of my youth I
now remember; when I hear the word of God, and when I walk
in the woods alone, I have much talk with God, and great repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for my ſins, and now I throw behind me all my ſtrange gods,
and my heart goes right to God in prayer.</p>
                  <p>The way that I am now in (through the grace of God) for the
carrying on of this great work, is by a Lecture every fortnight,
whereunto both men women and children do come; and firſt I
pray with them, teach them, chatechiſe their children, ſing a Pſalm,
and all in their own language. I conferre every laſt day of the
week with <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> about his ſubject matter of preaching to the
Indians the next day, where I furniſh him with what ſpiritual food
the Lord is pleaſed to afford me for them, wherein God hath
much aſſiſted him for his own and their ſpiritual good and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
who is diligent and conſcionable to hold forth the grace of
Chriſt to the Indians. For this purpoſe your ſervent and frequent
prayers together with all thoſe who rejoyce in advancing the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Chriſt, are by me earneſtly deſired, and for me that I may
preach him amongſt the Heathen, to the praiſe of the excellency of
his own power, and not mine; and that the Indians in this ſmall
beginning, being Gods husbandry, and Gods building, may be a
fruitful glorious ſpreading Vine, and builded together for an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of God through the Spirit, unto whom I commend you in

                  </opener>
                  <p>YOur very loving acceptance of my Letters doth engage me
very much unto you, but eſpecially your cordial rejoycing in
the progreſſe of this work of the Lord among theſe poor Indians.
Sir, I ſhall firſt anſwer ſome material things in your Letter. Firſt,
for that opinion of <hi>Rabbi-ben-Iſrael</hi> which you mention, I would
intreat you to requeſt the ſame godly Miniſter (nay I hope he hath
already done it) to ſend to him to know his grounds, and how he
came to that Intelligence, when was it done, which way were they
tranſported into <hi>America,</hi> by whom, and what occaſion, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and to what Parts firſt, or what ſteps of intimation of ſuch a
thing may there be. I had ſome thoughts in my heart to ſearch
the Original of this People, that I might finde under what Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and Promiſe their fore-fathers have been, for the help of my
faith; for <hi>Jehovah</hi> remembers and giveth being to ancient Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
What had become of us ſonnes of <hi>Japhet,</hi> if the Lord had
not remembred that (and ſuch like ancient Promiſes) <hi>God ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade</hi>
Japhet <hi>to dwell in the Tents of</hi> Shem. If theſe people be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Covenant and Promiſe as ancient as <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Eber,</hi> it is a
ground of faith to expect mercy for them.</p>
                  <p>Now this I have thought, that it ſeemeth to me as clear in the
Scripture,<note place="margin">Gen. 10.</note> that theſe are the children of <hi>Shem</hi> as we of <hi>Japhet,</hi> and
<hi>Shem</hi> was a great man in the Church, and to whom <hi>Abraham</hi> paid
<hi>Tythes;</hi> for I beleeve he was <hi>Melchiſedceck;</hi> yea it ſeemeth to me
probable that theſe people are Hebrews, of <hi>Eber,</hi> whoſe ſonnes the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117834:11"/>
Scripture ſends fartheſt Eaſt (as it ſeemeth to me) and learned
<hi>Broughton</hi> put ſome of them over into <hi>America,</hi> and certainly this
Country was peopled Eaſtward from the place of the <hi>Arks</hi> reſting,
ſeeing the finding of them by the Weſt is but of yeſterday: Now <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
was alſo a great man in the Church; <hi>Abraham</hi> the Hebrew,
ſaith the text; and how often in the Scriptures doth the Lord uſe
that bleſſed word of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Covenant, I am the God of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes?</hi>
beſides there be ſundry Propheſies in Scripture, <hi>unto the
goings down of the Sunne;</hi> and let it be conſidered whether <hi>America</hi>
be not to be accounted among the places that are the goings
down of the Sunne unto thoſe places where thoſe Promiſes were
promulgated; And when the Lord inlarged the Promiſe to <hi>Jacob</hi>
(as the light and extent of grace hath ever been encreaſing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging)
he promiſed to make him a Nation and a multitude of
Nations, which ſo farre as we regard a litteral accompliſhment, is
in part accompliſht in the Nation of the Jewes, and the other part
remaineth (as it may ſeem) to be accompliſht in the loſt Iſraelites
ſcattered in the world, principally, if not wholly, amongſt the ſons
of <hi>Japhet</hi> and <hi>Shem;</hi> and our God who can and will gather the
ſcattered and loſt duſt of our bodies at the Reſurrection, can and
will finde out theſe loſt and ſcattered Iſraelites, and in finding up
them, bring in with them the Nations among whom they were
ſcattered, and ſo ſhall <hi>Jacobs</hi> Promiſe extend to a multitude of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
indeed; and this is a great ground of faith for the converſion
of the Eaſterne Nations, and may be of help to our faith for theſe
Indians; eſpecially if <hi>Rabbi Ben-Iſrael</hi> can make it appeare that
ſome of the Iſraelites were brought into <hi>America,</hi> and ſcattered
here, or if the Lord ſhall by any meanes give us to underſtand the
ſame.</p>
                  <p>Theſe meditations upon Scripture grounds do miniſter comfort
&amp; encouragement to my heart with others alſo, as, <hi>That all Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
ſhall ſee his Glory, and that all Nations and Kingdoms ſhall become
the Kingdoms of the Lord Ieſus;</hi> and this I deſire to do, to look
unto Scripture grounds only; <hi>Oh this precious this perfect Word of
God!</hi> You intimate alſo how zealouſly worthy Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
this work; the Lord reward him, and the Lord accept him
in all his holy labours. Likewiſe you intimate how acceptable
this work is to the Parliament, that bleſſed Aſſembly, whom the
Lord Chriſt hath delighted to make inſtrumental to begin to ſet
up the longed for, prayed for, and deſired Kingdome of the Lord
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117834:12"/>
Jeſus; for we may ſee in ſome meaſure the accompliſhment of that
Propheſie of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 25. The peaceable ſummer begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to ariſe out of theſe diſtreſſed times of perplexity, all thoſe
ſignes preceding the glorious coming of Chriſt are accompliſhing,
and a thick black cloud is gathered, a cloud of blood, confuſion,
Hereſies and Errors, and the thickeſt and moſt portentous black
part of that cloud is the Toleration of the moſt groſſe and
convicted impieties under the pretence of conſcience, which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application
of the Sword of Authority (if it ſhould awhile pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile)
cannot be innocent, and will undoubtedly prolong the
ſtorme and delay of the reigne of Chriſt; But notwithſtanding
all this black cloud, who ſeeth not the glorious coming of the
Lord Jeſus breaking through this cloud, and coming with power
and great glory? He is King of Kings and reigneth over Kings;
for where Juſtice reignes, Chriſt doth reigne; and that Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
principle for man to be above God, whether the Pope in the
Church, or Monarches in the Common-wealth, is thrown to the
ground. He that is above the Law, is above the Word; and he that
is above the Word, is above Chriſt; Chriſt reigneth not over ſuch
as be above his Law: But behold, now Chriſt reigneth, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
breaks forth in the brightneſſe of his coming, and will in his
time ſcatter all this thick black cloud, yea the thickeſt of it. Now
this glorious work of bringing in and ſetting up the glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt, hath the Lord of his free grace and mercy put into
the hands of this renowned Parliament and Army; Lord put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all their hearts to make this deſigne of Chriſt their main firſt
and chiefeſt endeavour, according to the Word, <hi>Seek firſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven and the righteouſneſſe thereof, and all other things ſhall
be added.</hi> And when the Lord Jeſus is about to ſet up his bleſſed
Kingdome among theſe poore Indians alſo, how well doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the ſpirit of ſuch inſtruments in the hand of Chriſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
that work alſo, being the ſame buſineſſe in ſome reſpect which
themſelves are about by the good hand of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Surely Sir, your chief work of this nature now is to follow this
Indian work which ſticks in the birth for want of means. You
would marvel if I ſhould tell you how they long to come into a
way of civility by co-habitation, and by forming government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves, that ſo they being in ſuch order might have a
Church and the Ordinances of Chriſt among them; but want of
a Magazine of all ſorts of tools and materials for ſuch a work, is the
preſent impediment.</p>

                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:117834:12"/>
The Lord is wiſer then man, and his time is beſt; I will not ſay
any thing now for farther direction about what is requiſite for the
work which the Lord is preparing their hearts unto; my former
Letters have ſaid enough that way, partly to you, and partly to
Mr. <hi>Pelham,</hi> whoſe Letters I hope you have ſeen as containing ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
things neceſſary for your view; and I doubt not but your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
will readily adde what is lacking in what I have projected;
only let me ſay this, that I dayly ſtill ſee more evidence that that
is the very way which the Lord would have us take at preſent.</p>
                  <p>Let me, I beſeech you, trouble you a little farther with ſome
conſiderations about this great Indian work which lyeth upon me,
as my continual care, prayer, deſire and endeavour to carry on,
namely for their ſchooling and education of youth in learing,
which is a principal means for promoting of it for future times;
If the Lord bring us to live in a Towne and Society, we muſt have
ſpeiial care to have Schools for the inſtruction of the youth in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that they may be able to read the Scriptures at leaſt. And
therefore there muſt be ſome Annual revenew for the maintaining
of ſuch Schoolmaſters and Dames; Beſides, I do very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to tranſlate ſome parts of the Scriptures into their language,
and to print ſome Primer in their language wherein to initiate and
teach them to read, which ſome of the men do much alſo deſire, and
printing ſuch a thing will be troubleſome and chargable, and I
having yet but little skill in their language (having little leaſure
to attend it by reaſon of my continual attendance on my Miniſtry
in our own Church) I muſt have ſome Indians, and it may be other
help continually about me to try and examine Tranſlations, which
I look at as a ſacred and holy work, and to be regarded with much
fear, care, and reverence; and all this is chargable; therefore I
look at that as a ſpecial matter on which coſt is to be beſtowed, if
the Lord provide means, for I have not means of my own for it.
I have a family of many children to educate, and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give over my Miniſtry in our Church whereby my family is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
to attend the Indians to whom I give, and of whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
nothing, nor have they any thing to give: ſo that want of
money is the only thing in view that doth retard a more full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of this work unto which the Lord doth ripen them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, there be ſundry prompt, pregnant witted youths, not
vitiouſly inclined, but well diſpoſed, which I deſire may be wholly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117834:13"/>
ſequeſtred to learning, and put to Schoole for that purpoſe, had
we means; and I ſuppoſe ten pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to be paid in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> will maintaine one Indian youth at Schoole, and halfe aſcore
ſuch Gifts or Annuities would by the bleſſing of God greatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this work ſo farre as concerns that particular.</p>
                  <p>I had thought to have ſet down ſome of their Queſtions, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you might perceive how theſe dry bones begin to gather fleſh
and ſinnews; but partly I have them not ready, for I have not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to ſet them down at preſent, and they ſoone ſlip my memory,
and I did it in all my laſt Letters, and may do it again, if the Lord
will, hereafter. And therefore thus much at preſent, being cald off
to haſten to ſeale up my Letters, the Lord Jeſus bleſſe you, ſanctifie
and keep you in all your labours and travels, and accept you, and
all your works, and return you again unto us in due ſeaſon here to

                  <p>Now ſeeing it is ſo great a comfort to you to hear how the Lord
is pleaſed to carry on this work, I ſhall relate unto you ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whereby you may ſee in what frame they be; I had, and ſtill
have, a great deſire to go to a great fiſhing place, <hi>Namaske</hi> upon
<hi>Merimak;</hi> and becauſe the Indians way lyeth beyond the great
River which we cannot paſſe with our horſes, nor can we well go
to it on this ſide the river, unleſſe we go by <hi>Naſhaway,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and bad way, unbeaten, the Indians not uſing that way; I
therefore hired a hardy man of <hi>Naſhaway</hi> to beat out a way and
to mark trees, ſo that he may Pilot me thither in the ſpring, and he
hired Indians with him and did it; and in the way paſſed through
a great people called <hi>Sowahagen Indians,</hi> ſome of which had heard
me at <hi>Pautuket</hi> and at <hi>Naſhaway,</hi> and had carried home ſuch ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
that they were generally ſtirred with a deſire that I would
come and teach them; and when they ſaw a man come to cut out
a way for me that way, they were very glad; and when he told
them I intended to come that way the next ſpring, they ſeemed
to him full of joy, and made him very welcome. But in the Spring,
when I ſhould have gone, I was not well, it being a very ſickly time,
ſo that I ſaw the Lord prevented me of that journey; yet when I
went to <hi>Pautuket</hi> another fiiſhing place, where from all parts about
they met together, thither came divers of theſe <hi>Sowahegen</hi> Indians,
and heard me teach, and I had conference with them; and among
other things, I asked whether <hi>Sowahegen</hi> Indians were deſirous to
pray to God; they anſwered; yea, I asked how many deſired it;
they anſwered <hi>wamu,</hi> that is, <hi>All,</hi> and with ſuch affection as did
much affect thoſe Chriſtian men that I had with me in company.</p>
                  <p>The chief <hi>Sachim</hi> of this place <hi>Pautuket,</hi> and of all <hi>Mermak</hi> in
<hi>Papaſſaconnoway,</hi> whom I mentioned unto you the laſt yeere, who
gave up himſelf and his ſonnes to pray unto God, this man did
this yeer ſhew very great affection to me, and to the Word of God;
he did exceeding earneſtly, importunately invite me to come and
live there and teach them; he uſed many arguments, many where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117834:14"/>
I have forgotten: but this was one, <hi>that my coming thither but
once in a yeere, did them but little good, becauſe they ſoone had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
what I taught, it being ſo ſeldome, and ſo long betwixt the
times;</hi> further he ſaid, <hi>That he had many men, and of them many
nought, and would not beleeve him that praying to God was ſo good,
but if I would come and teach them, he hoped they would beleeve me;</hi>
He farther added, that I did, <hi>as if one ſhould come and throw a fine
thing among them, and they earneſtly catch at it, and like it well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it looks finely, but they cannot look into it to see what is within
it, and what it is within, they cannot tell whether ſomething or nothing,
it may be a stock or a ſtone is within it, or it may be a precious thing;
but if it be opened, and they ſee what is within it, and ſee it precious, then
they ſhould beleeve it</hi> (ſo ſaid he) <hi>you tell us of praying to God,</hi> (for ſo
they call all Religion) <hi>and we like it well at the firſt ſight, and we know
not what it is within, it may be excellent, or it may be nothing, we cannot
tell, but if you would come unto us, and open it unto us, and ſhew us what
it is within, then we ſhould beleeve that it is ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> excellent as you ſay, when
we ſee it opened;</hi> Such elegant arguments as theſe did he uſe, with
much gravity, wiſdome and affection; and truly my heart much
yearneth towards them, and I have a great deſire to make our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Towne that way; yet the Lord by the Eye of Providence ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to look thither, partly becauſe there is not a competent
place of due encouragement for ſubſiſtence; which would ſpoyle
the work; and partly becauſe our Indians which are our firſt and
chief materials in preſent view, are loth to go Northward, though
they ſay they will go with me any whether; but it concerneth me
much not to lead them into temptation of ſcarity, cold and want,
which may damp the progreſſe of the Goſpel; but I rather think
where ever I begin the firſt Towne, (if I live) I muſt begin more
townes then one, or oh that the Lord would raiſe up more and
more fit labourers into this harveſt:</p>
                  <p>Another Indian, who lived remote another way, asked me if I
had any children? I anſwered yea; he asked how many? I ſaid ſixe;
he asked how many of them were ſonnes? I told him five; then
he asked whether my ſonnes ſhould teach the Indians to know
God as I do? at which queſtion I was much moved in my heart, for
I have often in my prayers dedicated all my ſonnes unto the Lord
to ſerve him in this ſervice, if he will pleaſe to accept them therein;
and my purpoſe is to do my uttermoſt to traine them up in learning,
whereby they may be fitted in the beſt manner I can to ſerve the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117834:14"/>
Lord herein, and better preferment I deſire not for them then to
ſerve the Lord in this travel; and to that purpoſe I anſwered him,
and my anſwer ſeemed to be well pleaſing to them, which ſeemed
to miniſter to my heart ſome encouragement, that the Lords mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was to improve them that way, and he would prepare their
hearts to accept the ſame.</p>
                  <p>There is another aged <hi>Sachem</hi> at <hi>Quabagud</hi> threeſcore miles
Weſtward, and he doth greatly deſire that I would come thither
and teach them, and live there; and I made a journey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thither this
ſummer, and I went by <hi>Naſhaway;</hi> but it ſo fell out that there were
ſome ſtirres betwixt the <hi>Nazaganſet</hi> and <hi>Monahegen</hi> Indians, ſome
murder committed, &amp;c. which made our Church doubtful at firſt
of my going, which when the <hi>Naſhaway Sachem</hi> heard, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
twenty armed men (after their manner) to be ready, and
himſelf with theſe twenty men; beſides ſendry of our neer Indians
went along with me to guard me, but I took ſome Engliſh along
with me alſo, ſo that hereby their good affection is manifeſted to
me, and to the work I have in hand; here alſo I found ſundry
hungry after inſtruction, but it pleaſed God to exerciſe us with
ſuch tedious raine, and bad weather, that we were extreme wet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that I was not dry night nor day from the third day of the
week unto the ſixth, but ſo travelled, and at night pull off my
boots, wring my ſtockins, and on with them again, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued;
the rivers alſo were raiſed, ſo as that we were wet in riding
through; but that which added to my affliction was, my horſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ſo that I was forced to let my horſe go empty, and ride on one
of the mens horſes which I took along with me, yet God ſtept in
and helped; I conſidered that word of God, 2 <hi>Tim 2, 3. Endure
hardſhip as a good Souldier of Chriſt;</hi> with many other ſuch like
meditations, which I think not meet to mention now. And I thank
the Lord, neither I nor my company took any hurt, but the Lord
brought us in ſafety and health home again.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both Mr. <hi>Pelham</hi> and your ſelf do ſo heartily, and with
ſuch good affection ſend commendations and greetings unto our
Indians which pray unto God, I will tell you what a good occaſion
was miniſtred unto me, through the goodneſſe of God, by a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
which one of them propounded the next meeting as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
after I had received my Letters, and I muſt firſt tell you the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>There had been at that time ſome ſtrange Indians among them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117834:15"/>
which came to ſee them who prayed to God, as one from <hi>Martins
Vineyard,</hi> who is helpful to Mr. <hi>Mahu</hi> to tell him words, &amp;c. and
I think ſome others, <hi>when thoſe ſtrangers came,</hi> and they perceived
them to <hi>affect Religion,</hi> and had mutual conference about the ſame,
there was very great <hi>gladneſſe of heart</hi> among them, and they made
theſe ſtrangers exceeding welcome; Hereupon did the Queſtion
ariſe, namely what is the reaſon, that when a ſtrange<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indian comes
among us whom we never ſaw before, <hi>yet if he pray unto God, we
do exceedingly love him: But if my own Brother, dwelling a great
way off, come unto us, he not praying to God, though we love him,
yet nothing ſo as we love that other ſtranger who doth pray unto
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This queſtion did ſo clearly demonſtrate that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
calleth <hi>love of the Brethren,</hi> that I thought it was uſeful; firſt,
to try others of them, whether they found the ſame in their hearts;
I therefore asked them, how they found it in theis hearts? And
they anſwered, that they all found it ſo in their hearts, and that it
had been a matter of diſcourſe among themſelves, <hi>wondring at it,
what the reaſon of it ſhould be,</hi> which was no ſmall comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
unto my ſpirit; Then in my anſwer I asked them
what ſhould be the reaſon that the godly people in <hi>England,</hi> 3000.
miles off, who never ſaw them, yet hearing that they pray to God,
do exceedingly rejoyce at it, and love them, and ſend them tokens
of their love, and then I reckoned up what had been ſent them,
and mentioned ſome names to them, and farther told them that
their love was ſo great unto them, that they would ſend them over
a great deale more; and in ſpecial, I hoped they would ſend
us ſuch materials as be requiſite to make a Towne, and menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
ſome ſuch things as I have named in the Catalogue I ſent to
you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and asked them if they could tell the reaſon of it; they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
no; this being the ſame with their queſtion; and then I
ſhewed the unity of ſpirit, &amp;c. And thus you ſee the occaſion and
way of communicating the good will and love of the Saints
in <hi>England</hi> unto them, ſo as that they might taſte a ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and finde ſome edification of their ſouls by thoſe outward
bleſſings which they received. And whereas ſome, (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
who came from us to <hi>England,</hi> are no better friends to
this work then they ſhould, and may ſpeak ſlightly of it: I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
that ſuch may be asked but this queſtion; Did they ſo much
regard to look after it here, as to go three or four miles to ſome of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117834:15"/>
our meetings, and to obſerve what was ſaid and done there? if not,
how can they tell how things be? if they ſay they were, I deſire
to know what they except againſt? If they ſay the Indians be all
nought becauſe ſuch as come loytering and filtching about in our
Townes are ſo; Wiſh them to conſider how unequal that judgment
is, if all the Engliſh ſhould be judged by the worſt of them; and
any ſhould ſay they be all ſuch, this were to condemne the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
with the wicked. Had I leaſure, I would inſert a few more of
their queſtions, that you might perceive how fleſh and ſinewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to gather upon theſe dry bones; but I cannot at this time attend
it; the preſent work of God among them is to gather them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to bring them to Political life, both in Eccleſiaſtical ſociety
and in Civil, for which they earneſtly long and enquire, and ſome
aged ones ſay, <hi>Oh that God would let me live to ſee that day;</hi> I allude
to that in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> not becauſe I have any light to perſwade me
theſe are that people there mentioned, only they be dry and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
bones, if any be in the world; and the work of God upon
all ſuch dry bones I beleeve will be in many things <hi>Symmetricall;</hi>
But the work of the day is to civilize them, and it will be very
chargeable, and becauſe in your Letters to Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> you deſired
that he and I ſhould ſpeak with the Commiſſioners what was fitting
to ſend over for this work, we could not ſpeak with the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of other Colonies, nor write to have any ſeaſonable return,
nor could we communicate the ſtate of the buſineſſe unto them,
but what was feaſible we have done.</p>
                  <p>Now dear Sir, it may be you will deſire to know what kinde of
Civil Government they ſhall be inſtructed in; I acknowledge it to
be a very weighty conſideration; and I have adviſed with Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and others about it, and this I propound as my general rule
through the help of the Lord; they ſhall be wholly governed by
the Scriptures in all things both in Church and State; they ſhall
have no other Law-giver; the Lord ſhall be their Law-giver, the
Lord ſhall be their Judge, the Lord ſhall be their King, and he will
ſave them; and when it is ſo the Lord reigneth, and unto that
frame the Lord will bring all the world ere he hath done, but it will
be more difficult in other Nations who have been adulterate with
their <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> or humane wiſdome; they will be loth to lay
downe their imperfect own Star-light of excellent Lawes, in their
conceits, for the perfect Sun-light of the Scripture, which through
blindneſſe they cannot ſee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:117834:16"/>
                     <hi>England</hi> long ſince had happy experience of it, and it is often
in my heart to deſire they would pitch there in this preſent great
change they are about; this is certaine, that all formes and Lawes
of mans invention will ſhake, be unſetled; and many will doubt
of ſubjecting to any way man can deviſe; and they will never reſt
till they come up to the Scriptures, and when they produce Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
grounds for all they do, it will anſwer and ſatisfie all godly
conſciences, and awe the reſt, and ſtop their mouths unleſſe they
will cavill againſt divine wiſdome. It is the very reaſon why the
Lord in this houre of temptation will bring Nations into diſtreſſe
and perplexity, that ſo they may be forced to the Scriptures; the
light whereof hath ſole authority to extricate them out of their
deep perplexities; and therefore all Governments are and will be
ſhaken, that men may be forced to pitch upon the firme and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken
foundation, <hi>the Word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> this is doubtleſſe the great
deſigne of Chriſt in theſe later dayes; Oh that mens eyes were
open to ſee it, and when the world is brought into this frame,
then Chriſt reigneth; and when this is, Government ſhall be in
the hands of the Saints of the moſt high.</p>
                  <p>But I forget my ſelf; this is not my preſent work, it is my deſire
and prayer; my work is to endeavour the ſetting up Chriſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
among the Indians.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you tell me of one that will publiſh reaſons to prove (at
leaſt) ſome of the ten Tribes are in <hi>America,</hi> it would be glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
to my heart; and when Mr. <hi>Dudley</hi> heard of it, he ſaid that
Captaine <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who lately dyed at <hi>Boſton,</hi> told him that he
ſaw many Indians to the Southward Circumciſed; and that he was
oft converſant among them, and ſaw it with his eyes, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
certaine of it; this is Captaine <hi>Cromwels</hi> teſtimony,
and it ſeemeth to be one of the moſt probable arguments that ever
I yet heard of; unleſſe the Lord ſhall pleaſe to clear it up that
they are ſome of thoſe dry bones which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaketh of.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Mahew,</hi> who putteth his hand unto this Plough at <hi>Martins
Vineyard,</hi> being young, and a beginner here, hath extreme want of
books; he needeth <hi>Commentaries</hi> and <hi>Common Places</hi> for the body
of Divinity, that ſo he might be well grounded and principled; if
therefore the Lord bring any meanes into your hand, I deſire you
would (by the help of ſome godly Divine) ſend him over ſuch books
as may be neceaſſry for a young Scholer; I will name no books,
he needs all; I beſeech you put ſome weight upon it, for I deſire
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117834:16"/>
he might be furniſhed in that kinde, and other ſupplies will be
needful for him.</p>
                  <p>And for my ſelf I have this requeſt (who alſo am ſhort enough
in books) that I might be helped to purchaſe my brother <hi>Weld</hi> his
books, the ſumme of the purchaſe is (34. li.) I am loth they ſhould
come back to <hi>England</hi> when we have ſo much need of them here,
and without ready money there I cannot have them; if therefore
ſo much money might be disburſed for me, it would be a bleſſing to
me, but it is on condition that all his books here be comprehended,
elſe I will not give ſo much for them.</p>
                  <p>One thing more I ſhall mention, <hi>viz.</hi> if the work go on, and
you ſend us means, then this may be conſiderable, which ſome have
adviſed me, whether it might not be good to ſend me over a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
or two young men-ſervants; but if you ſhould approve it,
I deſire they may be godly, and well conditioned, of a good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
for they muſt be imployed among the Indians, and if they
ſhould be naught, and of an ill diſpoſition they might do a great
deal of hurt, but if they be honeſt &amp; meek and well ſpirited, it may be
a great furtherance of the work, I wholly leave it to your wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Having ſome leaſure by the Ships delay I will inſert a few que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
which they have propounded. <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a man know Gods Word, but beleeve it not; and he teach others,
is that good teaching? and if others beleeve that which he teacheth,
is that good beleeving, or faith? <hi>upon this queſtion I asked them,
how they could tell when a man knoweth Gods Word that he
doth not beleeve it? They anſwered me,</hi> When he doth not do in his
practice anſwerable to that which he knoweth.</p>
                  <p>If I teach on the Sabbath which you have taught us, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
ſome, Is that a fin? and ſome I miſtake and teach wrong, Is that
a ſin?</p>
                  <p>Do all evill thoughts come from the Devill, and all good ones from
God?</p>
                  <p>What is watchfulneſſe?</p>
                  <p>How ſhall I finde happineſſe?</p>
                  <p>What ſhould I pray for at night, and what at morning, and what on
the Sabbath day?</p>
                  <p>What is true Repentance, or how ſhall I know when this is true?</p>
                  <p>How muſt I wait on God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:117834:17"/>
Shall we ſee Chriſt at the day of Judgment?</p>
                  <p>Can we ſee God?</p>
                  <p>When I pray for a ſoft heart, why is it still hard?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Can one be ſaved by reading the book of the creature?</hi> This que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was made when I taught them, That God gave us two books,
and that in the book of the creature, every creature was a word or
ſentence, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>You ſaid God promiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to go with him, how doth he go
with us?</p>
                  <p>When ſuch die as never heard of Chriſt, whether do they go?</p>
                  <p>When the wicked die, do they firſt go to heaven to the judgment ſeate
of Chriſt to be judged, and then go away to hell?</p>
                  <p>What is the meaning of the word Hebrews?</p>
                  <p>Why doth God ſay, I am the God of the Hebrews?</p>
                  <p>When Chriſt aroſe, whence came his ſoul? <hi>When I anſwered from
heaven; It was replyed,</hi> How then was Chriſt puniſhed in our ſtead?
Or when did he ſuffer in our ſtead, afore death, or after?</p>
                  <p>When I pray every day, why is my heart ſo hard ſtill, even as a
ſtone?</p>
                  <p>How doth God ariſe, and we worſhip at his feet, what meaneth it?
<hi>This was when I preached out of</hi> Pſal. 132.</p>
                  <p>Why did they eate the Paſſeover, with loynes girt, and ſhooes on their
feet?</p>
                  <p>What meaneth, ariſe O Lord into thy reſting place?</p>
                  <p>What meaneth, hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, and they

                  <p>What meaneth, thou ſhalt not covet any thing that is thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?</p>
                  <p>If one purpoſeth to pray, and yet dieth before that time, whether go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his ſoul?</p>
                  <p>If I teach on the Sabbath ſomething that ſome other Engliſhman
taught me, the Indians do not like it, if it be not that which you have
taught, is this well?</p>
                  <p>Why muſt we be like Salt?</p>
                  <p>If I do not love wicked men, nor good men, am I good?</p>
                  <p>What meaneth that, love enemies and wicked men?</p>
                  <p>Doth God know who ſhall repent, and beleeve, and who not? <hi>When

                  </p>

matters, yet I ſhal forbear, only this, ſtill they continue conſtant, and
earneſtly deſire to ſet upon the way of cohabitation &amp; prepare for
their enjoyment of that great bleſſing to gather a Church of Chriſt
among them; and ſince the writing of my laſt a <hi>Nipnet Sachem</hi>
hath ſubmitted himſelf to pray unto the Lord, and much deſireth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117834:18"/>
one of our chief ones to live with him and teach him and thoſe that
are with him.</p>
                  <p>You wrote (I thank you) much encouraging to loſe no time, and
follow the work, though I borrow materials, but I durſt not do ſo,
the work is great, as I informed you in my former Letters; and I fear,
leſt it ſhould diſcourage you, nor would I be too haſty to run before
the Lord do clearly (by Scripture rules) ſay go; nor on the other ſide
would I hold them too long in ſuſpence, there may be weakneſſe
that way to their diſcouragement, but it is the Lords work, and he
is infinite in wiſdome, and he will ſuit the work in ſuch a time and
place as ſhall beſt attain his appointed ends and his great glory.</p>
                  <p>Touching the way of their Government, I alſo intimated the
purpoſe of my heart, that I intend to direct them according as the
Lord ſhall pleaſe to help and aſſiſt to ſet up the Kingdome of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt fully, ſo that Chriſt ſhall reigne both in Church and
Common-wealth, both in Civil and Spiritual matters; we will
(through his grace) fly to the Scriptures, for every Law, Rule, Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Form, or what ever we do. And when every thing both Civil &amp;
Spiritual are done by the direction of the word of Chriſt, then doth
Chriſt reigne, and the great Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt which we
weight for, is even this that I do now mention; and by this means
all Kingdomes and Nations ſhall become the Kingdomes of Chriſt,
becauſe he ſhall rule them in all things by his holy word; humane
wiſdome in learned Nations will be loth to yeeld to Chriſt ſo farre,
much leſſe will Princes and Monarches readily yeeld ſo farre to
ſtoop to Chriſt, and therefore the Lord will ſhake all Nations, and
put them into diſtreſſe and perplexity, and in the concluſion they
will be glad to ſtoop to Chriſt. But as for theſe poore Indians
they have no principles of their own, nor yet wiſdome of their
their own (I meane as other Nations have) wherein to ſtick; and
therefore they do moſt readily yeeld to any direction from the
Lord, ſo that there will be no ſuch oppoſition againſt the riſing
Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt among them; yet I foreſee a cloud of
difficulties in the work, and much obſcurity and trouble in ſome
ſuch reſpects, as I think not meet to mention, only by faith I do ſee
through this cloud: I beleeve the faithful promiſes of Chriſt ſhall
be accompliſht among them, and the Lord Jeſus ſhall reigne over
them gloriouſly, <hi>Oh my heart yearneth over diſtreſſed perplexed En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and my continual prayer unto the Lord for them is, that he
would be pleaſed to open their hearts and eyes, and let them ſee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117834:18"/>
their opportunity to let in Chriſt, and to advance his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
over them; yea, my hope is, that he will not leave tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them untill he hath brought it to paſſe; Oh the bleſſed
day in <hi>England</hi> when the Word of God ſhall be their <hi>Magna
Charta</hi> and chief Law Book; and when all Lawyers muſt be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
to ſtudy the Scriptures; and ſhould the Gentile Nations take
up <hi>Moſes</hi> policie ſo farre as it is morall and conſcionable, make the
Scriptures the foundation of all their Lawes, who knoweth what a
door would be opened to the Jewes to come in to Chriſt; I wrote
likewiſe by my laſt to intreat for ſome encouragement to Maſter
<hi>Mahu</hi> who preacheth to the Indians, and that ſome monies may
be laid out in book for him; for young Sholars in <hi>New-England</hi>
are very poor in books, as he is in extreme want.</p>
                  <p>Dear Sir,</p>
                  <p>Be helpful in prayer to our work, and above all gathering, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prayers; I mean, put the Saints in minde that they pray
much about it, as they do both there and here.</p>
                  <p>Truly Sir,</p>
                  <p>The ſpirit of prayer that is daily going about this matter, is a very
great encouragement for all our meetings, through mercie, ring of
it; I would intimate ſome more queſtions which they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
ſince my laſt, for they are fruitful that way, but partly I
fear I ſhall want time, yet my heart ſaies, it may comfort you, and
therefore I will ſet down a few, ſo many as I have noted down ſince

                  <p>I Heard of the health and welfare of your family not long ſince,
though the ſharpneſſe and depth of ſnowes this later part of
winter did more ſhut up and hinder intercourſe then ever I knew
in <hi>New-England</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall principally attend to give you intelligence about the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
touching whom, I know not that you are like to have intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
by others; The Lord hath ſhewed them a very great teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his mercy this winter, in that when formerly the Engliſh
had the Pox much, they alſo had the ſame; but now though it
was ſcattered in all or moſt of the Townes about them, yet the
Lord hath preſerved them from it; And that which maketh this
favour of God the more evident and conſpicuous, is this; That
there is a company of profane Indians that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lately are come to a
place near <hi>Wamouth,</hi> not farre from our Indians, who do not onely
refuſe to pray unto God, but oppoſe and apprehend that they were
ſent thither, if not by the policie of ſome <hi>Pawwaws,</hi> yet by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
of Sathan, on purpoſe to ſeduce the younger ſort from
their profeſſion, and diſcourage others; and indeed they being ſo
neer, had that effect evidently in ſome of the younger ſort. Now
it pleaſed God that this company of wicked Indians, were ſmitten
with the Pox, and ſundry cut off, and thoſe which were cut off,
were of the worſt and miſchievous of them all; which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
all the good Indians do take a great notice of, and doth ſay
that the Lord hath wrought a wonder for them; and it ſeemeth
to me that the Lord hath bleſt this good Providence of his to be a
ſtrong ingagement of their hearts to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The work of the Lord through his grace doth ſtill go on as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
and they are ſtill full of queſtions, and moſtly they now
be, to know the meaning of ſuch Scriptures as I have tranſlated
and read, and in a poor meaſure expounded to them, they long
for to proceed in that work which I have in former Letters menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned;
namely to cohabit in a Towne, to be under the government
of the Lord, and to have a Church and the Ordinances of Chriſt
among them; this Spring the Lord ſeemed to put ſome of them
upon ſuch ſtreights, about a convenient place of planting, as if
his Providence had meant to call us to a preſent ſetting upon the
work, but partly by reaſon of the undetermination about the place
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117834:20"/>
where, but principally for want of means, wherewith it is yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
though I ſee a neceſſity to ſpeed it forward, for they have
been now long in the expectation, and if I ſhould ſtill fail them,
it would both diſcourage them, and embolden their adverſaries to
deſpiſe the work (for all the Country of Indians are in an expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it) yea by this delay that hath been, Sathan hath taken this
advantage to my great grief; That whereas at my firſt preaching
at <hi>Naſhawog</hi> ſundry did imbrace the word, and called upon God,
and <hi>Pau wauing</hi> was wholly ſilenced among them all; yet now,
partly being forty miles of; and principally by the ſlow progreſſe
of this work, Sathan hath ſo embolned the Pawwawes, that this
winter, (as I hear to my grief) there hath been Paw-wauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
with ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why there is ſtill a delay of laying the foundation of
the work is this, becauſe we muſt ſee firſt whether any ſupply is like
to be had from <hi>England</hi> (for our ſins and bad times may diſappoint
our greateſt hopes) and if any, what meaſure, that we may by that be
guided what foundation and beginning to make; their condition
and the neceſſary frame of this work requireth a liberall ſtock to
begin withall, and liberall ſupply to carry it on; And therefore to
begin the work before the Lord hath diſcovered his providing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
this way, by the rule of prudence may not be; nor can I
manifeſt unto the Church that God doth call me to that work, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
I may lay before them, (at leaſt ſome) preſent means to begin
the work, and ſome probable hopes of ſupply; and untill that be
done, the Church hath no rule to give me up to that work; nor I
a rule to require it; only I do (through the Lords help) continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
go on to teach them, as for theſe three yeers and a half I have
done, inſtructing them, and preparing them as well as I can againſt
ſuch time as the Lord, who hath promiſed to guide us by his eye
and voyce, ſhall manifeſtly call us to go forward with that work
which we wait to ſee accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>I forbear to mention any thing about the materials requiſite,
and manner of proceedings, having done that in my former Letters,
by the firſt ſhip eſpecially, and alſo by the ſecond; both which

                  <p>For the work of the Lord among the Indians, I thank his Majeſty
he ſtill ſmileth on it, he favoureth and bleſſeth it; through his help
that ſtrengthneth me, I ceaſe not in my poor meaſure to inſtruct
them; and I do ſee that they profit and grow in knowledge of the
truth, and ſome of them in the love of it, which appeareth by a
ready obedience to it; and to teſtifie their growth in knowledge,
I will not (though I could do it if need were) trouble you with
their queſtions; but I will only relate one ſtory which fell out about
the fifth month of this yeere; Two of my hearers travelled to
<hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> where <hi>Gorton</hi> liveth, and there they ſpent
a Sabbath, and heard them in ſome exerciſes, and had much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with them; for it ſeemeth they perceiving that they had
ſome knowledge in Religion, and were of my hearers; they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to poſſeſſe their minds with their opinions. When they
came home, the next Lecture day, before I began the exerciſe, the
company being not fully come together, one of them asked me
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117834:21"/>
this queſtion; <hi>What is the reaſon, that ſeeing thoſe Engliſh people,
where he had be<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, had the ſame Bible that we have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet do not ſpeake
the ſame things?</hi> I asked the reaſon of his queſtion; he ſaid, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his brother and he had been at</hi> Providence <hi>and at</hi> Warwick, <hi>and
he perceived by ſpeech with them, that they differ from us; he ſaid they
heard their publike exerciſe, but did not underſtand what they meant,</hi>
(though the man underſtandeth the Engliſh Language pretty well)
But afterwards ſaid he, <hi>we had much ſpeech;</hi> I asked him in what
points; and ſo much as his brother and he could call to minde, he
related as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, ſaid he,</hi> they ſaid thus, they teach you that there is a Heaven
and a Hell, but there is no ſuch matter; <hi>I asked him what reaſon
they gave;</hi> he anſwered, that he ſaid there is no other Heaven, then
what is in the hearts of good men; nor no other Hell, then what is in
the hearts of bad men; <hi>Then I asked, and what ſaid you to that;
ſaith he,</hi> I told them, I did not beleeve them, becauſe Heaven is a place
whether good men go after this life is ended; and Hell is a place whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bad men go when they die, and cannot be in the hearts of men;
<hi>I approved of this anſwer. I asked what elſe they ſpake? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</hi>
they ſpake of Baptiſm, <hi>and ſaid,</hi> that they teach you that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
muſt be baptized, but that is a very fooliſh thing; <hi>I asked him what
reaſon they gave? He ſaid,</hi> becauſe infants neither know God nor
Baptiſme, nor what they do, and therefore it is a fooliſh thing to do it;
<hi>I asked him what he ſaid to that? He ſaid,</hi> he could not ſay much,
but he thought it was better to baptize them while they be young, and
then they are bound and engaged; but if you let them alone till they be
grown up, it may be they will flie off, and neither care for God nor for
Baptiſme; <hi>I approved of this anſwer alſo, and asked what elſe they
ſpake of? He ſaid farther,</hi> they spake of Miniſters, <hi>and ſaid,</hi> they
teach you that you muſt have Miniſters, but that is a needleſſe thing.
<hi>I asked what reaſon they gave? He ſaid,</hi> they gave theſe reaſons,
<hi>Firſt,</hi> Miniſters know nothing but what they learn out of Gods book,
and we have Gods book as well as they and can tell wha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> God ſaith. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
Miniſters cannot change mens hearts, God muſt do that, and
therefore there is no need of Miniſters. <hi>I asked him what he ſaid to
that? He ſaid,</hi> that he told them, that we muſt do as God commands
us, and if he commands to have Miniſters, we muſt have them. And
farther <hi>I</hi> told them, <hi>I</hi> thought it was true, that Miniſters cannot change
mens hearts; but when we do as God bids us, and hear Miniſters
preach, then God will change our hearts. <hi>I approved this anſwer alſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117834:21"/>
I asked what elſe they ſpake of? He ſaid,</hi> They teach you that you
muſt have Magiſtrates, but that is needleſſe, nor ought to be. <hi>I asked
what reaſon they gave? He ſaid,</hi> That they gave this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Magiſtrates cannot give life, therefore they may not take away
life; beſides, when a man ſinneth, he doth not ſinne againſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
and therefore why ſhould they puniſh them? but they ſinne
againſt God and therefore we muſt leave them to God to puniſh them.
<hi>I asked him what he ſaid to that, he anſwered,</hi> I ſaid to that as to
the former, we muſt do as God commands us; If God command us
to have Magiſtrates, and commands them to puniſh ſinners, them we
muſt obey. <hi>I approved this alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I asked farther what they ſaid; then both of them conſidered a
while, and ſaid, <hi>they could remember no more,</hi> only they ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> which they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.
And by ſuch time as we had done this conference, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was gathered together, and we went to Prayer, and I did
ſolemnly bleſſe God who had given them ſo much underſtanding
in his truth, and ſome ability to diſcerne between Truth and Error,
and an heart to ſtand for the Truth, and againſt Error; and I
cannot but take it as a Divine Teſtimony of Gods bleſſing upon
my poor labours; I afterwards gave him an anſwer to his firſt
queſtion, <hi>viz. Why they having the ſame Bible with us, yet ſpake
not the ſame things?</hi> And I anſwered him by that Text, 2 <hi>Theſ. 2.
10, 11. Becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they
might be ſaved, for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them strong deluſions
that they ſhould beleeve a lye.</hi> This text I opened unto them; I will
adde no more at preſent to manifeſt their proficiency in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>The preſent work of the Lord that is to be done among them,
is to gather them together from their ſcattered kinde of life; Firſt,
unto Civil Society, then to Eccleſiaſtical, and both by the Divine
direction of the Word of the Lord; they are ſtill earneſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of it; and this Spring that is paſt, they were very importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
deſirous to have been upon that work, and to have planted
corne in the place intended; but I did diſſwade, and was forced to
uſe this reaſon of delay, becauſe I hoped for tools, and meanes
from <hi>England,</hi> whereby to proſecute the work this Summer. But
when ſhips came, and no ſupply, you may eaſily think what a
damping it was; and truly my heart ſmote me, that I had looked
too much at man and meanes, in ſtoping their earneſt affections

with that barre which proved a Blank. I began without any
ſuch reſpect, and I thought that the Lord would have me ſo to go
on, and only look to him for help, whoſe work it is; and when
I had thus looked up to the Lord, I adviſed with our Elders and
ſome other of our Church, whoſe hearts conſented with me; then
I adviſed with divers of the Elders at <hi>Boston</hi> Lecture, and Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
anſwer was, <hi>my heart ſayeth, go on, and look to the Lord onely
for help,</hi> the reſt alſo concuring; So I commended it to our Church,
and we ſought God in a day of faſting and prayer about it, (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with other cauſes) and have been ever ſince a doing, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our abilities; and this I account a favour of God, that that
very night, before we came from our place of meeting, we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of a Ship from <hi>England</hi> whereby I received Letters, and ſome
encouragement in the work from private friends; a mercy which
God had in ſtore, but unknown to ſome, and ſo contrived by the
Lord, that I ſhould receive it as a fruit of prayer.</p>
                  <p>The place alſo is of Gods providing, as a fruit of prayer; for
when I, with ſome that went with me, had rode to a place of ſome
hopefull expectation, when we came to it, it was in no wiſe ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> went behind a Rock, and looked to the Lord, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the matter to him; and while J was travelling in Woods, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
friends were in prayer at home; and ſo it was, that though
one of our company fell ſick in the Woods, ſo that we were forced
home with ſpeed; yet in the way home, the Jndians in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
upon enquiry deſcribing a place to me, and guiding us over
ſome part of it, the Lord did both by his providence then, and by
after more diligent ſearch of the place, diſcover that there it was
his pleaſure we ſhould begin this work. When graſſe was fit to
cut, J ſent ſome Jndians to mow, and others to make ſome hay at the
place, becauſe we muſt oft ride thither in the Autumn when graſſe
is withered and dead, and eſpecially in the Spring before any
graſſe is come, and there is proviſion for our horſes; this work was
performd well, as I found when I went up to them with my man to
order it. We muſt alſo of neceſſity have an houſe to lodge in, meet
in, and lay up our proviſions and clothes, which cannot be in <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams.</hi>
I ſet them therefore to fell and ſquare timber for an houſe,
and when it was ready, I went, and many of them with me, and
on their ſhoulders carried all the timber together, &amp;c. Theſe things
they chearfully do; but this alſo I do, I pay them wages carefully
for all ſuch works I ſet them about, which is a good encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117834:22"/>
to labour. I purpoſe, God willing, to call them together this
Autumne to break and prepare their own ground againſt the
Spring, and for other neceſſary works, which are not afew, in ſuch
an enterprize. There is a great river which divideth between their
planting grounds and dwelling place, through which, though they
eaſily wade in Summer, yet in the Spring its deep, and unfit for
daily paſſing over, eſpecially of women and children; therefore I
thought it neceſſary, that this Autumne we ſhould make a foot
Bridge over, againſt ſuch time in the Spring as they ſhall have dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſe of it; I told them my purpoſe and reaſon of it, wiſhed
them to go with me to do that work, which they chearfully did,
and with their own hands did build a Bridge eighty foot long, and
nine foot high in the midſt, that it might ſtand above the floods;
when we had done, I cald them together, prayed, and gave thanks
to God, and taught them out of a portion of Scripture, and at
parting I told them, I was glad of their readineſſe to labour, when
I adviſed them thereunto; and in as much as it hath been hard
and tedious labour in the water, if any of them deſired wages for
their work, I would give it them; yet being it is for their owne
uſe, if they ſhould do all this labour in love, I ſhould take it well,
and as I may have occaſion, remember it; they anſwered me, they
were farre from deſiring any wages when they do their own work;
but on the other ſide they were thankful to me that I had called
them, and counſelled them in a work ſo needful for them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I replyed, I was very glad to ſee them ſo ingenuous.</p>
                  <p>This buſineſſe of praying to God (for that is their general name
of Religion) hath hitherto found oppoſition only from the <hi>Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wawes</hi>
and profane ſpirits; but now the Lord hath exerciſed us with
another and a greater oppoſition; for the <hi>Sachems</hi> of the Country
are generally ſet againſt us, and counter-work the Lord by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off their men from praying to God as much as they can; And
the reaſon of it is this, They plainly ſee that Religion will make
a great change among them, and cut them off from their former
tyranny; for they uſed to hold their people in an abſolute ſervitude,
inſomuch as what ever they had, and themſelves too were at his
command; his language was, as one ſaid (<hi>omne meum;</hi>) now they
ſee that Religion teaches otherwiſe, and puts a bridle upon ſuch
uſurpations; Beſides their former manner was, that if they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
money, or if they deſired any thing from a man, they would
take occaſion to rage and be in a great anger; which when they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117834:23"/>
did perceive, they would give him all they had to pacifie him; for
elſe their way was to ſuborne ſome villain (of which they have no
lack) to finde ſome opportunity to kill him; <hi>This keeps them in great
awe of their Sachems,</hi> and is one reaſon why none of them deſire
any wealth, only from hand to mouth, becauſe they are but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and they get it not for themſelves; But now if their <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi>
ſo rage, and give ſharp and cruell language, inſtead of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his favour with gifts (as formerly) they will admoniſh him of
his ſinne; tell him that is not the right way to get money; but he
muſt labour, and then he may have money, that is Gods command,
&amp;c. And as for Tribute, ſome they are willing to pay, but not as
formerly. Now theſe are great temptations to the <hi>Sachems,</hi> and
they had need of a good meaſure both of wiſdome and grace to
ſwallow this Pill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it hath ſet them quite off; And I ſuppoſe that
hence it is, that (I having requeſted the Court of Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
for a ge<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eral way to be thought of to inſtruct all the Indians
in all parts, and I told the Indians that I did ſo, which they would
ſoon ſpread; and ſtill in my prayers, I pray for the <hi>Monohegens,
Narraganſets, &amp;c.</hi>) the <hi>Monohegen</hi> Indians were much troubled
leſt the Court of Commiſſioners ſhould take ſome courſe to teach
them to pray to God; and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkus</hi> their <hi>Sachem</hi> went to <hi>Hartford</hi>
this Court (for there they ſate) and expreſſed to Elder <hi>Goodwin</hi> his
feare of ſuch a thing, and manifeſted a great unwillingneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
this one of our Commiſſioners told me at his coming
home.</p>
                  <p>This temptation hath much troubled <hi>Cutſhamoquin</hi> our <hi>Sachem,</hi>
and he was raiſed in his ſpirit to ſuch an height, that at a meeting
after Lecture, he openly conteſted with me againſt our proceeding
to make a Town; and plainly told me that all the <hi>Sachems</hi> in the
Countrey were againſt it, &amp;c. When he did ſo carry himſelf, all
the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndians were filled with fear, their countenances grew pale,
and moſt of them ſlunk away, a few ſtayed, and I was alone, not
any Engliſh man with me; But it pleaſed God (for it was his gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of me, and aſſiſtance) to raiſe up my ſpirit, not to paſſion,
but to a bold reſolution, telling him it was Gods work I was about,
and he was with me, and I feared not him, nor all the <hi>Sachems</hi> in
the Country, and I was reſolved to go on do what they can, and
they nor he ſhould hinder that which I had begun, &amp;c. And it
pleaſed God that his ſpirit ſhrunk and fell before me, which when
thoſe Indians that tarried ſaw, they ſmiled as they durſt, out of his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117834:23"/>
ſight, and have been much ſtrengthned ever ſince; and ſince I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that in ſuch conflicts their manner is, that they account
him that ſhrinks to be conquered, and the other to conquer; which
alas I knew not, nor did I aime at ſuch a matter, but the Lord car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me beyond my thoughts and wont; after this brunt was over,
I took my leave to go home, and <hi>Cutſhamoquin</hi> went a little way
with me, and told me that the reaſon of this trouble was, becauſe
the Indians that pray to God, ſince they have ſo done, do not pay
him tribute as formerly they have done; I anſwered him that
once before when I heard of his complaint that way, I preached
on that text, <hi>Give unto Caeſar what is Caeſars, and unto God what
is Gods;</hi> and alſo on <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. naming him the matter of the texts
(not the places of which he is ignorant) But he ſaid its true, I
taught them well, but they would not in that point do as I
taught them; And further he ſaid, this thing are all the <hi>Sachems</hi>
ſenſible of, and therefore ſet themſelves againſt praying to God;
and then I was troubled, leſt (if they ſhould be ſinfully unjuſt)
they ſhould both hinder and blemiſh the Goſpel and Religion; I
did therefore conſult with the Magiſtrates and Mr.<hi>Cotton</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Elders; Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> text by Gods providence, the next Lecture
gave him occaſion to ſpeak to it, which I fore-knowing adviſed
ſome that underſtood Engliſh beſt, to be there; and partly by what
they heard, and by what I had preached to the like purpoſe, and
told them what Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> ſaid, &amp;c. they were troubled, and fell
to reckon up what they had done in two yeers paſt, a few of them
that lived at one of the places I preached unto; I took down the
particulars in writing, as followeth. At one time they gave him
twenty buſhels of corne, at another time more then ſixe
buſhels; two hunting dayes they killed him fifteen Deeres; they
brake up for him two Acres of Land, they made for him a great
houſe or Wigwam, they made twenty rod of fence for him, with
a Ditch and two Railes about it, they paid a debt for him of 3. li.
10. s. only ſome others were contributors in this money; one of
them gave him a skin of Beaver of two pound, at his returne from
building, beſides many dayes works in planting corne altogether,
and ſome ſeverally; yea they ſaid, they would willingly do more if
they would govern well by juſtice, and as the word of God taught
them; when I heard all this, I wondred, for this cometh to neere
30. li. and was done by a few, and they thought it not much if he
had carried matters better; and yet his complaint was, they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117834:24"/>
But the bottome of it lieth here, he formerly had all or
what he would; now he hath but what they will; and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
alſo to rule better, and he is provoked by other <hi>Sachems,</hi> and
ill counſel, not to ſuffer this, and yet doth not know how to help
it; hence ariſe his tentations, in which I do very much pity him.
Having all this information what they had done, and how cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
his complaint and diſcontent was, I thought it a difficult thing
to eaſe his ſpirit, and yet clear and juſtifie the people, which I was
to endeavour the next day of our meeting after the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
therefore I was willing to get ſome body with me;
And by Gods providence, Elder <hi>Heath</hi> went with me, and
when we came there, we found him very full of diſcontent, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſower looks, &amp;c. but we took no notice of it.</p>
                  <p>I preached that day out of the fourth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Chriſt; and when I came at that temptation, of the Devils
ſhowing Chriſt the kingdomes and glories of the world, thereby
to tempt him from the ſervice of God, to the ſervice of the Devill;
I did apply it wholly to his caſe, ſhewing him the Devill was now
tempting him, as he tempted Chriſt; and Sathan ſheweth him all
the delights and dignities, and gifts and greatneſſe that he was
wont to have in their ſinfull way; Satan alſo tels him he ſhall loſe
them all if he pray to God, but if he will give over praying to
God he ſhall have them all again; then I ſhewed him how Chriſt
rejected that temptation, and exhorted him to reject it alſo, for
either he muſt reject the temptation, or elſe he will reject praying
to God; if he ſhould reject praying to God, God would reject him.</p>
                  <p>After our exerciſe was ended, we had conference of the matter,
and we gave him the beſt counſel we could (as the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to aſſiſt) and when we had done, Elder <hi>Heath</hi> his obſervation
of him was, that there was a great change in him, his ſpirit was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much lightned, and it much appeared both in his countenance
and carriage, and he hath carried all things fairly ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>But the temptation ſtill doth work ſtrongly, in the Countrey
the <hi>Sachems</hi> oppoſing any that deſire to ſubmit themſelves to the
ſervice of the Lord, as appeareth ſundry wayes; ſome that began
to liſten, are gone quite back; I meane <hi>Sachems</hi> and ſome people
that have a mind to it, are kept back; this laſt Lecture day one
came in and ſubmitted himſelf to call on God, and ſaid he had
been kept back this half yeer by oppoſition, but now at laſt the
Lord hath helped and emboldned him to break through all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:117834:24"/>
Thus Sathan ſeeketh to beat off theſe poore creatures from
ſeeking after the Lord by oppoſing the higheſt powers they have
againſt the Lord and this work of his, knowing that the light of
the Goſpel and kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt (if it once get footing)
will ſcatter and diſſipate that darkneſſe whereby his kingdome is
maintained; But I beleeve verily that the Lord will bring great
good out of all theſe oppoſitions, nay I ſee it already, (though I
ſee not all, I beleeve more then I can ſee; you who can know the
thoughts of Gods love to his people, it is yet a ſecret) but this I
ſee, that by this oppoſition the wicked are kept off from us, and
from thruſting themſelves into our ſociety, at leaſt ſundry are, who
elſe might croud in among us and trouble us; beſides it is become
ſome tryall now, to come into our company and call upon God;
for beſides the forſaking of their <hi>Pau-waus,</hi> (which was the firſt
triall) and their old barbarous faſhions and liberty to all ſinne, and
ſome of their friends and kindred, &amp;c. Now this is added, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
the diſpleaſure of their <hi>Sachems,</hi> all which put together, it
cannot but appear there is ſome work of God upon their hearts,
which doth carry them through all theſe ſnares, and adde to this,
that if upon ſome competent time of experience, we ſhall finde
them to grow in knowledge of the principles of Religion, and to
love the wayes of the Lord the better, according as they come to
underſtand them, and to yeeld obedience to them, and ſubmit to
this great change, to bridle luſt by lawes of chaſtity, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
idleneſſe by labour, and deſire to traine up their children
accordingly; I ſay if we ſhall ſee theſe things in ſome meaſure in
them, what ſhould hinder charity from hoping that there is grace
in their hearts, a ſpark kindled by the Word and Spirit of God that
ſhall never be quenched; and were theſe in a fixed cohabitation,
who could gain-ſay their gathering together into a holy Church-Covenant
and election of Officers? and who can forbid that they
ſhould be baptized? And I am perſwaded that there be ſundry
ſuch among them, whom the Lord will vouchſafe ſo far to favour
and ſhine upon, that they ſhall become a Church, and a Spouſe of
Jeſus Chriſt, and among whom the pure and holy Kingdome of
Chriſt ſhall ariſe, and over whom Chriſt ſhall reigne, ruling them
in all things by his holy word.</p>
                  <p>But though this trouble and oppſition is turned (and ſhall be
more) unto a ſpiritual gaine, yet it behoveth us not to be ſecure,
and regardleſſe of our ſafety; for if the Adverſary ſhould diſcerne
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:117834:25"/>
us naked and weak, and ſee an opportunity, who knoweth what
their rage and Sathans malice may ſtirre them up unto to work us
a miſchief? Nay, it is our duty to be vigilant, and fortifie our ſelves
the beſt we can, thereby to put the enemy out of hope to hurt us,
and to prevent them from attempting any evill againſt us, if it be
the will of God; and to that end we purpoſe (if the Lord will) to
make a ſtrong Palizado (wanting means of doing better) and if we
cannot get any Guns, Powder, Shot, Swords, &amp;c. we will make us
Slings, Bowes, and other Engines, the beſt the Lord will pleaſe to
direct us for our ſafety; and when we have uſed the beſt meanes
we can, I hope the Lord will help us to truſt in his great name, to
make that our ſtrong Tower to flie unto.</p>
                  <p>I ſee the Lord delighteth to appear himſelf in the work, and will
have us content our ſelves with little, low, poor things, that all the
power and praiſe may be given to his great name; Our work in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilizing
them will go on the more ſlowly for want of tools; for
though I have bought a few for them, we can do but little, for alas
afew will ſet but afew on work, and they be very dear too; had I
ſtore of hoſes this Autumne either to lend them or ſell them at
moderate prizes, we ſhould prepare (by Gods bleſſing) good ſtore
of ground for corne againſt next yeere; and had I wherewith to
buy corne to carry up to the place, and have it in a readineſſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them, that ſo they might tarry at their work, and not be ſhut off
through neceſſity to go get food, that alſo would be a great furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and had we but means to maintaine a diſcreet diligent man
to work with them, and guide them in work, that alſo would much
further the work; and many ſuch things I could propound as very
requiſite unto the work, but I lay my hand upon my mouth, I will
ſay no more, I have left it with the Lord, who hath hitherto appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and he will appear for his own eternal praiſe in ſhining upon the
day of our ſmal things in his due ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>The bleſſing of God upon this work doth comfortably, hopefuly,
&amp; ſucceſſefuly, appear in the labours of my brother <hi>Mahu</hi> at <hi>Martins
Vineyard,</hi> inſomuch that I hope they alſo will be after awhile ripe for
this work of Civility and Cohabitation, if once they ſee a ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
pattern of it, and I doubt not but they will (as theſe do) ere
long, deſire Church-fellowſhip, and the Ordinances of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
the cloud increaſeth, and the Lord ſeemeth to be coming in
among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are very deſirous to have their children taught,
which is one argument that they truly love the knowledge of God;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:117834:25"/>
as on the contrary, it is a great ground of doubt of the truth of
grace in that mans heart, when he hath not an heart to take care
to traine up his children in the truth and in the practiſe of all
godlineſſe, but this care is in them, and it is pity it ſhould not be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by all meanes; I have intreated a woman living neer where
they dwell, to do that office for their children, and I pay her for it;
but when they go to their plantation, we ſhall be in a ſtreight for
help that way; the Indians ſo well like the parties who performeth
that ſervice, that they intreat them to go with them, which I look
at as a finger of God; they are I hope a godly couple, and might
be a bleſſing to them, had we meanes to encourage them unto ſo
difficult an enterprize, for it is a great matter to go and live among
ſuch a people; but in that caſe alſo, I look up to the Lord, and leave
it with his holy care and wiſdome; and if the Lord move any hearts
to help in this work, I deſire that the care of their ſchooling may be
among the chiefeſt cares.</p>
                  <p>If the Lord pleaſe to proſper our poor beginnings, my purpoſe is,
(ſo for as the Lord ſhal enable me to give attendance unto the work)
to have ſchoole exerciſes for all the men by daily inſtructing of them
to read and write, &amp;c. Yea if the Lord affords us fit inſtruments,
my deſire is, that all the women may be taught to read; I know the
matter will be difficult every way, for Engliſh people can only teach
them to read Engliſh; and for their own Language we have no
book; my deſire therefore is to teach them all to write, and read
written hand, and thereby with pains taking, they may have ſome
of the Scriptures in their own Language; I have one already who
can write, ſo that I can read his writing well, and he (with ſome
paines and teaching) can read mine; I hope the Lord will both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
his underſtanding, and others alſo to do as he doth; and if
once I had ſome of themſelves able to ſpell aright, write and read,
it might further the work exceedingly, and will be the ſpeedieſt
way.</p>

ſtirre; from this they will not depart; from hence they have their
peace, and have ſeen good dayes under the Kingdome of our Lord
Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lord hath now declared one great end he had of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117834:26"/>
many of his people to thoſe ends of the earth; for beſides that the
Lord hath made that Land a place of reſt, and a little ſanctuary to
them in theſe troubleous times,<note place="margin">Ezek. 11. 16.</note> and hath made it a place where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
very many have been brought home to Chriſt, even amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
ſo now apparently in the converſion of many of the Heathens,
who ſing and rejoyce in the wayes of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when I looked on my dear native Country (in the bulke and
maſſe of them) there is one above doth know, that my heart melteth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, deſiring the Lord to give me grace to ſorrow in ſecret for milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them, who were never yet acquainted with what many of theſe
poore Indianns have felt and found of the things of Chriſt, and that
multitudes of ſuch who hold forth a profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion,
yet fall ſhort of them, in regard of their belief and practiſe. Here I
helped my ſelf by comparing the one with the other, and that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
particulars.</p>
               <p>1. Theſe Indians are found (to ſpeak of ſuch whoſe hearts the
Lord hath opened by his Word and Spirit) to prize Ordinances, and
ſuch as bring the Light to them, even that poor Indian, whoſe beſt
clothing is a ſimple skin about him, of whom you read in the firſt
Letter, yet they honour him for his works ſake, and for thoſe gifts,
piety, and modeſty they ſee in him; Here Miniſters of Christ are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiſed,
though many of them are eminent for parts, wiſdome, and
known integrity.</p>
               <p>2. Theſe Indians are plain-hearted, ſeek for Chriſt to enjoy him for
himſelf; they receive the Truth in the love of it, and obey it without
ſhifting or gain-ſaying; Here men have their own ends to tend to in
matter of Religion, take up the forme, and let the power lie, as not
ſerving their turn, have evaſions to get from under the authority of
the truth, and the Majeſty of the Rules of Chriſt; here is rending and
tearing of wits, whilſt we wrangle one another out of the truth, till love
and peace be loſt.</p>
               <p>3. Theſe Indians are induſtrious and purſue the things of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
reſt they cannot, have it they must, what ever it coſt them,
bearing up ſtrongly againſt all oppoſition: We have weak and bed-rid
diſpoſitions, ſunk down into a ſottiſh and ſenſuall way; in many the
kingdome of Hell ſuffers violence, and none can withſtand them, but
thither they will.</p>
               <p>4. Theſe mourn and weep bitterly, and are pained under the ſight
and ſenſe of their ſins, when convinced of them; that ſome of them have
been known to have wet with their teares the places weere they have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:117834:27"/>
ſtood. We here for the moſt part, the Lord knowes, live with dry eyes,
and hard hearts, and ſleight ſpirits.</p>
               <p>5. They are careful and conſtant in duties of worſhip, both in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and family prayer, hearing the Word, obſervation of the Sabbath,
meet often together, and will pray together as occaſion ſerves, converſe
lovingly together, are teachable, patient, and contented. O that there
were ſuch hearts in us! O that their example did not ſhame multitudes
of us who are fearfully guilty of omitting what the very light of
Nature cals for from us! For this my heart is ſad, fearing that if
the Lord do not mightily ſtep in, the next generation will be betrayed
to Ignorance of the <hi>Truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> to Deluſions and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and be rendred odious to all our neighbour Nations; and that
theſe Indians will riſe up in judgment againſt us and our children at
the laſt day. Brethren, the Lord hath no need of us, but if it pleaſe
him, can carry his Goſpel to the other ſide of the world, and make it
there to ſhine forth in its glory, brightneſſe, power and purity, and
leave us in Indian darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>And concerning theſe Indians, who have taſted how gracious the
Lord is, though it cannot be expected but that the Devil ſhould be like
himſelf, by the counter-working of this bleſſed work, both by himſelf
and his inſtruments, ſo as to cauſe many of them to totter, back ſlide,
and fall away from what they have profeſſed; yet I have ground to
conceive and hope, that there is ſuch a candle lighted amongſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
in thoſe parts which ſhall not be put out till Chriſt comes to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the accompliſhment of which he ſhall not ceaſe to pray, who is</p>
