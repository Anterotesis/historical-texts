         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Am extreamly pleas'd with this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of renewing that Acquaintance,
which I had the Honour and Happineſs
to begin with you at the College (where you
laid the Foundation of that fine Gentleman
you ſince have prov'd, and where you gave
ſuch early, and certain Promiſes of your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Merit) and at the ſame time of doing
Juſtice both to the Reſpect, and Honour I
have for you, Sir; and to the Value, and
Eſteem I ever had for the Perſon and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of Mrs. <hi>Behn,</hi> by making you a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that has more than once already met
with a publick and general Applauſe; and
by ſecuring theſe Admirable and Diverting
Hiſtories from being proſtituted to a Perſon
unworthy of the Honour: And were ſhe alive,
<pb facs="tcp:47213:3"/>
ſhe would be infinitely fond of my <hi>Choice;</hi>
in whom ſhe would have found all the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Qualifications, that make up the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a noble Patron, and a generous
Friend, an HEREDITARY HONO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R,
and a PERSONAL VIRT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E; in whom
ſhe wou'd have found an ancient Deſcent dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
with your own particular Honour,
Juſtice, Sweetneſs of Temper, Affability,
Generoſity, and Senſe; in whom ſhe wou'd
have found ſuch a Felicity of Addreſs, as
makes your Diſcourſe at once convince, and
charm; a ſprightly Wit, and ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which are eminent both in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
and Conduct, in the Choice and
Exerciſe of your Virtues: In whom ſhe
wou'd have found Generoſity without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs;
a native Propenſity to do good to
others, without injuring your Poſterity; a
juſt Conſideration of the Object of your Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
before you beſtow a Benefit; and then
the Favour doubl'd by preventing the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſaving the Perſon oblig'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion

found <hi>Prudence</hi> without <hi>Cunning,</hi> the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
Effect of a true Judgment; not the
haſty and mean Reſult of meer Intereſt and
Deſign. In whom therefore ſhe wou'd have
made no doubt of finding the noble Souls and
Principles of <hi>Mecenas, Proculeus, Cotta,
<pb facs="tcp:47213:3"/>
Fabius, Lentulus, Gallus,</hi> or <hi>Meſſala;</hi> a
Soul exalted with a generous Ambition of no
vulgar Praiſe; for to be a Protector, and
Encourager of the Muſes, is an uncommon
Glory; the Prerogative of but a few, <hi>Quos
aequus amavit Jupiter,</hi> and more Ages have
gone to the producing a <hi>Good Patron,</hi> than
a Good Poet.</p>
                  <p>Not but that Poetry in every Age, and
Nation has pleas'd, and found among the

                     <hi>Sophocles</hi> might get the Government of
a Province for writing a good Play: <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus</hi>
the Command of an Army; but that
golden Age of Poetry is gone; and at this
diſtance, looks almoſt like that fabulous one
the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poets deſcrib'd. For now (and
almoſt ever ſince) no Arts are encouraged,
that are not immediately employ'd in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
Ornament, or Pleaſure of the <hi>Body,</hi>
and thoſe that adorn the <hi>Mind</hi> thrown aſide

                  <p>Hence 'tis evident, That whatever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
the reſt of the World have to complain
of the Times, the Poets only have a juſt

                  <p>MY intimate Acquaintance with the
admirable <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> gave me, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
a very great Eſteem for her;
for it both freed me from that Folly
of my Sex, of envying or ſlighting Excellencies
I cou'd not obtain; and inſpir'd me with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Fire to celebrate that Woman, who was an
Honour and Glory to our Sex; and this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
her incomparable Novels, preſented
me with a lucky Occaſion of exerting that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
into Action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47213:7"/>
She was a Gentlewoman, by Birth, of a good
Family in the City of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> her
paternal Name was <hi>Johnſon,</hi> whoſe Relation
to the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> drew him for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Poſt of Lieutenant-General of many
Iſles, beſides the Continent of <hi>Surinam,</hi> from his
quiet Retreat at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to run the hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
Voyage of the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> with him he
took his chief Riches, his Wife and Children;
and in that Number <hi>Afra,</hi> his promiſing Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
our future <hi>Heroine,</hi> and admir'd <hi>Aſtrea;</hi>
who, ev'n in the firſt Bud of Infancy, diſcover'd
ſuch early Hopes of her riper Years, that ſhe
was equally her Parents Joy and Fears; for
they too often miſtruſt the Loſs of a Child,
whoſe Wit and Underſtanding outſtrip its
Years, as too great a Bleſſing to be long enjoy'd.
Whether that Fear proceed from Superſtition,
or Diffidence of our preſent Happineſs, I ſhall
not determine; but muſt purſue my Diſcourſe,
with aſſuring you, none had greater Fears of
that Nature, or greater Cauſe for 'em; for,
beſides the Vivacity and Wit of her Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
at the firſt Uſe almoſt of Reaſon in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
ſhe wou'd write the prettieſt, ſoft-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
Verſes in the World. Thus qualify'd,
ſhe accompany'd her Parents in their long Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to <hi>Surinam,</hi> leaving behind her the Sighs
and Tears of all her Friends, and breaking
Hearts of her Lovers, that ſigh'd to poſſeſs,
what was ſcarce yet arriv'd to a Capacity of
eaſing their Pain, if ſhe had been willing. But
as ſhe was Miſtreſs of uncommon Charms of
Body, as well as Mind, ſhe gave infinite and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Deſires, before ſhe cou'd know the leaſt
her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47213:7"/>
Her Father liv'd not to ſee that Land flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Milk and Honey; that Paradiſe, which
ſhe ſo admirably deſcribes in <hi>Oroonoko;</hi> where
you may alſo find what Adventures happen'd
to her in that Country. The Misfortunes of that
Prince had been unknown to us, if the Divine
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> had not been there, and his Sufferings
had wanted that Satisfaction which her Pen has
given 'em in the Immortality of his Vertues, and
Conſtancy; the very Memory of which, move
a generous Pity in all, and a Contempt of the
brutal Actors in that unfortunate Tragedy-Here
I can add nothing to what ſhe has given
the World already, but a Vindication of her
from ſome unjuſt Aſperſions I find, are inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about this Town in Relation to that Prince.
I knew her intimately well; and I believe ſhe
wou'd not have conceal'd any Love-Affair from
me, being one of her own Sex, whoſe Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Secrecy ſhe had experienc'd; which
makes me aſſure the World, there was no Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
between that Prince and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but what
the whole Plantation were Witneſſes of: A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Value for his uncommon Vertues, which
every one that but hears 'em, finds in himſelf;
and his Preſence gave her no more. Beſide, his
Heart was too violently ſet on the everlaſting
Charms of his <hi>Imoinda,</hi> to be ſhook with thoſe
more faint (in his Eye) of a white Beauty;
and <hi>Aſtrea</hi>'s Relations, there preſent, had too
watchful an Eye over her to permit the Frailty
of her Youth, if that had been powerful enough.
As this is falſe, ſo are the Conſequences of it
too; for the Lord, her Father's Friend, that
was not then arriv'd, periſh'd in a Hurricane,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47213:8"/>
without having it in his Power to reſent it.
Nor had his Reſentments been any thing to her,
who only waited the Arrival of the next Ships,
to convey her back to her deſir'd <hi>England:</hi>
Where ſhe ſoon after, to her Satisfaction, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
and gave King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and rational an Account of his Affairs there,
and particularly of the Misfortunes of <hi>Oroonoko,</hi>
that he deſir'd her to deliver them publickly
to the World; and ſatisfy'd of her Abilities
in the Management of Buſineſs, and the Fidelity
of our <hi>Heroine</hi> to his Intereſt: After ſhe was
marry'd to Mr. <hi>Behn,</hi> a Merchant of this City,
tho' of <hi>Dutch</hi> Extraction, he committed to her
Secrecy, and Conduct, Affairs of the higheſt
Importance in the <hi>Dutch</hi> War; which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
her to ſtay at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> preſented her
with <hi>The Adventures of Prince</hi> Tarquin, <hi>and his
falſe wicked Fair One</hi> Miranda: The full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of which, you will find admirably writ
in the following Volume.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt not omit entirely ſome other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
that happen'd to her during this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation,
tho' I cannot give ſo juſt and large
a Repreſentation of them as I willingly wou'd.</p>
                  <p>I have told you, that as her Mind, ſo her
Body was adorn'd with all the Advantages of
our Sex. Wit, Beauty, and Judgment, ſeldom
meet in one, eſpecially in Woman (you may
allow this from a Woman) but in her they
were eminent; and this made her turn all the
Advantages each gave her to the Intereſt ſhe
had devoted her ſelf to ſerve: And whereas the
Beauty of the Face is that which generally takes
with Mankind, ſo it gives 'em moſt commonly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:8"/>
an Aſſurance, and Security from Deſigns; for
they ſuppoſe that a beautiful Woman, as
ſhe is made for the Pleaſure of others, ſo chiefly
minds her own; and in that they are not
much miſtaken, for they purſue the ſame Courſe
with the reſt of the World, Pleaſure; but then
'tis as various as their Tempers, and what they
generally imagine may have the leaſt ſhare in
many of them. The Event, I'm ſure, ſhew'd
that, in <hi>Aſtrea</hi> (at this time at leaſt) the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Love had not the Predominance, when
ſhe diverted the Hopes, which the Vanity of a
<hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant of great Intereſt and Authority
in <hi>Holland,</hi> had entertain'd of a ſucceſsful
Paſſion, to the Service of her Prince, and his
own ſhameful Diſappointment.</p>
                  <p>They are miſtaken who imagine that a <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
can't love; for tho' they are generally
more phlegmatick, than other Men, yet it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happens, that Love does penetrate their
Lump, and diſpenſe an enlivening Fire, that
deſtroys its graver, and cooler Conſiderations;
at leaſt it once prov'd ſo on this Spark, whom
we muſt call by the Name of <hi>Vander Albert,</hi> of

grounded the Succeſs of her Negotiation. <hi>Albert,</hi>
as ſoon as he knew of her Arrival at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi>
and the publick Poſts he was in wou'd
give him Leave, made a ſhort Voyage to meet
her, with all the Love his Nature was capable
of, (and which by chance was much, and more
refin'd than moſt of his Countrymen, at leaſt
according to our common Notions of 'em,)
and after a Repetition of all his former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
for her Service, preſs'd her extreamly
to let him by ſome ſignal Means, give undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Proofs of the Vehemence and Sincerity of
his Paſſion; for which he wou'd ask no Reward,
till he had by long and faithful Services con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
her that he deſerv'd it.</p>
                  <p>This Propoſal was ſo reaſonable, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ſuitable to her preſent Aim in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of her Country, that ſhe accepted it; and
having the Reward in her own Power, as well
as the Judgment of his Deſerts, ſhe put him to
that uſe, which made her very ſerviceable to
the King. I ſhall only inſtance one piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
which might have ſav'd the Nation
a great deal of Money and Diſgrace, had Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
been given to it. The latter end of the
Year 1666. <hi>Albert</hi> ſent her Word by a ſpecial
Meſſenger that he wou'd be with her at a Day
appointed, which nothing cou'd have oblig'd
him to, but his Engagements to her; but his
Affairs requiring his immediate Return into
<hi>Holland,</hi> he had ſent that Expreſs to get her
to be alone, and in the way thoſe few Minutes

The time comes: <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is punctual to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
and <hi>Albert</hi> informs her, that <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
de Wit,</hi> who with the reſt of that Family,
had an implacable Hatred to the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Houſe of <hi>Orange,</hi> that was ſo
nearly related to it, had with <hi>d' Ruyter</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the States, to ſail up the River of
<hi>Thames,</hi> and deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships in their
Harbours; ſince, by the Propoſal of a Peace,
the King of <hi>England</hi> had ſhewn ſo little of the
Politician, or was ſo rul'd by evil Counſellors,
that he never thought of treating with Sword
in Hand; but to ſave the Expence of fitting
out a Fleet, had expos'd ſo conſiderable a part
of it to the Reſentment of the Enemy. This
Propoſal of <hi>de Wit,</hi> concurring with the Advice
which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Partiſans in <hi>England</hi> had given
'em, was well receiv'd, and you may depend
on it, my Charming <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that it will be put
in Execution (ſaid <hi>Albert</hi>) for I can further aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, that we have that good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with ſome Miniſters about the King, that
being enſur'd from all Oppoſition, we look on
it as a thing of neither Danger nor Difficulty.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Albert</hi> had diſcover'd a Secret of this
Importance, and with all thoſe Marks of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Relation of Truth, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> cou'd not doubt
but he had ſufficient Grounds for what he had
told her, and ſcarce allow'd that little time that
<hi>Albert</hi> ſtaid to the Civilities due for a Service of
that mighty Conſequence; and this Interview
was no ſooner ended, but ſhe got ready her
Diſpatches for <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all the particular Circumſtances ſhe gave,
nor the Conſequence of it, if it ſhould be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:10"/>
cou'd gain Credit enough to her Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
to make any tolerable Preparations
againſt it: And all the Encouragement ſhe met
with, was to be laugh'd at by the Miniſter ſhe
wrote to; and her Letter ſhew'd, by way of
Contempt, to ſome who ought not to have
been let into the Secret, and ſo bandy'd about,
till it came to the Ears of a particular Friend of
hers, who gave her an Account of what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhe was to expect for her Service, ſince
that was ſo little valu'd; and deſir'd her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to lay aſide her politick Negotiation, and
divert her Friends with ſome pleaſant Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> either as to her Lovers, or
thoſe of any other Lady of her Acquaintance;
that in this ſhe wou'd be more ſucceſsful than

gave over all ſollicitous Thought of Buſineſs,
and reſolv'd to comply with her Friends Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
in what ſhe wou'd take ſo much Pleaſure
in the Narration of. But ſoon after ſhe had
the Satisfaction to ſee her incredulous Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents
ſufficiently puniſhed for neglecting
her Advice, and by their Miſmanagement, find
e'ery particular thing come to paſs that ſhe had
forewarn'd 'em of. Nay, and ſome powerful

tho' they are ſharp, touch me not, but
recoil on thoſe that have not made uſe of the
Advantages they might have drawn from thence;
and are doubly to blame. Firſt in ſending a
Perſon, in whoſe Ability, Senſe, and Veracity,
they cou'd not confide; and next, not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
when a Perſon indifferent tells 'em a
probable Story, and which if it come to paſs,
wou'd ſufficiently puniſh their Incredulity; and
which if followed, wou'd have put 'em on their
Guard againſt a vigilant and induſtrious Foe,
who watch'd e'ery Opportunity of returning
the ſeveral Repulſes, and Damages they had
met with of late from them. But I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
your buſie young Stateſmen, ſo very opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionated
of their own Deſigns, that they are

Pride.</p>
                        <p>But I have let theſe <hi>Idle</hi> Reflections (for ſuch

divert me from a more agreeable Relation: To
comply therefore with your Requeſt, in its full
Extent, I ſhall give you an Account of both my

middle-ſiz'd, fine black Eyes, long flowing
dark Hair. Nature has drawn her Eye-brows,
which are dark, much finer than Art uſually
does thoſe of the affected Beauties of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
her Mouth is ſmall, her Lips
plump, ruddy, and freſh, I won't ſay moiſt;
her Hand ſmall; Fingers long and taper, and
her Shape better than is uſual among the <hi>Flemiſh</hi>

much above the common Rate.</p>
                        <p>With all theſe Accompliſhments, you may
imagine that ſhe was not without her Admirers;
among which Number, none came ſo near her
Heart, as the eldeſt Son of <hi>Ramirez,</hi> an old
ſordid Miſer, that loved his Money much above
his Sons, or ev'n himſelf; which made the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
he gave his Two Sons but very ſmall,
and not fit to enable them to make any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Figure in the World. For the real Names
of theſe two Brothers, I muſt give that of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guel</hi>
and <hi>Lopez,</hi> and for the Grace of the Matter,
add Don to 'em.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Miguel,</hi> and Don <hi>Lopez,</hi> I know not
how they came by 'em, had Souls as brave
and generous as that of their Fathers was
wretched and baſe; they with Pain ſaw their
many Advantages of a liberal Education their
Fathers Covetouſneſs robb'd 'em of; and by
their natural Parts, and winning Behaviour,
touched their Relations ſo nearly, that they
long contributed to their Improvement, ev'n
till now the Brothers were become two
of the moſt accompliſh'd and gallant Youths of
the City; their Quality gave them Admittance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:11"/>
to the beſt Families, and their Accompliſhments
to the Hearts of the faireſt Ladies: but few ever
paſs'd farther than the Confines of theirs;
and the lighter touches of an Amoret was all
that made them ſigh, till they ſaw the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<hi>Lucilla,</hi> and her fair Couſin, of whom
not knowing her, I ſhall ſay nothing. Don
<hi>Miguel,</hi> as gay as he was, and as inſenſible as
he fanſied himſelf, no ſooner ſaw <hi>Lucilla,</hi> but
he found the Difference betwixt the Force of
her Eyes, and thoſe of the reſt of the Ladies
of his Acquaintance: And as a Proof of it, he
was not ſooner touch'd with Love, than Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie;
for her Couſin ſitting by her, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
his Brother's Eyes often caſt that way,
and was very uneaſie at it; and that Friendſhip
that grew up with their Years, and increas'd
as they grew, found now a ſudden Check. I
will not, like your Romance-Writers, give
you an Account of all his private Reflections on
this Occaſion, nor the Conflict and Struggling
betwixt his old Gueſt Friendſhip, and this new
Intruder Love. It is enough to tell you, that
aſſoon as Opportunity ſerv'd he took Care to
put himſelf out of Pain, or at leaſt to give
himſelf a Certainty, whether his Brother was
his Rival or not; and was not a little pleas'd,
that <hi>Lucilla</hi> had only found the way to his
Heart, while his Brother ſaw nothing ſo fair
as her Couſin. Don <hi>Miguel</hi> and Don <hi>Lopez,</hi>
as they were in Love, ſo they were too accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
to be unſucceſsful; and there remained
no Obſtacle to their Happineſs, but their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Avarice, which wou'd never be brought
to any Reaſon, in allowing them what was fit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47213:12"/>
for Perſons of their Rank. They coming
therefore to a Conſultation, what Meaſures to
take to cure their Father of ſo ungenerous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
of the Mind; and by that Means, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
what they both longed for more than
Glory.</p>
                        <p>They found their Father's Avarice had not ſo
engroſs'd his Soul, as to beat off all Sentiments
of Religion; on the contrary, he was extreamly
credulous of all the ſuperſtitious parts of religion,
and particularly of all Narrations of Spectres,
Witches, Apparitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to attack him on that ſide that cou'd
make the leaſt Defence. He conſtantly ſpent
part of the Morning in telling his Money, and
counting his Bags: His Sons therefore having
procur'd a Pick-lock to his Cloſet, took Care to
place in it a Figure that was very dreadful, ſo
that the old Gentleman ſhou'd find him count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Bags and Money when he came in;
which happen'd accordingly. He was not a
little frighted, and haſtily retir'd, nor came
thither again in three or four Days, but on his
next coming, he was extreamly ſurpriz'd, to
find the Number of his Bags increas'd, which
for ſome time had been leſſen'd e'ery Morning,
ſo that he concluded it was a Reward of his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence
from a Sight that pleas'd him too much:
Yet was ſo well pleas'd with this Increaſe, that
he repeated his Viſits for three or four Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
together, and found his Bags decreaſe on
that. He was very much troubled in Mind,
and conſulting his Confeſſour on all that had
happen'd, he aſſur'd him it cou'd be none but
the Devil he had ſeen; and that he was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47213:12"/>
to fear the Conſequence of taking Poſſeſſion of
any of the Money ſo left there by that evil
Spirit, and it was much to be doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had not exchang'd the whole. So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
with ſome wholſome Advice againſt
Avarice, he diſmiſs'd his Penitent, who again
for ſome time forbore his Cloſet; and on his
next Viſit, finding all he had ever loſs'd retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and abundance more added, a Fit of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
coming on him, he reſolv'd to try if he
cou'd out-wit the Devil; and by removing it
from that Place, which he ſuppos'd taken Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of by the foul Fiend, ſecure both the
Money and his own Peace of Mind. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
in the Night he digs a hole in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and conveys all the Bags into it, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
them ſafely up. His Sons the next Day,
coming to the Cloſet, and finding all removed,
were not a little diſappointed and troubl'd, to
think how they ſhou'd at leaſt recover that
Money which was lent 'em by their Friends to
carry on this Deſign. All the Difficulty lay in
diſcovering where their Father had hid it, and
to do that nothing occurr'd that wou'd hold
Water, till Don <hi>Lopez</hi> concluded to make once
more the Experiment of his Fear of Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
againſt the next Night; therefore they
prepared the Chamber for their Deſign, and
invited ſome of their Friends, on purpoſe to
make the old Gentleman drunk; which having
effected, he was carefully carried to Bed, and
three or four Statues, out of the Garden, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
up into his Room, and placed on each
ſide and corner of his Bed, with People behind
'em to flaſh and make lightning, to diſcover to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47213:13"/>
him theſe imaginary Spectres. All things being
in this Order, a Maſtiff Dog, with a great Iron
Chain, was let into the Room, the ratling of
which, in a little time, waken'd the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who began to pray very heartily; but
Fear ſtill prevailing, as in Deſpair, made him
think to get out of the Room, when he heard
the Noiſe on the other ſide of the Room, the
moſt diſtant from the Door. On his firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to riſe, the Perſon behind the Image
flaſh'd with his Lightning, and diſcover'd a
white pale Ghoſt to the frighted Miſer: So he
ſtarted back into his Bed again, and thus he
was ſerv'd on each ſide till in Deſpair, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to die with Fear, he cou'd ſcarce utter ſo
much as one Prayer. Then he heard a Voice
with a thouſand Terrours and Threats, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him, he having taken the price of his
Soul in the Money he had removed: The old
Man replied, with a thouſand Croſſes to guard
himſelf, That the Money was in ſuch a place,
and that he wou'd ſurrender not only that, but
his own too, to be at eaſe. When they had
thus got the Knowledge of the place where
the Treaſure was hid, they eaſily, in the Fear
he was in, convey'd away the Statues, and left
all things in Order, as if nothing had happen'd;
and repairing to the Garden, found the Money,
but took no more thence but what they had
before put there.</p>
                        <p>The next Day, the old Gentleman ſends for
them to his Chamber, ill with the Fright, and
lets 'em know, That he had thus long been in
an Errour, in ſetting his Mind on hoarded Bags,
which ought to be plac'd in Heav'n at his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47213:13"/>
Years; but having had various Warnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, he now reſolv'd a new Life, and in
order to that, wou'd immediately ſettle his
Affairs. So he divided his Eſtate equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them; and having found his own Sum
of Money left, as he thought by the Devil, he
gave a third part to charitable uſes, and divided
the other betwixt his Sons, and retir'd to a
Monaſtery, where he ſoon made a very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
End.</p>
                        <p>The Sons having, by theſe means, gain'd
their Point, did not long deferr the Happineſs
for which they undertook this; and thus was
my Friend <hi>Lucilla,</hi> and her Couſin, made the
moſt fortunate of our Sex, if Love and Money
cou'd make 'em ſo.</p>
                        <p>But I have been too long in this to add ſome
pleaſant Adventures of my own, which I muſt
defer till the next Opportunity, having only
room enough left to ſubſcribe my ſelf your

                        <p>THO' our Courtiers will not allow me to
do any great Matters with my Politicks,
I'm ſure you muſt grant, that I have done ſo
with my Eyes, when I ſhall tell you I have
made two <hi>Dutch</hi>-men in Love with me. <hi>Dutch</hi>-men,
do you mind me; that have no Soul for
any thing but Gain; that have no Pleaſure,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47213:14"/>
but Intereſt or the Bottle; but in Affairs of
Love, go to the moſt ſacred part of it more
brutally than the moſt ſordid of their four-footed
Brethren; nay, they are ſo far from
the Warmth of Love, that through their Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Maſs there is not Fire enough to give
'em a vigorous Appetite, ſo far are they from
the fineneſs of a vehement Paſſion. Yet I, Sir,
this very numerical Perſon your Friend, and
humble Servant, have ſet two of 'em into a
Blaze. Two of very different Ages (I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſay Degrees too, but I remember there
are no Degrees in <hi>Holland) Vander Albert,</hi> is
about Thirty Two, of a hail Conſtitution,
ſomething more ſprightly than the reſt of his
Country-men, and tho' infinitely fond of his
Intereſt, and an irreconcilable Enemy to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
has by the Force of Love been oblig'd
to let me into ſome Secrets that might have
done our King, and if not our Court, our
Country no ſmall Service. But I ſhall ſay no
more of this Lover, till I ſee you, for ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Reaſons which you ſhall then likewiſe
know. My other is about twice his Age, nay,
and Bulk too, tho' <hi>Albert</hi> be not the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary
Shape you have ſeen. You muſt know
him by the Name of <hi>Van Bruin,</hi> and was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to me by <hi>Albert</hi> his Kinſman, and oblig'd
by him to furniſh me in his Abſence with what
Money, or other things I ſhou'd pleaſe to
command, or have Occaſion for, as long as he
ſtaid at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where he was like to continue
ſome time, about a Law Suit then depending.
He had not viſited me often, before I began to
be ſenſible of the Influence of my Eyes, on this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47213:14"/>
old piece of worm-eaten Touch-wood: but he
had not the Confidence (and that's much) to
tell me he lov'd me, and Modeſty, you know,
is no common Fault of his Country-men: Tho'
I rather impute it to a Love of himſelf, that he
wou'd not run the Hazard of being turn'd into
ridicule on ſo diſproportion'd a Declaration;
he often inſinuated, that he knew a Man of
Wealth and Subſtance, tho' ſtricken indeed in
Years, and on that Account not ſo agreeable as
a younger Man, that was paſſionately in love
with me: Deſir'd to know whether my Heart
was ſo far engag'd, that his Friend ſhou'd not
entertain any hopes. I reply'd, That I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to hear a Friend of <hi>Albert</hi>'s, making an
Intereſt in me for another, that if Love were a
Paſſion I was any way ſenſible of, it cou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be for an old Man, and much to that
purpoſe. But all this wou'd not do, in a Day or
Two I receiv'd this Eloquent Epiſtle from him;
for he had heard <hi>Albert</hi> praiſe my Wit, and he
thought, that what he writ to one ſo qualify'd,
muſt be in an extraordinary Style, which I ſhall
give you as near as I can, in our Language;
and which I indeed was indebted to an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
my ſelf for, tho' 'twas writ in <hi>French,</hi>
which I have ſome Knowledge of.</p>

the Walls of your Affections, but terrified with
the Strength of your Fortifications, I concluded

attack you at a farther Diſtance, and try firſt

<hi>incognita</hi> of <hi>America:</hi> Oh! thou art
beautiful in every part, as a goodly Ship under

Pennons as ſhe enters the Harbour, and thy
Forehead bold and fair as her Prow; thy Eyes
bright and terrible as her Guns, thy Noſe like

the well-wrought Mortar, whence the Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's
of thy Tongue are ſhot into the Gun-room
of my Heart, and ſhatter it to pieces; thy
Teeth are the grappling Irons that faſten me
to my Ruin, and of which I wou'd get clear
in vain; thy Neck is curious and ſmall, like the

very Top-maſt Head, beneath which thy love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Boſom ſpreads it ſelf like the Main-ſail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Wind; thy Middle's taper as the Bolt-ſprit,
and thy Shape as ſlender and upright as
the Main-maſt; thy Back-parts like the gilded
carv'd Stern, that jets over the Waters, and
thy Belly, with the Perquiſites thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing,
the Hold of the Veſſel, where all the
rich Cargo lies under Hatches; thy Thighs,
Legs, and Feet, the ſteady Keel that is ever
under Water. Oh! that I cou'd once ſee thy
Keel above Water! And is it not pity that ſo
ſpruce a Ship ſhou'd be unman'd, ſhou'd lie in
the Harbour for want of her Complement, for
want of her Crew! Ah, let me be the Pilot to
ſteer her by the <hi>Cape of good Hood,</hi> for the
<hi>Indies</hi> of Love. But Oh! Fair <hi>Engliſh Woman!</hi>
Thou art rather a Fireſhip gilded, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
without, and driven before the Wind to

that, deſtructive, tho', like Brandy, bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Alas! they have grappl'd my Heart, my

O! for Pity's ſake, take ſome Pity, for thy

                        <p>I Have receiv'd your Packet in anſwer to my
Epiſtolary Advice-boat, which did lately
and honeſtly remonſtrate my preſent State.
You give me hopes, that out of your <hi>Imperial</hi>
Bounty, you will have me tugg'd home to the
Harbour of your Good-Will, place me in the
Dock of your Friendſhip, refit me for the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
of your Love, and ſend me out a Cruiſing
for the Service of your Pleaſure: Which
Thought exalts my Heart more than Punch,
and makes me deſpiſe all Dangers of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping
ſpight of the Joint-ſtock of <hi>Vander Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert;</hi>
for the Scars I ſhall receive in your War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
will be more valu'd by me, than thoſe
I've got in my robuſt Youth, in the Heroick
Combats of <hi>Snick</hi> or <hi>Snee;</hi> when with a furious
and triumphant Rage, I have chopp'd off the
Foreflap of my Antagoniſt's Shirt, and laid
him Noſeleſs flat on his Back. You ſeem tho'
to make ſome Bones of two or three Scruples,
about my Perſon and Age. You ſay I'm too
bulky to be your Lover: Let not Errors miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guide

you, Child—<hi>Portlineſs</hi> is comely and
graceful; and ſince Bulk is valu'd in all things
elſe, why not in Man then? You value a great
Houſe more than a little one, an Elephant more
than an Ox; a Firſt Rate Ship more than a
Frigat; a Caſtle more than a Fort, and the
Ocean more than a Fiſh-pond; then why not
<hi>Van Bruin</hi> more than <hi>Vander Albert.</hi> O! but
you ſay I'm too old too—but that's more
than you know you little Wag, you; and
thereby hangs a Tale. I'm not green Wood
indeed, and Sixty or Sixty Five has the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of ſo many Years ſeaſoning; in all
things elſe too we value Age, Old Wine, Old
Seamen, Old Soldiers, and Old Medals, Old
Families, and why not then Old <hi>Van Bruin?</hi>
But then you object my betraying my Friend—but
that ſhews, that you are not ſo witty as
you wou'd be thought—for is any Man ſo
much my Friend, as I am to my ſelf: I, that
never part from my ſelf as long as I live, as I may
from <hi>Vander Albert,</hi> and ſhou'd I not then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a Friend that will certainly always ſtick
to me, to one that may deſert me the next

Friend, to be true to <hi>Vander Albert.</hi> But
what do you talk of Friendſhip, I'd ſooner
deny my Faith for <hi>you,</hi> than for a New Rich
<hi>Japan Traffick.</hi> But Words are ſuperfluous,
when you parley, 'tis a Sign you will hearken
to a Capitulation, and deliver up the Fort if
you like the Terms; and to ſhew you that
what you propos'd has not terrify'd me, I ſend
you <hi>Cart-Blank</hi> to fill up your ſelf—for
adod, adod, you muſt be mine, and you ſhall

                        <p>YOU have made me extreamly proud of my

with the only Cauſe and Effect of your

Nor am I leſs pleas'd, to find you ſo notable a
Logician, for I love Reaſoning with an infinite
Paſſion, eſpecially in a Lover; and it muſt be
allow'd, that you have gain'd your Point in the
Defence of your Bulk, and might for a farther
Vindication have added, That Elephants have
danc'd on the Ropes, which ſhews their Bulk
deſtroy'd not <hi>their</hi> Activity, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence—but

Race we ſhou'd produce; but I'm ſatisfy'd,
that betwixt the Gayety of the Mother, and

cou'd not be leſs than dancing Elephants. You
have indeed, ſurprizingly, vanquiſh'd my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection

uſe you like venerable Medals valuable for their
Antiquity and Ruſt; tho' an old Lover look'd
lately more like an old Gown, than old Gold,
or an old Family, and fitter for my Maid than
my ſelf; or at leaſt ſome decay'd Beauty, that
had not Stock of Charms enough to purchaſe a
young one. But you have convinc'd me of that
Error too. Alas! I fear that deluding Tongue
of your's will quite remove my Objection too of
your Treachery to <hi>Vander Albert.</hi> Since you
go on a National Principle, and ev'n bribe my
Judgment with the Complement of ſacrificing

                        <p>You may imagine, this Letter brought my
<hi>Hogen Mogen</hi> Lover, with no little haſte, to my
Apartment, whither we'll now adjourn; for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47213:19"/>
'twou'd be impertinent to trouble you with any
more of theſe fooliſh Letters, one or two may
divert, as a Minute or two of a Coxcomb's
Company, which on a longer Viſit grows nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous:
But to give you all, 'twou'd make you
pay too dear for ſo trifling a Pleaſure. The
other part of his Courtſhip conſiſting in odd
Grimaces, ridiculous Poſtures, and antick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
cannot be ſo well deſcrib'd to you, as to
give you a true Image of 'em; ſo far at leaſt, as
to render 'em as diverting to you as they were
for a while to me. But imagine to your ſelf,
an old, over-grown, unwieldy <hi>Dutch</hi>-man,
playing awkerdly over all that he ſuppos'd
wou'd make him look more agreeable in my
Eyes. Age he found I did not admire, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endeavour'd to conceal it by Dreſs, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruque,
and clumſey Gayety; Reſpect he was
inform'd I expected from a Lover, which he
wou'd expreſs with ſuch comical Cringes, ſuch
odd ſort of ogling, and fantaſtick Addreſs,
that I cou'd never force a ſerious Face on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſaid, for let the Subject be never ſo
grave, his Perſon and Delivery turn'd it into a
Farce. There was no piece of Gallantry he
obſerv'd, perform'd by the young Gentlemen
of the City, but he attempted in Imitation of
them, ev'n to Poetry; but that indeed in his
own Language, and ſo might be extraordinary
for ought I know.</p>
                        <p>Thus I diverted my ſelf with him in <hi>Albert</hi>'s
Abſence, till he began to aſſume and grow
troubleſome, on my bare Permiſſion of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
for a very little Incouragement ſerves
that Nation, full of their own dear ſelves; ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:20"/>
that to rid my ſelf of him, I found no more
ready way, than to let <hi>Albert</hi> know all his
Treachery to him, and the many conſiderable
Proffers he had made me to win me to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.
But <hi>Albert,</hi> with an unuſual Reſentment
of theſe Affairs, threaten'd his Death, which
was going farther than I deſir'd; for tho' I had
no Kindneſs for either of them, yet I had ſo
much for my ſelf, as not to be the Occaſion of
any Murder, or become the talk of the City on
ſo ridiculous an Occaſion; ſo I pacified <hi>Albert,</hi>
and made him ſee how fooliſh ſuch an Attempt
on an old Man wou'd look, and perſwaded him
only the next Viſit he made me, to upbraid him
with his Treachery, and forbid him the Houſe,
and if need were, to threaten him a little. But
this produced a very ridiculous Scene, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of more Spectators: For my <hi>Neſtorean</hi> Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wou'd not give ground to <hi>Albert,</hi> but was
as high, as he; challeng'd him to <hi>Snick</hi> or <hi>Snee</hi>
for me, and a thouſand things as comical; in
ſhort, nothing but my poſitive Command cou'd
ſatisfie him, and on that, he promis'd no
more to trouble me; ſure, as he thought, of
me, and was Thunder-ſtruck when he heard
me not only forbid him the Houſe, but ridicule
all his Addreſſes to his Rival <hi>Albert;</hi> and with
a Countenance full of Deſpair, went away, not
only from my Lodgings, but the next Day from
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> leaving his Law-ſuit to the Care of
his Friends, unable to ſtay in the Place where
he had met with ſo dreadful a Defeat.</p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee the Proweſs of my Perſon; how
unſucceſsful ſoever my Mind has been in our
Stateſmens Opinions, you will, in a little time,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47213:20"/>

                  <p>But now 'tis time to proceed to her Affairs,
with <hi>Vander Albert,</hi> her other <hi>Dutch</hi> Lover,
which was pleaſant enough, and in which

injuring her Gratitude; for ſhe cou'd not
deny but he had done ſuch Services that did
juſtly challenge a Return for ſo much Love as
produc'd 'em.</p>
                  <p>There was a Woman of ſome Remains of

                     </gap>ickle a Nature, that he never lov'd
paſt Enjoyment, and ſometimes made his
Change, before he had ev'n that pretence, of
which Number her ſelf was, for whom he had
profeſs'd ſo much Love as to marry her, and
yet deſerted her that very Night in the height
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47213:21"/>
of her Expectations: This Woman came now
into <hi>Aſtrea</hi>'s Mind at the ſame time, to gratifie
her Admirer with a Belief of his Happineſs,
and do Juſtice to an injur'd Woman. She gives
her Notice of her Deſign, and orders the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
ſo, that <hi>Albert</hi> met <hi>Catalina,</hi> (for
that was her Name) for <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and poſſeſs'd
her with all the Satisfaction of a longing Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
But <hi>Catalina,</hi> infinitely pleas'd with the
Adventure, appoints the next Night, and the
following; and finding his Tranſports ſtill
freſh and high, began to confide in her own
Charms; and keeping him longer than uſual,
made the Day diſcover a double Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her in her future Pleaſures, and him
in the paſt, for he cou'd not forgive her ev'n
the Joys ſhe had imparted by the falſe Bait of
another's Charms, but flung from her with the
higheſt Reſentment and Indignation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Aſtrea</hi> to upbraid her with her unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Dealing; who, for her Plea, urg'd his
Duty to his Wife, and how unreaſonable it
was in him, to deſire the ſacrificing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the Woman he profeſs'd to love.</p>
                  <p>Tho' <hi>Albert</hi> was forc'd to acquieſce in what
ſhe ſaid, he cou'd not loſe his Deſire, now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
by the Pleaſure of Revenge, which he
promis'd himſelf in the Enjoyment of her, ev'n
againſt her Will, and almoſt without her Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Mrs. <hi>Behn</hi> had an old Woman of near
Threeſcore, which, out of Charity, ſhe kept
as her Companion, having been an old decay'd
Gentlewoman; but ſhe, guilty of the common
Vice of Age, Avarice, ſtill covetous of what
they cannot enjoy, was corrupted by <hi>Albert</hi>'s

Gold, to put him dreſs'd in her Night-cloaths
to Bed in her Place (for ſhe made her her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow)
when <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was out at a Merchant's of
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> paſſing the Ev'ning in Play, and Mirth
as her Age, and Gayety requir'd: The Son of
which Merchant was a brisk, lively, frolick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
young Fellow, and with his two Siſters,
and ſome Servants, waited on <hi>Aſtrea</hi> home;
and as a Concluſion of that Night's Mirth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to go to bed to the old Woman and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
her, whilſt they ſhou'd all come in with
the Candles, and compleat the merry Scene:
As it was agreed, ſo they did, but the young
Spark was more ſurpriz'd when, in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
he found himſelf met with an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Ardour, and a Man's Voice, ſaying,
<hi>Have I now caught thee, thou malicious Charmer;
now I'll not let thee go till thou haſt done me Juſtice

Love.</hi>

was diſcarded to provide for her ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

Voyage to <hi>England,</hi> and Matrimony, dy'd at

where, with Sir <hi>Bernard Gaſcoign,</hi> and others,
ſhe took Shipping for <hi>England;</hi> in which ſhort
Voyage ſhe met with a ſtrange Appearance,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47213:22"/>
that was viſible to all the Paſſengers and Ship's-Crew.
Sir <hi>Bernand Gaſcoign</hi> had brought with
him from <hi>Italy</hi> ſeveral admirable Teleſcopes
and Proſpective-Glaſſes, and looking through
one of them, when the Day was very calm and
clear, eſpy'd a ſtrange Apparition floating on
the Water, which was alſo ſeen by all in their
turns that look'd through it, which made 'em
conclude that they were painted Glaſſes that
were put at the ends on purpoſe to ſurprize
and amuſe thoſe that look'd through 'em; till
after having taken 'em out, rubb'd, and put
'em in again, they found the ſame thing float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toward the Ship and which was now come
ſo near as to be within View without the Glaſs;
I've often heard her aſſert, that the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
ſaw it: The Figure was this: A fourſquare
Floor of various colour'd Marble, from which
aſcended rows of fluted and twiſted Pillars,
emboſs'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and waving Streamers, that receiv'd an

hundred little <hi>Cupids</hi> clamber'd with flutt'ring
Wings. This ſtrange Pageant came almoſt
near enough for one to ſtep out of the Ship into
it before it vaniſh'd; after which, and a ſhort
Calm, followed ſo violent a Storm, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ght of Land, but the People, by the help
of the Inhabitants, and Boats from ſhoar, were
all ſav'd; and our <hi>Aſtrea</hi> arriv'd ſafe, tho'
tir'd, to <hi>London,</hi> from a Voyage that gain'd her
more Reputation than Profit.</p>
                  <p>The Reſt of her Life was entirely dedicated
to Pleaſure and Poetry; the Succeſs in which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47213:22"/>
gain'd her the Acquaintance and Friendſhip of
the moſt ſenſible Men of the Age; and the Love
of not a few of different Characters; for tho' a
Sot have no Portion of Wit of his own, he
yet like Old Age, covets what he cannot enjoy.
I can't allow a Fool to be touch'd with the
Charms of Wit, but the Reputation that is
gain'd by Wit; which being a thing beyond his
Reach, he is fond of it becauſe it pleaſes others,
not himſelf: Our <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had many of theſe, who
profeſs'd not a little Love for her, and whom ſhe
us'd as Fools ſhou'd be us'd, for her Sport, and
the Diverſion of her better Acquaintance. I
went to viſit her one Day, and found with her
a young brisk pert Fop very gayly dreſs'd,
and who after an Abundance of Impertinence,
left us. His Figure was ſo extraordinary, that
I cou'd not but enquire into his Name, and
more particular Character, which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> gave
me in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>This is a young vain Coxcomb, but newly
come from the Univerſity, and full of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
ſelf-Opinion, and Pride of that Place,
takes the common Privilege of being very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
in all Company, eſpecially among
Women, and Men that underſtand not the
Jargon of the Schools. He's of a good Family,
and was left a pretty good paternal Eſtate,
which he endeavour'd to encreaſe by marrying
a rich Aunt he had in the Country, who had
Occaſion for juſt ſuch a Fop; for tho' he has
not been two Years from <hi>Oxford,</hi> he has met
with ſeveral uncommon Adventures, and among
the reſt, his Addreſſes to me ſhall not be the
leaſt conſiderable for all our Diverſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:47213:23"/>
Going down to take Poſſeſſion of his Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Eſtate, and full of no very good Thoughts
of wronging his Brothers, he lay at this Aunts's;
who, tho' none of the youngeſt, was not old
enough yet to have given off all Thoughts of
Love, or to be exempted from the Effects of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment;
for after a long Intrigue with the
Steward of her Eſtate, ſhe was, or imagin'd at
leaſt, that ſhe was with Child; and tho' ſhe
lik'd him well enough for a Gallant, ſhe cou'd
by no means think him fit for a Husband, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe her Pride wou'd not permit her to
think of her Servant for her Maſter, or that ſhe
fear'd to give him a Power over her Conduct,
who had been a Witneſs how weak a Guard of
Virtue ſhe had to ſecure the conjugal Duty, he
might expect from her as her Husband: But
whatever was the Motive, the Arrival of her
Nephew gave her other Thoughts, finding
him a fit Coxcomb for her ends; for you find,
that a little Converſation will let you into his
Character, at leaſt, ſo far as to diſcover
him to be a very ſelf-conceited Fool, and one
on whom by Conſequence, Flattery wou'd have
no ſmall Effect. His Aunt having made this
Diſcovery, took Care to detain him ſome Days
longer than he intended, and by all the cunning
Arts of a deſigning Woman, gave him Cauſe to
believe that his Suit wou'd not be very unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
if he ſhou'd make his Addreſſes to her. He
naturally thought well of himſelf, and fir'd
with ſo many Advances that his Aunt made
to him, he reſolv'd to trie if he cou'd gain

She was a Woman that had yet a Reſt of
Beauty, improv'd too by the help of Art,
that ſhe might pretend, without vanity, to a
conqueſt, where no brighter or more youthful
Faces interpos'd; to this ſhe had an engaging
Air, and a ſprightly Converſation: but that
which compleated the Victory over our young
Spark, was her Eſtate; that was exceeding
beautiful, becauſe very great, and, join'd with
her other Charms, was not to be reſiſted by a
Man who was poſſeſs'd with the contrary Vices
of Avarice and Prodigality. For he had ſtill
a thirſt of Wealth, which he perpetually ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd;
for he was incapable of doing a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Action, though he wou'd do many fooliſh
ones, which ſeem'd to him worthy that Name,
as particularly that which I'm juſt going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
after his Marriage with his Aunt, for there
ended this Amour.</p>
                  <p>Some ſmall time after the conſummation of
the Nuptials, finding her fears of being with
Child vain, and quite tired of the Fool her
Husband, ſhe perpetually was contriving how
to get handſomly rid of him; for though he
ſeem'd to love her well enough for a Wife, yet
he was too watchful of her motions to give her
opportunity of thoſe Pleaſures ſhe had ſo long
taken with liberty. This made her very ill
humour'd and croſs; which he endeavour'd,
by pleaſing her all the ways he cou'd think of,
to remove: But all in vain, unleſs he cou'd
remove himſelf, and his legal Right to her
Eſtate, all his Careſſes and Complaiſance ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
nothing. In ſhort, after ſhe had acted
this part ſome time, and made him very earneſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47213:24"/>
in the enquiry into the cauſe of her Chagrin,
ſhe inform'd him, that ſhe was very ſenſible
the chief motive that engag'd him to make love
to her was her Eſtate, and that all his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Love were only falſe baits to delude her
too credulous Heart, and catch her Eſtate;
that ſhe cou'd never forgive herſelf, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach'd
by ſo unexperienc'd a Youth, or ever
have patience to ſupport the affliction this
gave her.</p>
                  <p>He us'd all the Arguments he could think of
to convince her of her Error, and that he lov'd
her with a ſincere and tender Paſſion, without
any regard to her Eſtate, of which ſhe was as
entirely Miſtreſs as before. In vain was all he
ſaid, ſhe turn'd it to a contrary end to what he
meant it; told him 'twas eaſie profeſſing his
Love ſincere, when he was in poſſeſſion of the
fruits of his paſt Diſſimulation, and that ſhe
cou'd never believe her Fortune had no ſhare
in his Affections, as long as he was Maſter of it
whether ſhe wou'd or not; that ſhe muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
being ſo much older than him, of long
being able ſo much as of a cold Civility, when
it was out of her power to give him any more.
He, out of a fooliſh fanſie of Generoſity, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
good Opinion of his own Charms and
Power over her, tells her he has now thought
of a way to ſatisfie her Doubts, and, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
proof of his Love, remove all thoſe
Anxieties that gave her ſo much Pain, and
robb'd him of his Reſt and Satisfaction; for to
ſhew her that it was her Perſon, and that alone
which he eſteem'd, he would immediately put
her Fortune into her own poſſeſſion again, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47213:24"/>
keep no other Right he had to any thing of
hers but her Perſon, which was the Treaſure he
only coveted a quiet enjoyment of.</p>
                  <p>This was the point ſhe had all this while been
lab'ring to gain, and you may imagine ſhe loſt not
the lucky Minute of the Fools ridiculous Fondneſs.
The Writings were made, and ſhe put in abſolute
poſſeſſion of all her Fortune, and had therefore
no farther need of a longer Diſſimulation; nay,
the curb that had been ſet on her unruly Will
for the ſhort time of their Marriage, provok'd
her to obſerve no meaſures with him, whom
ſhe could not forgive the many Pleaſures he had
diſappointed her of. He was firſt tormented
with freſh Proofs, ev'ry day, of his being a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Cuckold, to which were added the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
of the Servants, and the Contempt of the
Miſtreſs; and when none of theſe wou'd rid her
hands of him whoſe ſight ſhe loath'd, having
taken particular care to have him well beaten,
ſhe thruſt him out of doors, to provide for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
His late treatment made him unwilling
to return, for fear of a worſe reception; and
ſince he had found all means ineffectual to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
her, he concluded to paſs on to his own
Eſtate, and from thence to <hi>London,</hi> out of the
hearing himſelf the perpetual Diſcourſe of the
Countrey.</p>
                  <p>He had not been long in Town, when one
day, walking in the <hi>Park,</hi> in a very mean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
(his own Eſtate being then ſeiz'd by his
Brothers, for the repayment of what he had
wrong'd 'em of,) he ſees his Wife alone, and
though maſqu'd, knows her; his Neceſſities
prompted him at leaſt to try if the making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47213:25"/>
Maſter of her Perſon, and playing the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in his turn, would not furniſh him with a
preſent Supply, if not recover him the Poſſeſſion
of her Eſtate, by cancelling the Deed that put
it in her power to abuſe him. She was very
well dreſs'd, and he ſomething ſhabby; he
ſeizes her, uſes all the Arguments he could to
perſuade her Reformation, and Re-union to a
Man that yet had a value for her; but all in
vain. He told her plainly he would keep her
Perſon, though he had nothing to do with her
Eſtate; 'twas in vain for her to ſtruggle, ſo ſhe
went with him to the <hi>Horſe-Guards,</hi> contriving
all the way how to get rid of him; and being
come there, on ſome occaſion there happen'd to
be a great concourſe of People: This gave her a
lucky hint, and ſtarting from him, ſhe ſought the
Protection of the <hi>Mobb,</hi> aſſuring them he was
a paultry Scoundrel, that would needs pretend
to ſeduce her to his Ends, but on denial, had,
on his threats, prevail'd with her to go quietly
to that place, where ſhe hop'd her Reſcue.
He aſſur'd them he was her Husband, and that
he only meant to reclaim her from her evil
courſes, and carry her home. She, with all
the aſſurance imaginable, laughing at his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
deſir'd 'em to conſider if that Man look'd
like her Husband. Her Dreſs and Mien had
engag'd a Gentleman of the Guards to eſpouſe
her Quarrel, and preventing the Deciſion of
the <hi>Mobb,</hi> declar'd his Opinion in the Lady's
favour, and propos'd the giving him the civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Horſe-pond: which hitting the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
pleaſure of the <hi>Mobb,</hi> prevail'd, and ſo the
poor Knight was carry'd to the Enchanted
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47213:25"/>
Caſtle, and the Lady ſet free, for more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Encounters; for ſhe was not ungrateful to
her Deliverer.</p>
                  <p>This unlucky Adventure was no ſmall check
to his Hopes, and unopinion of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Judgment; yet about half a year
after, being now more gay, by the recovery
of his Eſtate, and walking in the <hi>Park</hi> again,
he meets his treacherous Spouſe, and full of the
Injury he had laſt received from her, and out
of fear of the like Misfortune, his Dreſs being
now anſwerable to her's, he upbraids her with
what was paſt, and aſſures her nothing ſhall
now deliver her from him; and ſo endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to force her out again at the <hi>Horſe-Guards,</hi>
where ſhe enter'd, and near which he met her,
ſhe, by her cunning, and ſeeming ſorrow for
what had paſt, prevail'd with him to go out at
<hi>St. James's;</hi> and being got out of the Gate,
ſhe makes to the firſt Coach very peaceably
with him, where he found three Gentlemen
who waited ready for her, and on her approach
came out, deliver'd her from her Husband,
and without much difficulty carry'd her off.</p>
                  <p>Being thus again out-witted by her, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no help for his deſperate Condition, he
gave over all thought of her, and ſet his mind
on ſome freſh Amour, to wear off the uneaſie
remembrance of his paſt Adventures. Among
the reſt that were doom'd to ſuffer his Addreſſes,
it has been my fate, of late, to ſhare the ill
luck, tho' I have the advantage of a great deal
of good Company to atone for the impertinent
Moments he taxes me with, his Converſation
diverting ſometimes ſome of my beſt Friends, and

that is, of one whom Learning, ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
has fitted for a publick Coxcomb,
and of whom there is ſcarce any one ſo ignorant,
as to have a good Opinion. You have, indeed,
reply'd I, a moſt extraordinary Lover of him,
but whoſe folly is too groſs to be ſo long enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
as he ſhall think fit to be impertinent;
for, like common Beggars, they are not to be

no way of ridding your hands of him but laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at him, 'twill never do; for a Fool follows
you the more for laughing at him, as a Spaniel
does for beating of him.</p>
                  <p>Why truly (reply'd <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) he is grown ſo
troubleſome now, that I ſhall be forced to uſe
him as bad as his Wife has done, in my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
and that I intend to put in execution the
more ſpeedily, ſince I find my <hi>Lyſander</hi> grows
uneaſie at his Addreſſes, which can never move
any thing but laughter; however I ſhall eaſily
ſacrifice ſo trifling a Sport to the Quiet of the
Man I love, in which you muſt aſſiſt me; for
<hi>Lyſander</hi> ſhall have no hand in it, both to ſecure

I promis'd to give her all the Aſſiſtance I

for if one Man affronts another by his
Rudeneſs, the Perſon affronted muſt be look'd
upon as a Coward, if he take not Satisfaction:
I can imagine no reaſon in the world, why a
Woman of Wit, that is affronted with the ſaucy
impertinent Love of a Fool that will not be

                     </gap>olence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to her power: <hi>Wit</hi> is the Weapon ſhe had
to fight with, and that ſhe was to make uſe of
in her Satisfaction; to which, as a Second, I
was very willing to contribute; though the
Part ſhe afterwards engag'd me to play was not
ſo agreeable to me as I at firſt imagin'd; for to
give a conceited Coxcomb any reaſon to believe
he has an Aſcendant over a Woman, and then
allow him the leaſt Opportunity, is to put her
ſelf in a manifeſt hazard of her Honour and
Satisfaction. But this I did not much conſider,
being willing to free my Friend from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of one ſhe cou'd no more ſuffer, than
know how to be handſomly rid of.</p>
                  <p>And upon her Perſuaſion, I took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of his next Viſit, to give him all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
imaginable to make him think me extremely
taken with his Perſon: Which Interview <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
took care to improve on my departure, and to
let him know that I was a Perſon of no leſs For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
than Quality, which wou'd repair the loſs
of an unfaithful Wife. Flattery, as it has ſome
power on the moſt Senſible, ſo it is of ſuch force
with a Fool, that no Conſideration can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it. He ſoon thought the purſuit of me
more eligible, where he imagin'd his Perfections
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47213:27"/>
had made ſuch an impreſſion, that I cou'd no
more reſiſt the Charm, than the barren Paſſion
he had hitherto entertain'd for <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> In ſhort,
ſhe came to a perfect underſtanding, and the
Aſſignation was made, and ſome Friends provided
to be in readineſs to diſappoint him, when he
moſt thought me his own. But the Gentlemen
retir'd to the Balcony, to ſee ſome ſudden
Hubbub in the Street, and my Lover, full of
himſelf, and the opinion of my being wholly
at his devotion, preſs'd ſo hard for the victory,
that when nothing elſe wou'd ſecure me; I was
forc'd to cry out: On which the Gentlemen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd,
and he believing one of 'em my
Husband, was in a moſt dreadful fright, and
ſoon diſcover'd the baſeneſs of his Spirit; for
in hopes to get clear off himſelf, accus'd me to
him he ſuppos'd my Husband. But this not
availing, he was handſomly toſs'd in a Blanket,
waſh'd, and turn'd out of doors. All which
Misfortunes he diſſembl'd to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
his Suit to her; till by appointment, I
and the two Gentlemen enter'd the Room, and
expos'd the truth of the Story: which he cou'd
not deny; and, confounded with the Reproaches
of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and the whole Company's laughing at
him, he never after troubl'd her with a Viſit.</p>
                  <p>This was the end of this ridiculous Amour.
But that which touch'd her Heart, cou'd not be
ſo eaſily diſpos'd of. I have already mention'd
<hi>Lyſander,</hi> as a Lover ſhe valu'd; and he having
contributed her Letters to him, to the laſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
I ſhall ſay no more of it than what thoſe
diſcover, which I have now inſerted in their

ſcorn to guard my Tongue, as hoping 'twill
never offend willingly; yet I can, with much
adoe, hold it, when I have a great mind to ſay
a thouſand things I know will be taken in an
ill ſence. Poſſibly you will wonder what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells
me to write, what moves me to ſend where
I find ſo little Welcome; nay, where I meet
with ſuch Returns, it may be I wonder too.

I follow all my Inclinations neither, nor tell all

I can give no account; 'tis but fooling my ſelf,

                        <p>I ſtay'd after thee to Night, till I had read a

not ſo well receiv'd as it ought, he ſaid you
were not handſome, and call'd <hi>Philly</hi> to own

this, upon my Word, is all.</p>
                        <p>Your Articles I have read over, and do

you did; but you are reſolv'd to give me Proofs
of your No Love: Your Counſel, which was
given you to Night, has wrought the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
which it uſually do's in Hearts like yours.
Tell me no more you love me; for 'twill be hard
to make me think it, tho' it be the only Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
I ask on Earth: But if Love can merit a
Heart, I know who ought to claim yours. My
Soul is ready to burſt with Pride and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and at the ſame time, Love, with all his
Softneſs aſſails me, and will make me write: ſo
that, between one and the other, I can expreſs
neither as I ought. What ſhall I do to make
you know I do not uſe to condeſcend to ſo much
Submiſſion, nor to tell my Heart ſo freely?
Though you think it Uſe, methinks, I find
my Heart ſwell with Diſdain at this Minute, for
my being ready to make Aſſeverations of the
contrary, and to aſſure you I do not, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did love, or talk at the rate I do to you,
ſince I was born: I ſay, I wou'd ſwear this,
but ſomething rouls up my Boſom, and checks
my very Thought as it riſes. You ought, Oh
Faithleſs, and infinitely Adorable <hi>Lycidas!</hi> to
know and gueſs my Tenderneſs; you ought to
ſee it grow, and daily increaſe upon your
Hands: If it be troubleſome, 'tis becauſe I
fancy you leſſen, whilſt I encreaſe, in Paſſion;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47213:33"/>
or rather, that by your ill Judgment of mine,
you never had any in your Soul for me. Oh
unlucky, oh vexatious Thought! Either let me
never ſee that Charming Face, or eaſe my Soul
of ſo tormenting an Agony, as the cruel
Thought of not being belov'd. Why, my
Lovely Dear, ſhould I flatter you? or, why
make more Words of my Tenderneſs, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Woman, that loves as well, wou'd do,
as once you ſaid? No, you ought rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that I ſay more, becauſe I have more than
any Woman can be capable of: My Soul is
form'd of no other Material than Love; and
all that Soul of Love was form'd for my dear,
faithleſs <hi>Lycidas</hi>—Methinks I have a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that ſomething will prevent my going to
Morrow Morning: However, I conjure thee,
if poſſible, to come to Morrow about Seven or
Eight at Night, that I may tell you in what a
deplorable Condition you left me to Night. I
cannot deſcribe it; but I feel it, and wiſh you
the ſame Pain, for going ſo inhumanely: But,
oh! you went to Joys, and left me to Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments!
You went to Love alone, and left me
Love and Rage, Fevers and Calentures, even
Madneſs it ſelf! Indeed, indeed, my Soul! I
know not to what degree I love you; let it
ſuffice I do moſt paſſionately, and can have no
Thoughts of any other Man, whilſt I have
Life. No! Reproach me, Defame me, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon

that Repoſe I had reſolved to purſue, by
taking it unkindly that I did not write? I cannot
diſobey you, becauſe indeed I wou'd not, tho'
'twere better much for both I had been for ever
ſilent: I propheſie ſo, but at the ſame time cannot
help my Fate, and know not what Force or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
there is in the Vertue we both profeſs; but I
am ſure 'tis not good to tempt it: I think I am
ſure, and I think my <hi>Lycidas</hi> juſt; But, oh! to
what purpoſe is all this fooling? You have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
wiſely conſidered it; but I never ſtay'd to
think till 'twas too late; and whatever Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I make in the abſence of my lovely Friend,
one ſingle ſight turns me all Woman, and all
his. Take notice then, my <hi>Lycidas,</hi> I will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
never be wiſe more; never make any
Vows againſt my Inclinations, or the little wing'd
Deity. I do not only ſee 'tis all in vain, but I
really believe they ſerve only to augment my
Paſſion. I own I have neither the Coldneſs of
<hi>Lycidas,</hi> nor the Prudence; I cannot either not
Love, or have a Thouſand Arts of hiding it; I
have no Body to fear, and therefore may have
ſome Body to Love: But if you are deſtin'd to
be he, the Lord have mercy on me; for I am
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47213:34"/>
ſure you'll have none. I expect a Reprimand
for this plain Confeſſion; but I muſt juſtifie it,
and I will, becauſe I cannot help it: I was
born to Ill Luck, and this Loſs of my Heart is,
poſſibly, not the leaſt part on't. Do not let me
ſee you diſapprove it, I may one Day grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd
on't, and reclaim, but never, whilſt
you blow the Flame, tho' perhaps againſt your
Will. I expect now a very wiſe Anſwer; and,
I believe, with abundance of Diſcretion, you
will caution me to avoid this Danger that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens.
Do ſo, if you have a mind to make me
launch farther into the main Sea of Love: Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deal with me as with a right Woman; make
me believe my ſelf infinitely belov'd. I may chance
from the natural Inconſtancy of my Sex, to be
as falſe as you wou'd wiſh, and leave you in quiet:
For as I am ſatisfi'd I love in vain, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
I'm ſatisfi'd that nothing, but the thing that
hates me, cou'd treat me as <hi>Lycidas</hi> do's; and 'tis
only the vanity of being belov'd by me can make
you countenance a ſoftneſs ſo diſpleaſing to you.
How cou'd any thing, but the Man that hates me,
entertain me ſo unkindly? witneſs your excellent
Opinion of me, of loving others; witneſs your
paſſing by the end of the Street where I live, and
ſquandring away your time at any Coffee-Houſe,
rather than allow me what you know in your Soul
is the greateſt Bleſſing of my Life, your dear <hi>dull</hi>
melancholy Company; I call it dull, becauſe you
can never be gay or merry where <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is. How
cou'd this Indifference poſſeſs you, when your
malicious Soul knew I was languiſhing for you? I
dy'd, I fainted, and pin'd for an Hour of what you
laviſh'd out, regardleſs of me, and without ſo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47213:35"/>
much as thinking on me! What can you ſay, that
Judgment may not paſs? that you may not be
condemn'd for the worſt-natur'd, incorrigible
Thing in the World? Yield, and at leaſt ſay, My
honeſt Friend <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I neither do love thee, nor
can, nor ever will; at leaſt let me ſay, you
were generous, and told me plain blunt Truth: I
know it; nay worſe, you impudently (but truly)
told me your Buſineſs wou'd permit you to come
every Night, but your Inclinations wou'd not: At
leaſt this was honeſt, but very unkind and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
civil. Do not you, my Amiable <hi>Lycidas,</hi> know
I wou'd purchaſe your ſight at any Rate; Why
this Neglect then? Why keeping diſtance? <hi>But
as much as to ſay,</hi> Aſtrea, <hi>truly you will make me
love you, you will make me fond of you, you will
pleaſe and delight me with your Converſation, and
I am a Fellow that do not deſire to be pleas'd, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be not ſo civil to me; for I do not deſire civil
Company, nor Company that diverts me.</hi> A pretty
Speech this; and yet if I do obey, deſiſt being
civil, and behave my ſelf very rudely, as I have
done, you ſay, theſe two or three Days—then,
Oh, <hi>Aſtrea!</hi> where is your Profeſſion? where
your Love ſo boaſted? your Good-nature, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
Why truly, my dear <hi>Lycidas,</hi> where it was, and
ever will be, ſo long as you have invincible
Charms, and ſhew your Eyes, and look ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
tho' you may, by your prudent Counſel,
and your wiſe Conduct of Abſence, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Aſſiſtance of any thing but Nature, which ſhews
it ſelf indeed without the Embarraſſments of
Art in e'ry thing ſhe has writ.</p>
                  <p>She was of a generous and open Temper,
ſomething paſſionate, very ſerviceable to her
Friends in all that was in her Power; and cou'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47213:36"/>
ſooner forgive an Injury, than do one. She
had Wit, Honour, Good-humour, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
She was Miſtreſs of all the pleaſing Arts
of Converſation, but us'd 'em not to any but
thoſe who lov'd Plain-dealing. She was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Senſe, and by Conſequence a Lover of
Pleaſure, as indeed all, both Men and Women,
are; but only ſome wou'd be thought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Conditions of Humanity, and place
their chief Pleaſure in a proud, vain Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie:
For my part, I knew her intimately, and
never ſaw ought unbecoming the juſt Modeſty
of our Sex, tho' more gay and free than the
Folly of the preciſe will allow. She was, I'm
ſatisfy'd, a greater Honour to our Sex than all
the canting Tribe of Diſſemblers, that die with
the falſe Reputation of Saints. This I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſay, becauſe I'm unknown, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful
Cenſures of my Sex will not reach me,
ſince they will never be able to draw the Veil,
and diſcover the Speaker of theſe bold Truths.
If I have done my dead Friend any manner of
Juſtice, I am ſatisfy'd, having obtain'd my End:
If not, the Reader muſt remember that there
are few <hi>Aſtrea's</hi> ariſe in our Age; and till ſuch
a one does appear, all our Endeavours in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums
on the laſt, muſt be vain and impotent.</p>

HISTORY
OF THE
Royal Slave.</head>
                  <p>I Do not pretend, in giving you the Hiſtory
of this <hi>Royal Slave,</hi> to entertain my Reader
with the Adventures of a feign'd <hi>Hero,</hi>
whoſe Life and Fortunes Fancy may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
at the Poet's Pleaſure; nor in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Truth, deſign to adorn it with any
Accidents, but ſuch as arriv'd in earneſt to him:
And it ſhall come ſimply into the World, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by its own proper Merits, and natural
Intrigues; there being enough of Reality to
ſupport it, and to render it diverting, without
the addition of Invention.</p>
                  <p>I was my ſelf an Eye-witneſs to a great
part of what you will find here ſet down;
and what I cou'd not be Witneſs of, I receiv'd
from the Mouth of the chief Actor in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
the <hi>Hero</hi> himſelf, who gave us the whole
Tranſactions of his Youth: And though I ſhall
omit, for brevity's ſake, a thouſand little Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47213:37"/>
of his Life, which, however pleaſant to
us, where Hiſtory was ſcarce, and Adventures
very rare; yet might prove tedious and heavy
to my Reader, in a World where he finds Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
for every Minute, new and ſtrange:
But we who were perfectly charm'd with the
Character of this Great Man, were curious to
gather every Circumſtance of his Life.</p>
                  <p>The Scene of the laſt part of his Adventures
lies in a Colony in <hi>America,</hi> called <hi>Surinam,</hi> in
the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
                  </p>

trading with them for their Fiſh, Veniſon, Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filo's
Skins, and little Rarities; as <hi>Marmoſets,</hi>
a ſort of Monkey, as big as a Rat or Weeſel, but
of a marvellous and delicate ſhape, and has
Face and Hands like an Humane Creature:
and <hi>Couſheries,</hi> a little Beaſt in the form and
faſhion of a Lion, as big as a Kitten; but ſo
exactly made in all Parts like that noble Beaſt,
that it is it in <hi>Miniature.</hi> Then for little <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keetoes,</hi>
great <hi>Parrots, Muckaws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
other Birds and Beaſts of wonderful and
ſurpriſing Forms, Shapes and Colours. For
Skins of prodigious Snakes, of which there are
ſome threeſcore Yards in length; as is the Skin
of one that may be ſeen at His Majeſty's <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries:</hi>
where are alſo ſome rare Flies, of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47213:37"/>
amazing Forms and Colours, preſented to 'em
by my ſelf; ſome as big as my Fiſt, ſome leſs;
and all of various Excellencies, ſuch as Art
cannot imitate. Then we trade for Feathers,
which they order into all ſhapes, make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
little ſhort Habits of 'em, and glorious
Wreaths for their Heads, Necks, Arms and
Legs, whoſe Tinctures are unconceivable. I
had a Sett of theſe preſented to me, and I gave
'em to the King's Theatre, and it was the Dreſs
of the <hi>Indian Queen,</hi> infinitely admir'd by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Quality; and were unimitable. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
theſe, a thouſand little Knacks, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
in Nature; and ſome of Art, as their
Baskets, Weapons, Aprons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We dealt with
'em with Beads of all Colours, Knives, Axes,
Pins and Needles; which they us'd only as
Tools to drill Holes with in their Ears, Noſes
and Lips, where they hang a great many little
things; as long Beads, bits of Tin, Braſs or
Silver, beat thin; and any ſhining Trinket.
The Beads they weave into Aprons about a
Quarter of an Ell long, and of the ſame breadth;
working them very prettily in Flowers of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Colours of Beads; which Apron they wear
juſt before 'em, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did the Fig-leaves;
the Men wearing a long ſtripe of Linen,
which they deal with us for. They thread
theſe Beads alſo on long Cotton threads, and
make Girdles to tie their Aprons to, which
come twenty times, or more, about the Waſte,
and then croſs, like a Shoulder-belt, both ways,
and round their Necks, Arms and Legs. This
Adornment, with their long black Hair, and
the Face painted in little Specks or Flowers
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47213:38"/>
here and there, makes 'em a wonderful Figure
to behold. Some of the Beauties which indeed
are finely ſhap'd, as almoſt all are, and who
have pretty Features, are very charming and
novel; for they have all that is called Beauty,
except the Colour, which is a reddiſh Yellow;
or after a new Oiling, which they often uſe
to themſelves, they are of the colour of a new
Brick, but ſmooth, ſoft and ſleek. They are
extreme modeſt and baſhful, very ſhy, and nice
of being touch'd. And though they are all thus
naked, if one lives for ever among 'em, there
is not to be ſeen an indecent Action, or Glance;
and being continually us'd to ſee one another
ſo unadorn'd, ſo like our firſt Parents before
the Fall, it ſeems as if they had no Wiſhes;
there being nothing to heighten Curioſity; but
all you can ſee, you ſee at once, and every
moment ſee; and where there is no Novelty,
there can be no Curioſity. Not but I have
ſeen a handſom young <hi>Indian,</hi> dying for Love
of a very beautiful young <hi>Indian</hi> Maid; but all
his Courtſhip was, to fold his Arms, purſue
her with his Eyes, and Sighs were all his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
While ſhe, as if no ſuch Lover were
preſent, or rather, as if ſhe deſired none ſuch,
carefully guarded her Eyes from beholding him;
and never approach'd him, but ſhe look'd down
with all the bluſhing modeſty I have ſeen in
the moſt ſevere and cautious of our World.
And theſe People repreſented to me an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>Idea</hi> of the firſt State of Innocence, before
Man knew how to ſin: And 'tis moſt evident
and plain, that ſimple Nature is the moſt harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
inoffenſive and vertuous Miſtreſs. 'Tis ſhe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:38"/>
alone, if ſhe were permitted, that better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs
the World, than all the Inventions of
Man: Religion wou'd here but deſtroy that
Tranquillity they poſſeſs by Ignorance; and
Laws wou'd but teach 'em to know Offence,
of which now they have no Notion. They
once made Mourning and Faſting for the Death
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governor, who had given his
Hand to come on ſuch a day to 'em, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
came nor ſent; believing, when once a
Man's Word was paſt, nothing but Death cou'd
or ſhou'd prevent his keeping it: And when
they ſaw he was not dead, they ask'd him
what Name they had for a Man who promis'd
a thing he did not do? The Governor told
them, Such a Man was a <hi>Lyar,</hi> which was a
Word of Infamy to a Gentleman. Then one
of 'em reply'd, <hi>Governor, you are a Lyar, and
guilty of that Infamy.</hi> They have a native
Juſtice, which knows no Fraud; and they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
no Vice, or Cunning, but when they
are taught by the <hi>White</hi> Men. They have Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Wives; which, when they grow old,
they ſerve thoſe that ſucceed 'em, who are
young, but with a Servitude eaſie and reſpected;
and unleſs they take Slaves in War, they have
no other Attendants.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe on that <hi>Continent</hi> where I was, had no
King; but the oldeſt War-Captain was obey'd
with great Reſignation.</p>
                  <p>A War-Captain is a Man who has led them
on to Battle with Conduct and Succeſs; of
whom I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
and of ſome other of their Cuſtom and
Manners, as they fall in my way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:39"/>
With theſe People, as I ſaid, we live in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Tranquillity, and good Underſtanding, as
it behoves us to do; they knowing all the
places where to ſeek the beſt Food of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and the means of getting it; and for very
ſmall and unvaluable Trifles, ſupply us with
what 'tis impoſſible for us to get; for they do
not only in the Wood, and over the <hi>Sevana's,</hi>
in Hunting, ſupply the parts of Hounds, by
ſwiftly ſcouring through thoſe almoſt impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
places, and by the meer Activity of their
Feet, run down the nimbleſt Deer, and other
eatable Beaſts: But in the Water, one wou'd
think they were Gods of the Rivers, or Fellow-Citizens
of the Deep; ſo rare an Art they
have in Swimming, Diving, and almoſt Living
in Water; by which they command the leſs
ſwift Inhabitants of the Floods. And then for
Shooting; what they cannot take, or reach
with their Hands, they do with Arrows; and
have ſo admirable an Aim, that they will ſplit
almoſt an Hair; and at any diſtance that an
Arrow can reach, they will ſhoot down Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and other Fruit, and only touch the Stalk
with the Dart's Point, that they may not hurt
the Fruit. So that they being, on all occaſions,
very uſeful to us, we find it abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to careſs 'em as Friends, and not to treat
'em as Slaves; nor dare we do other, their
Numbers ſo far ſurpaſſing ours in that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe then whom we make uſe of to work
in our Plantations of Sugar, are <hi>Negro's, Black</hi>-Slaves
altogether; which are tranſported thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this manner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47213:39"/>
Thoſe who want Slaves, make a Bargain
with a Maſter, or a Captain of a Ship, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
to pay him ſo much a-piece, a matter of
Twenty Pound a Head for as many as he agrees
for, and to pay for 'em when they ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
on ſuch a Plantation: So that when
there arrives a Ship laden with Slaves, they
who have ſo contracted, go a-board, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their number by Lot; and perhaps in
one Lot that may be for ten, there may happen
to be three or four Men; the reſt Women
and Children: or be there more or leſs of
either Sex, you are oblig'd to be contented with
your Lot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coramantien,</hi> a Countrey of <hi>Blacks</hi> ſo called,
was one of thoſe places in which they found
the moſt advantageous Trading for theſe Slaves,
and thither moſt of our great Traders in that
Merchandiſe traffick'd; for that Nation is
very war-like and brave; and having a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Campaign, being always in Hoſtility with
one neighbouring Prince or other, they had
the fortune to take a great many Captives; for
all they took in Battle were ſold as Slaves; at
leaſt, thoſe common Men who cou'd not ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
themſelves. Of theſe Slaves ſo taken, the
General only has all the Profit; and of theſe
Generals, our Captains and Maſters of Ships buy
all their Freights.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Coramantien</hi> was himſelf a Man
of an Hundred and odd Years old, and had
no Son, though he had many beautiful <hi>Black</hi>-Wives;
for moſt certainly, there are Beauties
that can charm of that Colour. In his younger
years he had had many gallant Men to his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:40"/>
Sons, thirteen of which died in Battle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
when they fell; and he had only left
him for his Succeſſor, one Grand-Child, Son
to one of theſe dead Victors; who, as ſoon as
he could bear a Bow in his Hand, and a Quiver
at his back, was ſent into the Field, to be
train'd up, by one of the oldeſt Generals, to
War; where, from his natural Inclination to
Arms, and the Occaſions given him, with the
good Conduct of the old General, he became,
at the age of Seventeen, one of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Captains, and braveſt Soldiers, that ever
ſaw the Field of <hi>Mars:</hi> So that he was ador'd
as the Wonder of all that World, and the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Soldiers. Beſides, he was adorn'd
with a native Beauty ſo tranſcending all thoſe
of his gloomy Race, that he ſtruck an Awe and
Reverence, even into thoſe that knew not his
Quality; as he did into me, who beheld him
with Surprize and Wonder, when afterwards
he arriv'd in our World.</p>
                  <p>He had ſcarce arriv'd at his Seventeenth
Year, when, fighting by his ſide, the General
was kill'd with an Arrow in his Eye, which the
Prince <hi>Oroonoko</hi> (for ſo was this gallant <hi>Moor</hi>
call'd) very narrowly avoided; nor had he, if
the General, who ſaw the Arrow ſhot, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it aim'd at the Prince, had not bow'd
his Head between, on purpoſe to receive it in
his own Body, rather than it ſhou'd touch that
of the Prince, and ſo ſaved him.</p>
                  <p>'Twas then, afflicted as <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was, that
he was proclaim'd General in the Old Man's
place; and then it was, at the finiſhing of that
War, which had continued for two Years, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47213:40"/>
the Prince came to Court; where he had hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been a Month together, from the time of
his Fifth Year, to that of Seventeen; and 'twas
amazing to imagine where it was he learn'd ſo
much Humanity; or, to give his Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
a juſter Name, where 'twas he got that
real Greatneſs of Soul, thoſe refin'd Notions
of true Honour, that abſolute Generoſity, and
that Softneſs that was capable of the higheſt
Paſſions of Love and Gallantry, whoſe Objects
were almoſt continually fighting Men, or thoſe
mangl'd, or dead; who heard no Sounds, but
thoſe of War and Groans. Some part of it we
may attribute to the care of a <hi>French-man</hi> of
Wit and Learning; who finding it turn to
very good account to be a ſort of Royal Tutor
to this young <hi>Black,</hi> and perceiving him very
ready, apt, and quick of Apprehenſion, took
a great pleaſure to teach him Morals, Language
and Science; and was for it extremely belov'd
and valu'd by him. Another reaſon was; he
lov'd, when he came from War, to ſee all the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen that traded thither; and
did not only learn their Language, but that of
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo, with whom he traded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for Slaves.</p>
                  <p>I have often ſeen and convers'd with this
Great Man, and been a Witneſs to many of
his mighty Actions; and do aſſure my Reader,
the moſt illuſtrious Courts cou'd not have
produc'd a braver Man, both for greatneſs of
Courage and Mind, a Judgment more ſolid,
a Wit more quick, and a Converſation more
ſweet and diverting. He knew almoſt as much
as if he had read much: He had heard of,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:41"/>
and admir'd the <hi>Romans;</hi> he had heard of the
late Civil Wars in <hi>England,</hi> and the deplorable
Death of our great Monarch; and wou'd diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of it with all the Senſe and Abhorrence
of the Injuſtice imaginable. He had an extreme
good and graceful Mien, and all the Civility of
a well-bread Great Man. He had nothing of
Barbarity in his Nature, but in all Points ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd
himſelf as if his Education had been in
ſome <hi>Europaean</hi> Court.</p>
                  <p>This great and juſt Character of <hi>Oroonoko</hi>
gave me an extreme Curioſity to ſee him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when I knew he ſpoke <hi>French</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi>
and that I could talk with him. But
though I had heard ſo much of him, I was as
greatly ſurpriz'd when I ſaw him, as if I had
heard nothing of him; ſo beyond all Report
I found him. He came into the Room, and
addreſs'd himſelf to me, and ſome other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
with the beſt Grace in the World. He
was pretty tall, but of a ſhape the moſt exact
that can be fanſy'd: The moſt famous Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
cou'd not form the figure of a Man more
admirably turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d from Head to Foot. His Face
was not of that brown, ruſty Black which moſt
of that Nation are, but a perfect Ebony, or
poliſh'd Jett. His Eyes were the moſt awful
that cou'd be ſeen, and very piercing, the
White of 'em being like Snow, as were his
Teeth. His Noſe was riſing and <hi>Roman,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>African</hi> and flat. His Mouth, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſhap'd that cou'd be ſeen; far from thoſe
great turn'd Lips, which are ſo natural to the
reſt of the <hi>Negroes.</hi> The whole Proportion and
Air of his Face was ſo noble, and exactly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:41"/>
form'd, that, bating his Colour, there cou'd
be nothing in Nature more beautiful, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and handſome. There was no one Grace
wanting, that bears the Standard of true Beauty.
His Hair came down to his Shoulders, by the
aids of Art; which was, by pulling it out
with a Quill, and keeping it comb'd; of which
he took particular care. Nor did the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his Mind come ſhort of thoſe of his
Perſon; for his Diſcourſe was admirable upon
almoſt any Subject; and who-ever had heard
him ſpeak, wou'd have been convinc'd of their
Errors, that all fine Wit is confin'd to the <hi>White</hi>
men, eſpecially to thoſe of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and
wou'd have confeſs'd, that <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
even of reigning well, and of governing
as wiſely, had as great a Soul, as politick
Maxims, and was as ſenſible of Power, as any
Prince civiliz'd in the moſt refined Schools of
Humanity and Learning, or the moſt illuſtrious
Courts.</p>
                  <p>This Prince, ſuch as I have deſcrib'd him,
whoſe Soul and Body were ſo admirably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd,
was (while yet he was in the Court of
his Grand-father,) as I ſaid, as capable of Love,
as 'twas poſſible for a brave and gallant Man to
be: and in ſaying that, I have nam'd the higheſt
Degree of Love; for ſure, great Souls are moſt
capable of that Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>I have already ſaid, the old General was
kill'd by the ſhot of an Arrow, by the ſide of
this Prince in Battle; and that <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was
made General. This old dead <hi>Hero</hi> had one
only Daughter left of his Race; a Beauty, that
to deſcribe her truly, one need ſay only, ſhe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47213:42"/>
was Female to the noble Male; the beautiful
<hi>Black Venus,</hi> to our young <hi>Mars;</hi> as charming
in her Perſon as he, and of delicate Vertues. I
have ſeen an hundred <hi>White</hi> Men ſighing after
her, and making a thouſand Vows at her Feet,
all vain, and unſucceſsful: And ſhe was, indeed,
too great for any, but a Prince of her own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to adore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko</hi> coming from the Wars, (which
were now ended) after he had made his Court
to his Grand-father, he thought in honour he
ought to make a Viſit to <hi>Imoinda,</hi> the Daughter
of his Foſter-father the dead General; and to
make ſome Excuſes to her, becauſe his Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
was the occaſion of her Father's Death;
and to preſent her with thoſe Slaves that had
been taken in this laſt Battle, as the Trophies
of her Father's Victories. When he came, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by all the young Soldiers of any Merit,
he was infinitely ſurpriz'd at the Beauty of this
fair Queen of Night, whoſe Face and Perſon
was to exceeding all he had ever beheld, that
lovely Modeſty with which ſhe receiv'd him,
that Softneſs in her Look, and Sighs, upon the
melancholy Occaſion of this Honour that was
done by ſo great a Man as <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> and a
Prince of whom ſhe had heard ſuch admirable
things; the Awfulneſs wherewith ſhe receiv'd
him, and the Sweetneſs of her Words and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
while he ſtay'd gain'd a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
over his fierce Heart, and made him
feel, the Victor cou'd be ſubdu'd. So that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made his firſt Complements, and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her an Hundred and fifty Slaves in Fetters,
he told her with his Eyes, that he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47213:42"/>
of her Charms; while <hi>Imoinda,</hi> who
wiſh'd for nothing more than ſo glorious a
Conqueſt, was pleas'd to believe, ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that ſilent Language of new-born Love;
and, from that moment, put on all her addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Beauty.</p>
                  <p>The Prince return'd to Court with quite
another Humour than before; and though he
did not ſpeak much of the fair <hi>Imoinda,</hi> he had
the pleaſure to hear all his Followers ſpeak of
nothing but the Charms of that Maid, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that, even in the preſence of the old King,
they were extolling her, and heightning, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
the Beauties they had found in her: ſo
that nothing elſe was talk'd of, no other ſound
was heard in every corner where there were
Whiſperers, but <hi>Imoinda! Imoinda!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twill be imagin'd <hi>Oroonoko</hi> ſtay'd not long
before he made his ſecond Viſit; nor, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
his Quality, not much longer before he
told her, he ador'd her. I have often heard
him ſay, that he admir'd by what ſtrange In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
he came to talk things ſo ſoft, and ſo
paſſionate, who never knew Love, nor was us'd
to the Converſation of Women; but (to uſe
his own words) he ſaid; Moſt happily, ſome
new, and, till then, unknown Power inſtructed
his Heart and Tongue in the Language of Love,
and at the ſame time, in favour of him, inſpir'd
<hi>Imoinda</hi> with a ſenſe of his Paſſion. She was
touch'd with what he ſaid, and return'd it all
in ſuch Anſwers as went to his very Heart,
with a Pleaſure unknown before. Nor did he
uſe thoſe Obligations ill, that Love had done
him, but turn'd all his happy moments to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47213:43"/>
beſt advantage; and as he knew no Vice, his
Flame aim'd at nothing but Honour, if ſuch a
diſtinction may be made in Love; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in that Country, where Men take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a many as they can maintain; and where
the only Crime and Sin with Woman, is, to turn
her off, to abandon her to Want, Shame and
Miſery: ſuch ill Morals are only practis'd in
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Countries, where they preferr the bare
Name of Religion; and, without Vertue or
Morality, think that ſufficient. But <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was
none of thoſe Profeſſors; but as he had right
Notions of Honour, ſo he made her ſuch Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
as were not only and barely ſuch; but,
contrary to the cuſtom of his Countrey, he
made her Vows, ſhe ſhou'd be the only Woman
he wou'd poſſeſs while he liv'd; that no Age or
Wrinkles ſhou'd encline him to change; for her
Soul wou'd be always fine, and always young;
and he ſhould have an eternal <hi>Idea</hi> in his Mind
of the Charms ſhe now bore; and ſhou'd look
into his Heart for that <hi>Idea,</hi> when he cou'd find
it no longer in her Face.</p>
                  <p>After a thouſand Aſſurances of his laſting
Flame, and her eternal Empire over him, ſhe
condeſcended to receive him for her Husband;
or rather, receiv'd him, as the greateſt Honour
the Gods cou'd do her.</p>
                  <p>There is a certain Ceremony in theſe caſes to
be obſerv'd, which I forgot to ask him how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;
but 'twas concluded on both ſides, that
in obedience to him, the Grand-father was to
be firſt made acquainted with the Deſign: For
they pay a moſt abſolute Reſignation to the
Monarch, eſpecially when he is a Parent alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:47213:43"/>
On the other ſide, the old King, who had
many Wives, and many Concubines, wanted
not Court-Flatterers to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inuate into his Heart
a thouſand tender Thoughts for this young
Beauty; and who repreſented her to his Fancy,
as the moſt charming he had ever poſſeſs'd in
all the long race of his numerous Years. At
this Character, his old Heart, like an extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht
Brand, moſt apt to take Fire, felt new
Sparks of Love, and began to kindle; and now
grown to his ſecond Childhood, long'd with
impatience to behold this gay thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with
whom, alas! he could but innocently play.
But how he ſhou'd be confirm'd ſhe was this
<hi>Wonder,</hi> before he us'd his Power to call her to
Court, (where Maidens never came, unleſs for
the King's private Uſe) he was next to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider;
and while he was ſo doing, he had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
brought him, that <hi>Imoinda</hi> was moſt
certainly Miſtreſs to the Prince <hi>Oroonoko.</hi> This
gave him ſome <hi>Shagrien;</hi> however, it gave him
alſo an opportunity, one day, when the Prince
was a-hunting, to wait on a Man of Quality,
as his Slave and Attendant, who ſhou'd go and
make a Preſent to <hi>Imoinda,</hi> as from the Prince;
he ſhou'd then, unknown, ſee this fair Maid,
and have an opportunity to hear what Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
ſhe wou'd return the Prince for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
and from thence gather the ſtate of her
Heart, and degree of her Inclination. This
was put in execution, and the old Monarch
ſaw, and burnt: He found her all he had
heard, and wou'd not delay his Happineſs, but
found he ſhou'd have ſome Obſtacle to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
her Heart; for ſhe expreſs'd her ſenſe of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47213:44"/>
the Preſent the Prince had ſent her, in terms
ſo ſweet, ſo ſoft and pretty, with an Air of
Love and Joy that cou'd not be diſſembl'd, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that 'twas paſt doubt whether ſhe lov'd
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> entirely. This gave the old King ſome
affliction; but he ſalv'd it with this, that the
Obedience the People pay their King, was not
at all inferior to what they paid their Gods;
and what Love wou'd not oblige <hi>Imoinda</hi> to do,
Duty wou'd compell her to.</p>
                  <p>He was therefore no ſooner got to his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but he ſent the Royal Veil to <hi>Imoinda;</hi>
that is, the Ceremony of Invitation: He ſends
the Lady he has a mind to honour with his
Bed, a Veil, with which ſhe is cover'd, and
ſecur'd for the King's Uſe; and 'tis Death to
diſobey; beſides, held a moſt impious Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not to be imagin'd the Surprize and
Grief that ſeiz'd this lovely Maid at this News
and Sight. However, as Delays in theſe caſes
are dangerous, and Pleading worſe than Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
trembling, and almoſt fainting, ſhe was
oblig'd to ſuffer her ſelf to be cover'd, and led
away.</p>
                  <p>They brought her thus to Court; and the
King, who had caus'd a very rich Bath to be
prepar'd, was led into it, where he ſate under
a Canopy, in State, to receive this long'd-for
Virgin; whom he having commanded ſhou'd
be brought to him, they (after diſ-robing her)
led her to the Bath, and making faſt the Doors,
left her to deſcend. The King, without more
Courtſhip, bad her throw off her Mantle, and
come to his Arms. But <hi>Imoinda,</hi> all in Tears,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47213:44"/>
threw her ſelf on the Marble, on the brink of
the Bath, and beſought him to hear her. She
told him, as ſhe was a Maid, how proud of
the Divine Glory ſhe ſhould have been, of
having it in her power to oblige her King:
but as by the Laws, he cou'd not; and
from his Royal Goodneſs, wou'd not take
from any Man his wedded Wife: ſo ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
ſhe ſhou'd be the Occaſion of making
him commit a great Sin, if ſhe did not reveal
her State and Condition; and tell him, ſhe
was another's, and cou'd not be ſo happy to
be his.</p>
                  <p>The King, enrag'd at this Delay, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily
demanded the Name of the bold Man,
that had marry'd a Woman of her Degree,
without his Conſent. <hi>Imoinda,</hi> ſeeing his Eyes
fierce, and his Hands tremble, (whether with
Age or Anger, I know not, but ſhe fanſy'd the
laſt,) almoſt repented ſhe had ſaid ſo much,
for now ſhe fear'd the ſtorm wou'd fall on the
Prince; ſhe therefore ſaid a thouſand things
to appeaſe the raging of his Flame, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
him to hear who it was with calmneſs;
but before ſhe ſpoke, he imagin'd who ſhe
meant, but wou'd not ſeem to do ſo, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her to lay aſide her Mantle, and ſuffer
her ſelf to receive his Careſſes, or, by his Gods
he ſwore, that happy Man whom ſhe was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to name ſhou'd die, though it were even
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> himſelf: <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>deny this
Marriage, and ſwear thy ſelf a Maid. That</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Imoinda) by all our Powers I do; for I am
not yet known to my Husband. 'Tis enough</hi> (ſaid
the King;) <hi>'tis enough both to ſatisfie my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47213:45"/>
and my Heart.</hi> And riſing from his
Seat, he went and led her into the Bath; it
being in vain for her to reſiſt.</p>
                  <p>In this time, the Prince, who was return'd
from Hunting, went to viſit his <hi>Imoinda,</hi> but
found her gone; and not only ſo, but heard
ſhe had receiv'd the Royal Veil. This rais'd
him to a ſtorm; and in his madneſs, they had
much ado to ſave him from laying violent
Hands on himſelf. Force firſt prevail'd, and
then Reaſon: They urg'd all to him, that
might oppoſe his Rage; but nothing weigh'd
ſo greatly with him as the King's Old Age un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of injuring him with <hi>Imoinda.</hi> He
wou'd give way to that Hope, becauſe it pleas'd
him moſt, and flatter'd beſt his Heart. Yet this
ſerv'd not altogether to make him ceaſe his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Paſſions, which ſometimes rag'd within
him, and ſometimes ſoftned into Showers.
'Twas not enough to appeaſe him, to tell him,
his Grand-father was old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cou'd not that
way injure him, while he retain'd that awful
Duty which the Young Men are us'd there to
pay to their grave Relations. He cou'd not be
convinc'd he had no cauſe to ſigh and mourn
for the loſs of a Miſtreſs, he cou'd not with
all his ſtrength and courage retrieve. And
he wou'd often cry, <hi>Oh, my Friends! were ſhe
in wall'd Cities, or confin'd from me in Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the greateſt ſtrength; did Inchantments or
Monſters detain her from me; I wou'd venture
through any Hazard to free her: But here, in the
Arms of a feeble Old Man, my Youth, my violent
Love, my Trade in Arms, and all my vaſt Deſire
of Glory, avail me nothing:</hi> Imoinda <hi>is as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47213:45"/>
loſt to me, as if ſhe were ſnatcht by the
cold Arms of Death: Oh! ſhe is never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triev'd.
If I wou'd wait tedious Years, till Fate
ſhou'd bow the old King to his Grave; even that
wou'd not leave me</hi> Imoinda <hi>free; but ſtill that
Cuſtom that makes it ſo vile a Crime for a Son to
marry his Father's Wives or Miſtreſſes, wou'd hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Happineſs; unleſs I wou'd either ignobly ſet
an ill Preſident to my Succeſſors, or abandon my
Countrey, and fly with her to ſome unknown World
who never heard our Story.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it was objected to him, That his caſe was
not the ſame; for <hi>Imoinda</hi> being his lawful
Wife by ſolemn Contract, 'twas he was the
injur'd Man, and might, if he ſo pleas'd, take
<hi>Imoinda</hi> back, the breach of the Law being on
his Grand-Father's ſide; and that if he cou'd
circumvent him, and redeem her from the <hi>Otan,</hi>
which is the Palace of the King's Women, a
ſort of <hi>Seraglio,</hi> it was both juſt and lawful for
him ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>This Reaſoning had ſome force upon him,
and he ſhou'd have been entirely comforted,
but for the thought that ſhe was poſſeſs'd by
his Grand-father. However, he lov'd ſo well,
that he was reſolv'd to believe what moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
his Hope; and to endeavour to learn
from <hi>Imoinda's</hi> own Mouth, what only ſhe
cou'd ſatisfie him in; whether ſhe was robb'd
of that Bleſſing which was only due to his
Faith and Love. But as it was very hard to
get a ſight of the Women, (for no Men ever
enter'd into the <hi>Otan,</hi> but when the King went
to entertain himſelf with ſome one of his Wives
or Miſtreſſes; and 'twas Death, at any other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47213:46"/>
time for any other to go in;) ſo he knew not
how to contrive to get a ſight of her.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Oroonoko</hi> felt all the Agonies of Love,
and ſuffer'd under a Torment the moſt painful
in the world, the old King was not exempted
from his ſhare of Affliction. He was troubled,
for having been forc'd, by an irreſiſtible Paſſion,
to rob his Son of a Treaſure, he knew, cou'd
not but be extremely dear to him, ſince ſhe
was the moſt beautiful that ever had been ſeen;
and had beſides, all the Sweetneſs and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of Youth and Modeſty, with a Charm
of Wit ſurpaſſing all. He found that, however,
ſhe was forc'd to expoſe her lovely Perſon to
his wither'd Arms, ſhe cou'd only ſigh and
weep there, and think of <hi>Oroonoko;</hi> and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
cou'd not for bear ſpeaking of him, though
her Life were, by Cuſtom, forfeited by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Paſſion. But ſhe ſpoke not of a Lover
only, but of a Prince dear to him, to whom
ſhe ſpoke; and of the Praiſes of a Man, who,
till now, fill'd the old Man's Soul with Joy at
every recital of his Bravery, or even his Name.
And 'twas this Dotage on our young Hero, that
gave <hi>Imoinda</hi> a thouſand Privileges to ſpeak of
him, without offending; and this Condeſcention
in the old King, that made her take the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of ſpeaking of him ſo very often.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, he many times enquir'd how the
Prince bore himſelf: And thoſe of whom he
ask'd, being entirely Slaves to the Merits and
Vertues of the Prince, ſtill anſwer'd what they
thought conduc'd beſt to his Service; which was,
to make the old King fanſie that the Prince had
no more Intereſt in <hi>Imoinda,</hi> and had reſign'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47213:46"/>
her willingly to the Pleaſure of the King;
that he diverted himſelf with his Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,
his Fortifications, his Officers, and his
Hunting.</p>
                  <p>This pleas'd the old Lover, who fail'd not to
report theſe things again to <hi>Imoinda,</hi> that ſhe
might, by the Example of her young Lover,
withdraw her Heart, and reſt better contented
in his Arms. But however, ſhe was forc'd to
receive this unwelcome News, in all appearance,
with Unconcern and Content; her Heart was
burſting within, and ſhe was only happy when
ſhe cou'd get alone, to vent her Griefs and Moans
with Sighs and Tears.</p>
                  <p>What Reports of the Prince's Conduct were
made to the King, he thought good to juſtifie
as far as poſſibly he cou'd by his Actions; and
when he appear'd in the Preſence of the King,
he ſhew'd a Face not at all betraying his Heart:
ſo that in a little time, the old Man, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
convinc'd that he was no longer a Lover
of <hi>Imoindae,</hi> he carry'd him with him, in his
Train, to the <hi>Otan,</hi> often to banquet with his
Miſtreſs. But as ſoon as he enter'd, one day,
into the Apartment of <hi>Imoinda,</hi> with the King,
at the firſt Glance from her Eyes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all his determined Reſolution, he was
ready to ſink in the place where he ſtood; and
had certainly done ſo, but for the ſupport of
<hi>Aboan,</hi> a young Man who was next to him;
which, with his Change of Countenance, had
betray'd him, had the King chanc'd to look
that way. And I have obſerv'd, 'tis a very
great error in thoſe who laugh when one
ſays, <hi>A</hi> Negro <hi>can change Colour:</hi> for I have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47213:47"/>
ſeen 'em as frequently bluſh, and look pale,
and that as viſibly as ever I ſaw in the moſt
beautiful <hi>White.</hi> And 'tis certain, that both theſe
Changes were evident, this day, in both theſe
Lovers. And <hi>Imoinda,</hi> who ſaw with ſome
Joy the Change in the Prince's Face, and found
it in her own, ſtrove to divert the King from
beholding either, by a forc'd Careſs, with which
ſhe met him; which was a new Wound in the
Heart of the poor dying Prince. But as ſoon
as the King was buſy'd in looking on ſome fine
thing of <hi>Imoinda</hi>'s making, ſhe had time to tell
the Prince, with her angry but Love-darting
Eyes, that ſhe reſented his Coldneſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan'd
her own miſerable Captivity. Nor
were his Eyes ſilent, but anſwer'd hers again,
as much as Eyes cou'd do, inſtructed by the
moſt tender and moſt paſſionate Heart that
ever lov'd: And they ſpoke ſo well, and ſo
effectually, as <hi>Imoinda</hi> no longer doubted but
ſhe was the only Delight and Darling of that
Soul ſhe found pleading in 'em its Right of
Love, which none was more willing to reſign
than ſhe. And 'twas this powerful Language
alone that in an inſtant convey'd all the
Thoughts of their Souls to each other; that
they both found there wanted but Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to make them both entirely happy. But
when he ſaw another Door open'd by <hi>Onah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l</hi>
(a former old Wife of the Kings, who now had
Charge of <hi>Imoinda,</hi>) and ſaw the Proſpect of
a Bed of State made ready, with Sweets and
Flowers for the Dalliance of the King, who
immediately led the trembling Victim from his
ſight, into that prepar'd Repoſe; what Rage!
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47213:47"/>
what wild Frenzies ſeiz'd his Heart! which
forcing to keep within bounds, and to ſuffer
without noiſe, it became the more inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and rent his Soul with ten thouſand pains.
He was forc'd to retire, to vent his Groans,
where he fell down on a Carpet, and lay ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
a long time, and only breathing now and
then,—Oh, <hi>Imoinda!</hi> When <hi>Onahal</hi> had finiſht
her neceſſary Affair within, ſhutting the Door,
ſhe came forth, to wait till the King call'd; and
hearing ſome one ſighing in the other Room,
ſhe paſt on, and found the Prince in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Condition, which ſhe thought needed
her Aid. She gave him Cordials, but all in
vain; till finding the nature of his Diſeaſe, by
his Sighs, and naming <hi>Imoinda;</hi> ſhe told him,
he had not ſo much cauſe as he imagin'd to afflict
himſelf; for if he knew the King ſo well as
ſhe did, he wou'd not loſe a moment in Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,
and that ſhe was confident that <hi>Imoinda</hi>
bore, at this minute, part in his Affliction.
<hi>Aboan</hi> was of the ſame opinion; and both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
perſuaded him to re-aſſume his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
and all ſitting down on the Carpet, the
Prince ſaid ſo many obliging things to <hi>Onahal,</hi>
that he half-perſuaded her to be of his Party.
And ſhe promis'd him, ſhe wou'd thus far com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with his juſt Deſires, that ſhe wou'd let
<hi>Imoinda</hi> know how faithful he was, what he
ſuffer'd, and what he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>This Diſcourſe laſted till the King call'd;
which gave <hi>Oroonoko</hi> a certain Satisfaction; and
with the Hope <hi>Onahal</hi> had made him conceive,
he aſſum'd a Look as gay as 'twas poſſible a
Man in his circumſtances cou'd do; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47213:48"/>
after, he was call'd in with the reſt who
waited without. The King commanded Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
to be brought, and ſeveral of his young
Wives and Miſtreſſes came all together by his
Command, to dance before him: where <hi>Imoinda</hi>
perform'd her part with an Air and Grace ſo
paſſing all the reſt, as her Beauty was above
'em; and receiv'd the Preſent ordain'd as a
Prize. The Prince was every moment more
charm'd with the new Beauties and Graces he
beheld in this <hi>Fair One:</hi> And while he gaz'd,
and ſhe danc'd, <hi>Onahal</hi> was retir'd to a Window
with <hi>Aboan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Onahal,</hi> as I ſaid, was one of the Caſt-Miſtreſſes
of the old King; and 'twas theſe
(now paſt their Beauty) that were made Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
or Governantee's to the new and the
young ones; and whoſe Buſineſs it was, to
teach them all thoſe wanton Arts of Love, with
which they prevail'd and charm'd heretofore
in their Turn; and who now treated the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
happy Ones with all the Severity, as
to Liberty and Freedom, that was poſſible, in
revenge of their Honours they rob them of;
envying them thoſe Satisfactions, thoſe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries
and Preſents, that were once made
to themſelves, while Youth and Beauty laſted,
and which they now ſaw paſs, as it were, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
by, and paid only to the Bloomings. And
certainly, nothing is more afflicting to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd
Beauty, than to behold in it ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
Charms, that were once ador'd; and
to find thoſe Careſſes paid to new Beauties, to
which once ſhe laid a claim; to hear 'em
whiſper, as ſhe paſſes by, <hi>That once was a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47213:48"/>
Woman.</hi> Theſe abandon'd Ladies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endeavour to revenge all the Deſpights,
and Decays of Time, on theſe flouriſhing
happy Ones. And 'twas this Severity, that
gave <hi>Oroonoko</hi> a thouſand fears he ſhould never
prevail with <hi>Onahal</hi> to ſee <hi>Imoinda.</hi> But, as
I ſaid, ſhe was now retir'd to a Window with
<hi>Aboan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Young Man was not only one of the
beſt Quality, but a Man extremely well made,
and beautiful; and coming often to attend the
King to the <hi>Otan,</hi> he had ſubdu'd the Heart
of the antiquated <hi>Onahal,</hi> which had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
how pleaſant it was to be in Love: And
though ſhe had ſome Decays in her Face, ſhe
had none in her Sence and Wit; ſhe was there
agreeable ſtill, even to <hi>Aboan</hi>'s Youth: ſo that
he took pleaſure in entertaining her with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of Love. He knew alſo, that to make
his Court to theſe She-Favourites, was the
way to be great; theſe being the Perſons that
do all Affairs and Buſineſs at Court. He had
alſo obſerv'd that ſhe had given him Glances
more tender and inviting than ſhe had done
to others of his Quality. And now, when he
ſaw that her Favour cou'd ſo abſolutely oblige
the Prince, he fail'd not to ſigh in her Ear, and
to look with Eyes all ſoft upon her, and give
her Hope that ſhe had made ſome Impreſſions
on his Heart. He found her pleas'd at this,
and making a thouſand advances to him: but
the Ceremony ending, and the King departing,
broke up the Company for that Day, and his
Converſation.</p>

                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:47213:49"/>
                     <hi>Aboan</hi> fail'd not that night to tell the Prince
of his Succeſs, and how advantageous the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>Onahal</hi> might be to his Amour with
<hi>Imoinda.</hi> The Prince was over-joy'd with this
good News, and beſought him, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
to careſs her ſo, as to engage her entirely;
which he cou'd not fail to do, if he comply'd
with her Deſires: <hi>For then</hi> (ſaid the Prince)
<hi>her Life lying at your Mercy, ſhe muſt grant you
the Requeſt you make in my behalf. Aboan</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
him, and aſſur'd him he would make love
ſo effectually, that he would defie the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Miſtreſs of the Art, to find out whether he
diſſembl'd it, or had it really. And 'twas with
impatience they waited the next Opportunity of
going to the <hi>Otan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Wars came on; the Time of taking the
Field approach'd, and 'twas impoſſible for the
Prince to delay his going at the Head of his
Army, to encounter the Enemy: ſo that every
Day ſeem'd a tedious Year, till he ſaw his <hi>Imoinda;</hi>
for he believ'd he cou'd not live, if he were forc'd
away without being ſo happy. 'Twas with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
therefore that he expected the next Viſit
the King wou'd make; and, according to his
wiſh, it was not long.</p>
                  <p>The Parley of the Eyes of theſe two Lovers
had not paſs'd ſo ſecretly, but an old jealous
Lover could ſpy it; or rather, he wanted not
Flatterers, who told him, they obſerv'd it:
ſo that the Prince was haſten'd to the Camp,
and this was the laſt Viſit he found he ſhou'd
make to the <hi>Otan;</hi> he therefore urg'd <hi>Aboan</hi>
to make the beſt of this laſt Effort, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
himſelf ſo to <hi>Onahal,</hi> that ſhe, deferring
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47213:49"/>
her Enjoyment of her young Lover no longer,
might make way for the Prince to ſpeak to
<hi>Imoinda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The whole Affair being agreed on between
the Prince and</hi> Aboan, <hi>they attended the King,
as the cuſtom was, to the</hi> Otan; <hi>where, while
the whole Company was taken up in beholding
the Dancing, and Antick Poſtures the Women-Royal
made, to divert the King,</hi> Onahal <hi>ſingl'd
out</hi> Aboan <hi>whom ſhe found moſt plyable to her
wiſh. When ſhe had him where ſhe believ'd
ſhe cou'd not be heard, ſhe ſigh'd to him, and
ſoftly cry'd;</hi> Ah, <hi>Aboan!</hi> when will you be
ſenſible of my Paſſion? I confeſs it with my Mouth,
becauſe I wou'd not give my Eyes the Lye; and you
have too much already perceiv'd they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
my Flame: Nor wou'd I have you believe,
that becauſe I am the abandon'd Miſtreſs of a King,
I eſteem my ſelf altogether diveſted of Charms:
No, <hi>Aboan;</hi> I have ſtill a Rest of Beauty enough
engaging, and have learn'd to pleaſe too well, not
to be deſirable: I can have Lovers ſtill, but will
have none but <hi>Aboan.</hi> Madam, (<hi>reply'd the
half-feigning Youth</hi>) you have already, by my
Eyes, found you can ſtill conquer; and I believe
'tis in pity of me, you condeſcend to this kind Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion:
But, Madam, Words are us'd to be ſo
ſmall a part of our Country-Courtſhip, that 'tis
rare one can get ſo happy an Opportunity as to tell
one's Heart; and thoſe few Minutes we have, are
forc'd to be ſnatcht for more certain Proofs of
Love than Speaking and Sighing; and ſuch I lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
for.</p>
                  <p>He ſpoke this with ſuch a Tone, that ſhe
hop'd it true, and cou'd not forbear believing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:50"/>
it; and being wholly tranſported with Joy,
for having ſubdu'd the fineſt of all the King's
Subjects to her Deſires, ſhe took from her Ears
two large Pearls, and commanded him to wear
'em in his. He wou'd have refus'd em, crying,
<hi>Madam, theſe are not the Proofs of your Love
that I expect; 'tis Opportunity, 'tis a Lone-hour
only, that can make me happy:</hi> But forcing the
Pearls into his Hand, ſhe whiſper'd ſoftly to
him; <hi>Oh! Do not fear a Woman's Invention, when
Love ſets her a-thinking.</hi> And preſſing his Hand,
ſhe cry'd, <hi>This Night you ſhall be happy: Come to
the Gate of the Orange-Grove, behind the</hi> Otan,
<hi>and I will be ready, about Mid-night, to receive
you.</hi> 'Twas thus agreed, and ſhe left him,
that no notice might be taken of their ſpeaking
together.</p>
                  <p>The Ladies were ſtill dancing; and the King
laid on a Carpet, with a great deal of pleaſure
was beholding them, eſpecially <hi>Imoinda,</hi> who
that day appear'd more lovely than ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enliven'd with the good Tidings <hi>Onahal</hi>
had brought her, of the conſtant Paſſion the
Prince had for her. The Prince was laid on
another Carpet, at the other end of the Room,
with his Eyes fix'd on the Object of his Soul;
and as ſhe turn'd or mov'd, ſo did they; and
ſhe alone gave his Eyes and Soul their Motions.
Nor did <hi>Imoinda</hi> employ her Eyes to any other
uſe, than in beholding, with infinite Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
the Joy ſhe produc'd in thoſe of the Prince.
But while ſhe was more regarding Him, than
the Steps ſhe took, ſhe chanced to fall; and ſo
near him, as that leaping with extreme force
from the Carpet, he caught her in his Arms
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47213:50"/>
as ſhe fell: And 'twas viſible to the whole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
the Joy wherewith he receiv'd her; he
claſp'd her cloſe to his Boſom, and quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
that Reverence that was due to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of a King, and that Puniſhment that is
the Reward of a Boldneſs of this nature; and
had not the Preſence of Mind of <hi>Imoinda</hi> (fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his ſafety, than her own) befriended
him, in making her ſpring from his Arms, and
fall into her Dance again, he had, at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
met his Death; for the old King, jealous
to the laſt degree, roſe up in Rage, broke all
the Diverſion, and led <hi>Imoinda</hi> to her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſent out word to the Prince, to go
immediately to the Camp; and that if he were
found another Night in Court, he ſhou'd ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Death ordain'd for diſobedient Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
                  <p>You may imagine how welcome this News
was to <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> whoſe unſeaſonable Tranſport
and Careſs of <hi>Imoinda</hi> was blam'd by all Men
that lov'd him; and now he perceiv'd his fault,
yet cry'd, <hi>That for ſuch another Moment, he wou'd
be content to die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Otan</hi> was in diſorder about this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident;
and <hi>Onahal</hi> was particularly concern'd,
becauſe on the Prince's Stay depended her
Happineſs; for ſhe cou'd no longer expect
that of <hi>Aboan.</hi> So that, e're they departed,
they contriv'd it ſo, that the Prince and he
ſhou'd come both that Night to the Grove of
the <hi>Otan,</hi> which was all of Oranges and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
and that there they wou'd wait her
Orders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47213:51"/>
They parted thus, with Grief enough, till
Night, leaving the King in poſſeſſion of the
lovely Maid. But nothing could appeaſe the
Jealouſie of the old Lover; he wou'd not be
impos'd on, but wou'd have it, that <hi>Imoinda</hi>
made a falſe Step, on purpoſe to fall into <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko</hi>'s
Boſom, and that all things look'd like a
Deſign on both ſides, and 'twas in vain ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
her Innocence; he was old and obſtinate,
and left her more than half aſſur'd that his Fear
was true.</p>
                  <p>The King going to his Apartment, ſent to
know where the Prince was, and if he intended
to obey his Command. The Meſſenger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and told him, he found the Prince pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
and altogether unprepared for the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign;
that he lay negligently on the ground,
and anſwer'd very little. This confirm'd the
Jealouſie of the King, and he commanded that
they ſhou'd very narrowly and privately watch
his Motions; and that he ſhou'd not ſtir from
his Apartment, but one Spy or other ſhou'd be
employ'd to watch him. So that the hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
wherein he was to go to the Citron-Grove;
and taking only <hi>Aboan</hi> along with him,
he leaves his Apartment, and was watch'd to
the very Gate of the <hi>Otan;</hi> where he was ſeen
to enter, and where they left him, to carry
back the Tidings to the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko</hi> and <hi>Aboan</hi> were no ſooner enter'd,
but <hi>Onahal</hi> led the Prince to the Apartment of
<hi>Imoinda;</hi> who, not knowing any thing of her
Happineſs, was laid in Bed. But <hi>Onahal</hi> only
left him in her Chamber, to make the beſt of
his Opportunity, and took her dear <hi>Aboan</hi> to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47213:51"/>
her own; where he ſhew'd the height of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
for his Prince, when, to give him an
Opportunity, he ſuffer'd himſelf to be careſs'd
in Bed by <hi>Onahal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince ſoftly waken'd <hi>Imoinda,</hi> who was
not a little ſurpriz'd with Joy to find him there;
and yet ſhe trembl'd with a thouſand Fears.
I believe he omitted ſaying nothing to this
young Maid, that might perſuade her to ſuffer
him to ſeize his own, and take the Rights of
Love; and I believe ſhe was not long reſiſting
thoſe Arms where ſhe ſo long'd to be; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Opportunity, Night and Silence, Youth, Love
and Deſire, he ſoon prevail'd, and raviſht in a
Moment, what his old Grand-father had been
endeavouring for ſo many Months.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not to be imagin'd the Satisfaction of
theſe two young Lovers; nor the Vows ſhe
made him, that ſhe remain'd a ſpotleſs Maid,
till that Night; and that what ſhe did with his
Grand-father, had robb'd him of no part of
her Virgin-Honour, the Gods, in Mercy and
Juſtice, having reſerv'd that for her plighted
Lord, to whom of Right it belong'd. And 'tis
impoſſible to expreſs the Tranſports he ſuffer'd,
while he liſten'd to a Diſcourſe ſo charming
from her lov'd Lips; and claſp'd that Body in
his Arms, for whom he had ſo long languiſht;
and nothing now afflicted him, but his ſudden
Departure from her; for he told her the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
and his Commands; but ſhould depart
ſatisfy'd in this, That ſince the old King had
hitherto not been able to deprive him of thoſe
Enloyments which only belong'd to him, he
believ'd, for the future, he would be leſs able to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47213:52"/>
injure him; ſo that, abating the Scandal of the
Veil, which was no otherwiſe ſo, than that ſhe
was Wife to another: He believ'd her ſafe, even
in the Arms of the King, and innocent; yet
wou'd he have ventur'd at the Conqueſt of the
World, and have given it all, to have had her
avoided that Honour of receiving the <hi>Royal Veil.</hi>
'Twas thus, between a thouſand Careſſes, that
both bemoan'd the hard fate of Youth and
Beauty, ſo liable to that cruel Promotion:
'Twas a Glory that cou'd well have been ſpar'd
here, though deſir'd and aim'd at by all the
young Females of that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But while they were thus fondly employ'd,
forgetting how Time ran on, and that the
Dawn muſt conduct him far away from his
only Happineſs, they heard a great Noiſe in the
<hi>Otan,</hi> and unuſual Voices of Men; at which
the Prince, ſtarting from the Arms of the
frighted <hi>Imoinda,</hi> ran to a little Battle-Axe he
us'd to wear by his Side; and having not ſo
much leiſure as to put on his Habit, he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
himſelf againſt ſome who were already
opening the Door; which they did with ſo
much Violence, that <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was not able to
defend it; but was forc'd to cry out with a
commanding Voice, <hi>Whoever ye are that have
the Boldneſs to attempt to approach this Apartment
thus rudely; know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I, the Prince</hi> Oroonoko,
<hi>will revenge it with the certain Death of him that
firſt enters: Therefore, ſtand back, and know, this
Place is ſacred to Love and Me this Night; to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
'tis the King's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This he ſpoke with a Voice ſo reſolv'd and
aſſur'd, that they ſoon retir'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> from the Door;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47213:52"/>
but cry'd;</hi> 'Tis by the King's Command we are
come: and being ſatisfy'd by thy Voice, O Prince,
as much as if we had enter'd, we can report to the
King the Truth of all his Fears, and leave thee to
provide for thy own Safety, as thou art advis'd by
thy Friends.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words they departed, and left the
Prince to take a ſhort and ſad leave of his
<hi>Imoinda;</hi> who truſting in the ſtrength of her
Charms, believ'd ſhe ſhou'd appeaſe the Fury
of a jealous King, by ſaying, She was ſurpriz'd,
and that it was by force of Arms he got into
her Apartment. All her Concern now was
for his Life, and therefore ſhe haſten'd him to
the Camp, and with much a-doe prevail'd on
him to go. Nor was it ſhe alone that prevail'd;
<hi>Aboan</hi> and <hi>Onahal</hi> both pleaded, and both aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
him of a Lye that ſhou'd be well enough
contriv'd to ſecure <hi>Imoinda.</hi> So that at laſt,
with a Heart ſad as Death, dying Eyes, and
ſighing Soul, <hi>Oroonoko</hi> departed, and took his
way to the Camp.</p>
                  <p>It was not long after the King, in Perſon, came
to the <hi>Otan;</hi> where beholding <hi>Imoinda,</hi> with
Rage in his Eyes, he upbraided her Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Perfidy; and threatning her Royal
Lover, ſhe fell on her Face at his Feet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewing
the Floor with her Tears, and implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Pardon for a Fault which ſhe had not
with her Will committed; as <hi>Onahal,</hi> who
was alſo proſtrate with her, cou'd teſtifie:
That, unknown to her, he had broke into
her Apartment, and raviſh'd her. She ſpoke
this much againſt her Conſcience; but to
ſave her own Life, 'twas abſolutely neceſſary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47213:53"/>
ſhe ſhou'd feign this Falſity. She knew it
cou'd not injure the Prince, he being fled to
an Army that wou'd ſtand by him, againſt
any Injuries that ſhou'd aſſault him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this laſt Thought of <hi>Imoinda</hi>'s being Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd,
chang'd the meaſures of his Revenge;
and whereas before he deſign'd to be himſelf
her Executioner, he now reſolv'd ſhe ſhou'd
not die. But as it is the greateſt Crime in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
amongſt 'em, to touch a Woman after
having been poſſeſs'd by a Son, a Father, or a
Brother; ſo now he look'd on <hi>Imoinda</hi> as a
polluted thing, wholly unfit for his Embrace:
nor wou'd he reſign her to his Grand-ſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe had receiv'd the <hi>Royal Veil.</hi> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
removes her from the <hi>Otan,</hi> with <hi>Onahal;</hi>
whom he put into ſafe Hands, with order they
ſhou'd be both ſold off, as Slaves, to another
Country, either <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> 'twas no
matter where.</p>
                  <p>This cruel Sentence, worſe than Death, they
implor'd might be revers'd; but their Prayers
were vain, and it was put in execution accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
and that with ſo much Secrecy, that
none either without or within the <hi>Otan</hi>
knew any thing of their Abſence, or their
Deſtiny.</p>
                  <p>The old King, nevertheleſs, executed this
with a great deal of Reluctancy; but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
he had made a very great Conqueſt over
himſelf, when he had once reſolv'd, and had
perform'd what he reſolv'd. He believ'd now,
that his Love had been unjuſt; and that he
cou'd not expect the Gods, or <hi>Captain of the
Clouds</hi> (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hey call the unknown Power)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47213:53"/>
wou'd ſuffer a better Conſequence from ſo ill a
Cauſe. He now begins to hold <hi>Oroonoko</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd;
and to ſay, he had Reaſon for what he
did: And now every Body cou'd aſſure the
King how paſſionately <hi>Imoinda</hi> was belov'd
by the Prince; even thoſe confeſs'd it now,
who ſaid the contrary before his Flame was
abated. So that the King being old, and not
able to defend himſelf in War, and having no
Sons of all his Race remaining alive, but only
this, to maintain him on his Throne; and
looking on this as a Man diſoblig'd, firſt by
the Rape of his Miſtreſs, or rather Wife, and
now by depriving of him wholly of her, he
fear'd, might make him deſperate, and do ſome
cruel thing, either to himſelf or his old Grand-father
the Offender; he began to repent him
extremely of the Contempt he had, in his
Rage, put on <hi>Imoinda.</hi> Beſides, he conſider'd,
he ought in Honour to have kill'd her, for this
Offence, if it had been one: He ought to have
had ſo much Value and Conſideration for a
Maid of her Quality, as to have nobly put her
to Death; and not to have ſold her like a
common Slave, the greateſt Revenge, and the
moſt diſgraceful of any; and to which they a
thouſand times preferr Death, and implore it;
as <hi>Imoinda</hi> did, but cou'd not obtain that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Seeing therefore it was certain, that
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> wou'd highly reſent this Affront, he
thought good to make ſome Excuſe for his
Raſhneſs to him; and to that end, he ſent a
Meſſenger to the Camp, with Orders to treat
with him about the Matter, to gain his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and to endeavour to mitigate his Grief;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47213:54"/>
but that by no means he ſhou'd tell him ſhe
was ſold, but ſecretly put to death; for he
knew he ſhou'd never obtain his Pardon for
the other.</p>
                  <p>When the Meſſenger came, he found the
Prince upon the point of Engaging with the
Enemy; but as ſoon as he heard of the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of the Meſſenger, he commanded him to
his Tent, where he embrac'd him, and receiv'd
him with Joy; which was ſoon abated, by the
Down-caſt Looks of the Meſſenger, who was
inſtantly demanded the cauſe by <hi>Oroonoko,</hi>
who, impatient of Delay, ask'd a thouſand
Queſtions in a breath; and all concerning <hi>Imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inda.</hi>
But there needed little Return; for he
cou'd almoſt anſwer himſelf of all he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from his Sighs and Eyes. At laſt, the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
caſting himſelf at the Prince's Feet, and
kiſſing them, with all the Submiſſion of a Man
that had ſomething to implore which he dreaded
to utter, he beſought him to hear with Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
what he had to deliver to him, and to call
up all his Noble and Heroick Courage, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with his Words, and defend himſelf
againſt the ungrateful things he muſt relate.
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> reply'd, with a deep Sigh, and a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
Voice,—<hi>I am arm'd againſt their worſt
Efforts—; for I know they will tell me,</hi> Imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inda
<hi>is no more—; and after that, you may ſpare
the rest.</hi> Then, commanding him to riſe, he
laid himſelf on a Carpet, under a rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villion,
and remain'd a good while ſilent, and
was hardly heard to ſigh. When he was come
a little to himſelf, the Meſſenger ask'd him leave
to deliver that part of his Embaſſy which the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47213:54"/>
Prince had not yet devin'd: And the Prince
cry'd, <hi>I permit thee.</hi>—Then he told him the
Affliction the old King was in, for the Raſhneſs
he had committed, in his Cruelty to <hi>Imoinda;</hi>
and how he daign'd to ask Pardon for his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and to implore the Prince wou'd not
ſuffer that Loſs to touch his Heart too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly,
which now all the Gods cou'd not reſtore
him, but might recompenſe him in Glory,
which he begg'd he wou'd purſue; and that
Death, that common Revenger of all Injuries,
wou'd ſoon even the Account between him and
a feeble old Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko</hi> bad him return his Duty to his
Lord and Maſter; and to aſſure him, there
was no Account of Revenge to be adjuſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; if there were, 'twas he was the
Aggreſſor, and that Death would be juſt, and,
maugre his Age, wou'd fee him righted; and
he was contented to leave his Share of Glory
to Youths more fortunate, and worthy of that
Favour from the Gods. That henceforth he
wou'd never lift a Weapon, or draw a Bow,
but abandon the ſmall remains of his Life to
Sighs and Tears, and the continual Thoughts of
what his Lord and Grand-father had thought
good to ſend out of the World, with all that
Youth, that Innocence and Beauty.</p>
                  <p>After having ſpoken this, what-ever his
greateſt Officers and Men of the beſt Rank
cou'd do, they cou'd not raiſe him from the
Carpet, or perſuade him to Action, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
of Life; but commanding all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
he ſhut himſelf into his Pavillion all that
day, while the Enemy was ready to engage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:47213:55"/>
and wondring at the Delay, the whole Body
of the chief of the Army then addreſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to him, and to whom they had much
a-doe to get Admittance. They fell on their
Faces at the Foot of his Carpet; where they
lay, and beſought him with earneſt Prayers
and Tears, to lead'em forth to Battle, and not
let the Enemy take Advantages of them; and
implor'd him to have regard to his Glory, and
to the World, that depended on his Courage
and Conduct. But he made no other Reply to
all their Supplications, but this; That he had
now no more buſineſs for Glory; and for the
World, it was a Trifle not worth his Care:
<hi>Go</hi> (continu'd he, ſighing) <hi>and divide it amongſt
you, and reap with Joy what you ſo vainly prize,
and leave me to my more welcome Deſtiny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They then demanded what they ſhou'd do,
and whom he wou'd conſtitute in his room,
that the Confuſion of ambitious Youth and
Power might not ruine their Order, and make
them a Prey to the Enemy. He reply'd; He
wou'd not give himſelf the Trouble—; but
wiſh'd 'em to chuſe the braveſt Man amongſt
'em, let his Quality or Birth be what it wou'd:
<hi>For, O my Friends!</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>it is not Titles
make Men Brave or Good; or Birth, that beſtows
Courage and Generoſity, or makes the Owner Happy:
Believe this, when you behold</hi> Oroonoko, <hi>the most
wretched, and abandon'd by Fortune, of all the
Creation of the Gods.</hi> So turning himſelf about,
he wou'd make no more Reply to all they cou'd
urge or implore.</p>
                  <p>The Army beholding their Officers return
unſucceſsful, with ſad Faces, and ominous
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47213:55"/>
Looks, that preſage'd no good Luck, ſuffer'd
a thouſand Fears to take poſſeſſion of their
Hearts, and the Enemy to come ev'n upon
'em, before they wou'd provide for their
Safety, by any Defence; and though they were
aſſur'd by ſome, who had a mind to animate
'em, that they ſhou'd be immediately Headed
by the Prince, and that in the mean time <hi>Aboan</hi>
had Orders to Command as General; yet
they were ſo diſmay'd for want of that great
Example of Bravery, that they cou'd make but
a very feeble Reſiſtance; and at laſt, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
fled before the Enemy, who purſu'd 'em
to the very Tents, killing 'em: Nor cou'd all
<hi>Aboan</hi>'s Courage, which that day gain'd him
immortal Glory, ſhame 'em into a Manly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of themſelves. The Guards that were
left behind about the Prince's Tent, ſeeing
the Soldiers flee before the Enemy, and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelves all over the Plain, in great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
made ſuch Out-cries as rouz'd the Prince
from his amorous Slumber, in which he had
remain'd bury'd for two Days, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
any Suſtenance to approach him. But,
in ſpite of all his Reſolutions, he had not the
conſtancy of Grief to that degree, as to make
him inſenſible of the Danger of his Army; and
in that inſtant he leap'd from his Couch, and
cry'd,—<hi>Come, if we must die, let us meet Death
the nobleſt way; and 'twill be more like</hi> Oroonoko
<hi>to encounter him at an Army's Head, oppoſing
the Torrent of a conquering Foe, than lazily, on
a Couch, to wait his lingering Pleaſure, and die
every moment by a thouſand racking Thoughts;
or be tamely taken by an Enemy, and led a whining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:47213:56"/>
Love-ſick Slave, to adorn the Triumphs of</hi> Jamoan,
<hi>that young Victor, who already is enter'd beyond the
Limits I had preſcrib'd him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While he was ſpeaking, he ſuffer'd his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to dreſs him for the Field; and ſallying
out of his Pavillion, with more Life and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
in his Countenance than ever he ſhew'd,
he appear'd like ſome Divine Power deſcended
to ſave his Countrey from Deſtruction; and his
People had purpoſely put him on all things
that might make him ſhine with moſt Splendor,
to ſtrike a reverend Awe into the Beholders.
He flew into the thickeſt of thoſe that were
purſuing his Men; and being animated with
Deſpair, he fought as if he came on purpoſe
to die, and did ſuch things as will not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that Humane Strength cou'd perform;
and ſuch as ſoon inſpir'd all the reſt with new
Courage, and new Order: And now it was,
that they began to fight indeed; and ſo, as if
they wou'd not be out-done ev'n by their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
Hero; who turning the Tide of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
changing abſolutely the Fate of the Day,
gain'd an entire Conqueſt; and <hi>Oroonoko</hi> having
the good fortune to ſingle out <hi>Jamoan,</hi> he took
him Priſoner with his own Hand, having woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him almoſt to death.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Jamoan</hi> afterwards became very dear
to him, being a Man very gallant, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Graces, and fine Parts; ſo that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
put him amongſt the Rank of Captives, as
they us'd to do, without diſtinction, for the
common Sale, or Market; but kept him in his
own Court, where he retain'd nothing of the
Priſoner but the Name, and return'd no more
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47213:56"/>
into his own Countrey, ſo great an Affection he
took for <hi>Oroonoko;</hi> and by a thouſand Tales
and Adventures of Love and Gallantry, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
his Diſeaſe of Melancholy and Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which I have often heard him ſay, had
certainly kill'd him, but for the Converſation
of this Prince and <hi>Aboan,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Governor
he had from his Childhood, of whom I have
ſpoken before, and who was a Man of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Wit, great Ingenuity and Learning; all
which he had infus'd into his young Pupil.
This <hi>French-man</hi> was baniſht out of his own
Countrey, for ſome Heretical Notions he held;
and though he was a Man of very little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
he had admirable Morals, and a brave
Soul.</p>
                  <p>After the total Defeat of <hi>Jamoan</hi>'s Army,
which all fled, or were left dead upon the
Place, they ſpent ſome time in the Camp;
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> chuſing rather to remain a while there
in his Tents, than to enter into a Palace, or live
in a Court where he had ſo lately ſuffer'd ſo
great a Loſs. The Officers therefore, who ſaw
and knew his cauſe of Diſcontent, invented
all ſorts of Diverſions and Sports, to entertain
their Prince: So that what with thoſe Amuze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
abroad, and others at home, that is,
within their Tents, with the Perſuaſions, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Care of his Friends and Servants
that he more peculiarly priz'd, he wore off, in
time, a great part of that <hi>Shagrien,</hi> and Torture
of Deſpair, which the firſt Efforts of <hi>Imoinda</hi>'s
Death had given him: inſomuch as having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a thouſand kind Embaſſies from the King,
and Invitations to return to Court, he obey'd,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47213:57"/>
though with no little reluctancy; and when
he did ſo, there was a viſible change in him,
and for a long time he was much more melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
than before. But Time leſſens all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
and reduces 'em to <hi>Medium's,</hi> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern;
but no Motives or Beauties, though
all endeavour'd it, cou'd engage him in any ſort
of Amour, though he had all the Invitations to
it, both from his own Youth, and others Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was no ſooner return'd from this
laſt Conqueſt, and receiv'd at Court with all
the Joy and Magnificence that cou'd be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
to a young Victor, who was not only
return'd triumphant, but belov'd like a Deity,
when there arriv'd in the Port an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Ship.</p>
                  <p>This Perſon had often before been in theſe
Countries, and was very well known to <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko,</hi>
with whom he had traffick'd for Slaves,
and had us'd to do the ſame with his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
                  <p>This Commander was a Man of a finer ſort
of Addreſs, and Converſation, better bred, and
more engaging, than moſt of that ſort of Men
are; ſo that he ſeem'd rather never to have
been bred out of a Court, than almoſt all his
life at Sea. This Captain therefore was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
better receiv'd at Court, than moſt of the
Traders to thoſe Countries were; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> who was more civiliz'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Europaean</hi> Mode, than any other
had been, and took more delight in the <hi>White</hi>
Nations; and, above all, Men of Parts and
Wit. To this Captain he ſold abundance of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47213:57"/>
his Slaves; and for the Favour and Eſteem he
had for him, made him many Preſents, and
oblig'd him to ſtay at Court as long as poſſibly
he cou'd. Which the Captain ſeem'd to take
as a very great Honour done him, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Prince every day with Globes and
Maps, and Mathematical Diſcourſes and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
eating, drinking, hunting and living
with him with ſo much familiarity, that it
was not to be doubted but he had gain'd very
greatly upon the Heart of this gallant young
Man. And the Captain, in Return of all theſe
mighty Favours, beſought the Prince to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
his Veſſel with his Preſence, ſome day or
other, to Dinner, before he ſhou'd ſet ſail:
which he condeſcended to accept, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
his day. The Captain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on his part,
fail'd not to have all things in a readineſs, in
the moſt magnificent order he cou'd poſſibly:
And the day being come, the Captain, in his
Boat, richly adorn'd with Carpets and Velvet-Cuſhions,
row'd to the ſhore, to receive the
Prince; with another Long-Boat, where was
plac'd all his Muſick and Trumpets, with which
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> was extremely delighted; who met
him on the ſhore, attended by his <hi>French</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
<hi>Jamoan, Aboan,</hi> and about an hundred
of the nobleſt of the Youths of the Court: And
after they had firſt carry'd the Prince on board,
the Boats fetch'd the reſt off: where they
found a very ſplendid Treat, with all ſorts of
fine Wines; and were as well entertain'd, as
'twas poſſible in ſuch a place to be.</p>
                  <p>The Prince having drank hard of Punch,
and ſeveral ſorts of Wine, as did all the reſt,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47213:58"/>
(for great care was taken, they ſhou'd want
nothing of that part of the Entertainment) was
very merry, and in great admiration of the
Ship, for he had never been in one before; ſo
that he was curious of beholding every place
where he decently might deſcend. The reſt,
no leſs curious, who were not quite overcome
with Drinking, rambl'd at their pleaſure <hi>Fore</hi>
and <hi>Aft,</hi> as their Fancies guided 'em: So that
the Captain, who had well laid his Deſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
gave the Word, and ſeiz'd on all his Gueſts;
they clapping great Irons ſuddenly on the Prince,
when he was leap'd down into the Hold, to
view that part of the Veſſel; and locking him
faſt down, ſecur'd him. The ſame Treachery
was us'd to all the reſt; and all in one inſtant,
in ſeveral places of the Ship, were laſh'd faſt in
Irons, and betray'd to Slavery. That great
Deſign over, they ſet all Hands to work to
hoiſe Sail; and with as treacherous and fair a
Wind they made from the Shore with this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and glorious Prize, who thought of nothing
leſs than ſuch an Entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Some have commended this Act, as brave
in the Captain; but I will ſpare my ſenſe of it,
and leave it to my Reader to judge as he
pleaſes. It may be eaſily gueſs'd, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Prince reſented this Indignity, who
may be beſt reſembl'd to a Lion taken in a Toil;
ſo he rag'd, ſo he ſtruggl'd for Liberty, but all
in vain; and they had ſo wiſely manag'd his
Fetters, that he cou'd not uſe a Hand in his
defence, to quit himſelf of a Life that wou'd
by no means endure Slavery; nor cou'd he
move from the place where he was ty'd, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47213:58"/>
any ſolid part of the Ship againſt which he
might have beat his Head, and have finiſh'd his
Diſgrace that way: So that being deprived of
all other means, he reſolv'd to periſh for want
of Food; and pleas'd at laſt with that Thought,
and toil'd and tir'd by Rage and Indignation,
he laid himſelf down, and ſullenly reſolv'd
upon dying, and refuſed all things that were
brought him.</p>
                  <p>This did not a little vex the Captain, and
the more ſo, becauſe he found almoſt all of
'em of the ſame Humour: ſo that the loſs of
ſo many brave Slaves, ſo tall and goodly to
behold, wou'd have been very conſiderable:
He therefore order'd one to go from him (for
he wou'd not be ſeen himſelf) to <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> and
to aſſure him, he was afflicted for having raſhly
done ſo unhoſpitable a Deed, and which cou'd
not be now remedy'd, ſince they were far from
ſhore; but ſince he reſented it in ſo high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he aſſur'd him he wou'd revoke his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and ſet both him and his Friends a-ſhore
on the next Land they ſhou'd touch at; and of
this the Meſſenger gave him his Oath, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he would reſolve to live: And <hi>Oroonoko,</hi>
whoſe Honour was ſuch as he never had viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Word in his Life himſelf, much leſs a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Aſſeveration, believ'd in an inſtant what
this Man ſaid; but reply'd, He expected, for
a confirmation of this, to have his ſhameful
Fetters diſmiſs'd. This Demand was carried
to the Captain; who return'd him anſwer, That
the Offence had been ſo great which he had put
upon the Prince, that he durſt not truſt him
with Liberty while he remain'd in the Ship,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47213:59"/>
for fear leſt by a Valour natural to him, and a
Revenge that wou'd animate that Valour, he
might commit ſome Outrage fatal to himſelf,
and the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter, to whom his Veſſel did
belong. To this <hi>Oroonoko</hi> reply'd; He would
engage his Honour to behave himſelf in all
friendly Order and Manner, and obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the <hi>Captain,</hi> as he was Lord of the
<hi>King</hi>'s Veſſel, and General of thoſe Men under
his Command.</p>
                  <p>This was deliver'd to the ſtill doubting <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
who could not reſolve to truſt a <hi>Heathen,</hi>
he ſaid, upon his Parole, a Man that had no
Senſe or Notion of the God that he worſhipp'd.
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> then reply'd; He was very ſorry to
hear that the <hi>Captain</hi> pretended to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Worſhip of any <hi>Gods,</hi> who had
taught him no better Principles, than not to
Credit as he would be Credited. But they told
him, the Difference of their Faith occaſion'd
that Diſtruſt: For the <hi>Captain</hi> had proteſted to
him upon the Word of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and ſworn in
the Name of a Great <hi>GOD;</hi> which if he
ſhou'd violate, he would expect eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the World to come. <hi>Is that all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
he has to be Juſt to his Oath?</hi> (replied <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roonoko.)
Let him know, I ſwear by my Honour;
which to violate, would not only render me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
and deſpiſed by all brave and honeſt Men,
and ſo give my ſelf perpetual pain, but it wou'd
be eternally offending and diſpleaſing all Mankind;
harming, betraying, circumventing and outraging
all Men: but Puniſhments hereafter are ſuffer'd
by one's ſelf; and the World takes no cognizances
whether this</hi> God <hi>have reveng'd 'em, or not, 'tis
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47213:59"/>
done ſo ſecretly, and deferr'd ſo long: While the
Man of no Honour ſuffers every moment the ſcorn
and contempt of the honeſter World, and dies every
day ignominiouſly in his Fame, which is more valuable
than Life: I ſpeak not this to move Belief, but to
ſhew you how you miſtake, when you imagine, That
he who will violate his Honour, will keep his Word
with his</hi> Gods. So, turning from him with a
diſdainful ſmile, he refuſed to anſwer him,
when he urg'd him to know what Anſwer he
ſhou'd carry back to his Captain; ſo that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
without ſaying any more.</p>
                  <p>The Captain pondering and conſulting what
to do, it was concluded that nothing but <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko</hi>'s
Liberty wou'd encourage any of the reſt
to eat, except the <hi>French-man,</hi> whom the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
cou'd not pretend to keep Priſoner, but
only told him, he was ſecured, becauſe he might
act ſomething in favour of the Prince, but that
he ſhou'd be freed as ſoon as they came to Land.
So that they concluded it wholly neceſſary to
free the Prince from his Irons, that he might
ſhew himſelf to the reſt; that they might have
an eye upon him, and that they cou'd not fear a
ſingle Man.</p>
                  <p>This being reſolv'd; to make the Obligation
the greater, the Captain himſelf went to <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko;</hi>
where, after many Complements, and
Aſſurances of what he had already promis'd,
he receiving from the Prince his Parole, and
his Hand, for his good Behaviour, diſmiſs'd his
Irons, and brought him to his own Cabin;
where, after having treated and repos'd him a
while, (for he had neither eat nor ſlept in four
days before) he beſought him to viſit thoſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47213:60"/>
obſtinate People in Chains, who refus'd all
manner of Suſtenance; and entreated him to
oblige 'em to eat, and aſſure 'em of their Liberty
the firſt Opportunity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> who was too generous, not to give
credit to his Words, ſhew'd himſelf to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who were tranſported with Exceſs of Joy
at the ſight of their Darling Prince; falling at
his Feet, and kiſſing and embracing 'em; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
as ſome Divine Oracle, all he aſſur'd
'em. But he beſought 'em to bear their Chains
with that Bravery that became thoſe whom he
had ſeen act ſo nobly in Arms; and that they
cou'd not give him greater Proofs of their Love
and Friendſhip, ſince 'twas all the Security the
Captain (his Friend) cou'd have, againſt the
Revenge, he ſaid, they might poſſibly juſtly
take, for the Injuries ſuſtain'd by him. And
they all, with one accord, aſſur'd him, they
cou'd not ſuffer enough, when it was for his
Repoſe and Safety.</p>
                  <p>After this, they no longer refus'd to eat, but
took what was brought 'em, and were pleas'd
with their Captivity, ſince by it they hop'd to
redeem the Prince, who, all the reſt of the
Voyage, was treated with all the reſpect due to
his Birth, tho' nothing cou'd divert his Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly;
and he wou'd often ſigh for <hi>Imoinda,</hi>
and think this a Puniſhment due to his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
in having left that Noble Maid behind
him, that fatal Night, in the <hi>Otan,</hi> when he
fled to the Camp.</p>
                  <p>Poſſeſs'd with a thouſand Thoughts of paſt
Joys with this fair young Perſon, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Griefs for her eternal Loſs, he endur'd a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47213:60"/>
tedious Voyage, and at laſt arriv'd at the Mouth
of the River of <hi>Surinam,</hi> a Colony belonging
to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and where they were
to deliver ſome part of their Slaves. There
the Merchants and Gentlemen of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
going on Board, to demand thoſe Lots
of Slaves they had already agreed on, and,
amongſt thoſe, the Over-ſeers of thoſe Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
where I then chanc'd to be; the Captain,
who had given the Word, order'd his Men to
bring up thoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> noble Slaves in Fetters, whom
I have ſpoken of; and having put 'em, ſome
in one, and ſome in other Lots, with Women
and Children (which they call <hi>Pickaninies,</hi>)
they ſold 'em off, as Slaves, to ſeveral Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and Gentlemen; not putting any two
in one Lot, becauſe they wou'd ſeparate 'em
far from each other; not daring to truſt 'em
together, leſt Rage and Courage ſhou'd put
'em upon contriving ſome great Action, to the
Ruine of the Colony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was firſt ſeiz'd on, and ſold to our
Over-ſeer, who had the firſt Lot, with ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
more of all ſorts and ſizes, but not one of
Quality with him. When he ſaw this, he found
what they meant; for, as I ſaid, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<hi>Engliſh</hi> pretty well; and being wholly
unarm'd and defenceleſs, ſo as it was in vain to
make any Reſiſtance, he only beheld the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
with a Look all fierce and diſdainful, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding
him with Eyes that forc'd Bluſhes on
his guilty Cheeks, he only cry'd, in paſſing
over the ſide of the Ship; <hi>Farewell, Sir: 'Tis
worth my Suffering, to gain ſo true a Knowledge
both of you, and of your Gods by whom you ſwear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:47213:61"/>
And deſiring thoſe that held him to forbear
their pains, and telling 'em he wou'd make no
Reſiſtance, he cry'd, <hi>Come, my Fellow-Slaves;
let us deſcend, and ſee if we can meet with more
Honour and Honeſty in the next World we ſhall
touch upon.</hi> So he nimbly leapt into the Boat,
and ſhewing no more Concern, ſuffer'd himſelf
to be row'd up the River, with his Seventeen
Companions.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman that bought him, was a
young <hi>Coniſh</hi> Gentleman, whoſe Name was
<hi>Trefry;</hi> a Man of great Wit, and fine Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and was carry'd into thoſe Parts by the
Lord—Governor, to manage all his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
He reflecting on the laſt World of <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko</hi>
to the Captain, and beholding the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Veſt, no ſooner came into the Boat,
but he fix'd his Eyes on him; and finding
ſomething ſo extraordinary in his Face, his
Shape and Mien, a Greatneſs of Look, and
Haughtineſs in his Air, and finding he ſpoke
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> had a great Mind to be enquiring into
his Quality and Fortune; which, though <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko</hi>
endeavour'd to hide, by only confeſſing
he was above the Rank of common Slaves,
<hi>Trefry</hi> ſoon found he was yet ſomething greater
than he confeſs'd; and from that Moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to conceive ſo vaſt an Eſteem for him, that
he ever after lov'd him as his deareſt Brother,
and ſhew'd him all the Civilities due to ſo great
a Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trefry</hi> was a very good Mathematician, and
a Linguiſt; cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d ſpeak <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh;</hi>
and in the three Days they remain'd in the
Boat (for ſo long were they going from the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47213:61"/>
Ship, to the Plantation) he entertain'd <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko</hi>
ſo agreeably with his Art and Diſcourſe,
that he was no leſs pleas'd with <hi>Trefry,</hi> than
he was with the Prince; and he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
at leaſt, fortunate in this, that ſince he
was a Slave, as long as he won'd ſuffer himſelf
to remain ſo, he had a Man of ſo excellent Wit
and Parts for a Maſter: So that before they
had finiſh'd their Voyage up the River, he
made no ſcruple of declaring to <hi>Trefry</hi> all his
Fortunes, and moſt part of what I have here
related, and put himſelf wholly into the Hands
of his new Friend, whom he found reſenting
all the Injuries were done him, and was charm'd
with all the Greatneſſes of his Actions; which
were recited with that Modeſty, and delicate
Sence, as wholly vanquiſh'd him, and ſubdu'd
him to his Intereſt. And he promis'd him on
his Word and Honour, he wou'd find the
Means to re-conduct him to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
again: aſſuring him, he had a perfect Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
of ſo diſhonourable an Action; and
that he wou'd ſooner have dy'd, than have
been the Author of ſuch a Perfidy. He found
the Prince was very much concern'd to know
what became of his Friends, and how they
took their Slavery; and <hi>Trefry</hi> promis'd to
take care about the enquiring after their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and that he ſhou'd have an Account
of 'em.</p>
                  <p>Though, as <hi>Oroonoko</hi> afterwards ſaid, he had
little Reaſon to credit the Words of a <hi>Backea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,</hi>
yet he knew not why; but he ſaw a
king of Sincerity, and awful Truth in the Face
of <hi>Trefry;</hi> he ſaw an Honeſty in his Eyes, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47213:62"/>
he found him wiſe and witty enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Honour: for it was one of his Maxims,
<hi>A Man of Wit cou'd not be a Knave or Villain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In their paſſage up the River, they put in
at ſeveral Houſes for Refreſhment; and ever
when they landed, numbers of People wou'd
flock to behold this Man; not but their Eyes
were daily entertain'd with the ſight of Slaves,
but the Fame of <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was gone before him,
and all People were in admiration of his Beauty.
Beſides, he had a rich Habit on, in which he
was taken, ſo different from the reſt, and
which the Captain cou'd not ſtrip him of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was forc'd to ſurprize his Perſon in
the minute he ſold him. When he found his
Habit made him liable, as he thought, to be
gaz'd at the more, he begg'd <hi>Trefry</hi> to give him
ſomething more befitting a Slave; which he
did, and took off his Robes. Nevertheleſs, he
ſhone through all, and his <hi>Oſenbrigs</hi> (a ſort of
brown <hi>Holland</hi> Suit he had on) cou'd not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the Graces of his Looks and Mien; and he
had no leſs Admirers, than when he had his
dazling Habit on; the Royal Youth appear'd
in ſpite of the Slave, and People cou'd not help
treating him after a different manner, without
deſigning it: As ſoon as they approach'd him,
they venerated and eſteem'd him; his Eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
commanded Reſpect, and his Behaviour
inſinuated it into every Soul. So that there was
nothing talk'd of but this young and gallant
Slave, even by thoſe who yet knew not that he
was a Prince.</p>
                  <p>I ought to tell you, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> never
but any Slaves but they give 'em ſome Name
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47213:62"/>
of their own, their native ones being likely
very barbarous, and hard to pronounce; ſo
that Mr. <hi>Trefry</hi> gave <hi>Oroonoko</hi> that of <hi>Caeſar:</hi>
which Name will live in that Countrey as long
as that (ſcarce more) glorious one of the great
<hi>Roman;</hi> for 'tis moſt evident, he wanted no
part of the Perſonal Courage of that <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
and acted things as memorable, had they been
done in ſome part of the World repleniſh'd
with People, and Hiſtorians, that might have
given him his due. But his Misfortune was,
to fall in an obſcure World, that afforded only
a Female Pen to celebrate his Fame; though
I doubt not but it had liv'd from others Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
if the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who, immediately after
his time, took that Countrey, had not kill'd,
baniſh'd and diſpers'd all thoſe that were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of giving the World this great Man's
Life, much better than I have done. And
Mr. <hi>Trefry,</hi> who deſign'd it, dy'd before he
began it, and bemoan'd himſelf for not having
undertook it in time.</p>
                  <p>For the future therefore, I muſt call <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko,
Caeſar;</hi> Since by that Name only he was
known in our Weſtern World, and by that
Name he was receiv'd on Shore at <hi>Parham-Houſe,</hi>
where he was deſtin'd a Slave. But if
the King himſelf (God bleſs him) had come
a-ſhore, there cou'd not have been greater
Expectations by all the whole Plantation, and
thoſe neighbouring ones, than was on ours at
that time; and he was receiv'd more like a
Governor, than a Slave. Notwithſtanding, as
the Cuſtom was, they aſſign'd him his portion
of Land, his Houſe, and his Buſineſs, up in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47213:63"/>
Plantation. But as it was more for Form, than
any Deſign, to put him to his Task, he endur'd
no more of the Slave but the Name, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
ſome Days in the Houſe, receiving all
Viſits that were made him, without ſtirring
towards that part of the Plantation where the
<hi>Negroes</hi> were.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, he wou'd needs go view his Land,
his Houſe, and the Buſineſs aſſign'd him. But
he no ſooner came to the Houſes of the Slaves,
which are like a little Town by it ſelf, the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi>
all having left Work, but they all came
forth to behold him, and found he was that
Prince who had, at ſeveral times, ſold moſt of
'em to theſe Parts; and, from a Veneration they
pay to great Men, eſpecially if they know 'em,
and from the Surprize and Awe they had at the
ſight of him, they all caſt themſelves at his Feet,
crying out, in their Language, <hi>Live, O King!
Long live, O King!</hi> And kiſſing his Feet, paid
him even Divine Homage.</p>
                  <p>Several <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen were with him;
and what Mr. <hi>Trefry</hi> had told 'em, was here
confirm'd; of which he himſelf before had no
other Witneſs than <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf: But he was
infinitely glad to find his Grandure confirm'd
by the Adoration of all the Slaves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> troubl'd with their Over-Joy, and
Over-Ceremony, beſought 'em to riſe, and to
receive him as their Fellow-Slave; aſſuring
them, he was no better. At which they ſet
up with one Accord a moſt terrible and hidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Mourning and Condoling, which he and
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had much a-do to appeaſe; but at
laſt they prevail'd with 'em, and they prepar'd
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47213:63"/>
all their barbarous Muſick, and every one kill'd
and dreſs'd ſomething of his own Stock (for
every Family has their Land a-part, on which,
at their leiſure-times, they breed all eatable
things; and clubbing it together, made a moſt
magnificent Supper, inviting their <hi>Grandee Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
their <hi>Prince,</hi> to honour it with his Preſence;
which he did, and ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> with him;
where they all waited on him, ſome playing,
others dancing before him all the time, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Manners of their ſeveral Nations;
and with unwearied Induſtry, endeavouring to
pleaſe and delight him.</p>
                  <p>While they ſat at Meat, Mr. <hi>Trefry</hi> told <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
that moſt of theſe young <hi>Salves</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
in Love, with a fine She-<hi>Slave,</hi> whom
they had had about Six Months on their Land;
the <hi>Prince,</hi> who never heard the Name of <hi>Love</hi>
without a Sigh, nor any mention of it without
the Curioſity of examining further into that
tale, which of all Diſcourſes was moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him, asked, how they came to be ſo
Unhappy, as to be all Undone for one fair
<hi>Slave? Trefry,</hi> who was naturally Amorous,
and lov'd to talk of Love as well as any body,
proceeded to tell him, they had the moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Black</hi> that ever was beheld on their <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
about fifteen or ſixteen Years old, as he
gueſs'd that, for his part, he had done nothing
but Sigh for her ever ſince ſhe came; and that
all the <hi>White</hi> Beauties he had ſeen, never
charm'd him ſo abſolutely as this fine Creature
had done; and that no Man, of any Nation,
ever beheld her, that did not fall in Love with
her; and that ſhe had all the <hi>Slaves</hi> perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47213:64"/>
at her Feet; and the whole Countrey re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded
with the Fame of <hi>Clemene,</hi> for ſo (ſaid
he) we have Chriſten'd her: But ſhe denies us
all with ſuch a noble Diſdain, that 'tis a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
to ſee, that ſhe, who can give ſuch eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Deſires, ſhou'd her ſelf be all Ice and all
Unconcern. She is adorn'd with the moſt grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Modeſty that ever beautify'd Youth; the
ſofteſt Sigher;—that, if ſhe were capable
of Love, one wou'd ſwear ſhe languiſh'd for
ſome abſent happy Man; and ſo retir'd, as if
ſhe fear'd a Rape even from the God of Day,
or that the Breezes wou'd ſteal Kiſſes from her
delicate Mouth: Her Task of Work, ſome ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lover every Day makes it his Petition to
perform for her; which ſhe accepts, bluſhing,
and with reluctancy, for fear he will ask her
a Look for a Recompence, which he dares not
preſume to hope; ſo great an Awe ſhe ſtrikes
into the Hearts of her Admirers. <hi>I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
(reply'd the Prince) <hi>that</hi> Clemene <hi>ſhou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
Slaves, being, as you ſay, ſo Beautiful; but
wonder how ſhe eſcapes thoſe who can entertain her
as you can do: or why, being your Slave, you do
not oblige her to yield. I confeſs</hi> (ſaid <hi>Trefry) when
I have, against her Will, entertain'd her with Love
ſo long, as to be tranſported with my Paſſion
even above Decency, I have been ready to make
uſe of thoſe advantages of Strength and Force
Nature has given me: But, oh! ſhe diſarms me,
with that Modeſty and Weeping, ſo tender and ſo
moving, that I retire, and thank my Stars ſhe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
me.</hi> The Company laugh'd at his Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to a <hi>Slave,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> only applauded the
Nobleneſs of his Paſſion and Nature; ſince that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47213:64"/>
Slave might be Noble, or, what was better,
have true Notions of Honour and Vertue in her.
Thus paſs'd they this Night, after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from the <hi>Slaves</hi> all imaginable Reſpect and
Obedience.</p>
                  <p>The next day, <hi>Trefry</hi> ask'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> to walk
when the Heat was allay'd, and deſignedly
carry'd him by the Cottage of the <hi>fair Slave;</hi>
and told him, ſhe whom he ſpoke of laſt night
liv'd there retir'd: <hi>But</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I wou'd not
wiſh you to approach; for I am ſure, you will be
in Love as ſoon as you behold her. Caeſar</hi> aſſur'd
him, he was Proof againſt all the Charms of
that Sex; and that if he imagin'd his Heart
cou'd be ſo perfidious to Love again, after
<hi>Imoinda,</hi> he believ'd he ſhou'd tear it from his
Boſom. They had no ſooner ſpoke, but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Shock-Dog, that <hi>Clemene</hi> had preſented her,
which ſhe took great delight in, ran out; and
ſhe, not knowing any body was there, ran to
get it in again, and bolted out on thoſe who
were juſt ſpeaking of her: When, ſeeing them,
ſhe wou'd have run in again; but <hi>Trefry</hi> caught
her by the Hand, and cry'd; Clemene, <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you flie a Lover, you ought to pay ſome Reſpect
to this Stranger,</hi> (pointing to <hi>Caeſar.</hi>) But ſhe,
as if ſhe had reſolv'd never to raiſe her Eyes to
the Face of a Man again, bent 'em the more to
the Earth, when he ſpoke, and gave the <hi>Prince</hi>
the leiſure to look the more at her. There
needed no long Gazing, or Conſideration, to
examine who this <hi>fair Creature</hi> was; he ſoon
ſaw <hi>Imoinda</hi> all over her; in a minute he ſaw
her Face, her Shape, her Air, her Modeſty,
and all that call'd forth his Soul with Joy at
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47213:65"/>
his Eyes, and left his Body deſtitute of almoſt
Life; it ſtood without Motion, and, for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
knew not that it had a Being: and, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
he had never come to himſelf, ſo oppreſs'd
he was with Over-joy, if he had not met with
this Allay, that he perceiv'd <hi>Imoinda</hi> fall dead
in the Hands of <hi>Trefry:</hi> This awaken'd him,
and he ran to her Aid, and caught her in his
Arms, where, by degrees, ſhe came to her ſelf;
and 'tis needleſs to tell with what Tranſports,
what Extaſies of Joy, they both a while beheld
each other, without Speaking; then Snatch'd
each other to their Arms; then Gaze again, as
if they ſtill doubted whether they poſſeſs'd
the Bleſſing: They Graſp'd; but when they
recover'd their Speech, 'tis not to be imagin'd,
what tender Things they expreſs'd to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
wondering what ſtrange Fate had brought
'em again together. They ſoon inform'd each
other of their Fortunes, and equally bewail'd
their Fate; but, at the ſame time, they mutually
proteſted, that even Fetters and Slavery were
Soft and Eaſie; and wou'd be ſupported with
Joy and Pleaſure, while they cou'd be ſo happy
to poſſeſs each other, and to be able to make
good their Vows. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſwore he diſdain'd the
Empire of the World, while he cou'd behold his
<hi>Imoinda;</hi> and ſhe deſpis'd Grandure and Pomp,
thoſe Vanities of her Sex, when ſhe cou'd Gaze
on <hi>Oroonoko.</hi> He ador'd the very Cottage where
ſhe reſided, and ſaid, That little Inch of the
World wou'd give him more Happineſs than all
the Univerſe cou'd do; and ſhe vow'd, It was
a Palace, while adorn'd with the Preſence of
<hi>Oroonoko.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:47213:65"/>
                     <hi>Trefry</hi> was infinitely pleas'd with this Novel,
and found this <hi>Clemene</hi> was the Fair Miſtreſs of
whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> had before ſpoke; and was not a
little ſatisfied, that Heaven was ſo kind to the
<hi>Prince,</hi> as to ſweeten his Misfortunes by ſo lucky
an Accident; and leaving the Lovers to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
was impatient to come down to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-Houſe,</hi>
(which was on the ſame <hi>Plantation</hi>)
to give me an Account of what had hapned. I
was as impatient to make theſe Lovers a Viſit,
having already made a Friendſhip with <hi>Caeſar;</hi>
and from his own Mouth learn'd what I have
related, which was confirmed by his French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who was ſet on Shoar to ſeek his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
and of whom they cou'd not make a
Slave, becauſe a Chriſtian; and he came daily
to <hi>Parham-Hill</hi> to ſee and pay his Reſpects to
his Puple <hi>Prince:</hi> So that concerning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſting
my ſelf, in all that related to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
whom I had aſſur'd of Liberty, as ſoon as the
Governor arriv'd, I haſted preſently to the
Place where the Lovers were, and was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
glad to find this Beautiful young <hi>Slave</hi>
(who had already gain'd all our Eſteems, for
her Modeſty and her extraordinary Prettineſs)
to be the ſame I had heard <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſpeak ſo much
of. One may imagine then we paid her a treble
Reſpect; and though from her being carv'd in
fine Flowers and Birds all over her Body, we
took her to be of Quality before, yet, when we
knew <hi>Clemene</hi> was <hi>Imoinda,</hi> we cou'd not enough
admire her.</p>
                  <p>I had forgot to tell you, that thoſe who are
Nobly born of that Country, are ſo delicately
Cut and Rac'd all over the fore-part of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47213:66"/>
Trunk of their Bodies, that it looks as if it were
Japan'd, the Works being raiſed like high
Poynt round the edges of the Flowers. Some
are only carv'd with a little Flower, or Bird,
at the ſides of the Temples, as was <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and
thoſe who are ſo carv'd over the Body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
our Ancient <hi>Picts</hi> that are figur'd in
the Chronicles, but theſe Carvings are more
delicate.</p>
                  <p>From that happy Day <hi>Caeſar</hi> took <hi>Clemene</hi>
for his Wife, to the general Joy of all People;
and there was as much Magnificence as the
Countrey wou'd afford at the Celebration of
this Wedding: and in a very ſhort time after
ſhe conceiv'd with Child; which made <hi>Caeſar</hi>
even adore her, knowing he was the laſt of his
Great Race. This new Accident made him
more impatient of Liberty, and he was every
day treating with <hi>Trefry</hi> for his and <hi>Clemene</hi>'s
Liberty, and offer'd either Gold, or a vaſt
quantity of Slaves, which ſhou'd be paid before
they let him go, provided he cou'd have any
Security that he ſhou'd go when his Ranſom
was paid. They fed him from Day to Day
with Promiſes, and delay'd him till the Lord-Governor
ſhou'd come; ſo that he began to
ſuſpect them of falſhood, and that they wou'd
delay him till the time of his Wife's Delivery,
and make a Slave of that too; for all the Breed
is theirs to whom the Parents belong: This
Thought made him very uneaſie, and his Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenneſs
gave them ſome Jealouſies of him; ſo
that I was oblig'd, by ſome Perſons who fear'd
a Mutiny (which is very fatal ſometimes in
thoſe Colonies, that abound ſo with Slaves,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47213:66"/>
that they exceed the <hi>Whites</hi> in vaſt Numbers)
to diſcourſe with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and to give him all
the Satisfaction I proſſibly could; they knew he
and <hi>Clemene</hi> were ſcarce an Hour in a Day from
my Lodgings; that they eat with me, and that
I oblig'd 'em in all things I was capable of: I
entertain'd 'em with the Lives of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and Great Men; which charm'd him to my
Company; and her, with teaching her all the
pretty Works that I was Miſtreſs of, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her Stories of Nuns, and endeavouring to
bring her to the Knowledge of the True God.
But of all Diſcourſes, <hi>Caeſar</hi> lik'd that the worſt,
and wou'd never be reconcil'd to our Notions
of the Trinity, of which he ever made a Jeſt:
it was a Riddle, he ſaid, wou'd turn his Brain
to conceive, and one cou'd not make him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what Faith was. However, theſe
Converſations fail'd not altogether ſo well to
divert him, that he lik'd the Company of us
Women much above the Men: for he cou'd
not drink; and he is but an ill Companion in
that Countrey that cannot: So that obliging
him to love us very well, we had all the liberty
of Speech with him, eſpecially my ſelf, whom
he calld his <hi>Great Miſtreſs;</hi> and, indeed, my
Word wou'd go a great way with him. For
theſe Reaſons, I had opportunity to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to him, that he was not well pleas'd of
late, as he us'd to be; was more retir'd and
thoughtful; and told him, I took it ill he
ſhou'd Suſpect we wou'd break our Words with
him, and not permit both him and <hi>Clemene</hi> to
return to his own Kingdom, which was not ſo
long a way, but, when he was once on his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47213:67"/>
he wou'd quickly arrive there. He made
me ſome Anſwers that ſhew'd a doubt in him,
which made me ask what advantage it wou'd
be to doubt? it would but give us a Fear of
him, and poſſibly compel us to treat him ſo as I
ſhou'd be very loath to behold: that is, it might
occaſion his Confinement. Perhaps this was
not ſo luckily ſpoke of me, for I perceiv'd he
reſented that Word, which I ſtrove to ſoften
again in vain: However, he aſſur'd me, that
whatſoever Reſolutions he ſhou'd take, he wou'd
Act nothing upon the White-People; and as for
my ſelf, and thoſe upon that <hi>Plantation</hi> where
he was, he wou'd ſooner forfeit his eternal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and Life it ſelf, than lift his Hand againſt
his greateſt Enemy on that Place: He beſought
me to ſuffer no Fears upon his Account, for he
cou'd do nothing that Honour ſhou'd not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate;
but he accus'd himſelf for having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
Slavery ſo long; yet he charg'd that
weakneſs on Love alone, who was capable of
making him neglect even Glory it ſelf; and,
for which, now he reproaches himſelf every
moment of the Day. Much more to this effect
he ſpoke, with an Air impatient enough to
make me know he wou'd not be long in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage;
and though he ſuffer'd only the Name
of a Slave, and had nothing of the Toil and
Labour of one, yet that was ſufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him Uneaſie; and he had been too long
Idle, who us'd to be always in Action, and in
Arms: He had a Spirit all Rough and Fierce,
and that cou'd not be tam'd to lazy Reſt;
and though all endeavours were us'd to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
himſelf in ſuch Actions and Sports as this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47213:67"/>
World afforded, as Running, Wreſtling, Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Bar; Hunting and Fiſhing, Chaſing and
Killing <hi>Tigers</hi> of a monſtrous Size, which this
Continent affords in abundance; and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Snakes,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Alexander</hi> is reported to have
incounter'd at the River of <hi>Amazons,</hi> and which
<hi>Caeſar</hi> took great Delight to overcome; yet
theſe were not Actions great enough for his
large Soul, which was ſtill panting after more
renown'd Action.</p>
                  <p>Before I parted that Day with him, I got, with
much ado, a Promiſe from him to reſt yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
longer with Patience, and wait the coming of
the Lord Governor, who was every Day expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
on our Shore; he aſſur'd me he wou'd, and
this Promiſe he deſired me to know was given
perfectly in Complaiſance to me, in whom he
had an intire Confidence.</p>
                  <p>After this, I neither thought it convenient
to truſt him much out of our View, nor did
the Country who fear'd him; but with one
accord it was advis'd to treat him fairly, and
oblige him to remain within ſuch a compaſs, and
that he ſhou'd be permitted, as ſeldom as cou'd
be, to go up to the Plantations of the Negroes;
or, if he did, to be accompany'd by ſome that
ſhou'd be rather in appearance Attendants than
Spys. This Care was for ſome time taken, and
<hi>Caeſar</hi> look'd upon it as a Mark of extraordinary
Reſpect, and was glad his diſcontent had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
'em to be more obſervant to him; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
new aſſurance from the Overſeer, which
was confirmed to him by the Opinion of all the
Gentlemen of the Country, who made their
court to him: During this time that we had
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47213:68"/>
his Company more frequently than hitherto we
had had, it may not be unpleaſant to relate to
you the Diverſions we entertaind'd him with,
or rather he us.</p>
                  <p>My ſtay was to be ſhort in that Countrey;
becauſe my Father dy'd at Sea, and never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to poſſeſs the Honour was deſign'd him,
(which was Lieutenant-General of Six and
thirty Iſlands, beſides the Continent of <hi>Suri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi>)
nor the Advantages he hop'd to reap by
them: ſo that though we were oblig'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
on our Voyage, we did not intend to ſtay
upon the Place. Though, in a word, I muſt
ſay thus much of it; That certainly, had his late
Majeſty, of ſacred Memory, but ſeen and known
what a vaſt and charming World he had been
Maſter of in that Continent, he wou'd never
have parted ſo eaſily with it to the <hi>Dutch.</hi> 'Tis
a Continent whoſe vaſt Extent was never yet
known, and may contain more Noble Earth than
all the Univerſe beſide; for, they ſay, it reaches
from Eaſt to Weſt one way as far as <hi>China,</hi> and
another to <hi>Peru:</hi> It affords all things both for
Beauty and Uſe; 'tis there Eternal Spring, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the very Months of <hi>April, May</hi> and <hi>June;</hi>
the Shades are perpetual, the Trees bearing at
once all degrees of Leaves and Fruit, from
blooming Buds to ripe Autumn: Groves of
Oranges, Limons, Citrons, Figs, Nutmegs, and
noble Aromaticks, continually bearing their
Fragrancies. The Trees appearing all like Noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gays
adorn'd with Flowers of different kinds;
ſome are all White, ſome Purple, ſome Scarlet,
ſome Blue, ſome Yellow; bearing, at the ſame
time, Ripe Fruit and Blooming Young, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47213:68"/>
every day new. The very Wood of
all theſe Trees have an intrinſick Value above
common Timber; for they are, when cut, of
different Colours, glorious to behold; and bear
a price conſiderable, to Inlay withal. Beſides
this, they yield rich Balm, and Gums; ſo that
we make our Candles of ſuch an Aromatick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
as does not only give a ſufficient Light,
but, as they burn, they caſt their Perfumes all
about. Cedar is the common Firing, and all
the Houſes are built with it. The very Meat
we eat, when ſet on the Table, if it be Native,
I mean, of the Countrey, perfumes the whole
Room; eſpecially a little Beaſt call'd an <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilly,</hi>
a thing which I can liken to nothing ſo
well as a <hi>Rhinoceros;</hi> 'tis all in white Armour, ſo
jointed, that it moves as well in it, as if it had
nothing on; this Beaſt is about the bigneſs of
a Pig of ſix Weeks old. But it were endleſs to
give an Account of all the divers Wonderful
and Strange things that Countrey affords, and
which we took a very great delight to go in
ſearch of; though thoſe Adventures are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Fatal, and at leaſt Dangerous: But while
we had <hi>Caeſar</hi> in our Company on theſe Deſigns,
we fear'd no harm, nor ſuffer'd any.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I came into the Countrey, the beſt
Houſe in it was preſented me, call'd <hi>St. John's
Hill:</hi> It ſtood on a vaſt Rock of white Marble,
at the foot of which the River ran a vaſt depth
down, and not to be deſcended on that ſide;
the little Waves ſtill daſhing and waſhing the
foot of this Rock, made the ſofteſt Murmurs
and Purlings in the World; and the oppoſite
Bank was adorn'd with ſuch vaſt quantities of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47213:69"/>
different Flowers eternally Blowing, and every
Day and Hour new, fenc'd behind 'em with
lofty Trees of a thouſand rare Forms and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
that the Proſpect was the moſt raviſhing
that Sands can create. On the edge of this
white Rock, towards the River, was a Walk
or Grove of Orange and Limon-Trees, about
half the length of the <hi>Mall</hi> here, whoſe Flowery
and Fruit-bearing Branches met at the top, and
hinder'd the Sun, whoſe Rays are very fierce
there, from entering a Beam into the Grove;
and the cool Air that came from the River,
made it not only fit to entertain People in, at
all the hotteſt hours of the day, but refreſh'd
the ſweet Bloſſoms, and made it always Sweet
and Charming; and ſure, the whole Globe of
the World cannot ſhew ſo delightful a Place as
this Grove was: Not all the Gardens of boaſted
<hi>Italy</hi> can produce a Shade to out-vie this, which
Nature had join'd with Art to render ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
fine; and 'tis a marvel to ſee how ſuch
vaſt Trees, as big as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Oaks, cou'd take
footing on ſo ſolid a Rock, and in ſo little Earth
as cover'd that Rock: But all things by Nature
there are Rare, Delightful and Wonderful.
But to our Sports.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we wou'd go ſurpriſing, and in
ſearch of young <hi>Tigers</hi> in their Dens, watching
when the old ones went forth to forage for
Prey; and oftentimes we have been in great
danger, and have fled a-pace for our Lives,
when ſurpriz'd by the Dams. But once, above
all other times, we went on this Deſign, and
<hi>Caeſar</hi> was with us; who had no ſooner ſtoln
a young <hi>Tiger</hi> from her Neſt, but going off,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47213:69"/>
we encounter'd the Dam, bearing a Buttock
of a Cow, which he had torn off with his
mighty Paw, and going with it towards his
Den; we had only four Women, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, Brother to <hi>Harry Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
the great <hi>Oliverian;</hi> we found there was
no eſcaping this enraged and ravenous Beaſt.
However, we Women fled as faſt as we cou'd
from it; but our Heels had not ſaved our Lives,
if <hi>Caeſar</hi> had not laid down his <hi>Cub,</hi> when he
found the <hi>Tiger</hi> quit her Prey to make the
more ſpeed towards him; and taking Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>'s
Sword, deſir'd him to ſtand aſide, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Ladies. He obey'd him; and <hi>Caeſar</hi>
met this monſtrous Beaſt of might, ſize, and
vaſt Limbs, who came with open Jaws upon
him; and fixing his awful ſtern Eyes full upon
thoſe of the Beaſt, and putting himſelf into a
very ſteddy and good aiming poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
ran his Sword quite through his Breaſt
down to his very Heart, home to the Hilt of
the Sword: the dying Beaſt ſtretch'd forth her
Paw, and going to graſp his Thigh, ſurpriz'd
with death in that very moment, did him no
other harm than fixing her long Nails in his
Fleſh very deep, feebly wounded him, but
cou'd not graſp the Fleſh to tear off any.
When he had done this, he hollow'd to us
to return: which, after ſome aſſurance of his
Victory, we did, and found him lugging out
the Sword from the Boſom of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> who
was laid in her blood on the ground; he took
up the <hi>Cub,</hi> and with an Unconcern that had
nothing of the Joy or Gladneſs of a Victory,
he came and laid the Whelp at my Feet. We
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47213:70"/>
all extremely wonder'd at his Daring, and at
the Bigneſs of the Beaſt, which was about the
heighth of an Heifer, but of mighty great and
ſtrong Limbs.</p>
                  <p>Another time, being in the Woods, he kill'd
a <hi>Tiger</hi> which had long infeſted that Part, and
borne away abundance of Sheep and Oxen, and
other things that were for the ſupport of thoſe
to whom they belong'd: abundance of People
aſſail'd this Beaſt, ſome affirming they had ſhot
her with ſeveral Bullets quite through the
Body, at ſeveral times; and ſome ſwearing they
ſhot her through the very Heart, and they
believ'd ſhe was a Devil, rather than a mortal
thing. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had often ſaid, he had a mind
to encounter this Monſter, and ſpoke with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Gentlemen who had attempted her; one
crying, I ſhot her with ſo many poyſon'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
another with his Gun in this part of
her, and another in that; ſo that he remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all theſe places where ſhe was ſhot, fancy'd
ſtill he ſhou'd overcome her, by giving her ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort of a Wound than any had yet done,
and one day ſaid (at the Table,) <hi>What Trophies
and Garlands, Ladies, will you make me, if I bring
you home the Heart of this Ravenous Beast, that
eats up all your Lambs and Pigs?</hi> We all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
he ſhou'd be rewarded at all our hands.
So taking a Bow, which he choſe out of a
great many, he went up into the Wood, with
two Gentlemen, where he imagin'd this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer
to be; they had not paſt very far in
it, but they heard her Voice, growling and
grumbling, as if ſhe were pleas'd with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhe was doing. When they came in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47213:70"/>
view, they found her muzzling in the Belly
of a new raviſh'd Sheep, which ſhe had torn
open; and ſeeing her ſelf approach'd, ſhe took
faſt hold of her Prey with her fore Paws, and
ſet a very fierce raging Look on <hi>Caeſar,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offering to approach him, for fear at the
ſame time of loſing what ſhe had in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
So that <hi>Caeſar</hi> remain'd a good while,
only taking aim, and getting an opportunity to
ſhoot her where he deſign'd: 'twas ſome time
before he cou'd accompliſh it; and to wound
her, and not kill her, wou'd but have enrag'd
her the more, and endanger'd him: He had a
Quiver of Arrows at his Side, ſo that if one fail'd,
he could be ſupply'd; at laſt, retiring a little,
he gave her opportunity to eat; for he found
ſhe was ravenous, and fell too as ſoon as ſhe
ſaw him retire, being more eager of her Prey,
than of doing new Miſchiefs: when he going
ſoftly to one ſide of her, and hiding his Perſon
behind certain Herbage that grew high and
thick, he took ſo good aim, that, as he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he ſhot her juſt into the Eye, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
was ſent with ſo good a will, and ſo ſure
a hand, that it ſtuck in her Brain, and made
her caper, and become mad for a moment or
two; but being ſeconded by another Arrow,
ſhe fell dead upon the Prey. <hi>Caeſar</hi> cut her
open with a Knife, to ſee where thoſe Wounds
were that had been reported to him, and why
ſhe did not die of 'em. But I ſhall now relate
a thing that, poſſibly, will find no credit among
Men; becauſe 'tis a Notion commonly receiv'd
with us, That nothing can receive a Wound
in the Heart and live: But when the Heart of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47213:71"/>
this courageous Animal was taken out, there
were ſeven Bullets of Lead in it, and the
Wounds ſeam'd up with great Scars, and ſhe
liv'd with the Bullets a great while, for it was
long ſince they were ſhot: This Heart the
Conqueror brought up to us, and 'twas a very
great Curioſity, which all the Countrey came
to ſee; and which gave <hi>Caeſar</hi> occaſion of many
fine Diſcourſes; of Accidents in War, and
ſtrange Eſcapes.</p>
                  <p>At other times he wou'd go a Fiſhing; and
diſcourſing on that Diverſion, he found we had
in that Countrey a very ſtrange Fiſh, call'd a
<hi>Numb Eel</hi> (an <hi>Eel</hi> of which I have eaten) that
while it is aliye, it has a quality ſo Cold, that
thoſe who are Angling, though with a Line of
never ſo great a length, with a Rod at the end
of it, it ſhall, in the ſame minute the Bait is
touched by this <hi>Eel,</hi> ſeize him or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her that holds
the Rod with benumb'dneſs, that ſhall deprive
'em of Senſe, for a while; and ſome have faln
into the Water, and others drop'd, as dead, on
the Banks of the Rivers where they ſtood, as
ſoon as this Fiſh touches the Bait. <hi>Caeſar</hi> us'd
to laugh at this, and believ'd it impoſſible a
Man cou'd loſe his Force at the touch of a
Fiſh; and cou'd not underſtand that Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
that a Cold Quality ſhould be of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
however, he had a great Curioſity to
try whether it wou'd have the ſame effect on
him it had on others, and often try'd, but in
vain: at laſt, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ought-for Fiſh came to the
Bait, as he ſtood Angling on the Bank; and
inſtead of throwing away the Rod, or giving
it a ſudden twitch out of the Water, whereby
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47213:71"/>
he might have caught both the <hi>Eel,</hi> and have
diſmiſs'd the Rod, before it cou'd have too
much power over him; for Experiment-ſake,
he graſp'd it but the harder, and fainting fell
into the River; and being ſtill poſſeſs'd of the
Rod, the Tide carry'd him, ſenſeleſs as he was,
a great way, till an <hi>Indian</hi> Boat took him up;
and perceiv'd, when they touch'd him, a Numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſeize them, and by that knew the Rod was
in his Hand; which, with a Paddle, (that is,
a ſhort Oar) they ſtruck away, and ſnacht
it into the Boat, <hi>Eel</hi> and all. If <hi>Caeſar</hi> was
almoſt dead, with the effect of this Fiſh, he
was more ſo with that of the Water, where he
had remain'd the ſpace of going a League, and
they found they had much a-doe to bring him
back to life; but at laſt they did, and brought
him home, where he was in a few hours well
recover'd and refreſh'd, and not a little aſham'd
to find he ſhou'd be overcome by an <hi>Eel,</hi> and
that all the People, who heard his Defiance,
wou'd laugh at him. But we chear'd him up;
and he, being convinc'd, we had the <hi>Eel</hi> at
Supper, which was a Quarter of an Ell about,
and moſt delicate Meat; and was of the more
value, ſince it coſt ſo dear as almoſt the Life of
ſo gallant a Man.</p>
                  <p>About this time we were in many mortal
Fears, about ſome Diſputes the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had
with the <hi>Indians;</hi> ſo that we cou'd ſcarce truſt
our ſelves, without great Numbers, to go to
any <hi>Indian</hi> Towns or Place where they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode,
for fear they ſhou'd fall upon us, as they
did immediately after my coming away; and
that it was in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47213:72"/>
us'd 'em not ſo civilly as the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> ſo that
they cut in pieces all they cou'd take, getting
into Houſes, and hanging up the Mother, and
all her Children about her; and cut a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
I left behind me, all in Joints, and nail'd
him to Trees.</p>
                  <p>This Feud began while I was there; ſo that
I loſt half the Satisfaction I propos'd, in not
ſeeing and viſiting the <hi>Indian</hi> Towns. But one
day, bemoaning of our Misfortunes upon this
account, <hi>Caeſar</hi> told us, we need not fear; for
if we had a mind to go, he wou'd undertake
to be our Guard. Some wou'd, but moſt wou'd
not venture: about Eighteen of us reſolv'd, and
took Barge; and after eight days, arriv'd near
an <hi>Indian</hi> Town: But approaching it, the
Hearts of ſome of our Company fail'd, and
they wou'd not venture on Shore; ſo we Poll'd
who wou'd, and who wou'd not. For my
part, I ſaid, If <hi>Caeſar</hi> wou'd, I wou'd go. He
reſolv'd; ſo did my Brother, and my Woman,
a Maid of good Courage. Now, none of us
ſpeaking the Language of the People, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
we ſhou'd have a half Diverſion in Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
only; and not knowing what they ſaid,
we took a Fiſherman that liv'd at the mouth of
the River, who had been a long Inhabitant there,
and oblig'd him to go with us: But becauſe he
was known to the <hi>Indians,</hi> as trading among 'em,
and being, by long living there, become a perfect
in <hi>Indian</hi> Colour, we, who reſolv'd to ſurprize
'em, by making them ſee ſomething they never
had ſeen, (that is, <hi>White</hi> People) reſolv'd only my
ſelf, my Brother and Woman ſhou'd go; ſo <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
the Fiſherman, and the reſt, hiding behind
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47213:72"/>
ſome thick Reeds and Flowers that grew on
the Banks, let us paſs on towards the Town,
which was on the Bank of the River all along.
A little diſtant from the Houſes, or Huts, we
ſaw ſome Dancing, others buſy'd in fetching
and carrying of Water from the River: They
had no ſooner ſpy'd us, but they ſet up a loud
Cry, that frighted us at firſt; we thought it had
been for thoſe that ſhou'd kill us, but it ſeems
it was of Wonder and Amazement. They were
all Naked; and we were Dreſs'd, ſo as is moſt
commode for the hot Countries, very Glittering
and Rich; ſo that we appear'd extremely fine;
my own Hair was cut ſhort, and I had a Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faty
Cap, with Black Feathers, on my Head;
my Brother was in a Stuff Sute, with Silver
Loops and Buttons, and abundance of Green
Ribbon: This was all infinitely ſurpriſing to
them; and becauſe we ſaw them ſtand ſtill till
we approach'd 'em, we took heart and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd,
came up to 'em, and offer'd 'em our
Hands; which they took, and look'd on us round
about, calling ſtill for more Company; who
came ſwarming out, all wondering, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out <hi>Tepeeme;</hi> taking their Hair up in their
Hands, and ſpreading it wide to thoſe they
call'd out to; as if they wou'd ſay (as indeed
it ſignify'd) <hi>Numberleſs Wonders,</hi> or not to be
recounted, no more than to number the Hair
of their Heads. By degrees they grew more
bold, and from gazing upon us round, they
touch'd us, laying their Hands upon all the
Features of our Faces, feeling our Breaſts and
Arms, taking up one Petticoat, then wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſee another; admiring our Shooes and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47213:73"/>
Stockings, but more our Garters, which we
gave 'em, and they ty'd about their Legs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lac'd with Silver Lace at the ends; for they
much eſteem any ſhining things: In fine, we
ſuffer'd 'em to ſurvey us as they pleas'd, and
we thought they wou'd never have done ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
us. When <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the reſt, ſaw we
were receiv'd with ſuch wonder, they came
up to us; and finding the <hi>Indian</hi> Trader whom
they knew, (for 'tis by theſe Fiſhermen, call'd
<hi>Indian</hi> Traders, we hold a Commerce with 'em;
for they love not to go far from home, and we
never go to them;) when they ſaw him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they ſet up a new Joy, and cry'd, in their
language, <hi>Oh! here's our</hi> Tiguamy, <hi>and we ſhall
now know whether thoſe things can ſpeak:</hi> So advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to him, ſome of 'em gave 'em their Hands,
and cry'd, <hi>Amora Tiguamy;</hi> which is as much as,
<hi>How do you;</hi> or, <hi>Welcome, Friend:</hi> and all, with
one din, began to gabble to him, and ask'd, if we
had Senſe and Wit? if we could talk of Affairs
of Life and War, as they cou'd do? if we cou'd
Hunt, Swim, and do a thouſand things they uſe?
He anſwer'd 'em, We cou'd. Then they invited
us into their Houſes, and dreſs'd Veniſon and
<hi>Buffelo</hi> for us; and, going out, gather'd a Leaf
of a Tree, call'd a <hi>Sarumbo</hi> Leaf, of ſix Yards
long, and ſpread it on the Ground for a Table-Cloth;
and cutting another in pieces, inſtead of
Plates, ſetting us on little bow <hi>Indian</hi> Stools,
which they cut out of one entire piece of Wood,
and paint in a ſort of Japan-work: They
ſerve every one their Meſs on theſe pieces of
Leaves; and it was very good, but too high
ſeaſon'd with Pepper. When we had eat, my
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47213:73"/>
Brother and I took out our Flutes, and play'd
to 'em, which gave 'em new Wonder; and I
ſoon perceiv'd, by an Admiration that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to theſe People, and by the extreme Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Simplicity of 'em, it were not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to eſtabliſh any unknown or extravagaut
Religion among them, and to impoſe any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Fictions upon 'em. For ſeeing a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of mine ſet ſome Paper a fire with a Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs,
a Trick they had never before ſeen,
they were like to have ador'd him for a God,
and begg'd he wou'd give 'em the Characters
or Figures of his Name, that they might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it againſt Winds and Storms: which he
did, and they held it up in thoſe Seaſons, and
fancy'd it had a Charm to conquer them, and
kept it like a holy Relique. They are very
Superſtitious, and call'd him the Great <hi>Peeie,</hi>
that is, <hi>Prophet.</hi> They ſhew'd us their <hi>Indian
Peeie,</hi> a Youth of about Sixteen Years old, as
handſom as Nature cou'd make a Man. They
conſecrate a beautiful Youth from his Infancy,
and all Arts are uſed to compleat him in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
manner, both in Beauty and Shape: He
is bred to all the little Arts and Cunning they
are capable of; to all the Legerdemain Tricks,
and Slight of Hand, whereby he impoſes upon
the Rabble; and is both a Doctor in Phyſick
and Divinity: And by theſe Tricks makes the
Sick believe he ſometimes eaſes their Pains, by
drawing from the afflicted part little Serpents,
or odd Flies, or Worms, or any ſtrange thing;
and though they have beſides undoubted good
Remedies for almoſt all their Diſeaſes, they
cure the Patient more by Fancy than by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47213:74"/>
and make themſelves Fear'd, Lov'd,
and Reverenc'd. This young <hi>Peeie</hi> had a
very young Wife, who ſeeing my Brother kiſs
her, came running and kiſs'd me: after this
they kiſs'd one another, and made it a very
great Jeſt, it being ſo novel; and new<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Laughing went round the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
that they never will forget that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
never before us'd or known. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had
a mind to ſee and talk with their War-<hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
and we were conducted to one of their
Houſes; where we beheld ſeveral of the great
<hi>Captains,</hi> who had been at Council: But ſo
frightful a Viſion it was to ſee 'em no Fancy
can create; no ſad Dreams can repreſent ſo
dreadful a Spectacle. For my part, I took 'em
for Hobgoblins, or Fiends, rather than Men:
but however their Shapes appear'd, their Souls
were very Humane and Noble; but ſome wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Noſes, ſome their Lips, ſome both
Noſes and Lips, ſome their Ears, and others
cut through each Cheek, with long Slaſhes,
through which their Teeth appear'd: they had
other ſeveral formidable Wounds and Scars,
or rather Diſmembrings: they had <hi>Comitia's,</hi>
or little Aprons before 'em; and Girdles of
Cotton, with their Knives naked ſtuck in it;
a Bow at their Backs, and a Quiver of Arrows
on their Thighs; and moſt had Feathers on
their Heads of divers Colours. They cry'd
<hi>Amora Tigame</hi> to us, at our entrance, and were
pleas'd we ſaid as much to them: They ſeated
us, and gave us Drink of the beſt ſort, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
as much as the others had done before,
to ſee us. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was marvelling as much at
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47213:74"/>
their Faces, wondring how they ſhou'd all
be ſo wounded in War; he was impatient to
know how they all came by thoſe frightful
Marks of Rage or Malice, rather than Wounds
got in noble Battle: They told us, by our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,
That when any War was waging,
two Men, choſen out by ſome old <hi>Captain</hi> whoſe
Fighting was paſt, and who cou'd only teach
the Theory of War, theſe two Men were to
ſtand in competition for the Generalſhip, or
Great War-Captain; and being brought before
the old Judges, now paſt Labour, they are ask'd,
What they dare do, to ſhew they are worthy to
lead an Army? When he who is firſt ask'd,
making no Reply, cuts off his Noſe, and throws
it contemptibly on the Ground; and the other
does ſomething to himſelf that he thinks ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
him, and perhaps deprives himſelf of
Lips and an Eye; ſo they Slaſh on till one gives
out, and many have dy'd in this Debate. And
it's by a paſſive Valour they ſhew and prove their
Activity; a ſort of Courage too Brutal to be
applauded by our <hi>Black</hi> Hero; nevertheleſs, he
expreſs'd his Eſteem of 'em.</p>
                  <p>In this Voyage <hi>Caeſar</hi> begot ſo good an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
between the <hi>Indians</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
that there were no more Fears or Heart-burnings
during our ſtay, but we had a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
open, and free Trade with 'em. Many
things remarkable, and worthy reciting, we
met with in this ſhort Voyage; becauſe <hi>Caeſar</hi>
made it his buſineſs to ſearch out and provide
for our Entertainment, eſpecially to pleaſe his
dearly ador'd <hi>Imoinda,</hi> who was a Sharer in
all our Adventures; we being reſolv'd to make
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47213:75"/>
her Chains as eaſie as we cou'd, and to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
the Prince in that manner that moſt
oblig'd him.</p>
                  <p>As we were coming up again, we met with
ſome <hi>Indians</hi> of ſtrange Aſpects; that is, of a
larger Size, and other ſort of Features, than
thoſe of our Countrey: Our <hi>Indian Slaves,</hi> that
row'd us, ask'd 'em ſome Queſtions; but they
cou'd not underſtand us, but ſhew'd us a long
Cotton String, with ſeveral Knots on it, and
told us, they had been coming from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
ſo many Moons as there were Knots; they
were habited in Skins of a ſtrange Beaſt, and
brought along with 'em Bags of Gold Duſt;
which, as well as they cou'd give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
came ſtreaming in little ſmall Chanels
down the high Mountains, when the Rains fell;
and offer'd to be the Convoy to any Body, or
Perſons, that wou'd go to the Mountains. We
carry'd theſe Men up to <hi>Parham,</hi> where they were
kept till the Lord-Governor came: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all the Country was mad to be going on
this Golden Adventure, the Governor, by his
Letters, commanded (for they ſent ſome of the
Gold to him) that a Guard ſhou'd be ſet at the
mouth of the River of <hi>Amazons</hi> (a River ſo call'd,
almoſt as broad as the River of <hi>Thames</hi>) and
prohibited all People from going up that River,
it conducting to thoſe Mountains of Gold. But
we going off for <hi>England</hi> before the Project was
further proſecuted, and the Governor being
drown'd in a Hurricane, either the Deſign dy'd,
or the <hi>Dutch</hi> have the Advantage of it: And 'tis
to be bemoan'd what His Majeſty loſt, by loſing
that part of <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:47213:75"/>
Though this Digreſſion is a little from my
Story; however, ſince it contains ſome Proofs
of the Curioſity and Daring of this Great Man,
I was content to omit nothing of his Character.</p>
                  <p>It was thus for ſome time we diverted him;
but now <hi>Imoinda</hi> began to ſhew ſhe was with
Child, and did nothing but ſigh and weep for
the Captivity of her Lord, her ſelf, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
yet unborn; and believ'd, if it were ſo
hard to gain the Liberty of Two, 'twou'd be
more difficult to get that for Three. Her Griefs
were ſo many Darts in the great Heart of <hi>Caeſar;</hi>
and taking his Opportunity, one <hi>Sunday,</hi> when
all the <hi>Whites</hi> were overtaken in Drink, as there
were abundance of ſeveral Trades, and <hi>Slaves</hi>
for Four Years, that inhabited among the <hi>Negro</hi>
Houſes; and <hi>Sunday</hi> was their Day of Debauch,
(otherwiſe they were a ſort of Spies upon <hi>Caeſar,</hi>)
he went, pretending out of goodneſs to 'em, to
Feaſt among 'em, and ſent all his Muſick, and
order'd a great Treat for the whole Gang, about
Three hundred <hi>Negroes,</hi> and about an Hundred
and fifty were able to bear Arms, ſuch as they
had, which were ſufficient to do execution with
Spirits accordingly: For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had none
but ruſty Swords, that no ſtrength cou'd draw
from a Scabbard; except the People of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Quality, who took care to oil 'em, and keep
'em in good order: The Guns alſo, unleſs here
and there one, or thoſe newly carry'd from
<hi>England,</hi> wou'd do no good or harm; for 'tis
the Nature of that Countrey to ruſt and eat up
Iron, or any Metals but Gold and Silver. And
they are very unexpert at the Bow, which the
<hi>Negroes</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> are perfect Maſters of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:47213:76"/>
                     <hi>Caeſar,</hi> having ſingl'd out theſe Men from
the Women and Children, made an Harangue
to 'em, of the Miſeries and Ignominies of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
counting up all their Toils and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
under ſuch Loads, Burdens and Drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as were fitter for Beaſts than Men; Senſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Brutes, than Humane Souls. He told 'em,
it was not for Days, Months or Years, but
for Eternity; there was no end to be of their
Misfortunes: They ſuffer'd not like Men who
might find a Glory and Fortitude in Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
but like Dogs that lov'd the Whip and
Bell, and fawn'd the more they were beaten:
That they had loſt the Divine Quality of Men,
and were become inſenſible Aſſes, fit only to
bear: nay, worſe; an Aſs, or Dog, or Horſe,
having done his Duty, cou'd lie down in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
and riſe to work again, and while he
did his Duty, indur'd no Stripes; but Men,
Villainous, Senſeleſs Men, ſuch as they, Toil'd
on all the tedious Week till <hi>Black Friday;</hi> and
then, whether they work'd or not, whether
they were faulty or meriting, they, promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly,
the Innocent with the Guilty, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
the infamous Whip, the ſordid Stripes,
from their fellow <hi>Slaves,</hi> till their Blood
trickl'd from all Parts of their Body; Blood,
whoſe every drop ought to be reveng'd with
a Life of ſome of thoſe Tyrants that impoſe it:
<hi>And why</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>my dear Friends and Fellow-ſufferers,
ſhou'd we be Slaves to an unknown
People! Have they Vanquiſh'd us Nobly in Fight?
Have they Won us in Honourable Battle? And
are we, by the chance of War, become their Slaves?
This wou'd not anger a Noble Heart; this wou'd
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47213:76"/>
not animate a Soldier's Soul; no, but we are Bought
and Sold like Apes, or Monkeys, to be the Sport of
Women, Fools and Cowards; and the Support of
Rogues, Runagades, that have abandon'd their own
Countries for Rapine, Murders, Theft and Villanies:
Do you not hear, every day, how they upbraid each other
with Infamy of Life, below the Wildeſt Salvages?
and ſhall we render Obedience to ſuch a degenerate
Race, who have no one Humane Vertue left, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
'em from the vileſt Creatures? Will you, I ſay,
ſuffer the Laſh from ſuch Hands?</hi> They all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
with one accord, <hi>No, No, No;</hi> Caeſar <hi>has
ſpoke like a Great Captain; like a Great King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After this, he wou'd have proceeded, but was
interrupted by a tall</hi> Negro <hi>of ſome more Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
than the reſt, his Name was</hi> Tuſcan; <hi>who
bowing at the Feet of</hi> Caeſar, <hi>cry'd,</hi> My Lord,
we have liſten'd with Joy and Attention to what you
have ſaid; and, were we only Men, wou'd follow ſo
great a Leader through the World: But oh! conſider
we are Husbands, and Parents too, and have things
more dear to us than Life, our Wives and Children,
unfit for Travel in theſe unpaſſable Woods, Mountains
and Bogs; we have not only difficult Lands to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
but Rivers to wade, and Mountains to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter;
Ravenous Beaſts of Prey—<hi>To
this,</hi> Caeſar <hi>reply'd,</hi> That Honour was the Firſt
Principle in Nature, that was to be Obey'd: but as
no Man wou'd pretend to that, without all the Acts
of Vertue, Compaſſion, Charity, Love, Juſtice and
Reaſon; he found it not inconſiſtent with that, to
take an equal care of their Wives and Children, as
they wou'd of themſelves; and that he did not deſign,
when he led them to Freedom, and Glorious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
that they ſhou'd leave that better part of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47213:77"/>
to periſh by the Hand of the Tyrant's Whip:
But if there were a Woman among them ſo degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from Love and Vertue, to chuſe Slavery before
the purſuit of her Husband, and with the hazard of
her Life, to ſhare with him in his Fortunes; that
ſuch an one ought to be abandon'd, and left as a
Prey to the Common Enemy.</p>
                  <p>To which they all Agreed,—and Bowed.
After this, he ſpoke of the impaſſable Woods
and Rivers; and convinc'd 'em, the more Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
the more Glory. He told them, that he had
heard of one <hi>Hannibal</hi> a great Captain, had cut
his way through Mountains of ſolid Rocks;
and ſhou'd a few Shrubs oppoſe them, which
they cou'd fire before 'em? No, 'twas a trifling
Excuſe to Men reſolv'd to die, or overcome.
As for Bogs, they are with a little Labour fill'd
and harden'd; and the Rivers cou'd be no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle,
ſince they ſwam by Nature, at leaſt, by
Cuſtom, from the firſt hour of their birth:
That when the Children were weary, they muſt
carry them by turns, and the Woods and their
own Induſtry wou'd afford them Food. To
this they all aſſented with Joy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tuſcan</hi> then demanded, what he wou'd do?
He ſaid they wou'd Travel towards the Sea,
Plant a New Colony, and Defend it by their
Valour; and when they cou'd find a Ship, either
driven by ſtreſs of Weather, or guided by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that way, they wou'd ſeize it, and
make it a Prize, till it had tranſported them to
their own Countries; at leaſt, they ſhou'd be
made Free in his Kingdom, and be eſteem'd as
his Fellow-ſufferers, and Men that had the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and the Bravery to attempt, at leaſt, for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47213:77"/>
Liberty; and if they dy'd in the attempt, it
wou'd be more brave, than to live in perpetual
Slavery.</p>
                  <p>They bow'd and kiſs'd his Feet at this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and with one accord Vow'd to follow
him to Death. And that Night was appointed
to begin their March, they made it known to
their Wives, and directed them to tie their
Hamaca about their Shoulders, and under their
Arm, like a Scarf; and to lead their Children
that cou'd go, and carry thoſe that cou'd not.
The Wives, who pay an entire Obedience to
their Husbands, obey'd, and ſtay'd for 'em where
they were appointed: The Men ſtay'd but to
furniſh themſelves with what defenſive Arms
they cou'd get; and All met at the Rendezvous,
where <hi>Caeſar</hi> made a new encouraging Speech to
'em, and led 'em out.</p>
                  <p>But as they cou'd not march far that Night,
on <hi>Monday</hi> early, when the Overſeers went to
call 'em all together, to go to work, they
were extremely ſurpriz'd, to find not one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Place, but all fled with what Baggage
they had. You may imagine this News was
not only ſuddenly ſpread all over the <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but ſoon reach'd the neighbouring ones;
and we had by Noon about Six hundred Men
they call the Militia of the Country, that came
to aſſiſt us in the purſuit of the Fugitives:
But never did one ſee ſo comical an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
march forth to War. The Men of any
Faſhion wou'd not concern themſelves, though
it were almoſt the Common Cauſe; for ſuch
Revoltings are very ill Examples, and have
very fatal Conſequences, often-times, in many
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47213:78"/>
Colonies: But they had a Reſpect for <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
and all hands were againſt the <hi>Parhamites</hi> (as
they call'd thoſe of <hi>Parham Plantation;</hi>) becauſe
they did not, in the firſt place, love the Lord-Governor;
and, ſecondly, they wou'd have
it, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ill us'd, and Baffl'd with;
and 'tis not impoſſible but ſome of the beſt in
the Countrey was of his Council in this Flight,
and depriving us of all the <hi>Slaves:</hi> ſo that
they of the better ſort wou'd not meddle in
the matter. The Deputy-Governor, of whom
I have had no great occaſion to ſpeak, and
who was the moſt fawning fair-Tongu'd Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in the World, and one that pretended the
moſt Friendſhip to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was now the only
violent Man againſt him; and though he had
nothing, and ſo need fear nothing, yet talk'd
and look'd bigger than any Man: He was a
Fellow, whoſe Character is not fit to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
with the worſt of the <hi>Slaves.</hi> This Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
wou'd lead his Army forth to meet <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
or rather to purſue him: moſt of their Arms
were of thoſe ſort of cruel Whips they call
<hi>Cat-with Nine-Tails;</hi> ſome had ruſty uſeleſs
Guns for ſhew; others old Basket-hilts, whoſe
Blades had never ſeen the Light in this Age; and
others had long Staffs and Clubs. Mr. <hi>Trefry</hi>
went along<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather to be a Mediator than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
in ſuch a Battle; for he foreſaw, and
knew, if by fighting they put the <hi>Negroes</hi> into
deſpair, they were a ſort of ſullen Fellows, that
wou'd drown or kill themſelves, before they
wou'd yield; and he advis'd, that fair means was
beſt: But <hi>Byam</hi> was one that abounded in his
own Wit, and wou'd take his own Meaſures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:47213:78"/>
It was not hard to find theſe Fugitives; for
as they fled, they were forc'd to fire and cut
the Woods before 'em; ſo that Night or Day
they purſu'd 'em by the Light they made, and
by the Path they had clear'd. But as ſoon as
<hi>Caeſar</hi> found he was purſu'd, he put himſelf in
a poſture of Defence, placing all the Women
and Children in the Rear; and himſelf, with
<hi>Tuſcan</hi> by his ſide, or next to him, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
to Die or Conquer. Encourag'd thus,
they never ſtood to Parley, but fell on Pell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell
upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and kill'd ſome, and
wounded a good many; they having recourſe
to their Whips, as the beſt of their Weapons.
And as they obſerv'd no Order, they perplex'd
the Enemy ſo ſorely, with laſhing 'em in the
Eyes; and the Women and Children ſeeing
their Husbands ſo treated, being of fearful
cowardly Diſpoſitions, and hearing the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
cry out, <hi>Yield, and Live! Yield, and be Pardon'd!</hi>
they all run in amongſt their Husbands and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and hung about 'em, crying out, <hi>Yield,
Yield, and leave</hi> Caeſar <hi>to their Revenge;</hi> that by
degrees the <hi>Slaves</hi> abandon'd <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and left
him only <hi>Tuſcan,</hi> and his Heroick <hi>Imoinda;</hi>
who, grown big as ſhe was, did neverthelefs
preſs near her Lord, having a Bow, and a
Quiver full of poiſon'd Arrows, which ſhe
manag'd with ſuch dexterity, that ſhe woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſeveral, and ſhot the Governor into the
Shoulder; of which Wound he had like to
have died, but that an <hi>Indian</hi> Woman, his
Miſtreſs, ſuck'd the Wound, and cleans'd it
from the Venom: But however, he ſtirr'd not
from the Place till he had Parly'd with <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:47213:79"/>
who he found was reſolv'd to die fighting, and
wou'd not be taken; no more wou'd <hi>Tuſcan,</hi>
or <hi>Imoinda.</hi> But he, more thirſting after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of another ſort, than that of depriving
him of Life, now made uſe of all his Art of
Talking and Diſſembling, and beſought <hi>Caeſar</hi>
to yield himſelf upon Terms which he himſelf
ſhould propoſe; and ſhould be ſacredly aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to, and kept by him: He told him, It was
not that he any longer fear'd him, or cou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the force of two Men, and a young He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine,
cou'd overcome all them, with all the
Slaves now on their ſide alſo; but it was the
vaſt Eſteem he had for his Perſon, the Deſire
he had to ſerve ſo Gallant a Man, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himſelf from the Reproach hereafter, of
having been the occaſion of the Death of a
<hi>Prince,</hi> whoſe Valour and Magnanimity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
the Empire of the World. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
to him, he look'd upon this Action as
Gallant and Brave, however tending to the
Prejudice of his Lord and Maſter, who wou'd
by it have loſt ſo conſiderable a number of
<hi>Slaves;</hi> that this Flight of his, ſhou'd be look'd
on as a heat of Youth, and a raſhneſs of a too
forward Courage, and an unconſider'd Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of Liberty, and no more; and that he
labour'd in vain to accompliſh that which they
wou'd effectually perform, as ſoon as any
Ship arriv'd that wou'd touch on his Coaſt:
<hi>So that if you will be pleas'd</hi> (continu'd he) <hi>to
ſurrender your ſelf, all imaginable Reſpect ſhall be
paid you; and your Self, your Wife, and Child,
if it be born here, ſhall depart free out of our Land.</hi>
But <hi>Caeſar</hi> wou'd here of no Compoſition;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47213:79"/>
though <hi>Byam</hi> urg'd, If he purſu'd and went
on in his Deſign, he wou'd inevitably periſh,
either by great Snakes, wild Beaſts, or Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and he ought to have regard to his Wife,
whoſe Condition required Eaſe, and not the
Fatigues of tedious Travel, where ſhe cou'd
not be ſecur'd from being devour'd. But <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi>
told him, there was no Faith in the White
Men, or the Gods they ador'd; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
'em in Principles ſo falſe, that honeſt
Men cou'd not live amongſt 'em; though no
People profeſs'd ſo much, none perform'd ſo
little; that he knew what he had to do, when
he dealt with Men of Honour; but with them
a Man ought to be eternally on his Guard, and
never to Eat and Drink with <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> without
his Weapon of Defence in his Hand; and, for
his own Security, never to credit one Word
they ſpoke. As for the Raſhneſs and Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs
of his Action, he wou'd confeſs the
Governor is in the right; and that he was
aſham'd of what he had done, in endeavouring
to make thoſe Free, who were by Nature
<hi>Slaves,</hi> poor wretched Rogues, fit to be us'd
as <hi>Chriſtian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> Tools; Dogs, Treacherous and
Cowardly, fit for ſuch Maſters; and they wanted
only but to be whipp'd into the Knowledge of
the <hi>Chriſtian Gods,</hi> to be the vileſt of all creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things; to learn to worſhip ſuch Deities
as had not Power to make 'em Juſt, Brave,
or Honeſt. In fine, after a thouſand things of
this nature, not fit here to be recited, he told
<hi>Byam,</hi> He had rather Die, than Live upon the
ſame Earth with ſuch Dogs. But <hi>Trefry</hi> and
<hi>Byam</hi> pleaded and proteſted together ſo much,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47213:80"/>
that <hi>Trefry</hi> believing the Governor to mean
what he ſaid; and ſpeaking very cordially
himſelf, generouſly put himſelf into <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s
Hands, and took him aſide, and perſuaded
him, even with Tears, to Live, by Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
himſelf, and to name his Conditions.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> was overcome by his Wit and Reaſons,
and in conſideration of <hi>Imoinda;</hi> and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
what he deſir'd, and that it ſhou'd be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd
by their Hands in Writing, becauſe he
had perceiv'd that was the common way of
Contract between Man and Man, amongſt
the <hi>Whites.</hi> All this was perform'd, and <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>'s
Pardon was put in, and they Surrender
to the Governor, who walked peaceably down
into the <hi>Plantation</hi> with 'em, after giving Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to bury their Dead. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was very much
toil'd with the Buſtle of the Day, for he had
fought like a Fury; and what Miſchief was
done, He and <hi>Tuſcan</hi> perform'd alone; and
gave their Enemies a fatal Proof, that they
durſt do any thing, and fear'd no mortal
Force.</p>
                  <p>But they were no ſooner arriv'd at the
Place where all the Slaves receive their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
of Whipping, but they laid Hands
on <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Tuſcan,</hi> faint with Heat and
Toil; and ſurprizing them, bound them to
two ſeveral Stakes, and whipp'd them in a
moſt deplorable and inhumane manner, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the very Fleſh from their Bones; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> who was not perceiv'd to make
any Moan, or to alter his Face, only to roul
his Eyes on the Faithleſs Governor, and thoſe
he believ'd Guilty, with Fierceneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47213:80"/>
and, to compleat his Rage, he ſaw
every one of thoſe <hi>Slaves,</hi> who, but a few Days
before, ador'd him as ſomething more than Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
now had a Whip to give him ſome Laſhes,
while he ſtrove not to break his Fetters; tho'
if he had, it were impoſſible: but he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
a Woe and Revenge from his Eyes, that

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d Fire, that 'twas at once both Awful and
Terrible to behold.</p>
                  <p>When they thought they were ſufficiently
Reveng'd on him, they unty'd him, almoſt
fainting with loſs of Blood, from a thouſand
Wounds all over his Body; from which they
had rent his Cloaths, and led him Bleeding
and Naked as he was, and loaded him all over
with Irons, and then rubb'd his Wounds, to
compleat their Cruelty, with <hi>Indian</hi> Pepper;
which had like to have made him raving Mad;
and, in this Condition, made him ſo faſt to
the Ground, that he cou'd not ſtir, if his
Pains and Wounds wou'd have given him leave.
They ſpar'd <hi>Imoinda,</hi> and did not let her ſee
this Barbarity committed towards her Lord,
but carry'd her down to <hi>Parham,</hi> and ſhut her
up; which was not in kindneſs to her, but for
fear ſhe ſhou'd die with the Sight, or Miſcarry,
and then they ſhou'd loſe a young <hi>Slave,</hi> and
perhaps the Mother.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know, that when the News was
brought, on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had
betaken himſelf to the Woods, and carry'd
with him all the <hi>Negroes,</hi> we were poſſeſs'd
with extreme Fear, which no Perſuaſions
cou'd diſſipate, that he wou'd ſecure himſelf
till Night; and then, that he wou'd come
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47213:81"/>
down and cut all our Throats. This Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
made all the Females of us fly down
the River, to be ſecur'd; and while we were
away, they acted this Cruelty: For I ſuppoſe,
I had Authority and Intereſt enough there,
had I ſuſpected any ſuch thing, to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it; but we had not gone many Leagues,
but the News overtook us, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and whipp'd like a common <hi>Slave.</hi> We
met, on the River, with Colonel <hi>Martin,</hi> a Man
of great Gallantry, Wit and Goodneſs, and
whom I have celebrated in a Character of my
New <hi>Comedy,</hi> by his own Name, in Memory
of ſo Brave a Man: He was Wiſe and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and, from the fineneſs of his Parts,
bore a great Sway over the Hearts of all the
<hi>Colony:</hi> He was a Friend to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this falſe Dealing with him very much.
We carry'd him back to <hi>Parham,</hi> thinking to
have made an Accommodation. When he
came, the firſt News we heard, was, That the
<hi>Governor</hi> was dead of a Wound <hi>Imoinda</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him; but it was not ſo well: But it ſeems,
he wou'd have the Pleaſure of beholding the
Revenge he took on <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and before the cruel
Ceremony was finiſh'd, he dropt down; and
then they perceiv'd the Wound he had on his
Shoulder was by a venom'd Arrow; which, as
I ſaid, his <hi>Indian</hi> Miſtreſs heal'd, by ſucking the
Wound.</p>
                  <p>We were no ſooner arriv'd, but we went
up to the <hi>Plantation</hi> to ſee <hi>Caeſar;</hi> whom we
found in a very miſerable and unexpreſſible
Condition; and I have a thouſand times
admir'd how he liv'd in ſo much tormenting
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47213:81"/>
Pain. We ſaid all things to him, that Trouble,
Pity and Good Nature cou'd ſuggeſt; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
our Innocency of the Fact, and our
Abhorrence of ſuch Cruelties; making a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Profeſſions of Services to him, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
as many Pardons for the Offenders, till
we ſaid ſo much, that he believ'd we had
no hand in his ill Treatment; but told us,
He cou'd never pardon <hi>Byam;</hi> as for <hi>Trefry,</hi>
he confeſs'd he ſaw his Grief and Sorrow for
his Suffering, which he cou'd not hinder, but
was like to have been beaten down by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Slaves,</hi> for ſpeaking in his Defence: But
for <hi>Byam,</hi> who was their Leader, their
Head,—and ſhou'd, by his Juſtice and
Honour, have been an Example to 'em,—for
him he wiſh'd to live, to take a dire Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of him; and ſaid, <hi>It had been well for
him, if he had Sacrific'd me, inſtead of giving
me the contemptible Whip.</hi> He refus'd to talk
much; but begging us to give him our Hands,
he took 'em, and proteſted never to lift up his,
to do us any harm. He had a great Reſpect
for Colonel <hi>Martin,</hi> and always took his
Counſel like that of a Parent; and aſſur'd
him, He wou'd obey him in any thing, but
his Revenge on <hi>Byam: Therefore</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for
his own ſafety, let him ſpeedily diſpatch me; for if
I cou'd diſpatch my ſelf, I wou'd not, till that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
were done to my injur'd Perſon, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of a Soldier: No, I wou'd not kill my ſelf,
even after a Whipping, but will be content to live
with that Infamy, and be pointed at by every grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Slave, till I have compleated my Revenge;
and then you ſhall ſee, that</hi> Oroonoko <hi>ſcorns to live
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47213:82"/>
with the Indignity that was put on</hi> Caeſar. All
we cou'd do, cou'd get no more Words from
him; and we took care to have him put imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
into a healing Bath, to rid him of his
Pepper, and order'd a Chirurgeon to anoint
him with healing Balm; which he ſuffer'd, and
in ſome time he began to be able to Walk and
Eat. We fail'd not to viſit him every Day,
and to that end had him brought to an Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Parham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Governor was no ſooner recover'd, and

                     </gap> heard of the Menaces of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but he
call'd his Council; who (not to diſgrace them,
or Burleſque the Government there) conſiſted
of ſuch notorious Villains as <hi>Newgate</hi> never
Tranſported; and, poſſibly, originally were
ſuch who underſtood neither the Laws of
<hi>God or Man;</hi> and had no ſort of Principles
to make 'em worthy the Name of Men; but,
at the very Council-Table, wou'd Contradict
and Fight with one another; and Swear ſo
bloodily, that 'twas terrible to hear and ſee
'em. (Some of 'em were afterwards Hang'd,
when the <hi>Dutch</hi> took poſſeſſion of the Place,
others ſent off in Chains.) But calling theſe
ſpecial Rulers of the Nation together, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
their Counſel in this weighty Affair,
they all concluded, that (Damn 'em) it might
be their own Caſes; and that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ought to
be made an Example to all the <hi>Negroes,</hi> to
fright 'em from daring to threaten their Betters,
their Lords and Maſters; and, at this rate, no
Man was ſafe from his own <hi>Slaves;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhou'd
be Hang'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:47213:82"/>
                     <hi>Trefry</hi> then thought it time to uſe his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and told <hi>Byam,</hi> his Command did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to his Lord's <hi>Plantation;</hi> and that <hi>Parham</hi>
was as much exempt from the Law as <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall;</hi>
and that they ought no more to touch
the Servants of the Lord—(who there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
the King's Perſon) than they cou'd
thoſe about the King himſelf; and that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was a Sanctuary; and though his Lord
were abſent in Perſon, his Power was ſtill in
Being there; which he had entruſted with
him, as far as the Dominions of his particular
<hi>Plantations</hi> reach'd, and all that belong'd to it;
the reſt of the Country, as <hi>Byam</hi> was Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to his Lord, he might exerciſe his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
upon. <hi>Trefry</hi> had others as powerful, or
more, that int'reſted themſelves in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Life,
and abſolutely ſaid, He ſhou'd be Defended.
So turning the Governor, and his wiſe Council,
out of Doors, (for they ſat at <hi>Parham-houſe</hi>)
we ſet a Guard upon our Landing-place, and
wou'd admit none but thoſe we call'd Friends to
us and <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Governor</hi> having remain'd wounded at
<hi>Parham,</hi> till his Recovery was compleated,
<hi>Caeſar</hi> did not know but he was ſtill there, and
indeed, for the moſt part, his time was ſpent
there; for he was one that lov'd to live at other
Peoples Expence, and if he were a Day ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
he was Ten preſent there; and us'd to
Play, and Walk, and Hunt and Fiſh with
<hi>Caeſar.</hi> So that <hi>Caeſar</hi> did not at all doubt, if
he once recover'd Strength, but he ſhou'd find
an opportunity of being reveng'd on him:
Though, after ſuch a Revenge, he cou'd not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47213:83"/>
hope to live; for if he eſcap'd the Fury of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Mobile, who perhaps wou'd have been
glad of the occaſion to have kill'd him, he was
reſolv'd not to ſurvive his Whipping; yet he
had ſome tender Hours, a repenting Softneſs,
which he call'd his Fits of Cowardice; wherein
he ſtruggl'd with Love for the Victory of his
Heart, which took part with his charming <hi>Imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inda</hi>
there: but, for the moſt part, his time
was paſt in melancholy Thought, and black
Deſigns; he conſider'd, if he ſhou'd do this
Deed, and die either in the Attempt, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it, he left his lovely <hi>Imoinda</hi> a Prey, or at
beſt a <hi>Slave,</hi> to the enrag'd Multitude: His
great Heart cou'd not endure that Thought:
<hi>Perhaps</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſhe may be first Raviſh'd by
every Brute; expoſed firſt to their naſty Luſts, and
then a ſhameful Death:</hi> No, he cou'd not live
a moment under that Apprehenſion, too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
to be borne. Theſe were his
Thoughts, and his ſilent Arguments with his
Heart, as he told us afterwards: ſo that now
reſolving not only to kill <hi>Byam,</hi> but all thoſe
he thought had enrag'd him; pleaſing his great
Heart with the fancy'd Slaughter he ſhou'd
make over the whole face of the <hi>Plantation;</hi>
he firſt reſolv'd on a Deed, that (however
Horrid it firſt appear'd to us all) when we had
heard his Reaſons, we thought it Brave and
Juſt. Being able to walk, and, as he believ'd,
fit for the execution of his great Deſign, he
begg'd <hi>Trefry</hi> to truſt him into the Air, believing
a Walk wou'd do him good. Which was
granted him; and taking <hi>Imoinda</hi> with him, as
he us'd to do in his more happy and calmer
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47213:83"/>
Days, he led her up into a Wood, where,
after (with a thouſand Sighs, and long gazing
ſilently on her Face, while Tears guſht, in
ſpite of him, from his Eyes) he told her his
Deſign, firſt of killing her, and then his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and next himſelf, and the impoſſibility
of eſcaping, and therefore he told her the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of Dying. He found the Heroick Wife
faſter pleading for Death than he was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it, when ſhe found his fix'd Reſolution;
and, on her Knees, beſought him not to leave
her a Prey to his Enemies. He (griev'd to
Death) yet pleas'd at her noble Reſolution,
took her up, and embracing her with all the
Paſſion and Languiſhment of a dying Lover,
drew his Knife to kill this Treaſure of his Soul,
this Pleaſure of his Eyes; while Tears trickl'd
down his Cheeks, hers were ſmiling with Joy
ſhe ſhou'd die by ſo noble a Hand, and be
ſent into her own Countrey, (for that's their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the next World) by him ſhe ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Lov'd, and ſo truly Ador'd in this. For
Wives have a Reſpect for their Husbands equal
to what any other People pay a Deity: And
when a Man finds any occaſion to quit his
Wife, if he love her, ſhe dies by his Hand;
if not, he ſells her, or ſuffers ſome other to kill
her. It being thus, you may believe the Deed
was ſoon reſolv'd on; and 'tis not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but the Parting, the eternal Leave taking
of Two ſuch Lovers, ſo greatly Born, ſo Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
ſo Beautiful, ſo Young, and ſo Fond,
muſt be very Moving, as the Relation of it
was to me afterwards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:47213:84"/>
All that Love cou'd ſay in ſuch caſes, being
ended, and all the intermitting Irreſolutions
being adjuſted, the Lovely, Young and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
Victim lays her ſelf down before the
Sacrificer; while he, with a Hand reſolv'd, and
a Heart-breaking within, gave the fatal Stroke;
firſt cutting her Throat, and then ſevering her
yet ſmiling Face from that delicate Body, preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
as it was with the Fruits of tend'reſt Love.
As ſoon as he had done, he laid the Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
on Leaves and Flowers, of which he
made a Bed, and conceal'd it under the ſame
Cover-lid of Nature, only her Face he left
yet bare to look on: But when he found ſhe
was Dead, and paſt all Retrieve, never more
to bleſs him with her Eyes, and ſoft Language;
his Grief ſwell'd up to Rage; he Tore, he
Rav'd, he Roar'd like ſome Monſter of the
Wood, calling on the lov'd Name of <hi>Imoinda:</hi>
A thouſand times he turn'd the fatal Knife that
did the Deed toward his own Heart, with a
Reſolution to go immediately after her; but
dire Revenge, which was now a thouſand
times more fierce in his Soul than before, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
him, and he wou'd cry out; <hi>No, ſince I
have ſacrific'd</hi> Imoinda <hi>to my Revenge, ſhall I loſe
that Glory which I have purchas'd ſo dear, as at the
Price of the Faireſt, Deareſt, Softeſt Creature that
ever Nature made? No, no!</hi> Then, at her
Name, Grief wou'd get the aſcendant of
Rage, and he wou'd lie down by her Side,
and water her Face with ſhowers of Tears,
which never were wont to fall from thoſe
Eyes; and however bent he was on his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Slaughter, he had not power to ſtir fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:47213:84"/>
the Sight of this dear Object, now more Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd,
and more Ador'd than ever.</p>
                  <p>He remain'd in this deplorable Condition
for two Days, and never roſe from the Ground
where he had made his ſad Sacrifice; at laſt,
rouzing from her ſide, and accuſing himſelf
with living too long, now <hi>Imoinda</hi> was dead,
and that the Deaths of thoſe barbarous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were deferr'd too long, he reſolv'd now
to finiſh the Great Work; but offering to riſe,
he found his Strength ſo decay'd, that he reel'd
to and fro, like Boughs aſſail'd by contrary
Winds; ſo that he was forced to lie down
again, and try to ſummon all his Courage to
his Aid; he found his Brains turn'd round, and
his Eyes were dizzy, and Objects appear'd not
the ſame to him they were wont to do; his
Breath was ſhort, and all his Limbs ſurprized
with a Faintneſs he had never felt before: He
had not eat in two Days, which was one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of this Feebleneſs, but exceſs of Grief
was the greateſt; yet ſtill he hop'd he ſhou'd
recover Vigour to act his Deſign, and lay expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
it yet ſix days longer; ſtill mourning over
the dead Idol of his Heart, and ſtriving every
day to riſe, but cou'd not.</p>
                  <p>In all this time you may believe we were in
no little affliction for <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his Wife;
ſome were of opinion he was eſcap'd, never
to return; others thought ſome Accident had
hap'ned to him: But however, we fail'd not
to ſend out an hundred People ſeveral ways, to
ſearch for him: A Party of about forty went
that way he took, among whom was <hi>Tuſcan,</hi>
who was perfectly reconcil'd to <hi>Byam:</hi> They
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47213:85"/>
had not gone very far into the Wood, but
they ſmelt an unuſual Smell, as of a dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
for Stinks muſt be very noiſom, that can
be diſtinguiſh'd among ſuch a quantity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Sweets, as every Inch of that Land pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces.
So that they concluded they ſhou'd
find him dead, or ſome body that was ſo;
they paſs'd on towards it, as loathſom as it was,
and made ſuch a ruſling among the Leaves,
that lie thick on the Ground, by continual
falling, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> heard he was approach'd;
and though he had, during the ſpace of theſe
eight Days, endeavour'd to riſe, but found he
wanted Strength; yet looking up, and ſeeing
his Purſuers, he roſe, and reel'd to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Tree, againſt which he fix'd his Back;
and being within a dozen Yards of thoſe that
advanc'd and ſaw him, he call'd out to them,
and bid them approach no nearer, if they
wou'd be ſafe. So that they ſtood ſtill, and
hardly believing their Eyes, that wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
them that it was <hi>Caeſar</hi> that ſpoke to
'em, ſo much was he alter'd, they ask'd him,
what he had done with his Wife, for they
ſmelt a Stink that almoſt ſtruck them dead?
He, pointing to the dead Body, ſighing, cry'd,
<hi>Behold her there.</hi> They put off the Flowers
that cover'd her, with their Sticks, and found
ſhe was kill'd, and cry'd out, <hi>Oh, Monſter!
that hast murther'd thy Wife.</hi> Then asking
him, why he did ſo cruel a Deed? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
He had no leiſure to anſwer imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Queſtions: <hi>You may go back</hi> (continu'd
he) <hi>and tell the faithleſs Governor, he may thank
Fortune that I am breathing my last; and that my
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47213:85"/>
Arm is too feeble to obey my Heart, in what it
had deſign'd him:</hi> But his Tongue faultering,
and trembling, he cou'd ſcarce end what he
was ſaying. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> taking Advantage
by his Weakneſs, cry'd, <hi>Let us take him alive by
all means.</hi> He heard 'em; and, as if he had
reviv'd from a Fainting; or a Dream, he cry'd
out, <hi>No, Gentlemen, you are deceiv'd; you will
find no more</hi> Caeſars <hi>to be Whipt; no more find a
Faith in me: Feeble as you think me, I have
Strength yet left to ſecure me from a ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity.</hi>
They ſwore all a-new; and he only
ſhook his Head, and beheld them with Scorn.
Then they cry'd out, <hi>Who will venture on this
ſingle Man? Will no body?</hi> They ſtood all ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
while <hi>Caeſar</hi> replied, <hi>Fatal will be the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to the firſt Adventurer, let him aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
(and, at that word, held up his Knife in
a menacing poſture,) <hi>Look ye, ye faithleſs Crew,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>'tis not Life I ſeek, nor am I afraid of
Dying,</hi> (and at that word, cut a piece of
Fleſh from his own Throat, and threw it at
'em,) <hi>yet ſtill I wou'd Live if I cou'd, till I had
perfected my Revenge: But, oh! it cannot be; I
feel Life gliding from my Eyes and Heart; and
if I make not haſte, I ſhall yet fall a Victim to
the ſhameful Whip.</hi> At that, he rip'd up his own
Belly, and took his Bowels and pull'd 'em out,
with what Strength he cou'd; while ſome,
on their Knees imploring, beſought him to
hold his Hand. But when they ſaw him tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
they cry'd out, <hi>Will none venture on him?</hi>
A bold <hi>Engliſh</hi> cry'd, <hi>Yes, if he were the Devil,</hi>
(taking Courage when he ſaw him almoſt
Dead) and ſwearing a horrid Oath for his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47213:86"/>
Farewell to the World, he ruſh'd on him. <hi>Caeſar</hi>
with his Arm'd Hand met him ſo fairly, as
ſtuck him to the Heart, and he fell dead at his
Feet. <hi>Tuſcan</hi> ſeeing that, cry'd out, <hi>I love thee,
O</hi> Caeſar! <hi>and therefore will not let thee die, if
poſſible;</hi> and running to him, took him in his
Arms: but, at the ſame time, warding a Blow
that <hi>Caeſar</hi> made at his Boſom, he receiv'd it
quite through his Arm; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> having not
the ſtrength to pluck the Knife forth, tho' he
attempted it, <hi>Tuſcan</hi> neither pull'd it out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
nor ſuffer'd it to be pull'd out, but came
down with it ſticking in his Arm; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he gave for it, was, becauſe the Air ſhou'd
not get into the Wound. They put their
Hands a-croſs, and carry'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> between ſix
of 'em, fainting as he was, and they thought
dead, or juſt dying; and they brought him
to <hi>Parham,</hi> and laid him on a Couch, and had
the Chirurgeon immediately to him, who dreſt
his Wounds, and ſow'd up his Belly, and us'd
means to bring him to life, which they ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
We ran all to ſee him; and, if before
we thought him ſo beautiful a Sight, he was
now ſo alter'd, that his Face was like a Death's
Head black'd over; nothing but Teeth and
Eye-holes: For ſome Days we ſuffer'd no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſpeak to him, but cauſed Cordials to be
poured down his Throat; which ſuſtained his
Life, and in ſix or ſeven days he recover'd
his Senſes: For, you muſt know, that Wounds
are almoſt to a Miracle cur'd in the <hi>Indies;</hi>
unleſs Wounds in the Legs, which rarely
ever cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:47213:86"/>
When he was well enough to ſpeak, we
talk'd to him, and ask'd him ſome Queſtions
about his Wife, and the Reaſons why he kill'd
her; and he then told us what I have related
of that Reſolution and of his Parting, and he
beſought us we wou'd let him die, and was
extremely afflicted to think it was poſſible he
might live; he aſſur'd us, if we did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
him, he wou'd prove very fatal to a
great many. We ſaid all we cou'd to make
him live, and gave him new Aſſurances; but he
begg'd we wou'd not think ſo poorly of him,
or of his Love to <hi>Imoinda,</hi> to imagine we cou'd
flatter him to Life again: but the Chirurgeon
aſſur'd him he cou'd not live, and therefore
he need not fear. We were all (but <hi>Caeſar</hi>)
afflicted at this News, and the Sight was gaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
His Diſcourſe was ſad; and the earthly
Smell about him ſo ſtrong, that I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
to leave the place for ſome time, (being
my ſelf but ſickly, and very apt to fall into
Fits of dangerous Illneſs upon any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Melancholy.) The Servants, and <hi>Trefry,</hi>
and the Chirurgeons, promis'd all to take what
poſſible care they cou'd of the Life of <hi>Caeſar;</hi>
and I, taking Boat, went with other Company
to Colonel <hi>Martin</hi>'s, about three Days Journey
down the River: but I was no ſooner gone,
but the Governor taking <hi>Trefry</hi> about ſome
pretended earneſt Buſineſs, a Day's Journey
up the River, having communicated his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to one <hi>Baniſter,</hi> a Wild <hi>Iriſh</hi> Man, and
one of the Council, a Fellow of abſolute
Barbarity, and fit to execute any Villany, but
was Rich: He came up to <hi>Parham,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47213:87"/>
took <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and had him carried to the
ſame Poſt where he was whip'd; and cauſing
him to be ty'd to it, and a great Fire made before
him, he told him, he ſhou'd die like a Dog,
as he was. <hi>Caeſar</hi> replied, this was the firſt
piece of Bravery that ever <hi>Baniſter</hi> did, and he
never ſpoke Sence till he pronounc'd that Word;
and, if he wou'd keep it, he wou'd declare,
in the other World, that he was the only
Man, of all the <hi>Whites,</hi> that ever he heard
ſpeak Truth. And turning to the Men that
bound him, he ſaid, <hi>My Friends, am I to Die, or
to be Whipt?</hi> And they cry'd; <hi>Whipt! No, you
ſhall not eſcape ſo well.</hi> And then he reply'd,
ſmiling, <hi>A Bleſſing on thee;</hi> and aſſur'd them,
they need not tie him, for he wou'd ſtand fix'd
like a Rock, and endure Death ſo as ſhou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them to Die: <hi>But if you Whip me</hi> (ſaid
he) <hi>be ſure you tie me fast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had learn'd to take Tobacco; and when
he was aſſur'd he ſhou'd Die, he deſir'd they
wou'd give him a Pipe in his Mouth, ready
lighted; which they did: and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
came, and firſt out off his Members,
and threw them into the Fire; after that, with
an ill-favour'd Knife, they cut off his Ears and
his Noſe, and burn'd them; he ſtill Smoak'd
on, as if nothing had touch'd him; then they
hack'd off one of his Arms, and ſtill he bore
up, and held his Pipe; but at the cutting off
the other Arm, his Head ſunk, and his Pipe
dropt, and he gave up the Ghoſt, without a
Groan, or a Reproach. My Mother and Siſter
were by him all the while, but not ſuffer'd
to ſave him; ſo rude and wild were the Rabble,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47213:87"/>
and ſo inhumane were the Juſtices who ſtood
by to ſee the Execution, who after paid dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough for their Inſolence. They cut <hi>Caeſar</hi>
in Quarters, and ſent them to ſeveral of the
chief <hi>Plantations:</hi> One Quarter was ſent to
Colonel <hi>Martin;</hi> who refus'd it, and ſwore, he
had rather ſee the Quarters of <hi>Baniſter,</hi> and the
<hi>Governor</hi> himſelf, than thoſe of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> on his
<hi>Plantations;</hi> and that he cou'd govern his <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi>
without Terrifying and Grieving them
with frightful Spectacles of a mangl'd King.</p>
                  <p>Thus Died this Great Man; worthy of a
better Fate, and a more ſublime Wit than mine
to write his Praiſe: yet, I hope, the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my Pen is conſiderable enough to make
his Glorious Name to ſurvive to all Ages, with
that of the Brave, the Beautiful and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>Imoinda.</hi>

                  <head>The Fair JILT:
OR, THE
AMOURS
OF
Prince Tarquin and Miranda.</head>
                  <p>AS Love is the moſt Noble and Divine
Paſſion of the Soul, ſo it is that to
which we may juſtly attribute all the
real Satisfactions of Life; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, Man is unfiniſh'd, and unhappy.</p>
                  <p>There are a thouſand things to be ſaid of
the Advantages this generous Paſſion brings to
thoſe, whoſe Hearts are capable of receiving
its ſoft Impreſſions; for 'tis not every one that
can be ſenſible of its tender Touches. How
many Examples, from Hiſtory and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
cou'd I give of its wondrous Power; nay,
even to a degree of Tranſmigration? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ideots has it made wiſe? How many Fools
eloquent? How many Home-bred 'Squires ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd?
How many C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wards brave? And
there is no ſort or ſpecies of Mankind on whom
it cannot work ſome Change and Miracle, if it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47213:90"/>
be a noble well-grounded Paſſion, except on the
Fop in Faſhion, the harden'd incorrigible Fop;
ſo often wounded, but never reclaim'd: For
ſtill, by a dire Miſtake, conducted by vaſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionatreiſm,
and a greater Portion of Self-love,
than the reſt of the Race of Man, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
that Affectation in his Mien and Dreſs,
that Mathematical-movement, that Formality
in every Action, that Face manag'd with Care,
and ſoften'd into Ridicule, the languiſhing Turn,
the Toſs, and the Back-ſhake of the Perriwig,
is the direct Way to the Heart of the fine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he Adores; and inſtead of curing Love in
his Soul, ſerves only to advance his Folly; and
the more he is enamour'd, the more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
he aſſumes (every Hour) the Coxcomb.
Theſe are Love's Play-things, a ſort of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
with whom he ſports; and whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wounds, but when he is in good humour,
and always ſhoots laughing. 'Tis the Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Little God, to ſee what a fluttering
and buſtle one of theſe Sparks, new-wounded,
makes; to what fantaſtick Fooleries he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
The Glaſs is every moment call'd to
counſel, the Valet conſulted and plagu'd for
new Invention of Dreſs, the Foot-man and
Scrutore perpetually employ'd; <hi>Billet-doux</hi> and
<hi>Madrigals</hi> take up all his Mornings, till Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
in Dreſſing, till Night in Gazing; ſtill,
like a Sun-flower, turn'd towards the Beams
of the fair Eyes of his <hi>Caelia,</hi> adjuſting himſelf
in the moſt Amarous Poſture he can aſſume,
his Hat under his Arm, while the other Hand
is put careleſly into his Boſom, as if laid upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47213:90"/>
his panting Heart; his Head a little bent to
one ſide, ſupported with a world of Crevat-ſtring,
which he takes mighty care not to put
into diſorder; as one may gueſs by a never-failing,
and horrid Stiffneſs in his Neck; and
if he have an occaſion to look aſide, his whole
Body turns at the ſame time, for fear the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Head alone ſhould incommode the
Crevat or Perriwig: And ſometimes the Glove
is well manag'd, and the white Hand diſplay'd.
Thus, with a thouſand other little Motions and
Formalities, all in the common Place or Road
of Foppery, he takes infinite pains to ſhew
himſelf to the Pit and Boxes, a moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
Aſs. This is he, of all Humane Kind,
on whom Love can do no Miracle; and who
can no where, and upon no occaſion, quit one
Grain of his refin'd Foppery, unleſs in a Duel,
or a Battle, if ever his Stars ſhou'd be ſo ſevere
and ill-manner'd, to reduce him to the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of either: Fear then wou'd ruffle that fine
Form he had ſo long preſerved in niceſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with grief conſidering, that an unlucky
Chance-wound in his Face, if ſuch a dire Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
ſhou'd befal him, wou'd ſpoil the Sale
of it for ever.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be urg'd, that ſince no Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis
can be made in a Fop by Love, you
muſt conſider him one of thoſe that only talks
of Love, and thinks himſelf that happy thing,
a Lover; and wanting fine Sence enough for
the real Paſſion, believes what he feels to be it.
There are in the Quiver of the God a great
many different Darts; ſome that wound for a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47213:91"/>
Day, and others for a Year; they are all fine,
painted, glittering Darts, and ſhew as well
as thoſe made of the nobleſt Metal; but the
Wounds they make, reach the Deſire only,
and are cur'd by poſſeſſing, while the ſhort-liv'd
Paſſion betrays the Cheats: But 'tis that
refin'd and illuſtrious Paſſion of the Soul, whoſe
Aim is Vertue, and whoſe End is Honour, that
has the Power of changing Nature, and is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of performing all thoſe Heroick Things,
of which Hiſtory is full.</p>
                  <p>How far diſtant Paſſions may be from one
another, I ſhall be able to make appear in theſe
following Rules. I'll prove to you the ſtrong
Effects of Love in ſome unguarded and ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
Hearts; where it rages beyond the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations
of <hi>a God all ſoft and gentle,</hi> and reigns
more like <hi>a Fury from Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not pretend here to entertain you with
a feign'd Story, or any thing piec'd together
with Romantick Accidents; but every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to a Tittle, is Truth. To a great part
of the Main, I myſelf was an Eye-witneſs;
and what I did not ſee, I was confirm'd of by
Actors in the Intrigue, holy Men, of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of St. <hi>Francis:</hi> But for the ſake of ſome of
her Relations, I ſhall give my <hi>Fair Jilt</hi> a feign'd
Name, that of <hi>Miranda;</hi> but my Hero muſt
retain his own, it being too Illuſtrious to be
conceal'd.</p>
                  <p>You are to underſtand, that in all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Countries, where Holy Orders are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd,
there are abundance of differing kinds
of Religious, both of Men and Women: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:91"/>
the Women, there are thoſe we call
<hi>Nuns,</hi> that make ſolemn Vows of perpetual
Chaſtity: There are others who make but a
ſimple Vow, as, for five or ten Years, or more
or leſs; and that time expir'd, they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
anew for longer time, or marry, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of themſelves as they ſhall ſee good; and
theſe are ordinarily call'd <hi>Gallopping Nuns:</hi> Of
theſe there are ſeveral Orders; as, <hi>Chanoneſſes,
Begines, Queſt's, Swart-Siſters,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuitiſſes,</hi>
with ſeveral others I have forgot: Of thoſe of
the <hi>Begines</hi> was our <hi>Fair Votreſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Orders are taken up by the beſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the Town, young Maids of Fortune,
who live together, not inclos'd, but in Palaces
that will hold about Fiften hundred or Two
thouſand of theſe <hi>Fille Devotes,</hi> where they
have a regulated Government, under a ſort of
<hi>Abbeſs,</hi> or <hi>Prioreſs;</hi> or rather, a <hi>Governante.</hi>
They are oblig'd to a Method of Devotion,
and are under a ſort of Obedience. They wear
an Habit much like our Widows of Quality in
<hi>England,</hi> only without a <hi>Bando;</hi> and their
Veil is of a thicker Crape than what we have
here, through which one cannot ſee the Face;
for when they go abroad, they cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
all over with it, but they put 'em up in
the Churches, and lay 'em by in the Houſes.
Every one of theſe have a Confeſſor, who is to
'em a ſort of Steward: For, you muſt know,
they that go into theſe places, have the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of their own Fortunes, and what
their Parents deſign 'em. Without the Advice
of this Confeſſor, they act nothing, nor admit
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:92"/>
of a Lover that he ſhall not approve of; at
leaſt, this Method ought to be taken, and is
by almoſt all of 'em; though <hi>Miranda</hi> thought
her Wit above it, as her Spirit was.</p>
                  <p>But as theſe Women are, as I ſaid, of the
beſt Quality, and live with the Reputation of
being retir'd from the World a little more than
ordinary, and becauſe there is a ſort of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to approach 'em, they are the People the
moſt courted, and liable to the greateſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations;
for as difficult as it ſeems to be, they
receive Viſits from all the Men of the beſt
Quality, eſpecially Strangers. All the Men of
Wit and Converſation meet at the Apartments
of theſe fair <hi>Fille Devotes,</hi> where all manner of
Gallantries are perform'd, while all the Study
of theſe Maids is to accompliſh themſelves for
theſe noble Converſations. They receive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
Balls, Serenades and Billets: All the
News, Wit, Verſes, Songs, Novels, Muſick,
Gaming, and all fine Diverſion, is in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments,
they themſelves being of the beſt
Quality and Fortune. So that to manage theſe
Gallantries, there is no ſort of Female Arts
they are not practis'd in, no Intrigues they are
ignorant of, and no Management of which they
are not capable.</p>
                  <p>Of this happy Number was the Fair <hi>Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
whoſe Parents being dead, and a vaſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
divided between herſelf, and a young
Siſter (who liv'd with an unmarry'd old Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
whoſe Eſtate afterwards was all divided
between 'em) put herſelf into this uninclos'd
Religious Houſe; but her Beauty, which had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47213:92"/>
all the Charms that ever Nature gave, became
the Envy of the whole <hi>Siſterhood.</hi> She was tall,
and admirably ſhap'd; ſhe had a bright Hair,
and Hazle-Eyes, all full of Love and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
No Art cou'd make a Face ſo fair as hers
by a Nature, which every Feature adorn'd with
a Grace that Imagination cannot reach: Every
Look, every Motion charm'd, and her black
Dreſs ſhew'd the Luſtre of her Face and Neck.
She had an Air, though gay as ſo much Youth
cou'd inſpire, yet ſo modeſt, ſo nobly reſerv'd,
without Formality, or Stiffneſs, that one who
look'd on her would have imagin'd her Soul
the Twin-Angel of her Body; and both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
made her appear ſomething Divine. To
this ſhe had a great deal of Wit, read much,
and retain'd all that ſerv'd her purpoſe. She
ſung delicately, and danc'd well, and play'd
on the Lute to a Miracle. She ſpoke ſeveral
Languages naturally; for being Co-heireſs to
ſo great a Fortune, ſhe was bred with the niceſt
Care, in all the fineſt Manners of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and was now arriv'd to her Eighteenth
Year.</p>
                  <p>'Twere needleſs to tell you how great a
Noiſe the Fame of this young Beauty, with ſo
conſiderable a Fortune, made in the World;
I may ſay, the World, rather than conſine
her Fame to the ſcanty Limits of a Town;
it reach'd to many others: And there was not
a Man of any Quality that came to <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
or paſs'd through the City, but made it his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to ſee the lovely <hi>Miranda,</hi> who was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
ador'd: Her Youth and Beauty, her
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:93"/>
Shape and Majeſty of Mien, and Air of
Greatneſs, charm'd all her Beholders; and
thouſands of People were dying by her Eyes,
while ſhe was vain enough to glory in her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
and make it her Buſineſs to wound.
She lov'd nothing ſo much as to behold ſighing
Slaves at her Feet, of the greateſt Quality;
and treated 'em all with an Affability that gave
'em Hope. Continual Muſick as ſoon as it
was dark, and Songs of dying Lovers, were
ſung under her Windows; and ſhe might well
have made herſelf a great Fortune (if ſhe had
not been ſo already) by the rich Preſents that
were hourly made her; and every Body daily
expected when ſhe wou'd make ſome one hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
by ſuffering herſelf to be conquer'd by
Love and Honour, by the Aſſiduities and Vows
of ſome one of her Adorers: But <hi>Miranda</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
their Preſents, heard their Vows with
pleaſure, and willingly admitted all their ſoft
Addreſſes; but wou'd not yield her Heart, or
give away that lovely Perſon to the Poſſeſſion
of one, who cou'd pleaſe itſelf with ſo many.
She was naturally Amorous, but extreamly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant:
She lov'd one for his Wit, another
for his Face, a third for his Mein; but above
all, ſhe admir'd Quality: Quality alone had the
Power to attack her entirely; yet not to one
Man, but that Vertue was ſtill admir'd by her
in all; where-ever ſhe found that, ſhe lov'd,
or at leaſt acted the Lover with ſuch Art, that
(deceiving well) ſhe fail'd not to compleat her
Conqueſt; and yet ſhe never durſt truſt her
fickle Humour with Marriage; She knew the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47213:93"/>
Strength of her own Heart, and that it cou'd
not ſuffer itſelf to be confin'd to one Man,
and wiſely avoided thoſe Inquietudes, and
that Uneaſineſs of Life ſhe was ſure to find in
that married Life, which wou'd, againſt her
Nature, oblige her to the Embraces of one,
whoſe Humour was, to love all the Young
and the Gay. But Love, who had hitherto
but play'd with her Heart, and given it naught
but pleaſing wanton Wounds, ſuch as afforded
only ſoft Joys, and not Pains, reſolv'd, either
out of Revenge to thoſe Numbers ſhe had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd,
and who had ſigh'd ſo long in vain;
or to try what Power he had upon ſo fickle a
Heart, ſent an Arrow dipp'd in the moſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Flames that rage in Hearts moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
He ſtruck it home and deep, with all
the Malice of an angry God.</p>
                  <p>There was a Church belonging to the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers,</hi>
whither <hi>Miranda</hi> often repair'd to her
Devotion; and being there one Day, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with a young Siſter of the Order, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Maſs was ended, as 'tis the Cuſtom,
ſome one of the Fathers goes about the Church
with a Box, for Contribution, or Charity-Money;
it happen'd that Day, that a young
Father, newly initiated, carried the Box a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
which, in his turn, he brought to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa.</hi>
She had no ſooner caſt her Eyes on
this young Friar, but her Face was overſpread
with Bluſhes of Surprize: She beheld him ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly,
and ſaw in his Face all the Charms of
Youth, Wit and Beauty; he wanted no one
Grace that cou'd form him for Love, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:94"/>
all that is adorable to the Fair Sex, nor
cou'd the miſhapen Habit hide from her the
lovely Shape it endeavour'd to cover, nor thoſe
delicate Hands that approach'd her too near
with the Box. Beſides the Beauty of his Face
and Shape, he had an Air altogether great; in
ſpite of his profeſs'd Poverty, it betray'd the
Man of Quality; and that Thought weigh'd
greatly with <hi>Miranda.</hi> But Love, who did
not deſign ſhe ſhou'd now feel any ſort of thoſe
eaſie Flames, with which ſhe had heretofore
burnt, made her ſoon lay all thoſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
aſide, which us'd to invite her to Love,
and now lov'd ſhe knew not why.</p>
                  <p>She gaz'd upon him, while he bow'd before
her, and waited for her Charity, 'till ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the lovely Friar to bluſh, and caſt his
Eyes to the Ground. This awaken'd her Shame,
and ſhe put her Hand into her Pocket, and was
a good while in ſearching for her Purſe, as if
ſhe thought of nothing leſs, than what ſhe was
about; at laſt ſhe drew it out, and gave him a
Piſtole; but that with ſo much Deliberation
and Leiſure, as eaſily betray'd the Satisfaction
ſhe took in looking on him; while the good
Man, having receiv'd her Bounty, after a very
low Obeiſance, proceeded to the reſt; and
<hi>Miranda</hi> caſting after him a Look all languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as long as he remain'd in the Church,
departed with a Sigh as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him go
out, and return'd to her Apartment, without
ſpeaking one Word all the Way to the young
<hi>Fille Devote,</hi> who attended her; ſo abſolutely
was her Soul employ'd with this young holy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:94"/>
Man. <hi>Cornelia</hi> (ſo was this Maid call'd who
was with her) perceiving ſhe was ſo ſilent,
who us'd to be all Wit and good Humour, and
obſerving her little Diſorder at the Sight of
the young Father, tho' ſhe was far from imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it to be Love, took an Occaſion, when ſhe
was come home, to ſpeak of him. <hi>Madam,</hi>
ſaid ſhe, <hi>did you not obſerve that fine young</hi> Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delier,
<hi>who brought the Box?</hi> At a Quſtion that
nam'd that Object of her Thoughts, <hi>Miranda</hi>
bluſh'd; and the finding ſhe did ſo, redoubl'd
her Confuſion, and ſhe had ſcarce Courage
enough to ſay,—<hi>Yes, I did obſerve him:</hi>
And then, forcing herſelf to ſmile a little, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd;
<hi>And I wonder'd to ſee ſo jolly a young Friar
of an Order ſo ſevere, and mortify'd. Madam,</hi>

did not ſuffer him to deſpair of, he boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47213:95"/>
of his Happineſs to a young Prince, his
elder Brother, a Youth amorous and fierce,
impatient of Joys, and ſenſible of Beauty,
taking Fire with all fair Eyes: He was his
Father's Darling, and Delight of his fond
Mother; and by an Aſcendant over both
their Hearts, rul'd their Wills.</q>

                        <q>This young Prince no ſooner ſaw, but
lov'd the fair Miſtreſs of his Brother, and
with an Authority of a Sovereign, rather
than the Advice of a Friend, warn'd his
Brother <hi>Henrick</hi> (this now young Friar) to
approach no more this Lady, whom he had
ſeen; and ſeeing, lov'd.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>In vain the poor ſurpriz'd Prince pleads
his Right of Love, his Exchange of Vows,
and Aſſurance of an Heart that cou'd never
be but for himſelf. In vain he urges his
Nearneſs of Blood, his Friendſhip, his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or his Life, which ſo entirely depended
on the Poſſeſſion of the charming Maid. All
his Pleading ſerv'd but to blow his Brother's
Flame; and the more he implores, the more
the other burns; and while <hi>Henrick</hi> follows
him on his Knees, with humble Submiſſions,
the other flies from him in Rages of tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Love; nor cou'd his Tears, that purſu'd
his Brother's Steps, move him to Pity: Hot-headed,
vain-conceited of his Beauty, and
greater Quality, as elder Brother, he doubts
not his Succeſs, and reſolv'd to ſacrifice all to

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47213:95"/>
and accordingly, propoſing it firſt to the
Prince, her Husband, urging the Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Son, ſhe ſoon wrought ſo on
him, that a Match being concluded between
the Parents of this young Beauty, and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>'s
Brother, the Hour was appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe knew of the Sacrifice ſhe was to be
made. And while this was in Agitation,
<hi>Henrick</hi> was ſent on ſome great Affairs, up
into <hi>Germany,</hi> far out of the way; not but
his boding Heart, with perpetual Sighs and
Throbs, eternally foretold him his Fate.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>All the Letters he writ were intercepted,
as well as thoſe ſhe writ to him. She finds
herſelf every Day perplex'd with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
of the Prince ſhe hated; he was
ever ſighing at her Feet. In vain were all
her Reproaches, and all her Coldneſs, he was
on the ſurer ſide; for what he found Love
wou'd not do, Force of Parents wou'd.</q>

<hi>Henrick,</hi> from whom ſhe cou'd never receive
one Letter; and at laſt, cou'd not forbear
burſting into Tears, in ſpite of all her Force,
and feign'd Courage; when, on a Day, the
Prince told her, that <hi>Henrick</hi> was withdrawn,
to give him time to Court her; to whom, he
ſaid, He confeſs'd he had made ſome Vows;
but did repent of 'em, knowing himſelf too
young to make 'em good: That it was for
that Reaſon he brought him firſt to ſee her;
and for that Reaſon, that after that, he never
ſaw her more, nor ſo much as took Leave of
her; (when, indeed, his Death lay upon the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47213:96"/>
next Viſit, his Brother having ſworn to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
him; and to that End, put a Guard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, 'till he was ſent into <hi>Germany.</hi>)</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>All this he utter'd with ſo many paſſionate
Aſſeverations, Vows, and ſeeming Pity for
her being ſo inhumanely abandon'd, that
ſhe almoſt gave Credit to all he had ſaid,
and had much adoe to keep herſelf within
the Bounds of Moderation, and ſilent Grief.
Her Heart was breaking, her Eyes languiſh'd,
and her Cheeks grew pale, and ſhe had like
to have fallen dead into the treacherous Arms
of him that had reduc'd her to this Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
but ſhe did what ſhe cou'd to aſſume her
Courage, and to ſhew as little Reſentment as
poſſible for a Heart, like hers, oppreſs'd with
Love, and now abandon'd by the dear Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of its Joys and Pains.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But, Madam, not to tire you with this
Adventure, the Day arriv'd wherein our ſtill
weeping fair Unfortunate was to be ſacrific'd
to the Capriciouſneſs of Love; and ſhe was
carry'd to Court by her Parents, without
knowing to what End, where ſhe was almoſt
compell'd to marry the Prince.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Henrick,</hi> who, all this while, knew no more
of his Unhappineſs, than what his Fears ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
returns, and paſſes even to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of his Father, before he knew any
thing of his Fortune; where he beheld his
Miſtreſs and his Brother, with his Father, in
ſuch a Familiarity, as he no longer doubted
his Deſtiny. 'Tis hard to judge, whether the
Lady, or himſelf, was moſt ſurpriz'd; ſhe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47213:96"/>
was all pale and unmovable in her Chair, and
<hi>Henrick</hi> fix'd like a Statue; at laſt Grief and
Rage took place of Amazement, and he could
not forbear crying out, <hi>Ah, Traytor! Is it
thus you have treated a Friend and Brother? And
you, O perjur'd Charmer! Is it thus you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
all my Vows?</hi> He cou'd ſay no more;
but reeling againſt the Door, had fall'n in a
Swoon upon the Floor, had not his Page
caught him in his Arms, who was entring
with him. The good old Prince, the Father,
who knew not what all this meant, was ſoon
inform'd by the young, weeping Princeſs;
who, in relating the Story of her Amour
with <hi>Henrick,</hi> told her Tale in ſo moving a
manner, as brought Tears to the Old Man's
Eyes, and Rage to thoſe of her Husband;
he immediately grew jealous to the laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
He finds himſelf in Poſſeſſion ('tis
true) of the Beauty he ador'd; but the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
adoring another; a Prince, young, and
charming as the Light; ſoft, witty, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
with an equal Paſſion. He finds this
dreaded Rival in the ſame Houſe with him,
with an Authority equal to his own; and
fancies, where two Hearts are ſo entirely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
and have ſo good an Underſtanding,
it would not be impoſſible to find Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to ſatisfie and eaſe that mutual Flame,
that burnt ſo equally in both; he therefore
reſolv'd to ſend him out of the World, and
to eſtabliſh his own Repoſe by a Deed, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
cruel, and unnatural, to have him aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinated
the firſt Opportunity he cou'd find.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47213:97"/>
This Reſolution ſet him a little at eaſe, and
he ſtrove to diſſemble Kindneſs to <hi>Henrick,</hi>
with all the Art he was capable of, ſuffering
him to come often to the Apartment of the
Princeſs, and to entertain her oftentimes
with Diſcourſe, when he was not near enough
to hear what he ſpoke; but ſtill watching their
Eyes, he found thoſe of <hi>Henrick</hi> full of Tears,
ready to flow, but reſtrain'd, looking all dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and yet reproaching, while thoſe of the
Princeſs were ever bent to the Earth, and
ſhe, as much as poſſible, ſhunning his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
Yet this did not ſatisfie the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Husband; 'twas not her Complaiſance
that cou'd appeaſe him; he found her Heart
was panting within, when ever <hi>Henrick</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
her, and every Viſit more and more
confirm'd his Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Father often found the Diſorders of
the Sons; the Softneſs and Addreſs of the
one gave him as much Fear, as the angry
Bluſhings, the fierce Looks, and broken Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of the other, when ever he beheld <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
approach his Wife: So that the Father
fearing ſome ill Conſequence of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
<hi>Henrick</hi> to withdraw to ſome other
Country, or travel into <hi>Italy,</hi> he being now
of an Age that requir'd a View of the World.
He told his Father, That he wou'd obey his
Commands, though he was certain, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he was to be ſeparated from the ſight
of the fair Princeſs, his Siſter, wou'd be the
laſt of his Life; and, in fine, made ſo pitiful
a Story of his ſuffering Love, as almoſt mov'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47213:97"/>
the old Prince to compaſſionate him ſo far, as
to permit him to ſtay; but he ſaw inevitable
Danger in that, and therefore bid him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for his Journey.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That which paſs'd between the Father and
<hi>Henrick,</hi> being a Secret, none talk'd of his
departing from Court; ſo that the Deſign the
Brother had, went on; and making an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-match
one Day, where moſt young
People of Quality were, he order'd ſome
whom he had hir'd to follow his Brother, ſo
as if he chanc'd to go out of the way, to
diſpatch him; and accordingly, Fortune
gave 'em an Opportunity; for he lagg'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Company, and turn'd aſide into a
pleaſant Thicket of Hazles; where alighting
he walk'd on Foot in the moſt pleaſant part
of it, full of Thought, how to divide his
Soul between Love and Obedience. He was
ſenſible that he ought not to ſtay, that he
was but an Affliction to the young Princeſs,
whoſe Honour cou'd never permit her to
eaſe any part of his Flame; nor was he ſo
vicious, to entertain a Thought that ſhou'd
ſtain her Vertue. He beheld her now as his
Brother's Wife, and that ſecur'd his Flame
from all looſe Deſires, if her native Modeſty
had not been ſufficient of itſelf to have done
it, and that profound Reſpect he paid her:
And he conſider'd, in obeying his Father,
he left her at Eaſe, and his Brother freed of
a thouſand Fears; he went to ſeek a Cure,
which if he cou'd not find, at laſt he cou'd
but die; and ſo he muſt, even at her Feet:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47213:98"/>
However, that 'twas more noble to ſeek a
Remedy for his Diſeaſe, than expect a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Death by ſtaying. After a thouſand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on his hard Fate, and bemoaning
himſelf, and blaming his cruel Stars, that
had doom'd him to die ſo young; after an
infinity of Sighs and Tears, Reſolvings and
Unreſolvings, he, on the ſudden, was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the trampling of ſome Horſes he
heard, and their ruſhing through the Boughs,
and ſaw four Men make towards him: He
had not time to mount, being walk'd ſome
Paces from his Horſe. One of the Men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd,
and cry'd, <hi>Prince you must die.—I
do believe thee</hi> (reply'd <hi>Henrick) but not by a
Hand ſo baſe as thine:</hi> And at the ſame time,
drawing his Sword, run him into the Groin.
When the Fellow found himſelf ſo wounded,
he wheel'd off, and cry'd, <hi>Thou art a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and hast rewarded my Treachery with
Death.</hi> The reſt came up, and one ſhot at
the Prince, and ſhot him in the Shoulder;
the other two haſtily laying hold (but too
late) on the Hand of the Murtherer, cry'd,
<hi>Hold, Traytor; we relent, and he ſhall not die.</hi>
He reply'd, <hi>'Tis too late, he is ſhot; and ſee, he
lies dead: Let us provide for our ſelves, and tell
the Prince, we have done the Work; for you are
as guilty as I am.</hi> At that, they all fled, and
left the Prince lying under a Tree, weltering
in his Blood.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>About the Evening, the Foreſter going
his Walks, ſaw the Horſe richly capariſon'd,
without a Rider, at the Entrance of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47213:98"/>
Wood; and going farther, to ſee if he cou'd
find its Owner, found there the Prince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
dead: He immediately mounts him on
the Horſe, and himſelf behind, bore him
up, and carry'd him to the Lodge; where
he had only one old Man, his Father, well
skill'd in Surgery, and a Boy. They put him
to Bed, and the old Foreſter, with what
Art he had, dreſs'd his Wound, and in the
Morning ſent for an abler Surgeon, to whom
the Prince enjoyn'd Secrecy, becauſe he knew
him. The Man was faithful, and the Prince,
in time, was recover'd of his Wound; and
ae ſoon as he was well, he came for <hi>Flanders,</hi>
in the Habit of a Pilgrim, and after ſome
time, took the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> none
knowing what became of him, 'till he was
profefs'd; and then he writ his own Story
to the Prince his Father, to his Miſtreſs, and
his ungrateful Brother. The young Princeſs
did not long ſurvive his Loſs, ſhe languiſh'd
from the Moment of his Departure; and he
had this to confirm his devout Life, to know
ſhe dy'd for him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>My Brother, Madam, was an Officer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Prince, his Father, and knew his
Story perfectly well; from whoſe Mouth I
had it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What!</hi> (reply'd <hi>Miranda</hi> then) <hi>is Father</hi>
Henrick <hi>a Man of Quality? Yes, Madam,</hi> (ſaid
<hi>Cornelia,) and has chang'd his Name to</hi> Franciſco.
But <hi>Miranda,</hi> fearing to betray the Sentiments
of her Heart, by asking any more Queſtions
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47213:99"/>
about him, turn'd the Diſcourſe; and ſome
Perſons of Quality came in to viſit her (for
her Apartment was, about Six a-clock, like
the Preſence-Chamber of a Queen, always
fill'd with the greateſt People.) There meet
all the <hi>Beaux Eſpreets,</hi> and all the Beauties. But
it was viſible <hi>Miranda</hi> was not ſo gay as ſhe
us'd to be; but penſive, and anſwering <hi>Mal
a propo,</hi> to all that was ſaid to her. She was a
thouſand times going to ſpeak, againſt her Will,
ſomething of the charming Friar, who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
from her Thoughts; and ſhe imagin'd, if
he could inſpire Love in a courſe, grey, ill-made
Habit, a ſhorn Crown, a Hair-Cord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Waſte, bare-leg'd, in Sandals inſtead
of Shooes, what muſt he do, when looking
back on Time, ſhe beholds him in a Proſpect
of Glory, with all that Youth, and Illuſtrious
Beauty, ſet off by the Advantage of Dreſs and
Equipage. She frames an Idea of him all gay,
and ſplendid, and looks on his preſent Habit as
ſome Diſguiſe proper for the Stealths of Love;
ſome feign'd put-on Shape, with the more Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to approach a Miſtreſs, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
happy; and that, the Robe laid by, ſhe
has the Lover in his proper Beauty, the ſame
he wou'd have been, if any other Habit (tho'
never ſo rich) were put off: In the Bed, the
ſilent, gloomy Night, and the ſoft Embraces
of her Arms, he loſes all the Friar, and aſſumes
all the Prince; and that awful Reverence, due
alone to his holy Habit, he exchanges for a
thouſand Dalliances, for which his Youth was
made; for Love, for tender Embraces, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47213:99"/>
all the Happineſs of Life. Some Moments ſhe
fancies him a Lover, and that the fair Object
that takes up all his Heart, has left no room for
her there; but that was a Thought that did
not long perplex her, and which, almoſt as ſoon
as born, ſhe turn'd to her Advantage: She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
him a Lover, and therefore finds he has
a Heart ſenſible and tender; he had Youth to
be fir'd, as well as to inſpire; he was far from
the lov'd Object, and totally without Hope:
and ſhe reaſonably conſider'd, that Flame
wou'd of itſelf ſoon die, that had only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
to feed on. She beheld her own Charms;
and Experience, as well as her Glaſs, told her,
they never fail'd of Conqueſt; eſpecially
where they deſign'd it: And ſhe believ'd <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
would be glad, at leaſt, to quench that
Flame in himſelf, by an Amour with her,
which was kindl'd by the young Princeſs of—his
Siſter.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, and a thouſand other Self-flatteries,
all vain and indiſcreet, took up her waking
Nights, and now more retir'd Days; while Love,
to make her truly wretched, ſuffer'd her to ſooth
herſelf with fond Imaginations; not ſo much as
permitting her Reaſon to plead one Moment to
ſave her from Undoing: She wou'd not ſuffer
it to tell her, he had taken holy Orders, made
ſacred and ſolemn Vows of everlaſting Chaſtity,
that 'twas impoſſible he cou'd marry her, or lay
before her any Argument that might prevent
her Ruine; but Love, mad, malicious Love was
always call'd to Counſel, and, like eaſie Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
ſhe had no Ears, but for Flatterers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47213:100"/>
Well then, ſhe is reſolv'd to love, without
conſidering to what End, and what muſt be
the Conſequence of ſuch an Amour. She now
miſs'd no Day of being at that little Church,
where ſhe had the Happineſs, or rather, the
Misfortune (ſo Love ordain'd) to ſee this Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher
of her Heart and Soul; and every Day
ſhe took new Fire from his lovely Eyes: Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
unknown and unwillingly he gave her
Wounds, and the Difficulty of her Cure made
her Rage the more: She burnt, ſhe languiſh'd,
and dy'd for the young Innocent, who knew
not he was the Author of ſo much Miſchief.</p>
                     <p>Now ſhe reſolves a thouſand Ways in her
tortur'd Mind, to let him know her Anguiſh, and
at laſt pitch'd upon that of writing to him ſoft
Billets, which ſhe had learnt the Art of doing;
or if ſhe had not, ſhe had now Fire enough to
inſpire her with all that cou'd charm and move.
Theſe ſhe deliver'd to a young Wench, who
waited on her, and whom ſhe had entirely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
to her Intereſt, to give to a certain Lay-Brother
of the Order, who was a very ſimple,
harmleſs Wretch, and who ſerv'd in the Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
in the nature of a Cook in the Monaſtery of
<hi>Cordeliers:</hi> She gave him Gold to ſecure his
Faith and Service; and not knowing from
whence they came (with ſo good Credenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als)
he undertook to deliver the Letters to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Franciſco;</hi> which Letters were all after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as you ſhall hear, produc'd in open
Court. Theſe Letters fail'd not to come eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Day; and the Sence of the firſt was, to tell
him that a very beautiful young Lady, of a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47213:100"/>
great Fortune, was in love with him, without
naming her; but it came as from a third Perſon,
to let him know the Secret, that ſhe deſir'd he
wou'd let her know whether ſhe might hope
any Return from him; aſſuring him, he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but only ſee the fair Languiſher, to confeſs
himſelf her Slave.</p>
                     <p>This Letter being deliver'd him, he read
by himſelf, and was ſurpriz'd to receive
Words of this nature, being ſo great a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in that place; and cou'd not imagine, or
wou'd not give himſelf the trouble of gueſſing
who this ſhould be, becauſe he never deſign'd
to make Returns.</p>
                     <p>The next Day <hi>Miranda,</hi> finding no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from her Meſſenger of Love, in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſends another (impatient of Delay) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
that ſhe who ſuffer'd the Shame of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and Imploring, was the Perſon herſelf
who ador'd him. 'Twas there her raging Love
made her ſay all things that diſcover'd the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of its Flame, and propoſe to flee with him
to any part of the World, if he wou'd quit
the Convent; that ſhe had a Fortune conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
enough to make him happy, and that his
Youth and Quality were not given him to ſo
unprofitable an End as to loſe themſelves in a
Convent, where Poverty and Eaſe was all
their Buſineſs. In fine, ſhe leaves nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urg'd
that might debauch and invite him; not
forgetting to ſend him her own Character of
Beauty, and left him to judge of her Wit and
Spirit by her Writing, and her Love by the
Extremity of Paſſion ſhe profeſs'd. To all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47213:101"/>
which, the lovely Friar made no Return, as
believing a gentle Capitulation or Exhortation
to her wou'd but inflame her the more, and
give new Occaſions for her continuing to
write. All her Reaſonings, falſe and vicious,
he deſpis'd, pities the Error of her Love, and
was Proof againſt all ſhe could plead. Yet
notwithſtanding his Silence, which left her in
doubt, and more tormented her, ſhe ceas'd
not to purſue him with her Letters, varying
her Style; ſometimes all wanton, looſe and
raving; ſometimes feigning a Virgin-modeſty
all over, accuſing herſelf, blaming her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and ſiging her Deſtiny, as one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to the ſhameful Diſcovery by the Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Vow and Habit, asking his Pity and
Forgiveneſs; urging him in Charity to uſe his
Fatherly Care to perſwade and reaſon with her
wild Deſires, and by his Councel drive the
God from her Heart, whoſe Tyranny was
worſe than that of a Fiend; and he did not
know what his pious Advice might do. But
ſtill ſhe writes in vain, in vain ſhe varies her
Style, by a Cunning, peculiar to a Maid poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
with ſuch a ſort of Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>This cold Neglect was ſtill Oil to the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lamp, and ſhe tries yet more Arts, which
for want of right Thinking, were as fruitleſs.
She has recourſe to Preſents; her Letters came
loaded with Rings of great price, and Jewels,
which Fops of Quality had given her. Many
of this ſort he receiv'd, before he knew where
to return 'em, or how; and on this Occaſion
alone he ſent her a Letter, and reſtor'd her
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47213:101"/>
Trifles, as he call'd 'em: But his Habit having
not made him forget his Quality and Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he writ to her with all the profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
imaginable; believing by her Preſents,
and the Liberality with which we parted with
'em, that ſhe was of Quality. But the whole
Letter, as he told me afterwards, was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
her from the Honour ſhe did him, by
loving him; urging a thouſand Reaſons, ſolid
and pious, and aſſuring her, he had wholly
devoted the reſt of his Days to Heaven, and
had no need of thoſe gay Trifles ſhe had ſent
him, which were only fit to adorn Ladies ſo
fair as herſelf, and who had buſineſs with this
glittering World, which he diſdain'd, and had
for ever abandon'd. He ſent her a thouſand
Bleſſings, and told her, ſhe ſhou'd be ever in
his Prayers, though not in his Heart, as ſhe
deſired: And abundance of Goodneſs more he
expreſs'd, and Councel he gave her, which had
the ſame Effect with his Silence; it made her
Love but the more, and the more impatient
ſhe grew: She now had a new Occaſion to
write, ſhe now is charm'd with his Wit; this
was the new Subject. She rallies his Reſolution,
and endeavours to re-call him to the World,
by all the Arguments that Humane Invention
is capable of.</p>
                     <p>But when ſhe had above four Months lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
thus in vain, not miſſing one Day,
wherein ſhe went not to ſee him, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
herſelf to him; ſhe reſolv'd, as her
laſt Effort, to ſhew her Perſon, and ſee what
that, aſſiſted by her Tears, and ſoft Words
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47213:102"/>
from her Mouth, cou'd do, to prevail upon
him.</p>
                     <p>It happen'd to be on the Eve of that Day
when ſhe was to receive the Sacrament, that
ſhe, covering herſelf with her Veil, came to
<hi>Veſpers,</hi> purpoſing to make choice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Friar for her Confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>She approach'd him; and as ſhe did ſo, ſhe
trembl'd with Love: At laſt ſhe cry'd,</hi> Father,
my Confeſſor is gone for ſome time from the Town,
and I am oblig'd to morrow to receive, and beg you
will be pleas'd to take my Confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>He cou'd not refuſe her; and let her into
the <hi>Sacriſte,</hi> where there is a Confeſſion-Chair,
in which he ſeated himſelf; and on one ſide of
him ſhe kneel'd down, over againſt a little Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
where the Prieſts Robes lie, on which was
plac'd ſome lighted Wax-Candles, that made
the little place very light and ſplendid, which
ſhone full upon <hi>Miranda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the little Preparation uſual in Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſhe turn'd up her Veil, and diſcover'd to
his View the moſt wond'rous Object of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he had ever ſeen, dreſs'd in all the Glory of
a young Bride; her Hair and Stomacher full of
Diamonds, that gave a Luſtre all dazling to
her brighter Face and Eyes. He was ſurpriz'd
at her amazing Beauty, and queſtion'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſaw a Woman or an Angel at his Feet.
Her Hands, which were elevated, as if in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
ſeem'd to be form'd of poliſh'd Alabaſter;
and he confeſs'd, he had never ſeen any thing
in Nature ſo perfect, and ſo admirable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:47213:102"/>
He had ſome pain to compoſe himſelf to
hear her Confeſſion, and was oblig'd to turn
away his Eyes, that his Mind might not be
perplex'd with an Object ſo diverting; when
<hi>Miranda,</hi> opening the fineſt Mouth in the
World, and diſcovering new Charms, began
her Confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Holy Father (<hi>ſaid ſhe;</hi>) amongst the Number of
my vile Offences, that which afflicts me to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Degree, is, that I am in Love: Not (<hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
ſhe</hi>) that I believe ſimple, and vertuous Love
a Sin, when 'tis plac'd on an Object proper and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
but, my dear Father, (<hi>ſaid ſhe, and wept,</hi>)
I love with a Violence which cannot be contain'd
within the Bounds of Reaſon, Moderation, or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
I love a Man whom I cannot poſſeſs without
a Crime, and a Man who cannot make me happy
without become perjur'd. Is he marry'd? (<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
the Father.</hi>) No; (<hi>anſwer'd</hi> Miranda.
Are you ſo? (<hi>continu'd he.</hi>) Neither; (<hi>ſaid ſhe</hi>)
Is he too near ally'd to you? (<hi>ſaid</hi> Franciſco:) a
Brother, or Relation? Neither of theſe, (<hi>ſaid ſhe:</hi>)
He is unenjoy'd, unpromis'd; and ſo am I: Nothing
oppoſes our Happineſs, or makes my Love a Vice,
but You:—'Tis you deny me Life: 'Tis you
that forbids my Flame: 'Tis you will have me die,
and ſeek my Remedy in my Grave, when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of Tortures, Wounds and Flames. O cruel
Charmer, 'tis for you I languiſh; and here, at your
Feet, implore that Pity which all my Addreſſes have
fail'd of procuring me.—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:103"/>
With that, perceiving he was about to riſe
from his Seat, ſhe held him by his Habit, and
vow'd ſhe wou'd in that poſture follow him,
where-ever he flew from her. She elevated
her Voice ſo loud, he was afraid ſhe might be
heard, and therefore ſuffer'd her to force him
into his Chair again; where being ſeated, he
began, in the moſt paſſionate Terms imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to diſſuade her; but finding ſhe but the
more perſiſted in Eagerneſs of Paſſion, he us'd
all the tender Aſſurance that he cou'd force
from himſelf, that he wou'd have for her all
the Reſpect, Eſteem and Friendſhip that he
was capable of paying; that he had a real
Compaſſion for her; and at laſt, ſhe prevail'd
ſo far with him by her Sighs and Tears, as
to own he had a Tenderneſs for her, and that
he cou'd not behold ſo many Charms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being ſenſibly touch'd by them, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all thoſe Effects that a Maid ſo young and
fair cauſes in the Souls of Men of Youth
and Senſe: But that, as he was aſſured, he
cou'd never be ſo happy to marry her, and as
certain he cou'd not grant any thing but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Paſſion, he humbly beſought her not
to expect more from him than ſuch; and then
began to tell her how ſhort Life was, and
tranſitory its Joys; how ſoon ſhe wou'd grow
weary of Vice, and how often change to
find real Repoſe in it, but never arrive to it.
He made an End by new Aſſurance of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Friendſhip, but utterly forbad her to
hope.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:47213:103"/>
Behold her now deny'd, refus'd and defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with all her pleading Youth, Beauty,
Tears, and Knees, imploring, as ſhe lay, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faſt his <hi>Scapular,</hi> and embracing his Feet.
What ſhall ſhe do? She ſwells with Pride,
Love, Indignation and Deſire, her burning
Heart is burſting with Deſpair, her Eyes grow
fierce, and from Grief, ſhe riſes to a Storm;
and in her Agony of Paſſion, which looks all
diſdainful, haughty, and full of Rage, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to revile him, as the pooreſt of Animals:
Tells him, his Soul was dwindled to the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Habit, and his Vows of Poverty
were ſuited to his degenerate Mind. <hi>And</hi>
(ſaid ſhe) <hi>ſince all my nobler Ways have fail'd
me; and that, for a little hypocritical Devotion,
you reſolve to loſe the greatest Bleſſings of Life, and
to ſacrifice me to your Religious Pride and Vanity, I
will either force you to abandon that dull Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
or you ſhall die, to prove your Sanctity
real. Therefore anſwer me immediately, anſwer
my Flame, my raging Fire, which your Eyes have
kindled; or here, in this very Moment, I will ruine
thee; and make no Scruple of revenging the Pains
I ſuffer, by that which ſhall take away your Life
and Honour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The trembling young Man, who, all this
while, with extream Anguiſh of Mind, and
Fear of the dire Reſult, had liſten'd to her
Ravings, full of Dread, demanded what ſhe
wou'd have him do. When ſhe reply'd,—</hi>
Do that which thy Youth and Beauty were ordain'd
to do:—This place is private, a Sacred Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
reigns here, and no one dares to pry into the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47213:104"/>
Secrets of this holy Place: We are as ſecure from
Fears of Interruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in Deſarts uninhabited, or
Caves forſaken by wild Beaſts. The Tapers too ſhall
veil their Lights, and only that glimmering Lamp
ſhall be witneſs of our dear Stealths of Love—Come
to my Arms, my trembling, longing Arms;
and curſe the Folly of thy Bigottry, that has made
thee ſo long loſe a Bleſſing, for which ſo many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſigh in vain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>At theſe Words ſhe roſe from his Feet, and
ſnatching him in her Arms, he cou'd not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himſelf from receiving a thouſand Kiſſes
from the lovely Mouth of the charming Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;
after which, ſhe ran herſelf, and in an
inſtant put out the Candles. But he cry'd to
her,</hi> In vain, O too indiſcreet Fair Onè; in vain
you put out the Light; for Heaven ſtill has Eyes,
and will look down upon my broken Vows. I own
your Power, I own I have all the Senſe in the World
of your charming Touches; I am frail Fleſh and
Blood, but yet—yet—yet I can reſist;
and I prefer my Vows to all your powerful Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
—I will be deaf and blind, and guard
my Heart with Walls of Ice, and make you know,
that when the Flames of true Devotion are kindled
in a Heart, it puts out all other Fires; which are
as ineffectual, as Candles lighted in the Face of the
Sun.—Go, vain Wanton, and repent, and
mortifie that Blood which has ſo ſhamefully betray'd
thee, and which will one Day ruine both thy Soul
and Body.—</p>
                     <p>At theſe Words <hi>Miranda,</hi> more enrag'd, the
nearer ſhe imagin'd herſelf to Happineſs,
made no Reply; but throwing herſelf, in that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47213:104"/>
inſtant, into the Confeſſing-Chair, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
pulling the young Friar into her Lap,
ſhe elevated her Voice to ſuch a degree, in cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, <hi>Help, help: A Rape: Help, help,</hi> that
ſhe was heard all over the Church, which was
full of People at the Evening's Devotion;
who flock'd about the Door of the <hi>Sacriſti;</hi>
which was ſhut with a Spring-lock on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
but they durſt not open the Door.</p>
                     <p>'Tis eaſily to be imagin'd, in what Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our young Friar was, at this laſt deviliſh
Stratagem of his wicked Miſtreſs. He ſtrove
to break from thoſe Arms that held him ſo
faſt; and his buſtling to get away, and hers
to retain him, diſorder'd her Hair and Habit
to ſuch a degree, as gave the more Credit to
her falſe Accuſation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Fathers had a Door on the other ſide,
by which they uſually enter'd, to dreſs in this
little Room; and at the Report that was in an
inſtant made 'em, they haſted thither, and
found</hi> Miranda <hi>and the good Father very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decently
ſtrugling; which they miſ-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as</hi> Miranda <hi>deſir'd; who, all in Tears,
immediately threw herſelf at the Feet of the
Provincial, who was one of thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd;
and cry'd,</hi> O holy Father, revenge an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Maid, undone and lost to Fame and Honour,
by that vile Monſter, born of Goats, nurs'd by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and bred up on ſavage Mountains, where
Humanity and Religion are Strangers. For, O
holy Father, cou'd it have enter'd into the Heart of
Man, to have done ſo barbarous and horrid a Deed,
as to attempt the Virgin-Honour of an unſpotted
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47213:105"/>
Maid, and one of my Degree, even in the Moment
of my Confeſſion, in that holy time, when I was
proſtrate before him and Heaven, confeſſing thoſ
Sins that preſs'd my tender Conſcience; even then
to load my Soul with the blackest of Infamies, to
add to my Number a Weight that must ſink me to
Hell? Alas! under the Security of his innocent
Looks, his holy Habit, and his awful Function, I
was lead into this Room, to make my Confeſſion;
where, he locking the Door, I had no ſooner began,
but he gazing on me, took Fire at my fatal Beauty;
and ſtarting up, put out the Candles, and caught
me in his Arms; and raiſing me from the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſet me in the Confeſſion-Chair; and then—Oh,
ſpare me the reſt.</p>
                     <p>With that a Shower of Tears burſt from
her fair diſſembling Eyes, and Sobs ſo natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acted, and ſo well manag'd, as left no
Doubt upon the good Men, but all ſhe had
ſpoken was Truth.</p>
                     <p>—At firſt, (<hi>proceeded ſhe,</hi>) I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to bring ſo great a Scandal on his Order,
as to cry out; but ſtruggl'd as long as I had Breath,
pleaded the Heinouſneſs of the Crime; urging my
Quality, and the Danger of the Attempt. But he,
deaf as the Winds, and ruffling as a Storm, purſu'd
his wild Deſign with ſo much Force and Inſolence,
as I at laſt, unable to reſiſt, was wholly vanquiſh'd,
robb'd of my native Purity: With what Life and
Breath I had, I call'd for Aſſiſtance, both from
Men and Heaven; but oh, alas! your Succours
come too late:—You find me here a wretched,
undone and raviſh'd Maid. Revenge me, Fathers;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47213:105"/>

from ever being proclaim'd o'er the World;
or my Tongue will be eternally reproaching you, and
curſing the wicked Author of my Infamy.</p>
                     <p>She ended as ſhe began, with a thouſand
Sighs and Tears; and receiv'd from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
all Aſſurances of Revenge.</p>
                     <p>The innocent betray'd Victim, all this while
ſhe was ſpeaking, heard her with an Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that may eaſily be imagin'd; yet ſhew'd
no extravagant Signs of it, as thoſe wou'd do,
who feign it to be thought innocent, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
really ſo, he bore, with an humble, modeſt,
and bluſhing Countenance, all her Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Which ſilent Shame they miſtook for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Signs of his Guilt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When the Provincial demanded, with an
unwonted Severity in his Eyes and Voice, what
he cou'd anſwer for himſelf; calling him Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner
of his ſacred Vows, and Infamy to the
holy Order; the Injur'd, but the innocently
Accus'd, only reply'd,</hi> May Heaven forgive that
bad Woman, and bring her to Repentance: For his
part, he was not ſo much in love with Life, as to
uſe many Arguments to juſtifie his Innocence; unleſs
it were to free that <hi>Order</hi> from a Scandal, of
which he had the Honour to be profeſs'd: But as for
himſelf, Life or Death were things indifferent to him,
who heartily deſpis'd the World.</p>
                     <p>He ſaid no more, and ſuffer'd himſelf to be
led before the Magiſtrate; who committed
him to Priſon, upon the Accuſation of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47213:106"/>
Beauty; who, with ſo much feign'd
Sorrow, proſecuted the Matter, even to his
Tryal and Condemnation; where he refus'd
to make any great Defence for himſelf. But
being daily viſited by all the Religious, both of
his own, and other Orders, they oblig'd him
(ſome of 'em knowing the Auſterity of his
Life, others his Cauſe of Griefs that firſt
brought him into Orders, and others pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a nearer Knowledge, even of his Soul it
ſelf) to ſtand upon his Juſtification, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
what he knew of that wicked Woman;
whoſe Life had not been ſo exemplary for
Vertue, not to have given the World a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Suſpicions of her Lewdneſs and Proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</p>
                     <p>The daily Importunities of theſe Fathers
made him produce her Letters: But as he had
all the Gown-Men on his ſide, ſhe had all the
Hats and Feathers on hers; all the Men of
Quality taking her part, and all the Church-men
his. They heard his daily Proteſtations and
Vows, but not a Word of what paſſed at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
was yet diſcover'd: He held that as a
Secret ſacred on his part; and what was ſaid
in nature of a Confeſſion, was not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd,
though his Life depended on the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.
But as to the Letters, they were
forc'd from him, and expoſs'd; however,
Matters were carry'd with ſo high a Hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, that they ſerv'd for no Proof at
all of his Innocence, and he was at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to be burn'd at the Market-place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47213:106"/>
After his Sentence was paſs'd, the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Prieſts made their Addreſſes to Marqueſs
<hi>Caſteil Roderigo,</hi> the then Governour of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
for a Reprieve; which, after much a-do,
was granted him for ſome Weeks, but with an
abſolute Denial of Pardon; ſo prevailing were
the young Cavaliers of his Court, who were
all Adorers of this Fair <hi>Jilt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About this time, while the poor, innocent,
young <hi>Henrick</hi> was thus languiſhing in Priſon,
in a dark and diſmal Dungeon, and <hi>Miranda,</hi>
cured of her Love, was triumphing in her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
expecting, and daily giving new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts;
and who, by this time, had re-aſſum'd
all her wonted Gaiety, there was great Noiſe
about the Town, that a Prince of mighty
Name, and fam'd for all the Excellencies of
his Sex, was arrived; a Prince young, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
attended, call'd Prince <hi>Tarquin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We had often heard of this Great Man, and
that he was making his Travels in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Germany:</hi> And we had alſo heard, that ſome
Years before, he being about Eighteen Years
of Age, in the time when our King <hi>Charles</hi> of
Bleſſed Memory was in <hi>Bruxels,</hi> in the laſt
Year of his Baniſhment, that all on a ſudden,
this young Man roſe up upon 'em like the Sun,
all glorious and dazling, demanding Place of
all the Princes in that Court. And when his
Pretence was demanded, he own'd himſelf
Prince <hi>Tarquin,</hi> of the Race of the laſt Kings
of <hi>Rome,</hi> made good his Title, and took his
Place accordingly. After that, he travell'd
for about ſix Years up and down the World,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47213:107"/>
and then arriv'd at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> about the time of
my being ſent thither by His late Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps there could be nothing ſeen ſo
magnificent as this Prince: He was, as I ſaid,
extreamly handſome, from Head to Foot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
form'd, and he wanted nothing that
might adorn that native Beauty to the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
His Parts were ſuitable to the reſt:
He had an Accompliſhment fit for a Prince,
an Air haughty, but a Carriage affable, eaſie
in Converſation, and very Entertaining, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
and Good-natur'd, Brave and Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.
I have ſeen him paſs the Streets with
twelve Foot-men, and four Pages; the Pages
all in green Velvet Coats, lac'd with Gold,
and white Velvet Trunks; the Men in Cloth,
richly lac'd with Gold; his Coaches, and all
other Officers, ſuitable to a Great Man.</p>
                     <p>He was all the Diſcourſe of the Town;
ſome laughing at his Title, others reverencing
it: Some cry'd, that he was an Impoſtor;
others, that he had made his Title as plain, as
if <hi>Tarquin</hi> had reign'd but a Year ago. Some
made Friendſhips with him, others wou'd
have nothing to ſay to him; but all wonder'd
where this Revenue was, that ſupported this
Grandeur; and believ'd, though he cou'd
make his Deſcent from the <hi>Roman</hi> Kings very
well out, that he cou'd not lay ſo good a Claim
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Land. Thus every Body med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with what they had nothing to do; and,
as in other places, thought themſelves on the

imagin'd the worſt.</p>

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:47213:107"/>
But the Men might be of what Opinion
they pleas'd concerning him; the Ladies were
all agreed that he was a Prince, and a young,
handſome Prince, and a Prince not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted:
He had all their Wiſhes, all their Eyes,
and all their Hearts: They now dreſs'd only
for him; and what Church he grac'd, was
ſure, that Day, to have the Beauties, and all
that thought themſelves ſo.</p>
                     <p>You may believe, our amorous <hi>Miranda</hi>
was not the laſt Conqueſt he made. She no
ſooner heard of him, which was as ſoon as he
arriv'd, but ſhe fell in love with his very Name.
<hi>Jeſu!</hi>—A young King of <hi>Rome!</hi> Oh, 'twas ſo
novel, that ſhe doated on the Title; and had
not car'd whether the reſt had been Man or
Monkey almoſt: She was reſolv'd to be the
<hi>Lucretia,</hi> that this young <hi>Tarquin</hi> ſhou'd raviſh.</p>
                     <p>To this End, ſhe was no ſooner up the
next Day, but ſhe ſent him a <hi>Billet Deaux,</hi>
aſſuring him how much ſhe admir'd his Fame;
and that being a Stranger in the Town, ſhe
begg'd the Honour of introducing him to all
the <hi>Belle</hi>-Converſations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which he took
for the Invitation of ſome <hi>Coquet,</hi> who had
Intereſt in fair Ladies; and civilly return'd
her an Anſwer, that he wou'd wait on her.
She had him that Day watch'd to Church;
and impatient to ſee what ſhe heard ſo many
People flock to ſee, ſhe went alſo to the ſame
Church; thoſe ſanctified Abodes being too
often prophan'd by ſuch <hi>Devotees,</hi> whoſe Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is to ogle and enſnare.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:47213:108"/>
But what a Noiſe and Humming was heard
all over the Church, when <hi>Tarquin</hi> enter'd?
His Grace, his Mien, his Faſhion, his Beauty,
his Dreſs, and his Equipage ſurpriz'd all
that were preſent: And by the good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
and Care of <hi>Miranda,</hi> ſhe got to
kneel at the ſide of the Altar, juſt over againſt
the Prince; ſo that, if he wou'd, he cou'd not
avoid looking full upon her. She had turn'd
up her Veil, and all her Face and Shape ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
ſuch, and ſo inchanting, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd:
And her Beauty heighten'd with
Bluſhes, and her Eyes full of Spirit and Fire,
with Joy, to find the young <hi>Roman</hi> Monarch ſo
charming, ſhe appear'd like ſomething more
than mortal, and compell'd his Eyes to a fix'd
Gazing on her Face: She never glanc'd that
way, but ſhe met 'em; and then would feign
ſo modeſt a Shame, and Caſt her Eyes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with ſuch inviting Art, that he was wholly
raviſh'd and charm'd, and ſhe over-joy'd to
find he was ſo.</p>
                     <p>The Ceremony being ended, he ſent a
Page to follow that Lady home, himſelf pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
her to the Door of the Church; where he
took ſome Holy Water, and threw upon her, and
made her a profound Reverence. She forc'd
an innocent Look, and a modeſt Gratitude in
her Face, and bow'd, and paſs'd forward, half
aſſur'd of her Conqueſt; leaving him to go
home to his Lodging, and impatiently wait
the Return of his Page. And all the Ladies
who ſaw this firſt Beginning between the
Prince and <hi>Miranda,</hi> began to curſe and envy
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47213:108"/>
her Charms, who had depriv'd 'em of half their
Hopes.</p>
                     <p>After this, I need not tell you, he made
<hi>Miranda</hi> a Viſit; and from that Day, never
left her Apartment, but when he went home at
Nights, or unleſs he had Buſineſs; ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
was he conquer'd by this Fair One. But
the Biſhop, and ſeveral Men of Quality, in
Orders, that profeſs'd Friendſhip to him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
him from her Company; and ſpoke ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things to him, that might (if Love had
not made him blind) have reclaim'd him from
the Purſuit of his Ruin. But whatever they
truſted him with, ſhe had the Art to wind
herſelf about his Heart, and make him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel
all his Secrets; and then knew as well,
by feign'd Sighs and Tears, to make him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
all. So that he had no Faith, but for
her; and was wholly inchanted and bewitched
by her. At laſt, in ſpight of all that wou'd
have oppos'd it, he marry'd this famous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
poſſeſs'd by ſo many Great Men and
Strangers before, while all the World was pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
his Shame and Misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>Being marry'd, they took a great Houſe;
and as ſhe was indeed a great Fortune, and
now a great Princeſs, there was nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that was agreeable to their Quality; all
was ſplendid and magnificent. But all this
would not acquire 'em the World's Eſteem;
they had an Abhorrence for her former Life,
deſpis'd her; and for his eſpouſing a Woman
ſo infamous, they deſpis'd him. So that tho'
they admir'd, and gaz'd upon their Equipage,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47213:109"/>
and glorious Dreſs, they foreſaw the Ruin that
attended it; and paid her Quality little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
                     <p>She was no ſooner marri'd, but her Uncle
dy'd; and dividing his Fortune between <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa,</hi>
and her Siſter, and leaves the young Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs,
and all her Fortune, entirely in the Hands
of the Princeſs.</p>
                     <p>We will call this Siſter <hi>Alcidiana;</hi> ſhe was
about Fourteen Years of Age, and now had
choſen her Brother, the Prince, for her Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.
If <hi>Alcidiana</hi> were not altogether ſo
great a Beauty as her Siſter, ſhe had Charms
ſufficient to procure her a great many Lovers,
though her Fortune had not been ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as it was; but with that Addition, you
may believe, ſhe wanted no Courtſhips from
thoſe of the beſt Quality; though every Body
deplor'd her being under the Tutorage of a
Lady ſo expert in all the Vices of her Sex, and
ſo cunning a Manager of Sin as was the Princeſs;
who, on her part, fail'd not, by all the Careſſes,
and obliging Endearments, to engage the Mind
of this young Maid, and to ſubdue her wholly
to her Government. All her Senſes were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
regal'd with the moſt bewitching Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
they were capable of: She ſaw nothing
but Glory and Magnificence, heard nothing but
Muſick of the ſweeteſt Sounds; the richeſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes
employ'd her Smelling, and all ſhe eat
and touch'd was delicate and inviting; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too young to conſider, how this State and
Grandeur was to be continu'd, little imagin'd
her vaſt Fortune was every Day diminiſhing, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
its needleſs Support.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:47213:109"/>
When the Princeſs went to Church, ſhe
had her Gentleman bare before her, carrying
a great Velvet Cuſhion, with great Golden
Taſſels, for her to kneel on, and her Train
born up a moſt prodigious length; led by a
Gentleman-Uſher, bare; follow'd by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Footmen, Pages, and Women. And
in this State ſhe wou'd walk in the Streets, as
in thoſe Countries 'tis the Faſhion for the great
Ladies to do, who are well; and in her Train
two or three Coaches, and perhaps a rich Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
Chair embroider'd, wou'd follow in State.</p>
                     <p>'Twas thus for ſome time they liv'd, and the
Princeſs was daily preſs'd by young ſighing Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
for her Conſent to marry <hi>Alcidiana;</hi> but
ſhe had ſtill one Art or other to put 'em off,
and ſo continually broke all the great Matches
that were propos'd to her, notwithſtanding
their Kindred, and other Friends, had indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly
endeavour'd to make ſeveral great
Matches for her; but the Princeſs was ſtill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
in her Denial, and one way or other
broke all. At laſt it happen'd, there was one
propos'd yet more advantageous; a young
Count, with whom the young Maid grew
paſſionately in Love, and beſought her Siſter to
conſent that ſhe might have him, and got the
Prince to ſpeak in her behalf; but he had no
ſooner heard the ſecret Reaſons <hi>Miranda</hi> gave
him, but (entirely her Slave) he chang'd his
Mind, and ſuited it to hers, and ſhe, as before,
broke off that Amour; which ſo extreamly
incens'd <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> that ſhe, taking an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
got from her Guard, and ran away,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47213:110"/>
putting herſelf into the Hands of a wealthy
Merchant, her Kinſman, and one who bore the
greateſt Authority in the City; him ſhe chuſes
for her Guardian, reſolving to be no longer a
Slave to the Tyranny of her Siſter. And ſo
well ſhe ordered Matters, that ſhe writ to this
young Cavalier, her laſt Lover, and retrieved
him; who came back to <hi>Antwerp</hi> again, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
his Courtſhip.</p>
                     <p>Both Parties being agreed, it was no hard
Matter to perſwade all but the Princeſs. But
though ſhe oppoſed it, it was reſolved on, and
the Day appointed for Marriage, and the
Portion demanded; demanded only, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be payed, the beſt part of it being
ſpent. However, ſhe put 'em off from Day
to Day, by a thouſand frivolous Delays: And
when ſhe ſaw they would have recourſe to
Force, and that all her Magnificence would be
at an End, if the Law ſhould prevail againſt
her; and that, without this Siſter's Fortune,
ſhe could not long ſupport her Grandeur, ſhe
bethought herſelf of a Means to make it all
her own, by getting her Siſter made away;
but ſhe being out of her Tuition, ſhe was
not able to accompliſh ſo great a Deed of
Darkneſs: But ſince 'twas reſolv'd it muſt
be done, ſhe revolves on a Thouſand Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems;
and, at laſt, pitches upon an effectual
one.</p>
                     <p>She had a Page, called <hi>Van Brune;</hi> a Youth
of great Addreſs and Wit, and one ſhe had
long manag'd for her purpoſe. This Youth
was about Seventeen Years of Age, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47213:110"/>
beautiful; and in the time when <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi>
lived with the Princeſs, ſhe was a little
in Love with this handſome Boy; but 'twas
check'd in its Infancy, and never grew up to a
Flame: Nevertheleſs, <hi>Alcidiana</hi> retain'd ſtill a
ſort of Tenderneſs for him, while he burned in
good Earneſt with Love for the Princeſs.</p>
                     <p>The Princeſs one Day ordering this Page to
wait on her in her Cloſet, ſhe ſhut the Door;
and after a Thouſand Queſtions of what he
would undertake to ſerve her, the amorous
Boy finding himſelf alone, and careſs'd by
the fair Perſon he ador'd, with joyful Bluſhes
that beautify'd his Face, told her, <hi>There was
nothing upon Earth, he wou'd not do, to obey her
least Commands.</hi> She grew more familiar with
him, to oblige him; and ſeeing Love dance
in his Eyes, of which ſhe was ſo good a Judge,
ſhe treated him more like a Lover, than a
Servant; till at laſt the raviſh'd Youth, wholly
tranſported out of himſelf, fell at her Feet,
and impatiently implor'd to receive her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
quickly, that he might fly to execute
'em; for he was not able to bear her charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Words, Looks, and Touches, and retain
his Duty. At this ſhe ſmil'd, and told him,
the Work was of ſuch a Nature, as wou'd mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
all Flames about him; and he would
have more need of Rage, Envy, and Malice,
than the Aids of a Paſſion ſo ſoft as what ſhe
now found him capable of. He aſſur'd her,
he would ſtick at nothing, though even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Nature, to recompence for the
Boldneſs he now, through his Indiſcretion
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47213:111"/>
had diſcovered. She ſmiling, told him, he
had committed no Fault; and that poſſibly,
the Pay he ſhou'd receive for the Service ſhe
required at his Hands, ſhould be—what he
moſt wiſh'd for in the World. To this he
bowed to the Earth; and kiſſing her Feet,
bad her Command. And then ſhe boldly told
him, <hi>'Twas to kill her Siſter</hi> Alcidiana. The
Youth, without ſo much as ſtarting, or pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon the Matter, told her, <hi>It ſhould be done;</hi>
and bowing low, immediately went out of the
Cloſet. She called him back, and would have
given him ſome Inſtruction; but he refus'd it,
and ſaid, <hi>The Action, and the Contrivance ſhould
be all his own.</hi> And offering to go again, ſhe
—again recalled him; putting into his
Hand a Purſe of a Hundred Piſtoles, which
he took; and with a low Bow, departed.</p>
                     <p>He no ſooner left her Preſence, but he goes
directly and buys a Doſe of Poyſon, and
went immediately to the Houſe where <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana</hi>
lived; where deſiring to be brought to
her Preſence, he fell a weeping; and told her,
his Lady had fallen out with him, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
him her Service; and ſince, from a
Child, he had been brought up in the Family,
he humbly beſought <hi>Alcidiana</hi> to receive him
into hers, ſhe being in a few Days to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
There needed not much intreaty to a
thing that pleaſed her ſo well, and ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
received him to Penſion. And he
waited ſome Days on her, before he could
get an Opportunity to adminiſter his Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Potion: But one Night, when ſhe drunk
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47213:111"/>
Wine with roaſted Apples, which was uſual
with her; inſtead of Sugar, or with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
the baneful Drug was mixed, and ſhe drank
it down.</p>
                     <p>About this time, there was a great Talk of
this Page's coming from one Siſter, to go to
the other. And Prince <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who was
ignorant of the Deſign, from the Beginning
to the End, hearing ſome Men of Quality at
his Table ſpeaking of <hi>Van Brune</hi>'s Change
of Place (the Princeſs then keeping her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
upon ſome trifling Indiſpoſition) he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>That ſurely they were miſtaken, that he was
not diſmiſſed from the Princeſs's Service.</hi> And
calling ſome of his Servants, he asked for <hi>Van
Brune;</hi> and whether any thing had happened
between Her Highneſs and him, that had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
his being turned off. They alſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ignorant of this Matter; and thoſe who
had ſpoken of it, began to fancy there was ſome
Juggle in the Caſe, which Time would bring
to Light.</p>
                     <p>The enſuing Day 'twas all about the Town,
that <hi>Alcidiana</hi> was Poyſoned; and though not
dead, yet very near it; and that the Doctors
ſaid, ſhe had taken Mercury. So that there
was never ſo formidable a Sight as this Fair
young Creature; her Head and Body ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
her Eyes ſtarting out, her Face black, and
all deformed: So that diligent Search was
made, who it ſhould be that did this; who
gave her Drink and Meat. The Cook and
Butler were examined, the Footmen called to
an Account; but all concluded, ſhe received
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47213:112"/>
nothing, but from the Hand of her new Page,
ſince he came into her Service. He was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and ſhewed a thouſand guilty Looks:
And the Apothecary, then attending among
the Doctors, proved he had bought Mercury
of him three or four Days before; which he
could not deny; and making many Excuſes for
his buying it, betrayed him the more; ſo ill
he chanced to diſſemble. He was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſent to be examined by the Margrave or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
who made his <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and ſent him to
Priſon.</p>
                     <p>'Tis eaſie to imagine, in what Fears and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
the Princeſs was at this News: She took
her Chamber upon it, more to hide her guilty
Face, than for any Indiſpoſition. And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
applied ſuch Remedies to <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> ſuch
Antidotes againſt the Poiſon, that in a ſhort
time ſhe recovered; but loſt the fineſt Hair in
the World, and the Complexion of her Face
ever after.</p>
                     <p>It was not long before the Trials for Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals
came on; and the Day being arrived,
<hi>Van Brune</hi> was tried the firſt of all; every
Body having already read his Deſtiny, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as they wiſh'd it; and none would believe,
but juſt indeed as it was: So that for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
they hoped to ſee fall upon the Princeſs,
every one wiſhed he might find no Mercy, that
ſhe might ſhare of his Shame and Miſery.</p>
                     <p>The Seſſions-Houſe was filled that Day with
all the Ladies, and Chief of the Town, to hear
the Reſult of his Trial; and the ſad Youth
was brought loaden with Chains, and pale as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47213:112"/>
Death; where every Circumſtance being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proved againſt him, and he making but
a weak Defence for himſelf, he was Convicted,
and ſent back to Priſon, to receive his Sentence
of Death on the Morrow; where he owned all,
and who ſet him on to do it. He own'd 'twas
not Reward of Gain he did it for, but Hope he
ſhould command at his Pleaſure, the Poſſeſſion
of his Miſtreſs, the Princeſs; who ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him nothing, after having intruſted him
with ſo great a Secret; and that beſides, ſhe
had elevated him with the Promiſe of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Reward, and had dazl'd his young Heart
with ſo charming a Proſpect, that blind and
mad with Joy, he ruſhed forward, to gain the
deſired Prize, and thought on nothing but his
coming Happineſs: That he ſaw too late the
Follies of his preſumptuous Flame, and curſed
the deluding Flatteries of the fair Hypocrite,
who had ſoothed him to his Undoing: That he
was a miſerable Victim to her Wickedneſs;
and hoped, he ſhould warn all young Men, by
his Fall, to avoid the Diſſimulation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Fair: That he hoped, they would have
Pity on his Youth, and attribute his Crime to
the ſubtile Perſuaſions alone of his Miſtreſs, the
Princeſs: And that ſince <hi>Alcidiana</hi> was not
dead, they would grant him Mercy, and permit
him to live to repent of his grievous Crime, in
ſome Part of the World, whither they might
baniſh him.</p>
                     <p>He ended with Tears, that fell in abundance
from his Eyes; and immediately the Princeſs
was apprehended, and brought to Priſon, to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47213:113"/>
the ſame Priſon, where yet the poor young Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Franciſco</hi> was languiſhing, he having been
from Week to Week reprieved, by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Fathers; and poſſibly ſhe there
had time to make ſome Reflections.</p>
                     <p>You may imagine <hi>Tarquin</hi> left no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſaied,
to prevent the Impriſonment of the
Princeſs, and the Publick Shame and Infamy
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e was likely to undergo in this Affair: But
the whole City being over-joyed that ſhe ſhould
be puniſh'd, as an Author of all this Miſchief,
were ſo generally bent againſt her, both Prieſts,
Magiſtrates, and People; the whole Force of
the Stream running that way, ſhe found no
more Favour than the meaneſt Criminal. The
Prince therefore, when he ſaw 'twas impoſſible
to reſcue her from the Hands of Juſtice, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
with Grief unſpeakable, what he could
not prevent; and led her himſelf to the Priſon,
followed by all his People, in as much State,
as if he had been going to his Marriage;
where, when ſhe came, ſhe was as well attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſerved as before, he never ſtirring one
Moment from her.</p>
                     <p>The next Day ſhe was tried in open and
common Court; where ſhe appeared in Glory,
led by <hi>Tarquin,</hi> and attended according to her
Quality: And ſhe could not deny all the Page
had alledged againſt her, who was brought
thither alſo in Chains; and after a great many
Circumſtances, ſhe was found Guilty, and both
received Sentence; the Page to be hanged 'till
he was dead, on a Gibbet, in the Market-place;
and the Princeſs to ſtand under the Gibbet,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47213:113"/>
with a Rope about her Neck, the other end of
which was to be faſtned to the Gibbet where
the Page was hanging; and to have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
in large Characters, upon her Back
and Breaſt, of the Cauſe why: Where ſhe
was to ſtand from Ten in the Morning, to
Twelve.</p>
                     <p>This Sentence, the People, with one accord,
believed too favourable for ſo ill a Woman,
whoſe Crimes deſerved Death, equal to that
of <hi>Van Brune:</hi> Nevertheleſs, there were ſome
who ſaid, it was infinitely more ſevere than
Death itſelf.</p>
                     <p>The following <hi>Friday</hi> was the Day of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and one need not tell of the abundance
of People, who were flocked together in the
Market-place: And all the Windows were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
down, and filled with Spectators, and the
Tops of Houſes; when at the Hour appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the fatal Beauty appeared. She was dreſs'd
in a black Velvet Gown, with a rich Row of
Diamonds all down the fore-part of her Breaſt,
and a great Knot of Diamonds at the Peak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind;
and a Petticoat of flowered Gold, very
rich, and laced; with all Things elſe ſuitable:
A Gentleman carried her great Velvet Cuſhion
before her, on which her Prayer-Book, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered,
was laid; her Train was born up
by a Page, and the Prince led her, bare; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by his Foot-men, Pages, and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of his Houſe.</p>
                     <p>When they arrived to the Place of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Cuſhion was laid on the Ground, upon
a <hi>Portugal</hi>-Mat, ſpread there for that purpoſe;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47213:114"/>
and the Princeſs ſtood on the Cuſhion, with
her Prayer-Book in her Hand, and a Prieſt by
her ſide; and was accordingly tied up to the
Gibbet.</p>
                     <p>She had not ſtood there ten Minutes, but ſhe
had the Mortification, (at leaſt, one would
think it ſo to her) to ſee her ſad Page, <hi>Van
Brune,</hi> approach; fair as an Angel, but lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
and pale. That Sight moved all the
Beholders with as much Pity, as that of the
Princeſs did Diſdain and Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>He was dreſſed all in Mourning, and very fine
Linnen; bare-headed, with his own Hair, the
faireſt that could be ſeen, hanging all in Curls
on his Back and Shoulders, very long. He
had a Prayer-Book of black Velvet in his Hand,
and behaved himſelf with much Penitence and
Devotion.</p>
                     <p>When he came under the Gibbet, he ſeeing
his Miſtreſs in that Condition, ſhewed an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Concern, and his fair Face was covered
over with Bluſhes; and falling at her Feet, he
humbly ask'd her Pardon, for having been the
Occaſion of ſo great an Infamy to her, by a
weak Confeſſion, which the Fears of Youth,
and Hopes of Life, had obliged him to make,
ſo greatly to her Diſhonour; for indeed, he
had wanted that Manly Strength, to bear the
Efforts of dying as he ought, in Silence, rather
than of committing ſo great a Crime againſt
his Duty, and Honour itſelf; and that he could
not die in Peace, unleſs ſhe would forgive him.
The Princeſs only nodded her Head, and cried,
<hi>I do.</hi>—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:47213:114"/>
And after having ſpoken a little to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Confeſſor, who was with him, he chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
mounted the Ladder; and in the ſight of
the Princeſs, he was turned off, while a loud
Cry was heard through all the Market-place,
eſpecially from the fair Sex; he hanging there
'till the time the Princeſs was to depart: And
then ſhe was put into a rich embroidered Chair,
and carried away; <hi>Tarquin</hi> going into his; for
he had all that time ſtood ſupporting the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
under the Gallows, and was very weary.
She was ſent back, 'till her Releaſement came;
which was that Night, about Seven of the
Clock; and then ſhe was conducted to her own
Houſe in great State, with a Dozen White
Wax-flambeaus about her Chair.</p>
                     <p>If the Affairs of <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> and her Friends,
before were impatient of having the Portion
out of the Hands of theſe Extravagants, 'tis
not to be imagined, but they were now much
more ſo; and the next Day they ſent an Officer,
according to Law, to demand it; or to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the Prince to give Reaſons, why he would
not. And the Officer received for Anſwer,
That the Money ſhould be called in, and paid
in ſuch a time; ſetting a certain Time, which
I have not been ſo curious as to retain, or put
in my Journal Obſervations; but I am ſure it
was not long, as may be eaſily imagin'd; for
they every Moment, ſuſpected the Prince wou'd
pack up, and be gone ſome time, or other, on
the ſudden; and for that Reaſon they would
not truſt him without Bail, or two Officers to
remain in his Houſe, to watch that nothing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47213:115"/>
ſhould be removed, or touched. As for Bail,
or Security, he could give none; every one
ſlunk their Heads out of the Collar, when it
came to that: So that he was obliged, at his
own Expence, to maintain Officers in his
Houſe.</p>
                     <p>The Princeſs finding herſelf reduced to the
laſt Extremity, and that ſhe muſt either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Value of a Hundred thouſand Crowns,
or ſee the Prince, her Husband, lodged for
ever in a Priſon, and all their Glory vaniſh;
and that it was impoſſible to fly, ſince guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
ſhe had recourſe to an Extremity, worſe
than the Affair of <hi>Van Brune.</hi> And in order to
this, ſhe firſt puts on a World of Sorrow and
Concern, for what ſhe feared might arrive to
the Prince: And indeed, if ever ſhe ſhed Tears
which ſhe did not diſſemble, it was upon this
Occaſion. But here ſhe almoſt over-acted:
She ſtirred not from her Bed, and refuſed to
Eat, or Sleep, or ſee the Light; ſo that the
Day being ſhut out of her Chamber, ſhe lived
by Wax-Lights, and refuſed all Comfort and
Conſolation.</p>
                     <p>The Prince, all raving with Love, tender
Compaſſion, and Grief, never ſtirred from her
Bed-ſide, nor ceaſed to implore, that ſhe would
ſuffer herſelf to live. But ſhe, who was not
now ſo paſſionately in Love with <hi>Tarquin,</hi> as
ſhe was with the Prince; not ſo fond of the
Man, as his Titles, and of Glory, foreſaw the
total Ruin of the laſt, if not prevented, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
the Payment of this great Sum; which
could no otherwiſe be, than by the Death of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47213:115"/>
                        <hi>Alcidiana:</hi> And therefore, without ceaſing, ſhe
wept, and cried out, <hi>She could not live, unleſs</hi>
Alcidiana <hi>dy'd. This</hi> Alcidiana, (continued
ſhe) <hi>who has been the Author of my Shame; who
has expoſed me under a Gibbet, in the publick
Market-place—Oh!—I am deaf to all
Reaſon, blind to Natural Affection. I renounce her,
I hate her as my Mortal Foe, my Stop to Glory, and
the Finiſher of my Days, e'er half my Race of Life
be run.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then throwing her falſe, but ſhowy, charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arms, about the Neck of her Heart-breaking
Lord, and Lover, who lay ſighing,
and liſtening by her Side, he was charmed
and bewitched into ſaying all Things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed
her: And laſtly, told her, Alcidiana
<hi>ſhould be no longer an Obſtacle to her Repoſe; but
that, if ſhe would look up, and cast her Eyes of
Sweetneſs and Love upon him, as heretofore; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
her Sorrow, and redeem her lost Health, he
would take what Meaſures ſhe ſhould propoſe, to
diſpatch this fatal Stop to her Happineſs, out of the
way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Words fail'd not to make her careſs
him in the moſt endearing Manner, that Love
and Flattery could invent; and ſhe kiſſed him
to an Oath, a ſolemn Oath, to perform what
he had promiſed; and he vowed liberally. And
ſhe aſſumed in an inſtant, her Good Humour,
and ſuffered a Supper to be prepared, and did
eat; which, in many Days before ſhe had not
done; ſo obſtinate and powerful was ſhe in
Diſſembling well.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:47213:116"/>
The next Thing to be conſidered was, which
Way this Deed was to be done; for they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not, but when 'twas done, all the World
would lay it upon the Princeſs, as done by her
Command: But ſhe urged, Suſpicion was no
Proof; and that they never put to Death any
one, but when they had great and certain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
who were the Offenders. She was
ſure of her own Conſtancy, that Racks and
Tortures ſhould never get the Secret from her
Breaſt; and if he were as confident on his
part, there was no Danger. Yet this Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
ſhe made, towards the laying the Fact
on others, that ſhe cauſed ſeveral Letters to be
written from <hi>Germany,</hi> as from the Relations
of <hi>Van Brune,</hi> who threatned <hi>Alcidiana</hi> with
Death, for depriving their Kinſman (who was
a Gentleman) of his Life, tho' he had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away hers. And it was the Report of the
Town, how this young Maid was threatned.
And indeed, the Death of the Page had ſo
afflicted a great many, that <hi>Alcidiana</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
herſelf abundance of Enemies upon that
Account, becauſe ſhe might have ſaved him if
ſhe had pleaſed; but on the contrary, ſhe was
a Spectator, and in full Health and Vigour, at
his Execution: And People were not ſo much
concerned for her at this Report, as they would
have been.</p>
                     <p>The Prince, who now had, by reaſoning the
Matter ſoberly with <hi>Miranda,</hi> found it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to diſpatch <hi>Alcidiana;</hi> he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himſelf, and with his own Hand, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
it; not daring to truſt to any of his moſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47213:116"/>
Favourite Servants, tho' he had many, who,
poſſibly, would have obeyed him; for they
loved him as he deſerved; and ſo would all the
World, had he not been ſo purely deluded by
this fair Enchantreſs. He therefore, as I ſaid,
reſolved to keep this great Secret to himſelf;
and taking a Piſtol, charged well with two
Bullets, he watched an Opportunity to ſhoot
her as ſhe ſhould go out, or into her Houſe, or
Coach, ſome Evening.</p>
                     <p>To this End he waited ſeveral Nights, near
her Lodgings; but ſtill, either ſhe went not
out; or when ſhe returned, ſhe was ſo guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Friends, or her Lover, and Flambeaus,
that he could not aim at her, without endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
the Life of ſome other. But one Night
above the reſt, upon a Sunday, when he knew
ſhe would be at the Theater; for ſhe never
miſſed that Day, ſeeing the Play: He waited
at the Corner of the Stadt-Houſe, near the
Theater, with his Cloak caſt over his Face,
and a black Perriwig, all alone, with his Piſtol
ready cock'd; and remain'd not very long, but
he ſaw her Kinſman's Coach come along; 'twas
almoſt dark; Day was juſt ſhutting up her
Beauties, and left ſuch a Light to govern the
World, as ſerved only juſt to diſtinguiſh one
Object from another, an a convenient Help to
Miſchief. He ſaw a Light out of the Coach,
only one young Lady, the Lover, and then the
deſtin'd Victim; which he (drawing near)
knew rather by her Tongue, than Shape. The
Lady ran into the Play-Houſe, and left <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi>
to be conducted by her Lover into it;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47213:117"/>
who led her to the Door, and went to give
ſome Order to the Coach-man; ſo that the
Lover was about twenty Yards from <hi>Alcidiana;</hi>
when ſhe ſtood the faireſt Mark in the World,
on the Threſhold of the Entrance of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre;
there being many Coaches about the
Door, ſo that hers could not come ſo near.
<hi>Tarquin</hi> was reſolved not to loſe ſo fair an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and advanc'd, but went behind
the Coaches; and when he came over-againſt
the Door, through a great Booted, Velvet
Coach, that ſtood between him and her, he
ſhot; and ſhe having her Train of her Gown
and Petticoat on her Arm, in great quantity,
he miſſed her Body, and ſhot through her
Cloaths, between her Arm and her Body.
She, frightned to find ſomething hit her, and
to ſee the Smoak, and hear the Report of
the Piſtol; running in, cried, <hi>I am ſhot; I am
dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Noiſe quickly alarm'd her Lover; and
all the Coach-men, and Foot-men immediately
ran, ſome one Way, and ſome another. One
of 'em ſeeing a Man haſte away in a Clock,
he being a luſty, bold <hi>German,</hi> ſtopped him;
and drawing upon him, bad him ſtand, and
deliver his Piſtol, or he would run him
through.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tarquin</hi> being ſurprized at the Boldneſs
of this Fellow, to demand his Piſtol, as if
he poſitively knew him to be the Murtherer,
(for ſo he thought himſelf, ſince he believed
<hi>Alcidiana</hi> dead) had ſo much Preſence of
Mind, as to conſider, if he ſuffered himſelf
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47213:117"/>
to be taken, he ſhould poorly die a publick
Death; and therefore reſolved upon one
Miſchief more, to ſecure himſelf from the
firſt: And in the Moment that the <hi>German</hi>
bad him deliver his Piſtol, he cried, <hi>Though
I have no Piſtol to deliver, I have a Sword to
chaſtiſe thy Inſolence.</hi> And throwing off his
Cloak, and flinging his Piſtol from him, he
drew, and wounded, and diſarmed the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>This Noiſe of Swords brought every Body
to the Place; and immediately the Bruit ran,
<hi>The Murtherer was taken, the Murtherer was taken:</hi>
Though none knew which was he, nor the
Cauſe of the Quarrel between the two fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men, which none yet knew; for it now
was darker than before. But at the Noiſe of
the Murderer being taken, the Lover of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi>
who by this time found his Lady un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt,
all but the Trains of her Gown, and
Petticoat, came running to the place, juſt
as <hi>Tarquin</hi> had diſarmed the <hi>German,</hi> and was
ready to have kill'd him; when laying hold of
his Arm, they arreſted the Stroak, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
the Footman.</p>
                     <p>They then demanded who this Stranger was,
at whoſe Mercy the Fellow lay; but the Prince,
who now found himſelf venturing for his laſt
Stake, made no Reply; but with two Swords
in his Hands, went to fight his Way through
the Rabble: And tho' there were above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Perſons, ſome Swords, others with long
Whips (as Coach-men) ſo invincible was the
Courage of this poor unfortunate Gentleman at
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47213:118"/>
that time, that all theſe were not able to ſeize
him; but he made his Way through the Ring
that encompaſſed him, and ran away; but
was, however, ſo cloſely purſu'd, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
ſtill gathering as they ran, that toiled
with fighting, oppreſſed with Guilt, and
Fear of being taken, he grew fainter and
fainter, and ſuffered himſelf, at laſt, to yield
to his Purſuers, who ſoon found him to
be Prince <hi>Tarquin</hi> in Diſguiſe: And they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him directly to Priſon, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> to
wait the coming Day, to go before a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
                     <p>In an Hours time the whole fatal Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rried all over the City, and every
one knew that Prince <hi>Tarquin</hi> was the intended
Murtherer of <hi>Alcidiana;</hi> and not one but had
a real Sorrow and Compaſſion for him. They
heard how bravely he had defended himſelf,
how many he had wounded before he could
be taken, and what Numbers he had fought
through: And even thoſe that ſaw his Valour
and Bravery, and who had aſſiſted at his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeized, now repented from the bottom of
their Hearts, their having any Hand in the
Ruine of ſo gallant a Man; eſpecially, ſince
they knew the Lady was not hurt. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Addreſſes were made to her, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
him; but her Lover, a hot-headed Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
more fierce than brave, would by no
means be pacified; but vowed to purſue him
to the Scaffold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:47213:118"/>
The <hi>Monday</hi> came, and the Prince being
examined, confeſſed the Matter of Fact,
ſince there was no harm done; believing a
generous Confeſſion the beſt of his Game;
but he was ſent back to cloſer Impriſonment,
loaded with Irons, to expect the next Seſſions.
All his Houſhold-Goods were ſeized, and all
they could find, for the Uſe of <hi>Alcidiana.</hi>
And the Princeſs, all in Rage, tearing her
Hair, was carried to the ſame Priſon, to
behold the cruel Effects of her helliſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
                     <p>One need not tell here how ſad and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
this Metting appeared between her Lord
and ſhe, let it ſuffice it was the moſt melancholy
and mortifying Object that ever Eyes beheld.
On <hi>Miranda</hi>'s part, 'twas ſometimes all Rage
and Fire, and ſometimes all Tears and Groans;
but ſtill 'twas ſad Love, and mournful Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
on his: Nor cou'd all his Sufferings, and
the Proſpect of Death itſelf, drive from his
Soul one Spark of that Fire the obſtinate God
had fatally kindl'd there: And in the midſt of
all his Sighs, he would recal himſelf, and cry,
—<hi>I have</hi> Miranda <hi>ſtill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was eternally viſited by his Friends and
Acquaintance; and this laſt Action of Bravery
had got him more, than all his former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
had loſt. The Fathers were perpetually
with him; and all joyn'd with one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Voice in this, That he ought to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
a Woman ſo wicked as the Princeſs;
and that however Fate dealt with him, he
could not ſhew himſelf a true Penitent,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47213:119"/>
while he laid the Author of ſo much Evil in
his Boſom: That Heaven would never bleſs
him, till he had renounced her: And on ſuch
Conditions, he would find thoſe that would
employ their utmoſt Intereſt to ſave his Life;
who elſe would not ſtir in his Affair. But he
was ſo deaf to all, that he could not ſo much
as diſſemble a Repentance for having married
her.</p>
                     <p>He lay a long time in Priſon, and all that
time the poor Father <hi>Franciſco</hi> remained there
alſo; and the good Fathers, who daily viſited
theſe two amorous Priſoners, the Prince and
Princeſs; and who found, by the Management
of Matters, it would go very hard with <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
entertained 'em often with holy Matters
relating to the Life to come; from which,
before his Tryal, he gathered what his Stars
had appointed, and that he was deſtin'd to
die.</p>
                     <p>This gave an unſpeakable Torment to the
now repenting Beauty, who had reduced him
to it; and ſhe began to appear with a more
ſolid Grief, which being perceived by the good
Fathers, they reſolved to attack her on the
yielding Side; and after ſome Diſcourſe upon
the Judgment for Sin, they came to reflect on
the Buſineſs of Father <hi>Franciſco;</hi> and told her,
ſhe had never thriv'd ſince her Accuſing of that
Father, and laid it very home to her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
aſſuring her, that they would do their
utmoſt in her Service, if ſhe would confeſs
that ſecret Sin to all the World; ſo that ſhe
might atone for the Crime, by the ſaving that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47213:119"/>
good Man. At firſt ſhe ſeem'd inclin'd to yield;
but ſhame of being her own Detector in ſo
vile a Matter, recall'd her Goodneſs, and ſhe
faintly perſiſted in it.</p>
                     <p>At the end of ſix Months, Prince <hi>Tarquin</hi>
was call'd to his Tryal; where I will paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Circumſtances, which are only what is
uſual in ſuch Criminal Caſes, and tell you,
that he, being found guilty of the Intent of
killing <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> was condemn'd to loſe his
Head in the Market-place, and the Princeſs
to be baniſh'd her Country.</p>
                     <p>After Sentence pronounc'd, to the real
Grief of all the Spectators, he was carried back
to Priſon. And now the Fathers attack her
a-new: And ſhe, whoſe Griefs daily increas'd,
with a Languiſhment that brought her very
near her Grave, at laſt confeſs'd all her Life,
all the Lewdneſs of her Practices with ſeveral
Princes and Great Men, beſides her Luſts with
People that ſerv'd her, and others in mean
Capacity: And laſtly, the whole Truth of
the young Friar; and how ſhe had drawn the
Page, and the Prince, her Husband, to this
deſign'd Murther of her Siſter. This ſhe ſign'd
with her Hand, in the Preſence of the Prince,
her Husband, and ſeveral holy Men who were
preſent. Which being ſignified to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
the Friar was immediately deliver'd
from his Irons (where he had languiſh'd more
than two whole Years) in great Triumph, with
much Honour, and lives a moſt exemplary
pious Life, as he did before; for he is now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:47213:120"/>
After the Condemnation of theſe two unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Perſons, who begot ſuch different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
in the Minds of the People, (the
Prince, all the Compaſſion and Pity imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and the Princeſs all the Contempt and
Deſpight;) they languiſh'd almoſt ſix Months
longer in Priſon; ſo great an Intereſt there
was made, in order to the ſaving his Life, by
all the Men of the Robe. On the other ſide,
the Princes, and Great Men of all Nations,
who were at the Court of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> who bore
a ſecret Revenge in their Hearts againſt a
Man who had, as they pretended, ſet up a
falſe Title, only to take place of them; who
indeed, was but a Merchant's Son of <hi>Holland,</hi>
as they ſaid, ſo incens'd them againſt him, that
they were too hard at Court for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
However, this Diſpute gave the Prince
his Life ſome Months longer than was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
which gave him alſo ſome hope, that
a Reprieve for Ninety Years would have been
granted, as was deſir'd. Nay, Father <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco</hi>
ſo intereſted himſelf in this Concern, that
he writ to his Father, and ſeveral Princes of
<hi>Germany,</hi> with whom Marqueſs <hi>Caſtiel de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derigo</hi>
was well acquainted, to intercede with
him for the ſaving of <hi>Tarquin;</hi> ſince 'twas
more by his Perſwaſions, than thoſe of all who
attack'd her, that made <hi>Miranda</hi> confeſs the
Truth of her Affair with him. But at the end
of ſix Months, when all Application were
found fruitleſs and vain, the Prince receiv'd
News, that in two days he was to die, as his
Sentence had been before pronounc'd; and for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47213:120"/>
which he prepar'd himſelf with all Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>On the following <hi>Friday,</hi> as ſoon as it was
light, all People of any Condition came to
take their Leaves of him; and none departed
with dry Eyes, or Hearts unconcern'd to the
laſt Degree: For <hi>Tarquin,</hi> when he found his
Fate inevitable, bore it with a Fortitude that
ſhew'd no ſigns of Regret; but addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to all about him with the ſame chearful,
modeſt and great Air, he was wont to do in
his modeſt flouriſhing Fortune. His <hi>Vallet</hi> was
dreſſing him all the Morning, ſo many Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
they had by Viſiters; and he was all
in Mourning, and ſo were all his Followers;
for even to the laſt he kept up his Grandeur,
to the Amazement of all People: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
he was ſo paſſionately belov'd by them,
that thoſe he had diſmiſs'd, ſerv'd him volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily,
and would not be perſwaded to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him while he liv'd.</p>
                     <p>The Princeſs was alſo dreſs'd in Mourning,
and her two Women; and notwithſtanding the
unheard of Leudneſs and Villanies ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
of herſelf, the Prince ſtill ador'd her;
for ſhe had ſtill thoſe Charms that made him
firſt do ſo: Nor, to his laſt Moment, could
be brought to wiſh, that he had never ſeen her;
but on the contrary, as a Man yet vainly proud
of his Fetters, he ſaid, <hi>All the Satisfaction this
ſhort Moment of Life could afford him, was, that
he died in endeavouring to ſerve</hi> Miranda, <hi>his ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Princeſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:47213:121"/>
After he had taken Leave of all who thought
it neceſſary to leave him to himſelf for ſome
time, he retir'd with his Confeſſor; where
they were about an Hour in Prayer, all the
Ceremonies of Devotions that were fit to be
done, being already paſt. At laſt the Bell
toll'd, and he was to take leave of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
as his laſt Work of Life, and the moſt
hard he had to accompliſh. He threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at her Feet, and gazing on her, as ſhe
ſat more dead than alive, o'erwhelm'd with
ſilent Grief, they both remain'd ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſpeechleſs; and then, as if one riſing
Tide of Tears had ſupply'd both their Eyes,
it burſt out in Streams at the ſame inſtant;
and when his Sighs gave way, he utter'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Farewels, ſo ſoft, ſo paſſionate and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that all who were by, were extreamly
touch'd with it, and ſaid, <hi>That nothing could be
ſeen more deplorable and melancholy.</hi> A thouſand
times they bad Farewel, and ſtill ſome tender
Look, or Word, would prevent his going:
Then embrace, and bid Farewel again. A
thouſand times ſhe ask'd his Pardon for being
the Occaſion of that fatal Separation; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times aſſuring him, She would follow him,
for ſhe could not live without him. And Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
knows, when their ſoft and ſad Careſſes
would have an end, had not the Officers, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
him, 'twas time to mount the Scaffold.
At which Words the Princeſs fell fainting in
the Arms of her Women, and they led <hi>Tarquin</hi>
out of Priſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:47213:121"/>
When he came to the Market-place, whither
he walked on Foot, follow'd by his own Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
and ſome bearing a black Velvet Coffin
with Silver Hinges; the Heads-man before
him, with his fatal Scimiter drawn, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
by his ſide, and many Gentlemen, and
Church-men, with Father <hi>Franciſco</hi> attending
him, the People ſhowering Millions of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
on him, and beholding, with weeping
Eyes, he mounted the Scaffold; which was
ſtrew'd with ſome Saw-duſt, about the place
where he was to kneel, to receive the Blood:
For they Behead People kneeling, and with
the Back-ſtroak of a Scimiter, and not lying
on a Block, and with an Ax, as we in <hi>England.</hi>
The Scaffold had a low Rail about it, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body might more conveniently ſee: This
was hung with Black, and all that State that
ſuch a Death could have, was here in moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Order.</p>
                     <p>He did not ſay much upon the Scaffold:
The Sum of what he ſaid to his Friends, was,
To be kind, and take Care of the poor Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
his Wife: To others, recommending
his honeſt and generous Servants, whoſe Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was ſo well known and commended, that
they were ſoon promis'd Preferment. He was
ſome time in Prayer, and a very ſhort time
ſpeaking to his Confeſſor; then he turn'd to
the Heads-man, and deſired him to do his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
well, and gave him twenty <hi>Louis d' Ors;</hi>
and undreſſing himſelf with the help of his Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
and Page, he pull'd off his Coat, and had
underneath a white Satten Waſte-coat: He
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47213:122"/>
took off his Perriwig, and put on a white Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Cap, with a Holland one done with Poynt
under it, which he pull'd over his Eyes, then
took a chearful Leave of all, and kneel'd down,
and ſaid, <hi>When he lifted up his Hands the Third
time, the Heads-man ſhould do his Office.</hi> Which
accordingly was done, and the Heads-man gave
him his laſt Stroak, and the Prince fell on the
Scaffold. The People, with one common Voice,
as if it had been but one entire one, pray'd for
his Soul; and Murmurs of Sighs were heard
from the whole Multitude, who ſcrambl'd for
ſome of the bloody Saw-duſt, to keep for his
Memory.</p>
                     <p>The Heads-man going to take up the Head,
as the manner is, to ſhew to the People, he
found he had not ſtruck it off, and that the
Body ſtirr'd; with that he ſtepp'd to an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
which they always carry with 'em, to
force thoſe who may be refractory; thinking,
as he ſaid, to have twiſted the Head from the
Shoulders, conceiving it to hang but by a ſmall
matter of Fleſh. Tho' twas an odd Shift of
the Fellows, yet 'twas done, and the beſt
Shift he could ſuddenly propoſe. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,
and another Officer, old Men, were on
the Scaffold, with ſome of the Prince's Friends,
and Servants; who ſeeing the Heads-man put
the Engine about the Neck of the Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to call out, and the People made a great
Noiſe. The Prince, who found himſelf yet
alive; or rather, who was paſt thinking, but
had ſome Senſe of feeling left, when the
Heads-man took him up, and ſet his Back
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47213:122"/>
againſt the Rail, and clapp'd the Engine about
his Neck, got his two Thumbs between the
Rope and his Neck, feeling himſelf preſs'd
there; and ſtruggling between Life and Death,
and bending himſelf over the Rail backward,
while the Heads-man pull'd forward, he threw
himſelf quite over the Rail, by Chance, and not
Deſign, and fell upon the Heads and Shoulders
of the People, who were crying out with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
Shouts of Joy. The Heads-man leap'd
after him, but the Rabble had like to have
pull'd him to pieces: All the City was in an
Uproar, but none knew what the Matter
was, but thoſe who bore the Body of the
Prince, whom they found yet living; but
how, or by what ſtrange Miracle preſerv'd,
they knew not, nor did examine; but with
one Accord, as if the whole Crowd had been
one Body, and had had but one Motion, they
bore the Prince on their Heads, about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Yards from the Scaffold, where there is
a Monaſtery of Jeſuites; and there they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
him. All this was done, his Beheading,
his Falling, and his being ſecur'd, almoſt in a
Moments time; the People rejoycing, as at
ſome extraordinary Victory won. One of the
Officers being, as I ſaid, an old, timerous Man,
was ſo frighten'd at the Accident, the Buſtle,
the Noiſe, and the Confuſion, of which he was
wholly ignorant, that he dy'd with Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Fear; and the other was fain to be
let Blood.</p>
                     <p>The Officers of Juſtice went to demand the
Priſoner; but they demanded in vain; they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47213:123"/>
had now a Right to protect him, and wou'd
do ſo. All his over-joy'd Friends went to ſee
in what Condition he was, and all of Quality
found Admittance: They ſaw him in Bed,
going to be dreſs'd by the moſt skilful Surgeons
who yet could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> aſſure him of Life. They
deſired no Body ſhould ſpeak to him, or ask
him any Queſtions. They found that the
Heads-man had ſtruck him too low, and had
cut him into the Shoulder-bone. A very great
Wound, you may be ſure; for the Sword, in
ſuch Executions, carries an extream force:
However, ſo great Care was taken on all ſides,
and ſo greatly the Fathers were concern'd for
him, that they found an Amendment, and
Hopes of a good Effect of their incomparable
Charity and Goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, when he was permitted to ſpeak, the
firſt News he ask'd was after the Princeſs. And
his Friends were very much afflicted to find,
that all his Loſs of Blood had not quench'd
that Flame, nor let out that which made him
ſtill love that bad Woman. He was ſolicited
daily to think no more of her: And all her
Crimes were laid ſo open to him, and ſo
ſhamefully repreſented; and on the other ſide,
his Vertues ſo admir'd; and which, they ſaid,
would have been eternally celebrated, but for
his Folly with this infamous Creature; that at
laſt, by aſſuring him of all their Aſſiſtance, if
he abandon'd her; and to renounce him, and
deliver him up, if he did not; they wrought
ſo far upon him, as to promiſe, he would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
her to go alone into Baniſhment, and would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47213:123"/>
not follow her, or live with her any more. But
alas! this was but his Gratitude that compell'd
this Complaiſance, for in his Heart he reſolv'd
never to abandon her; nor was he able to live,
and think of doing it: However, his Reaſon
aſſured him, he could not do a Deed more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable,
and one that would regain his Fame
ſooner.</p>
                     <p>His Friends ask'd him ſome Queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Eſcape; and that ſince he was not
beheaded, but only wounded, why he did not
immediately riſe up? But he replied, He was
ſo abſolutely prepoſſeſſed, that at the third lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Hands, he ſhould receive the Stroak
of Death, that at the ſame inſtant the Sword
touch'd him, he had no Senſe; nay, not even
of Pain, ſo abſolutely dead he was with Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;
and knew not that he ſtirr'd, as the
Heads-man found he did; nor did he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
any thing, from the lifting up of his Hands,
to his Fall; and then awakened, as out of a
Dream, or rather a Moment's Sleep, without
Dream, he found he liv'd, and wonder'd what
was arriv'd to him, or how he came to live; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not, as yet, any Senſe of his Wound, tho'
ſo terrible an one.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> who was extreamly
afflicted for having been the Proſecutor of this
Great Man; who, bating this laſt Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her, which we knew was the Inſtigation
of her Siſter, had oblig'd her with all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
imaginable; now ſought all Means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of getting his Pardon, and that of her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
tho' of an Hundred thouſand Crowns,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47213:124"/>
which ſhe ſhould have paid her, ſhe could get
but Ten thouſand; which was from the Sale of
her rich Beds, and ſome other Furniture: So
that the young Count, who before ſhould have
marry'd her, now went off for want of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
and a young Merchant (perhaps the beſt
of the two) was the Man to whom ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, by great Interceſſion, both their
Pardons were obtain'd; and the Prince, who
would be no more ſeen in a place that had
prov'd every way ſo fatal to him, left <hi>Flanders,</hi>
promiſing never to live with the fair Hypocrite
more; but e'er he departed, he writ her a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherein he order'd her, in a little time, to
follow him into <hi>Holland;</hi> and left a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
with one of his truſty Servants, whom
he had left to wait upon her, for Money for
her Accommodations: So that ſhe was now
reduced to one Woman, one Page, and this
Gentleman. The Prince, in this time of his
Impriſonment, had ſeveral Bills of great Sums
from his Father, who was exceeding rich, and
this all the Children he had in the World, and
whom he tenderly loved.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Miranda</hi> was come into <hi>Holland,</hi>
ſhe was welcom'd with all imaginable Reſpect
and Endearment by the old Father; who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon ſo, as that he knew not ſhe was the
fatal Occaſion of all theſe Diſaſters to his Son;
but rather look'd on her as a Woman, who had
brought him an Hundred and fifty thouſand
Crowns, which his Misfortunes had conſum'd.
But, above all, ſhe was receiv'd by <hi>Tarquin</hi> with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47213:124"/>
a Joy unſpeakable; who, after ſome time, to
redeem his Credit, and gain himſelf a new
Fame, put himſelf into the <hi>French</hi> Army, where
he did Wonders; and after three Campaigns,
his Father dying, he return'd home, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
to a Country-Houſe; where, with his
Princeſs, he lives as a private Gentleman, in
all the Tranquility of a Man of a good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
They ſay <hi>Miranda</hi> has been very peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for her Life paſt, and gives Heaven the
Glory for having given her theſe Afflictions,
that have reclaim'd her, and brought her to as
perfect a State of Happineſs as this troubleſome
World can afford.</p>
                     <p>Since I began this Relation, I heard that
Prince <hi>Tarquin</hi> dy'd about Three Quarters of a
Year ago.</p>

                  <head>THE
HISTORY
OF
AGNES de CASTRO.</head>
                  <p>THough LOVE, all ſoft and flattering,
promiſes nothing but Pleaſures; yet
its Conſequences are often ſad and
fatal: It is not enough to be in
Love, to be happy, ſince Fortune, who is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious,
and takes delight to trouble the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of the moſt Elevated and Virtuous, has
very little reſpect for paſſionate and tender
Hearts, when ſhe deſigns to produce ſtrange
Adventures.</p>
                  <p>Many Examples of paſt Ages render this
Maxim certain, but the Reign of <hi>Dom Alphonſo</hi>
the Fourth, King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> furniſhes us with
one, the moſt extraordinary that Hiſtory can
produce.</p>
                  <p>He was the Son of that <hi>Dom Denice,</hi> who was
ſo ſucceſsful in all his Undertakings, that it
was ſaid of him, that he was capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
whatever he deſign'd: And of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
a Princeſs of eminent Vertue, who when
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47213:127"/>
he came to inherit a flouriſhing and tranquil
State, he endeavour'd to eſtabliſh Peace and
Plenty in abundance, in his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>And to advance this his Deſign, he agreed
on a Marriage between his Son <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> (then
about eight Years of Age) and <hi>Bianca</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and whom
the young Prince married when he arrived
to his ſixteenth Year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bianca</hi> brought nothing to <hi>Coimbra</hi> but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
and very few Charms. <hi>Don Pedro,</hi>
who was full of Sweetneſs and Generoſity, liv'd
nevertheleſs very well with her; but thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
of the Princeſs degenerating into the
Palſie, ſhe made it her Requeſt to retire, and
at her Interceſſion, the Pope broke the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and the melancholy Princeſs concealed
her Languiſhment in a ſolitary Retreat: And
<hi>Don Pedro,</hi> for whom they had provided ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Match, married <hi>Conſtantia Manuel,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Dom John Manuel,</hi> a Prince of the Blood
of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and famous for the Enmity he had
to his King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſtantia</hi> was promiſed to the King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi>
but that King not keeping his Word, they
made no difficulty of beſtowing her on a young
Prince, who was one day to Reign over a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of fine Provinces. He was but five and
twenty Years of Age, and the Man of all <hi>Spain</hi>
that had the beſt Faſhion and Grace: And
with the moſt advantagious Qualities of the
Body, he poſſeſt thoſe of the Soul, and ſhew'd
himſelf worthy in all things of the Crown that
was deſtin'd for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47213:127"/>
The Princeſs <hi>Conſtantia</hi> had Beauty, Wit,
and Generoſity, in as a great Meaſure as 'twas
poſſible for a Woman to be poſſeſt with; her
Merit alone ought to have attach'd <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
eternally to her; and certainly he had for her
an Eſteem, mixt with ſo great a Reſpect, as
might very well paſs for Love with thoſe that
were not of a nice and curious Obſervation;
but alas! his real Care was reſerv'd for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Beauty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſtantia</hi> brought into the World, the firſt
Year after her Marriage, a Son, who was call'd
<hi>Don Louis;</hi> but it ſcarce ſaw the Light, and
dy'd almoſt as ſoon as born. The Loſs of this
little Prince ſenſibly touch'd her, but the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhe obſerv'd in the Prince her Husband,
went yet more near her Heart; for ſhe had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
herſelf abſolutely up to her Duty, and had
made her Tenderneſs for him her only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern:
But puiſſant Glory which ty'd her ſo
entirely to the Intereſt of the Prince of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
open'd her Eyes upon his Actions, where
ſhe obſerv'd nothing in his Careſſes and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
that was natural, or could ſatisfie her
delicate Heart.</p>
                  <p>At firſt, ſhe fancy'd herſelf deceiv'd, but
time having confirm'd her in what ſhe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſhe ſighed in ſecret; yet had that Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
for the Prince, as not to let him ſee
her Diſorder; and which nevertheleſs, ſhe
could not conceal from <hi>Agnes de Caſtro,</hi> who
liv'd with her, rather as a Companion, than a
Maid of Honour, and whom her Friendſhip
made her infinitely diſtinguiſh from the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47213:128"/>
This maid, ſo dear to the Princeſs, very
well merited the Preference her Miſtreſs gave
her; ſhe was beautiful to exceſs, wiſe, diſcreet,
witty, and had more Tenderneſs for <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
than ſhe had for herſelf, having quitted her
Family, which was illuſtrious, to give herſelf
wholly to the Service of the Princeſs, and to
follow her into <hi>Portugal.</hi> It was into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
of this Maid, that the Princeſs unladed
her firſt Moans, and the charming <hi>Agnes</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
nothing that might give eaſe to her affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Heart.</p>
                  <p>Nor was <hi>Conſtantia</hi> the only Perſon who
complain'd on <hi>Don Pedro;</hi> before his Divorce
from <hi>Bianca,</hi> he had expreſſed ſome Care and
Tenderneſs for <hi>Elvira Gonzales,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Don
Alvaro Gonzales,</hi> Favourite to the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi>
and this Amuſement in the young Years
of the Prince, had made a deep Impreſſion on
<hi>Elvira,</hi> who flatter'd her Ambition with the
Infirmities of <hi>Bianca.</hi> She ſaw, with a ſecret
Rage, <hi>Conſtantia</hi> take her place, who was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
with ſuch Charms, that quite diveſted her
of all Hopes.</p>
                  <p>Her Jealouſie left her not idle, ſhe examin'd
all the Actions of the Prince, and eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the little Regard he had for the Princeſs;
but this brought him not back to her. And it
was upon very good Grounds that ſhe ſuſpected
him to be in Love with ſome other Perſon,
and poſſeſſed with a new Paſſion; and which
ſhe promis'd herſelf, ſhe would deſtroy as
ſoon as ſhe could find it out. She had a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
altogether proper for bold and hazardous
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:128"/>
Enterprizes; and the Credit of her Brother
gave her ſo much Vanity, as all the Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Prince was not capable of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
                  <p>The Prince languiſh'd, and conceal'd the
Cauſe with ſo much Care, that 'twas impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for any to find it out. No publick Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
were agreeable to him, and all Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
were tedious; and it was Solitude alone
that was able to give him any eaſe.</p>
                  <p>This Change ſurprized all the World. The
King who lov'd his Son very tenderly, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
preſs'd him to know the Reaſon of his
Melancholy; but the Prince made no anſwer,
but only this, That it was the Effects of his
Temper.</p>
                  <p>But Time ran on, and the Princeſs was
brought to Bed of a ſecond Son, who liv'd,
and was call'd <hi>Fernando. Don Pedro</hi> forc'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a little to take part in the publick Joy, ſo
that they believ'd his Humour was changing;
but this appearance of a Calm endured not
long, and he fell back again into his black Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>
                  <p>The Artful <hi>Elvira</hi> was inceſſantly agitated
in ſearching out the Knowledge of this Secret.
Chance wrought for her: And, as ſhe was
walking full of Indignation and Anger, in the
Garden of the Palace of <hi>Coimbra,</hi> ſhe found the
Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſleeping in an obſcure
Grotto.</p>
                  <p>Her Fury could not contain itſelf at the
Sight of this lov'd Object, ſhe roul'd her Eyes
upon him, and perceiv'd in ſpight of Sleep,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:129"/>
that ſome Tears eſcap'd his Eyes; the Flame
which burnt yet in her Heart, ſoon grew ſoft
and tender there: But oh! ſhe heard him
ſigh, and after that, utter theſe Words; <hi>Yes,
Divine</hi> Agnes, <hi>I will ſooner die, than let you know
it:</hi> Conſtantia <hi>ſhall have nothing to reproach me
with. Elvira</hi> was enrag'd at this Diſcourſe,
which repreſented to her immediately, the
ſame Moment, <hi>Agnes de Caſtro</hi> with all her
Charms; and not at all doubting, but it was
ſhe who poſſeſt the Heart of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſhe
found in her Soul more Hatred for this fair
Rival, than Tenderneſs for him.</p>
                  <p>The Grotto was not a Place ſit to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
in, or to form Deſigns. Perhaps her
firſt Tranſports would have made her waken'd
him, if ſhe had not perceiv'd a Paper lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Hand, which ſhe ſoftly ſeiz'd on; and
that ſhe might not be ſurpriz'd in the reading
it, ſhe went out of the Garden with as much
Haſte as Confuſion.</p>
                  <p>When ſhe was retir'd to her Apartment, ſhe
open'd the Paper, trembling, and found in it
theſe Verſes, writ by the Hand of <hi>Don Pedro;</hi>
and which in appearance, he had newly then
compoſed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Elvira</hi> regarded neither Exactneſs nor Grace
in theſe Lines, and if they had but the Effect
ſhe deſign'd, ſhe wiſh'd no more.</p>
                  <p>Her Impatience could not wait till the next
Day to expoſe 'em; ſhe therefore went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to the Lodgings of the Princeſs, who
was then walking in the Garden of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace;
and paſſing without reſiſtance, even to
her Cabinet, ſhe put the Paper into a Book, in
which the Princeſs us'd to read, and went
out again unſeen, and ſatisfied with her good
Fortune.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as <hi>Conſtantia</hi> was return'd, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into her Cabinet, and ſaw the Book open,
and the Verſes lying in it, which were to coſt
her ſo dear: She ſoon knew the Hand of the
Prince which was ſo familiar to her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Information of what ſhe had always
fear'd, ſhe underſtood it was <hi>Agnes de Caſtro,</hi>
(whoſe Friendſhip alone was able to comfort
her in her Misfortunes) who was the fatal Cauſe
of it; ſhe read over the Paper an hundred
times, deſiring to give her Eyes and Reaſon
the Lye; but finding but too plainly ſhe was
not deceiv'd, ſhe found her Soul poſſeſt with
more Grief than Anger: When ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
as much in Love as the Prince was, he
had kept his Torment ſecret. After having
made her Moan, without condemning him,
the Tenderneſs ſhe had for him, made her
ſhed a Torrent of Tears, and inſpir'd her
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47213:130"/>
with a Reſolution of concealing her Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>She would certainly have done it by a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
extraordinary, if the Prince, who miſſing
his Verſes when he wak'd, and fearing they
might fall into indiſcreet Hands, had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
the Palace, all troubl'd with his Loſs,
and haſtily going into <hi>Conſtantia</hi>'s Apartment,
ſaw her fair Eyes all wet with Tears, and at
the ſame inſtant caſt his own on the unhappy
Verſes that had eſcap'd from his Soul, and now
lay before the Princeſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He immediately turn'd pale at this ſight, and
appear'd ſo mov'd, that the generous Princeſs
felt more Pain than he did:</hi> Madam, <hi>ſaid he,
(infinitely alarm'd)</hi> from whom had you that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?
It cannot come but from the Hand of ſome
Perſon, <hi>anſwer'd</hi> Conſtantia, who is an Enemy
both to your Repoſe and mine; it is the Work, Sir,
of your own Hand; and doubtleſs, the Sentiment of
your Heart: But be not ſurpriz'd, and do not fear,
for if my Tenderneſs ſhould make it paſs for a
Crime in you, the ſame Tenderneſs, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is able to alter, ſhall hinder me from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining.</p>
                  <p>The Moderation and Calmneſs of <hi>Conſtantia,</hi>
ſerv'd only to render the Prince more aſham'd
and confuſs'd. <hi>How Generous are you, madam,</hi>
purſu'd he, <hi>and how Vnfortunate am I.</hi> Some
Tears accompanied his Words, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
who lov'd him with extream Ardor, was
ſo ſenſibly touch'd, that it was a good
while before ſhe could utter a Word: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia</hi>
then broke Silence, and ſhewing him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:131"/>
what <hi>Elvira</hi> had caus'd to be written; <hi>You are
betray'd, Sir,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>you have been heard
ſpeak, and your Secret is known.</hi> It was at this
very moment that all the Forces of the Prince
abandon'd him; and his Condition was really
worthy Compaſſion: He could not pardon
himſelf the unvoluntary Crime he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in expoſing of the lovely, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Agnes.</hi> And tho' he was convinc'd of the
Vertue and Goodneſs of <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
that he had, that this modeſt and
prudent Maid might ſuffer by his Conduct, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him beyond all Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs, who heedfully ſurveyed him,
ſaw ſo many Marks of Deſpair in his Face
and Eyes, that ſhe was afraid of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences;
and holding out her Hand, in a very
obliging manner to him; ſhe ſaid, <hi>I promiſe
you, Sir, I will never more complain on you; and
that</hi> Agnes <hi>ſhall always be very dear to me; you
ſhall never hear me make you any Reproaches: And
ſince I cannot poſſeſs your Heart, I will content my
ſelf with endeavouring to render myſelf worthy of it.
Don Pedro</hi> more confus'd and dejected than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had been, bent one of his Knees at the
Feet of <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> and with reſpect kiſs'd that
fair kind Hand ſhe had given him, and perhaps
forgot <hi>Agnes</hi> for a Moment.</p>
                  <p>But Love ſoon put a ſtop to all the little Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of <hi>Hymen,</hi> the fatal Star that preſided
over the Deſtiny of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> had not yet
vented its Malignity; and one Moment's ſight
of <hi>Agnes</hi> gave new Forces to his Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:131"/>
The Wiſh and Deſires of this charming Maid
had no part in this Victory; her Eyes were juſt,
tho' penetrating, and they ſearched not in
thoſe of the Prince, what they had a deſire to
diſcover to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As ſhe was never far from</hi> Conſtantia, Don
Pedro <hi>was no ſooner gone out of the Cloſet, but</hi>
Agnes <hi>entred; and finding the Princeſs all pale
and languiſhing in her Chair, ſhe doubted not
but there was ſome ſufficient Cauſe for her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
ſhe put herſelf in the ſame Poſture
the Prince had been in before, and expreſſing
an Inquietude, full of Concern;</hi> Madam, <hi>ſaid
ſhe,</hi> by all your Goodneſs, conceal not from me the
Cauſe of your Trouble. Alas, <hi>Agnes, reply'd the
the Princeſs,</hi> what would you know? And what
ſhould I tell you? The Prince, the Prince, my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Maid, is in Love; the Hand that he gave me,
was not a Preſent of his Heart; and for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of this Alliance, I must become the Victim of
it.—What! the Prince in Love, <hi>replied</hi> Agnes,
(<hi>with an Aſtoniſhment mixt with Indignation</hi>)
What Beauty can diſpute the Empire over a Heart
ſo much your due? Alas, Madam, all the Reſpect
I owe him, cannot hinder me from murmuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. Accuſe him of nothing, <hi>interrupted</hi>
Conſtantia, he does what he can; and I am more
obliged to him for deſiring to be Faithful, than if I
poſſest his real Tenderneſs. It is not enough to
Fight, but to Overcome; and the Prince does more
in the Condition wherein he is, than I ought reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to hope for: In fine, he is my Husband, and an
agreeable one; to whom nothing is wanting, but what
I cannot inſpire; that is, a Paſſion which would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47213:132"/>
have made me but too happy. Ah, Madam, <hi>cry'd
out</hi> Agnes, <hi>tranſported with her Tenderneſs
for the Princeſs,</hi> he is a blind and ſtupid Prince,
who knows not the precious Advantages he poſſeſſes.
He must ſurely know ſomething, <hi>reply'd the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
modeſtly.</hi> But, Madam, <hi>reply'd</hi> Agnes,
Is there any thing, not only in <hi>Portugal,</hi> but in all
<hi>Spain,</hi> that can compare with you? And, without
conſidering the charming Qualities of your Perſon,
can we enough admire thoſe of your Soul? My dear
Agnes, <hi>interrupted</hi> Conſtantia, <hi>ſighing,</hi> ſhe who
robs me of my Husband's Heart, has but too many
Charms to plead his Excuſe; ſince it is Thou, Child,
whom Fortune makes uſe of, to give me the Killing
Blow. Yes, <hi>Agnes,</hi> the Prince loves thee; and the
Merit I know thou art poſſest of, puts Bounds to my
Complaints, without ſuffering me to have the least
Reſentment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The delicate</hi> Agnes <hi>little expected to hear
what the Princeſs told her; Thunder would
have leſs ſurprized, and leſs oppreſs'd her: She
remained a long time without ſpeaking, but at
laſt fixing her Looks all frightful on</hi> Conſtantia,
What ſay you, Madam? (<hi>cry'd ſhe</hi>) And what
Thoughts have you of me? What, that I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
you? And coming hither only full of Ardor to
be the Repoſe of your Life, do I bring a fatal Poyſon
to afflict it? What Deteſtation must I have for the
Beauty they find in me, without aſpiring to make it
appear? And how ought I to curſe the unfortunate
Day, in which I first ſaw the Prince?—But,
Madam, it cannot be me, whom Heaven has cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to torment you, and to deſtroy all your Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
No, it cannot be ſo much my Enemy, to put me
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47213:132"/>
to ſo great a Tryal: And if I were that odious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
there is no Excuſe, or Puniſhment, to which I
would not condemn myſelf: It is <hi>Elvira,</hi> Madam,
the Prince loves, and lov'd before his Marriage with
you, and alſo before his Divorce from <hi>Bianca;</hi> and
ſome Body has made an indiſcreet Report to you of
this Intrigue of his Youth: But, Madam, what was
in the time of <hi>Bianca,</hi> is nothing to you. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> loves you, <hi>anſwer'd the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;</hi>
and I have Vanity enough to believe, that none
beſides yourſelf could have diſputed his Heart with
me: But the Secret is diſcover'd, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
has not diſown'd it. What, <hi>interrupted</hi> Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es,
(<hi>more ſurprized than ever</hi>) is it then from himſelf
you have learn'd his Weakneſs? <hi>The Princeſs then
ſhew'd her the Verſes; and there was never
any Deſpair like to hers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While they were both thus ſadly employed,
both Sighing, and both Weeping, the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Elvira,</hi> who was willing to learn the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of her Malice, return'd to the Apartment
of the Princeſs, where ſhe freely entred, even
to the Cabinet where theſe unhappy Perſons
were; whom all afflicted and troubled as they
were, bluſh'd at her approach, whoſe Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
they did not deſire: She had the pleaſure to
ſee <hi>Conſtantia</hi> hide from her the Paper which
had been the Cauſe of all their Trouble, and
which the Princeſs had never ſeen, but for her
Spight and Revenge; and to obſerve alſo, in
the Eyes of the Princeſs, and thoſe of <hi>Agnes,</hi>
an immoderate Grief: She ſtay'd in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet
as long as it was neceſſary to be aſſur'd,
that ſhe had ſucceeded in her Deſign; but the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47213:133"/>
Princeſs, who did not deſire ſuch a Witneſs of
the Diſorder, in which ſhe then was, deſir'd
to be left alone. <hi>Elvira</hi> then went out of the
Cabinet, and <hi>Agnes de Caſtro</hi> withdrew at the
ſame time.</p>
                  <p>It was in her own Chamber, that <hi>Agnes</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
more freely this Adventure, found it as
cruel as Death: She lov'd <hi>Conſtantia</hi> ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and had not 'till then any thing more than
an Eſteem, mixt with Admiration, for the
Prince of <hi>Portugal;</hi> which, indeed, none could
refuſe to ſo many fine Qualities. And look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on herſelf as the moſt unfortunate of her
Sex, as being the Cauſe of all the Suffering of
the Princeſs, to whom ſhe was obliged for the
greateſt Bounties, ſhe ſpent the whole Night
in Tears and Complaints, ſufficient to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
<hi>Conſtantia</hi> of all the Griefs ſhe made
her ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>The Prince, on his ſide, was in no greater
Tranquility; the Generoſity of his Princeſs
increas'd his Remorſe, without diminiſhing
his Love; he fear'd, and with Reaſon, that
thoſe who were the occaſion of <hi>Conſtantia</hi>'s
ſeeing thoſe Verſes, ſhould diſcover his Paſſion
to the King, from whom he hop'd for no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
and he would moſt willingly have
given his Life to have been free from this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the afflicted Princeſs lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
in a moſt deplorable Sadneſs; ſhe found
nothing in thoſe who were the Cauſe of her
Misfortunes, but things fitter to move her Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
than her Anger; it was in vain that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47213:133"/>
Jealouſie ſtrove to combat the Inclination ſhe
had to love her fair Rival; nor was any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of making the Prince leſs dear to her; and
ſhe felt neither Hatred, nor ſo much as Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for innocent <hi>Agnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While theſe three diſconſolate Perſons aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
themſelves to their Melancholy, <hi>Elvira,</hi>
not to leave her Vengeance imperfect, ſtudy'd
in what manner ſhe might bring it to the
Height of its Effects. Her Brother, on whom
ſhe depended, ſhew'd her a great deal of
Friendſhip; and judging rightly that the
Love of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> to <hi>Agnes de Caſtro,</hi> would
not be approv'd by the King, ſhe acquainted
<hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> her Brother, with it, who was not
ignorant of the Paſſion the Prince had once
proteſted to have for his Siſter. He found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
very much intereſted in this News, from
a ſecret Paſſion he had for <hi>Agnes;</hi> whom the
Buſineſs of his Fortune had hitherto hindred
him from diſcovering: And he expected a
great many Favours from the King, that might
render the Effort of his Heart the more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
                  <p>He hid not from his Siſter this one thing,
which he found difficult to conceal; ſo that
ſhe was now poſſeſt with a double Grief, to
find <hi>Agnes</hi> Sovereign of all the Hearts, to which
ſhe had a pretenſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> was one of thoſe ambitious Men,
that are Fierce without Moderation, and Proud
without Generoſity; of a melancholy, clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Humour; of a cruel Inclination, and to
effect his Ends, found nothing difficult, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47213:134"/>
Naturally he lov'd not the Prince,
who, on all Accounts ought to have held the
firſt Rank in the Heart of the King, which
ſhould have ſet Bounds to the Favour of <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varo;</hi>
who when he knew the Prince was his
Rival, his Jealouſie increas'd his Hate of him;
and he conjured <hi>Elvira</hi> to employ all her Care,
to oppoſe an Engagement that could not but
be deſtructive to 'em both; ſhe promiſed him,
and he not very well ſatisfied, rely'd on her
Addreſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> who had too lively a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
within himſelf, of the Beauties and
Grace of the Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> thought of
nothing but how to combate his Merits, he
himſelf being not handſome, or well made:
His Faſhion was as diſagreeable as his Humour,
and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had all the Advantages that one
Man may poſſibly have over another. In fine,
all that <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> wanted, adorn'd the
Prince: But as he was the Husband of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia,</hi>
and depended upon an abſolute Father,
and that <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> was free, and Maſter of a
good Fortune, he thought himſelf more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
of <hi>Agnes,</hi> and fix'd his Hopes on that
Thought.</p>
                  <p>He knew very well, that the Paſſion of <hi>Don
Pedro,</hi> could not but inſpire a violent Anger in
the Soul of the King. Induſtrious in doing Ill,
his firſt Buſineſs was to carry this unwelcome
News to him. After he had given time to his
Grief, and had compos'd himſelf to his Deſire,
he then beſought the King to Intereſt himſelf in
his amorous Affair, and to be the Protector of
his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47213:134"/>
Though <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> had no other Merit
to recommend him to the King, than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
and blind Obedience to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
yet he had favour'd him with ſeveral
Teſtimonies of his vaſt Bounty; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the height to which the King's Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
had rais'd him, there were few Ladies
that would have refus'd his Alliance. The
King aſſur'd him of the Continuation of his
Friendſhip and Favour, and promis'd him, if
he had any Authority, he would give him the
charming <hi>Agnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> perfectly skilful in managing his
Maſter, anſwer'd the King's laſt Bounties with
a profound Submiſſion. He had yet never told
<hi>Agnes</hi> what he felt for her; but he thought now
he might make a publick Declaration of it, and
and ſought all means to do it.</p>
                  <p>The Gallantry which <hi>Coimbra</hi> ſeem'd to have
forgotten, began now to be awaken'd. The

Sports, and commanded that every thing ſhould

                  <p>Since the Adventure of the Verſes, <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
endeavour'd to lay a Conſtraint on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and to appear leſs troubled: But in his
Heart he ſuffer'd always alike; and it was
not but with great Uneaſineſs he prepar'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for the Turnament. And ſince he could
not appear with the Colours of <hi>Agnes,</hi> he took
thoſe of his Wife, without Device, or any great
Magnificence.</p>

                     <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> adorn'd himſelf with the Liv'ries
of <hi>Agnes de Caſtro;</hi> and this fair Maid, who
had yet found no Conſolation from what the
Princeſs had told her, had this new Cauſe of
being diſpleas'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Pedro</hi> appear'd in the Liſt with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Grace; and <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> who look'd
on this Day as his own, appear'd there all ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with Gold, mix'd with Stones of Blew,
which were the Colours of <hi>Agnes;</hi> and there
was embroider'd all over his Equipage, fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Hearts of Gold, on blew Velvet, and
Nets for the Snares of Love, with abundance
of double <hi>A's;</hi> his Device was a Love coming
out of a Cloud, with theſe Verſes written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Love from a Cloud breaks like the God of Day,</l>
                     <l>And to the World his Glories does diſplay;</l>
                     <l>To gaze on charming Eyes, and make 'em know,</l>
                     <l>What to ſoft Hearts, and to his Power they owe.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>The Pride of <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> was ſoon hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at the Feet of the Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who
threw him againſt the Ground, with twenty
others, and carry'd alone the Glory of the
Day. There was in the Evening a Noble
Aſſembly at <hi>Conſtantia</hi>'s, where <hi>Agnes</hi> would
not have been, unleſs expreſly commanded by
the Princeſs. She appear'd there all negligent
and careleſs in her Dreſs, but yet ſhe appear'd
all beautiful and charming. She ſaw, with
diſdain, her Name, and her Colours, worn by
<hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> at a Publick Triumph; and if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47213:135"/>
her Heart were capable of any tender Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it was not for ſuch a Man as he, for
whom her Delicacy deſtin'd them: She lookd
on him with a Contempt, which did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him from preſſing ſo near, that there was
a neceſſity for her to hear, and what he had to
declare to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>She treated him not uncivily, but her Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
would have rebated the Courage of any
but</hi> Alvaro. Madam, <hi>ſaid he, (when he could
be heard of none but herſelf</hi>) I have hitherto
concealed the Paſſion you have inſpir'd me with,
fearing it ſhould diſpleaſe you; but it has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Violence on my Reſpect; and I could no longer
conceal it from you. I never reflected on your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<hi>anſwer'd</hi> Agnes, <hi>with all the Indifference
of which ſhe was capable,</hi> and if you think you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
me, you are in the wrong to make me perceive
it. This Coldneſs is but an ill Omen for me, <hi>reply'd
Don Alvaro,</hi> and if you have not found me out to
be your Lover to Day, I fear you will never approve
my Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Oh! what a time you have choſen to make it
appear to me (<hi>purſu'd</hi> Agnes) is it ſo great an
Honour for me, that you must take ſuch Care to ſhew
it to the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And do you think that I am ſo
deſirous of Glory, that I must aſpire to it by your
Actions? If I must, you have very ill maintain'd
it in the Turnament; and if it be that Vanity that
you depend upon, you'll make no great Progreſs on
a Soul that is not fond of Shame. If you were
poſſest of all the Advantages, which the Prince has
this Day carried away, you yet ought to conſider
what you are going about; and it is not a Maid
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47213:136"/>
like me, who is touch'd with Enterprizes, without
reſpect or permiſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Favourite of the King, was too proud
to hear <hi>Agnes,</hi> without Indignation: But as he
was willing to conceal it, and not offend her,
he made not his Reſentment appear; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the Obſervation ſhe made on the
Triumphs of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> (which encreaſed his
Jealouſies:) <hi>If I have not overcome at the Turna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
reply'd he, <hi>I am not the leſs in Love for
being vanquiſh'd, nor leſs capable of ſucceſs on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They were interrupted here, but from that
Day, <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> who had open'd the firſt
Difficulties, kept no more his wonted Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but perpetually perſecuted <hi>Agnes;</hi> yet
tho' he were protected by the King, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd
in her never the more Conſideration for
him. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was always ignorant by what
Means the Verſes he had loſt in the Garden,
fell into the Hands of <hi>Conſtantia:</hi> As the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
appeared to him Indulgent, he was only
concerned for <hi>Agnes;</hi> and the Love of <hi>Don
Alvaro,</hi> which was then ſo well known, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
the Pain; and had he been poſſeſt of
the Authority, he would not have ſuffer'd
her to have been expos'd to the Perſecutions
of ſo unworthy a Rival. He was alſo afraid
of the King's being advertiſed of his Paſſion,
but he thought not at all of <hi>Elvira</hi>'s, nor
apprehended any Malice from her Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47213:136"/>
While ſhe burnt with a Deſire of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Agnes,</hi> againſt whom ſhe vented all her
Venom; and ſhe was never weary of making
new Reports to her Brother, aſſuring him,
that tho' they could not prove, that <hi>Agnes</hi>
made any returns to the Tenderneſs of the
Prince; yet that was the Cauſe of <hi>Conſtantia</hi>'s
Grief. And, that if this Princeſs ſhould die
of it, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> might marry <hi>Agnes.</hi> In fine,
ſhe ſo incens'd the jealous <hi>Don Alvaro</hi>'s Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
that he could not hinder himſelf from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
immediately to the King, with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of all he knew, and all he gueſt, and
whom he had the Pleaſure to find, was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inrag'd at the News. <hi>My dear</hi> Alvaro, ſaid
the King, <hi>you ſhall inſtantly marry this dangerous
Beauty: And let Poſſeſſion; aſſure your Repoſe and
mine. If I have protected you in other Occaſions,
judge what a Service of ſo great an Importance for
me, would make me undertake; and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
the Forces of this State are in your Power,
and almoſt any thing that I can give, ſhall be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
you, ſo you render your ſelf Maſter of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny

                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> pleas'd, and vain with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
Bounty, made uſe of all the Authority
he gave him: He paſſionately lov'd <hi>Agnes,</hi> and
would not, on the ſudden, make uſe of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
but reſolv'd with himſelf to employ all
poſſible Means to win her fairly; but if that
fail'd, to have recourſe to force, if ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47213:137"/>
While <hi>Agnes de Caſtro</hi> (importun'd by his
Aſſiduities, deſpairing at the Grief of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
and perhaps made tender by thoſe ſhe had
caus'd in the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi>) took a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
worthy of her Vertue; yet, amiable as
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> was, ſhe found nothing in him, but
his being Husband to <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> that was dear
to her: And far from encouraging the Power
ſhe had got over his Heart, ſhe thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but removing from <hi>Coimbra;</hi> the Paſſion
of <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> which ſhe had no inclination to
favour, ſerv'd her as a Pretext, and preſs'd
with the fear of cauſing, in the End, a cruel
Divorce between the Prince and his Princeſs,
ſhe went to find <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> with a Trouble,
which all her Care was not able to hide from
her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Princeſs eaſily found it out; and their
common Misfortune having not chang'd their
Friendſhip:</hi>—What ails you, <hi>Agnes? ſaid the
Princeſs to her, in a ſoft Tone, and her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Sweetneſs;</hi> And what new Misfortune cauſes
that Sadneſs in thy Looks? Madam, <hi>reply'd</hi> Agnes,
<hi>ſhedding a Rivulet of Tears,</hi> the Obligations
and Tyes I have to you, put me upon a cruel Tryal;
I had bounded the Felicity of my Life in hope of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it near your Highneſs; yet I must carry, to
ſome other part of the World, this unlucky Face of
mine, which renders me nothing but ill Offices: And
itis to obtain that Liberty, that I am come to throw
myſelf at your Feet; looking upon you as my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:47213:137"/>
Conſtantia <hi>was ſo ſurpriz'd and touch'd with
the Propoſition of</hi> Agnes, <hi>that ſhe loſt her
Speech for ſome Moments; Tears, which were
ſincere, expreſs'd her firſt Sentiments: And
after having ſhed abundance, to give a new
Mark of her Tenderneſs to the Fair afflicted</hi>
Agnes, <hi>ſhe with a ſad and melancholy Look,
fix'd her Eyes upon her, and holding out her
Hand to her, in a moſt obliging manner, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
cry'd,</hi>—You will then, my dear <hi>Agnes,</hi>
leave me? and expoſe me to the Griefs of ſeeing you
no more? Alas, Madam, <hi>interrupted this love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Maid,</hi> hide from the unhappy <hi>Agnes</hi> a Bounty,
which does but increaſe her Misfortunes. It is not
I, Madam, that would leave you, it is my Duty,
and my Reaſon that orders my Fate. And thoſe
Days which I ſhall paſs far from you, promiſe me
nothing to oblige me to this Deſign, if I did not ſee
myſelf abſolutely forc'd to it: I am not ignorant of
what paſſes at <hi>Coimbra;</hi> and I ſhall be an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice
of the Injuſtice there committed, if I
ſhould ſtay there any longer.—Ah, I
I know your Vertue, <hi>cry'd</hi> Conſtantia, and you may
remain here, in all ſafety, while I am your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectreſs;
and let what will happen, I will accuſe you
of nothing. There's no anſwering for what's to
come, <hi>reply'd</hi> Agnes, <hi>ſadly;</hi> and I ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
Guilty, if my Preſence cauſe Sentiments,
which cannot be innocent. Beſide, Madam, the
Importunities of <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> are inſupportable to
me; and though I find nothing but Averſion for
him, ſince the King protects his Inſolence, and he's
in a Condition of undertaking any thing, my Flight
is abſolutely neceſſary: But, Madam, though he

Heaven to witneſs, that if I could cure the Prince
by marrying <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> I would not conſider of
it a Moment; and finding in my Puniſhment the
Conſolation of ſacrificing my ſelf to my Princeſs, I
would ſupport it without murmuring. But if I were
the Wife of <hi>Don Alvaro, Don Pedro</hi> would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
look upon me with the ſame Eyes: So that I
find nothing more reaſonable for me, than to hide
myſelf in ſome Corner of the World; where, though
I ſhall moſt certainly live without Pleaſure, yet I
ſhall preſerve the Repoſe of my dearest Miſtreſs. All
the Reaſon you find in this Deſign, <hi>anſwered the
Princeſs,</hi> cannot oblige me to approve of your Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:
Will it reſtore me the Heart of <hi>Don Pedro?</hi>
And will he not fly away with you? his Grief is mine,
and my Life is ty'd to his; do not make him deſpair
then, if you love me. I know ye, I tell you ſo once
more; and let your Power be never ſo great over the
Heart of the Prince, I will not ſuffer you to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
us.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Agnes</hi> thought ſhe had perfectly
known <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> yet ſhe did not expect to
find ſo intire a Vertue in her, which made her
think herſelf more happy, and the Prince more
criminal. <hi>Oh, Wiſdom! Oh, Bounty without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample!</hi>
(cry'd ſhe) <hi>Why is it, that the cruel De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies
do not give you all you deſerve? You are the
Diſpoſer of my Actions,</hi> continu'd ſhe (in kiſſing
the Hand of <hi>Conſtantia</hi>) I'll do nothing but what
you'll have me: But conſider, weigh well the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that ought to counſel you in the Meaſures you
oblige me to take.</p>

                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:47213:138"/>
Don Pedro, <hi>who had not ſeen the Princeſs all
that Day, came in then, and finding 'em both
extreamly troubled; with a fierce Impatience,
demanded the Cauſe:</hi> Sir, <hi>anſwered</hi> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
<hi>Agnes</hi> too wiſe, and too ſcrupulous, fears the
Effects of her Beauty, and will live no longer at
<hi>Coimbra;</hi> and it was on this Subject, (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be agreeable to me) that ſhe ask'd my Advice.
<hi>The Prince grew pale at this Diſcourſe, and
ſnatching the Words from her Mouth (with
more concern, than poſſeſt either of them)
cry'd with a Voice very feeble, Agnes</hi> cannot
fail, if ſhe follow your Councel Madam; and I
leave you full liberty to give it her. <hi>He then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
went out, and the Princeſs, whoſe
Heart he perfectly poſſeſt, not being able to
hide her Diſpleaſure, ſaid,</hi> My dear <hi>Agnes,</hi> if
my Satisfaction did not only depend on your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
I ſhould deſire it of you, for <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s
sake; it is the only Advantage that his unfortunate
Love can hope: And would not the World have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to call me Barbarous, if I contributed to deprive
him of that? But the ſight of me will prove a Poyſon
to him,—<hi>reply'd</hi> Agnes, And what ſhould I
do, my Princeſs, if after the Reſerve he has hitherto
kept, his Mouth ſhould add any thing to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I have already felt, by ſpeaking to me of his
Flame? You would hear him ſure, without cauſing
him to deſpair, <hi>reply'd</hi> Conſtantia; and I ſhould
put this Obligation to the Account of the rest you
have done. Would you then have me expect thoſe
Events which I fear, Madam? <hi>reply'd</hi> Agnes;
Well—I will obey, but just Heavens, <hi>purſued
ſhe,</hi> if they prove fatal, do not puniſh an innocent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47213:139"/>
Heart for it. <hi>Thus this Converſation ended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
Agnes <hi>withdrew into her Chamber, but it was
not to be more at eaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had learn'd of the Deſign
of <hi>Agnes,</hi> caus'd a cruel Agitation in his Soul;
he wiſh'd he had never lov'd her, and deſir'd a
thouſand times to die: But it was not for him
to make Vows againſt a thing which Fate
had deſign'd him; and whatever Reſolutions
he made, to bear the Abſence of <hi>Agnes,</hi> his
Tenderneſs had not force enough to conſent
to it.</p>
                  <p>After having, for a long time, combated
with himſelf, he determin'd to do, what was
impoſſible for him, to let <hi>Agnes</hi> do. His Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
reproach'd him with the Idleneſs, in which
he paſt the moſt Youthful and Vigorous of his
Days; and making it appear to the King, that
his Allies, and even the Prince <hi>Don John Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
his Father-in-Law, had Concerns in the
World, which demanded his Preſence on the
Frontiers; he eaſily obtain'd Liberty to make
this Journey, to which the Princeſs would put
no Obſtacle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes</hi> ſaw him part without any Concern,
but it was not upon the Account of any Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſhe had for him. <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> began then
to make his Importunity, an open Perſecution;
he forgot nothing that might touch the inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<hi>Agnes,</hi> and made uſe, a long time, only of
the Arms of Love: But ſeeing that this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
and Reſpect was to no purpoſe, he
form'd ſtrange Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:47213:139"/>
As the King had a Deference for all his
Counſels, it was not difficult to inſpire him
with what he had a Mind to: He complain'd
of the ungrateful <hi>Agnes,</hi> and forgot nothing
that might make him perceive that ſhe was not
cruel to him, on his Account; but from the
too much Senſibility ſhe had for the Prince.
The King, who was extream angry at this, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated
all the Promiſes he had made him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King had not yet ſpoke to</hi> Agnes, <hi>in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of</hi> Don Alvaro; <hi>and not doubting but his
Approbation would ſurmount all Obſtacles,
he took an occaſion to entertain her with it:
And removing ſome diſtance from thoſe who
might hear him,</hi> I thought <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> had Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
enough, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> to have obtain'd a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſhare in your Eſteem; and I could not imagine,
there would have been any neceſſity of my ſolliciting
it for him: I know you are very charming, but he
has nothing that renders him unworthy of you; and
when you ſhall reflect on the Choice my Friendſhip has
made of him, from among all the Great Men of my
Court, you will do him, at the ſame time, Juſtice.
His Fortune is none of the meanest, ſince he has me
for his Protector: He is nobly born, a Man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Courage; he adores you, and it ſeems to
me, that all theſe Reaſons are ſufficient to vanquiſh
your Pride.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Heart of</hi> Agnes <hi>was ſo little diſpoſed to
give itſelf to</hi> Don Alvaro, <hi>that all that the King
of</hi> Portugal <hi>had ſaid, had no Effect on her, in
his favour.</hi> If <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> Sir, <hi>anſwered ſhe,</hi>
were without Merit, he poſſest Advantages enough
in the Bounty your Majeſty is pleaſed to Honour him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:140"/>
with, to make him Maſter of all things,; it is not
that I find any Defect in him, that I anſwer not his
Deſires: But, Sir, by what obſtinate Power, would
you that I ſhould Love, if Heaven has not given
me a Soul that is tender? And why ſhould you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that I ſhould ſubmit to him, when nothing is
dearer to me than my Liberty? You are not ſo free,
nor ſo inſenſile, as you ſay, (<hi>anſwered the King,
bluſhing, with Anger;</hi>) and if your Heart were
exempt from all ſorts of Affection, he might expect a
more reaſonable Return than what he finds. But im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
Maid, conducted by an ill Fate, <hi>added he,
in Fury,</hi> what Pretenſions have you to <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro?</hi>
Hitherto, I have hid the Chagreen, which
his Weakneſs, and yours gave me; but it was not the
leſs violent for being hid: And ſince you oblige me
to break out, I must tell you, that if my Son were
not already married to <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> he ſhould never
be your Husband; renounce then thoſe vain Ideas,
which will cure him, and juſtifie you.</p>
                  <p>The couragious <hi>Agnes</hi> was ſcarce Miſtreſs
of the firſt Tranſports, at a Diſcourſe ſo full
of Contempt; but calling her Vertue to the aid
of her Anger, ſhe recover'd herſelf by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Reaſon: And conſidering the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
ſhe receiv'd, not as coming from a Great
King, but a Man blinded and poſſeſt by <hi>Don
Alvaro,</hi> ſhe thought him not worthy of her
Reſentment; her fair Eyes animated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with ſo ſhining a vivacity, they anſwered
for the purity of her Sentiments; and fixing
them ſtedfaſtly on the King. <hi>If the Prince,</hi> Don
Pedro <hi>have Weakneſſes,</hi> (reply'd ſhe, with an
Air diſdainful) <hi>he never communicated 'em to me;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47213:140"/>
and I am certain, I never contributed wilfully to
'em: But to let you ſee how little I regard your
Defiance, and to put my Glory in ſafety, I will live
far from you, and all that belongs to you: Yes, Sir,
I will quit</hi> Coimbra <hi>with pleaſure; and for this
Man, who is ſo dear to you,</hi> (anſwer'd ſhe with
a noble Pride and Fierceneſs, of which the
King felt all the Force) <hi>for this Favourite, ſo
worthy to poſſeſs the most tender affections of a great
Prince, I aſſure you, that into whatever part of the
World Fortune conducts me, I will not carry away
the least Remembrance of him.</hi> At theſe words
ſhe made a profound Reverence, and made
ſuch haſte from his Preſence, that he could not
oppoſe her going if he would.</p>
                  <p>The King was now more ſtrongly convinc'd
than ever, that ſhe favoured the Paſſion of Don
<hi>Pedro,</hi> and immediately went to <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> to
inſpire her with the ſame thought; but ſhe was
not capable of receiving ſuch Impreſſions, and
following her own natural Inclinations, ſhe
generouſly defended the Virtue of <hi>Actions.</hi> The
King angry to ſee her ſo well intentioned to
her Rival, whom he would have had her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
reproached her with the ſweetneſs of her
Temper, and went thence to mix his Anger
with Don <hi>Alvaro</hi>'s Rage, who was totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
when he ſaw the Negotiation of his
Maſter had taken no effect. The haughty
Maid braves me then, Sir, ſaid he to the King,
and deſpiſes the Honour which your Bounty
offered her! Why cannot I reſiſt ſo fatal a
Paſſion? But I muſt love her, in ſpight of my
ſelf; and if this Flame conſume me, I can find
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47213:141"/>
no way to extinguiſh it; what can I farther
do for you, replied the King? Alas, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> I muſt do by force, what I
cannot otherwiſe hope from the Proud and
Cruel <hi>Agnes.</hi> Well then, added the King,
ſince it is not fit for me to Authorize publickly
a Violence in the midſt of my Kingdom, chuſe
thoſe of my Subjects which you think moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ſerving you, and take away by force
the Beauty that charms you, and if ſhe do not
yield to your Love, put that Power you are
Maſter of in execution, to oblige her to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
you.</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> raviſh'd with this Propoſition,
which at the ſame time flatter'd both his Love
and Anger, caſt himſelf at the feet of the King,
and renew'd his Acknowledgments by freſh
Proteſtations, and thought of nothing but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
his unjuſt Authority againſt <hi>Agnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Pedro</hi> had been about three months ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
when <hi>Alvaro</hi> undertook what the King
counſell'd him to; tho' the Moderation was
known to him, yet he feared his Preſence, and
would not attend the Return of a Rival, with
whom he would avoid all Diſputes.</p>
                  <p>One Night, when the ſad <hi>Agnes,</hi> full of her
ordinary Inquietudes, in vain expected the
God of Sleep, ſhe heard a noiſe, and after ſaw
ſome Men unknown enter her Chamber, whoſe
Meaſures being well conſulted, they carried her
out of the Palace, and putting her in a cloſe
Coach, forc'd her out of <hi>Coimbra,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hinder'd by any Obſtacle. She knew not
of whom to complain, nor whom to ſuſpect;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47213:141"/>
Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> ſeem'd too puiſſant to ſeek his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
this way; and ſhe accus'd not the
Prince of this Attempt, of whom ſhe had ſo
favourable an Opinion; whatever ſhe could
think or ſay, ſhe could not hinder her ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
They hurried her on with diligence, and
before it was Day, were a conſiderable way off
from the Town.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as Day began to break, ſhe ſurveyed
thoſe that encompaſſed her, without ſo much
as knowing one of them; and ſeeing that her
Cries and Prayers were all in vain with theſe
deaf Raviſhers, ſhe ſatisfied herſelf with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
the Protection of Heaven, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
herſelf to its Conduct.</p>
                  <p>While ſhe ſate thus overwhelmed with grief,
uncertain of her Deſtiny, ſhe ſaw a Body of
Horſe advance towards the Troop which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
her; the Raviſhers did not ſhun them,
thinking it to be Don <hi>Alvaro;</hi> but when he
approached more near, they found it was the
Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who was at the Head of
'em, and who, without foreſeeing the occaſion
that would offer itſelf of ſerving <hi>Agnes,</hi> was
returning to <hi>Coimbra</hi> full of her Idea, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
performed what he ought in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes,</hi> who did not expect him, changed
now her Opinion, and thought that it was the
Prince that had cauſed her to be ſtolen away.
<hi>Oh, Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>having ſtill the ſame
Thought, Is it you that have torn me from the
Princeſs? and could ſo cruel a Blow come from
a Hand that is ſo dear to her, what will you
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47213:142"/>
do with an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate Creature, who deſires
nothing but Death? and why will you obſcure
the Glory of your Life, by an Artifice unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of you?</hi> This Language aſtoniſh'd the
Prince no leſs than the Sight of <hi>Agnes</hi> had
done; he found by what ſhe had ſaid, that
ſhe was taken away by force; and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paſſing to the height of Rage, he made
her underſtand by one only Look, that he was
not the baſe Author of her Trouble. <hi>I tear
you from</hi> Conſtantia, <hi>whoſe only Pleaſure you are,</hi>
replied he: <hi>What Opinion have you of Don</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro?
<hi>No, Madam, though you ſee me here, I am
altogether innocent of the Violence that has been done
you; and there is nothing I will refuſe to hinder it.</hi>
He then turned himſelf to behold the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhers,
but his Preſence had already ſcattered
'em: he ordered ſome of his Men to purſue
'em, and to ſeize ſome of 'em, that he might
know what Authority it was that ſet 'em at
work.</p>
                  <p>During this, <hi>Agnes</hi> was no leſs confus'd than
before; ſhe admir'd the Conduct of her Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that brought the Prince at a time when he
was ſo neceſſary to her: Her Inclinations to
do him Juſtice, ſoon repair'd the Offence her
Suſpicions had caus'd; ſhe was glad to have
eſcap'd a Misfortune, which appear'd certain
to her; but this was not a ſincere Joy, when
ſhe conſider'd that her Lover was her Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
and a Lover worthy of all her Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments,
but who ow'd his Heart to the moſt
amiable Princeſs in the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:47213:142"/>
While the Prince's Men were purſuing the
Raviſhers of <hi>Agnes,</hi> he was left almoſt alone
with her; and tho' he had always reſolv'd to
ſhun being ſo, yet his Conſtancy was not Proof
againſt ſo fair an Occaſion: <q>Madam, ſaid
he to her, is it poſſible that Men born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe that obey us, ſhould be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of offending you? I never thought my
ſelf deſtin'd to revenge ſuch an Offence; but
ſince Heaven has permitted you to receive
it, I will either periſh or make them repent it.
Sir, replied <hi>Agnes,</hi> more concern'd at this
courſe than at the Enterprize of Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi>
thoſe who are wanting in their Reſpect to the
Princeſs and you, are not oblig'd to have any
for me. I do not in the leaſt doubt but Don
<hi>Alvaro</hi> was the Undertaker of this Enterprize,
and I judg'd what I ought to fear from him,
by what his Importunities have already made
me ſuffer. He is ſure of the King's Protection,
and he will make him an Accomplice in his
Crime; but, Sir, Heaven conducted you hither
happily for me, and I owe you for the liberty
I have of ſerving the Princeſs yet longer.
You will do for <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> replied the Prince,
what 'tis impoſſible not to do for you; your
Goodneſs attaches you to her, and my Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
engages me to you for ever.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The modeſt <hi>Agnes,</hi> who fear'd this Diſcourſe
as much as the Misfortune ſhe had newly ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
anſwer'd nothing but by down-caſt Eyes,
and the Prince, who knew the trouble ſhe was
in, left her to go ſpeak to his Men, who brought
back one of thoſe that belong'd to Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:47213:143"/>
by whoſe Confeſſion he found the Truth: He
pardon'd him, thinking not fit to puniſh him,
who obey'd a Man whom the weakneſs of his
Father had render'd powerful.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards they conducted <hi>Agnes</hi> back to
<hi>Coimbra,</hi> where her Adventure began to make
a great noiſe: The Princeſs was ready to die
with Deſpair, and at firſt thought it was only
a continuation of the Deſign this fair Maid
had of retiring; but ſome Women that ſerv'd
her having told the Princeſs, that ſhe was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away by Violence, <hi>Conſtantia</hi> made her
Complaint to the King, who regarded her not
at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Madam, ſaid he to her, let this fatal Plague
remove itſelf, who takes from you the Heart
of your Husband, and without afflicting your
ſelf for her Abſence, bleſs Heaven and me
for it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Generous Princeſs took <hi>Agnes</hi>'s part
with a great deal of Courage, and was then
diſputing her defence with the King, when
Don <hi>Pedro</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Coimbra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt Object that met the Prince's Eyes
was Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> who was paſſing through one
of the Courts of the Palace, amidſt a Croud of
Courtiers, whom his favour with the King
drew after him. This Sight made Don <hi>Pedro</hi>
rage; but that of the Princeſs and <hi>Agnes</hi>
caus'd in him another ſort of Emotion: He
eaſily divin'd, that it was Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> who had
taken her from his Men, and, if his Fury had
acted what it would, it might have produc'd
very ſad effects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47213:143"/>
                     <q>Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> ſaid the Prince to him, is it
thus you make uſe of the Authority which
the King my Father has given you? Have
you receiv'd Employments and Power from
him for no other end but to do baſe Actions,
and to commit Rapes on Ladies? Are you
ignorant how the Princeſs intereſts herſelf
in all that concerns this Maid? And do you
not know the tender and affectionate Eſteem
ſhe has for her? No, replied Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi>
                     </q>
(with an Inſolence that had like to have put
the Prince paſt all Patience) <q>I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it, nor of the Intereſt your Heart
takes in her. Baſe and treacherous as thou
art, replied the Prince, neither the Favour
which thou haſt ſo much abuſed, nor the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
which makes thee ſpeak this, ſhould
hinder me from puniſhing thee, wert thou
worthy of my Sword; but there are other
ways to humble thy Pride, and 'tis not fit
for ſuch an Arm as mine to ſeek ſo baſe an
Imployment to puniſh ſuch a Slave as thou
art.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Pedro</hi> went away at theſe words, and
left <hi>Alvaro</hi> in a Rage, which is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,
deſpairing to ſee himſelf defeated in an
Enterprize he thought ſo ſure, and at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the Prince ſhew'd him, he promiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to ſacrifice all to his Revenge.</p>
                  <p>Tho' the King loved his Son, he was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd
againſt his Paſſion, that he could not
pardon him what he had done, and condemn'd
him as much for this laſt Act of Juſtice, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
<hi>Agnes,</hi> as if it had been the greateſt of
Crimes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47213:144"/>
                     <hi>Elvira,</hi> whom the ſweetneſs of Hope flatter'd
ſome moments, ſaw the return of <hi>Agnes</hi> with
a ſenſible Diſpleaſure, which ſuffer'd her to
think of nothing but irritating her Brother.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the Prince ſaw the King, but inſtead
of being receiv'd by him with a Joy due to the
ſucceſs of his Journey, he appear'd all ſullen
and out of Humour. After having paid him
his firſt Reſpects, and gave him an exact
account of what he had done, he ſpoke to him
about the Violence committed againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Agnes de Caſtro,</hi> and complain'd to him
of it in the Name of the Princeſs, and of his
own: <q>You ought to be ſilent in this Affair,
replied the King, and the Motive which
makes you ſpeak is ſo ſhameful for you, that
I ſigh and bluſh at it: What is it to you, if
this Maid, whoſe Preſence is troubleſome to
me, be remov'd hence, ſince 'tis I that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it? But, Sir, interrupted the Prince,
what neceſſity is there of employing Force,
Artifice, and the Night, when the leaſt of
your Orders had been ſufficient; <hi>Agnes</hi> would
willingly have obey'd you, and if ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
at <hi>Coimbra,</hi> 'tis perhaps againſt her will;
but be it as it will, Sir, <hi>Conſtantia</hi> is offended,
and if it were not for fear of diſpleaſing you,
(the only thing that retains me) the Raviſher
ſhould not have gone unpuniſh'd. How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are you, replied the King, ſmiling with
Diſdain, in making uſe of the Name of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia</hi>
to uphold the Intereſt of your Heart;
you think I am ignorant of it, and that this
unhappy Princeſs looks on the Injury you
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47213:144"/>
do her with Indifference. Never ſpeak to me
more of <hi>Agnes,</hi> (with a Tone very ſevere)
Content your ſelf, that I pardon what's paſt,
and think maturely of the Conſiderations I
have for <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> when you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
any thing againſt him. Yes, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
the Prince, with fierceneſs, I will ſpeak
to you no more of <hi>Agnes,</hi> but <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> and
I will never ſuffer, that ſhe ſhould be any
more expos'd to the Inſolence of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.</q>
The King had like to have broke
out into Rage at this Diſcourſe; but he had
yet a Reſt of Prudence left, that hinder'd him.
<q>Retire, (ſaid he to <hi>Don Pedro</hi>) and go make
Reflections on what my Power can do, and
what you owe me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>During this Converſation, <hi>Agnes</hi> was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
from the Princeſs, and from all the Ladies
of the Court, great Expreſſions of Joy, and
Friendſhip, <hi>Conſtantia</hi> ſaw again her Husband,
with a great deal of ſatisfaction, and far from
being ſorry at what he had lately done for
<hi>Agnes,</hi> ſhe privately return'd him Thanks for
it, and ſtill was the ſame towards him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the Jealouſie which was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to be inſpir'd in her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> who found in his Siſter a Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs
worthy of his Truſt, did not conceal
his Fury from her. After ſhe had made vain
Attempts to moderate it, in blotting <hi>Agnes</hi> out
of his Heart, ſeeing that his Diſeaſe was incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
ſhe made him underſtand, that ſo long
as <hi>Conſtantio</hi> ſhould not be Jealous, there was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47213:145"/>
no Hopes. That if <hi>Agnes</hi> ſhould once be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
by her, ſhe would not fail of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
her, and that then it would be eaſie
to get Satisfaction, the Prince being now ſo
proud of <hi>Conſtantia</hi>'s Indulgency. In giving
this Advice to her Brother, ſhe promis'd to
ſerve him effectually; and having no need of
any Body but herſelf to perform Ill Things, ſhe
recommended <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> to manage well the
King.</p>
                  <p>Four Years were paſs'd in that melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Station, and the Princeſs, beſides her firſt
dead Child, and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who was ſtill
living, had brought two Daughters into the
World.</p>
                  <p>Some Days after <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Return, <hi>Elvira,</hi>
who was moſt dextrous in the Art of Well-governing
any wicked Deſign, did gain one
of the Servants which belong'd to <hi>Conſtantia</hi>'s
Chamber. She firſt ſpoke her fair, then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd
her with Preſents and Gifts, and
finding in her as ill a Diſpoſition as in herſelf,
ſhe readily reſolv'd to employ her.</p>
                  <p>After ſhe was ſure of her, ſhe compos'd a
Letter, which was after writ over again in
an unknown Hand, which ſhe depoſited in that
Maid's Hands, that ſhe might deliver to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia</hi>
with the firſt Opportunity, telling her,
that <hi>Agnes</hi> had drop'd it. This was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Employ not my own Hand to write to you, for
Reaſons that I ſhall acquaint you with. How
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47213:145"/>
happy am I to have overcome all your Scruples!
And what Happineſs ſhall I find in the Progreſs of
our Intrigue! The whole Courſe of my Life, ſhall
continually repreſent to you the Sincerity of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
pray think on the Secret Converſation that
I require of you; I dare not ſpeak to you in publick,
therefore let me conjure you here, by all that I have
ſuffer'd, to come to Night to the Place appointed, and
ſpeak to me no more of <hi>Conſtantia;</hi> for ſhe must
be content with my Eſteem, ſince my Heart can be
only Yours.</p>
                  <p>The unfaithful <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſerv'd <hi>Elvira</hi> exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to her Deſires, and the very next Day ſeeing
<hi>Agnes</hi> go out from the Princeſs, ſhe carry'd
<hi>Conſtantia</hi> the Letter; which ſhe took, and
found there what ſhe was far from imagining:
Tenderneſs never produc'd an Effect more
full of Grief, than what it made her ſuffer:
<hi>Alas, they are both culpable</hi> (ſaid ſhe, ſighing)
<hi>and in ſpight of the Defence my Heart wou'd make
for 'em, my Reaſon Condemns 'em. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
the ſad Subject of the Capriciouſneſs of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune!
Why dost not thou die, ſince thou hast not a
Heart of Honour to revenge itſelf? O</hi> Don Pedro!
<hi>Why did you give me your Hand, without your Heart?
And thou, Fair, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful! Wert thou born
to be the Misfortune of my Life, and, perhaps, the
only Cauſe of my Death.</hi> After having given
ſome Moments to the Violence of her Grief,
ſhe call'd the Maid, who brought her the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
commanding her to ſpeak of it tono Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and to ſuffer no one to enter into her
Chamber.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:47213:146"/>
She conſider'd then of that Prince with more
liberty, whoſe Soul ſhe was not able to touch
with the leaſt Tenderneſs; and of the cruel
fair One that had betray'd her: Yet, even
while her Soul was upon the Rack, ſhe was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to excuſe 'em, and ready to do all ſhe could
for Don <hi>Pedro;</hi> at leaſt, ſhe made a firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
not to complain of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elvira</hi> was not long without being inform'd
of what had paſs'd, nor of the Melancholly of
the Princeſs, from whom ſhe hop'd all ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes,</hi> far from foreſeeing this Tempeſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Conſtantia;</hi> and hearing of her Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
paſs'd the reſt of the day at her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-door,
that ſhe might from time to time
learn News of her Health, for ſhe was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to come in, at which <hi>Agnes</hi> was both ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
and troubled. The Prince had the
ſame Deſtiny, and was aſtoniſh'd at an Order
which ought to have excepted him.</p>
                  <p>The next day <hi>Conſtantia</hi> appear'd, but ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
that 'twas not difficult to imagine what
ſhe had ſuffer'd. <hi>Agnes</hi> was the moſt impatient
to approach her, and the Princeſs could not
forbear weeping. They were both ſilent for
ſome time, and <hi>Conſtantia</hi> attributed this Silence
of <hi>Agnes</hi> to ſome Remorſe which ſhe felt; and
this unhappy Maid being able to hold no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<hi>Is it poſſible Madam,</hi> (ſaid ſhe,) <hi>that two
Days ſhould have taken from me all the Goodneſs
you had for me? What have I done? And for
what do you puniſh me?</hi> The Princeſs regarded
her with a languiſhing look, and return'd her
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47213:146"/>
no Anſwer, but Sighs. <hi>Agnes,</hi> offended at this
Reſerve, went out with very great Diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Anger; which contributed to her
being thought criminal. The Prince came in
immediately after, and found <hi>Conſtantia</hi> more
diſorder'd than uſual, and conjur'd her in a
moſt obliging manner to take care of her
Health: <hi>The greateſt good for me</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>is
not the Continuation of my Life; I ſhould have
more Care of it if I lov'd you leſs; but</hi>—She
could not proceed; and the Prince, exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
afflicted at her trouble, ſigh'd ſadly,
without making her any Anſwer, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
her Grief. Spight then began to mix
itſelf; and all things perſwading the Princeſs
that they made a Sacrafice of her, ſhe would
enter into no Explanation with her Husband,
but ſuffer'd him to go away without ſaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing to him.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more capable of troubling our
Reaſon, and conſuming our Health, then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Notions of Jealouſie in Solitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> who us'd to open her Heart free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Agnes,</hi> now believing ſhe had deceiv'd
her, abandon'd herſelf ſo abſolutely to Grief,
that ſhe was ready to ſink under it; ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
fell ſick with the violence of it, and all
the Court was concern'd at this Misfortune:
Don <hi>Pedro</hi> was truly afflicted at it, but <hi>Agnes</hi>
more than all the World beſide. <hi>Conſtantia</hi>'s
Coldneſs towards her, made her continually
ſigh; and her Diſtemper, created meerly by
Fancy, caus'd her to reflect on every thing that
offer'd itſelf to her Memory; ſo that at laſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47213:147"/>
ſhe began even to fear herſelf, and to reproach
herſelf for what the Princeſs ſuffer'd.</p>
                  <p>But the Diſtemper began to be ſuch, that
they fear'd <hi>Conſtantia</hi>'s Death, and ſhe herſelf
began to feel the Approaches of it. This
Thought did not at all diſquiet her; ſhe look'd
on Death as the only Relief from all her Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and regarded the Deſpair of all that
approach'd her without the leaſt concern.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King, who lov'd her tenderly, and who
knew her Vertue, was infinitely mov'd at the
Extremity ſhe was in. And Don</hi> Alvaro, <hi>who
loſt not the leaſt Occaſion of making him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that it was Jealouſie which was the
Cauſe of</hi> Conſtantia<hi>'s Diſtemper, did but too
much incenſe him againſt Criminals worthy of
Compaſſion. The King was not of a Temper
to conceal his Anger long:</hi> You give fine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
(<hi>ſaid he to the Prince</hi>) and ſuch as
will render your Memory illuſtrious; and the
Death of <hi>Conſtantia</hi> (of which you are only
to be accus'd of) is the unhappy Fruit of your
guilty Paſſion. Fear Heaven after this; and
behold yourſelf as a Monſter that does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to ſee the Light. If the Interest you
have in my Blood did not plead for you, what
ought you not to fear from my just Reſentment?
But what must not Imprudent <hi>Agnes,</hi> to
whom nothing ties me, expect from my hands?
If <hi>Conſtantia</hi> dyes, ſhe, who has the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
in my Court, to cheriſh a fooliſh Flame
by vain Hopes, and make us loſe the most
Amiable Princeſs, whom thou art not worthy to
poſſeſs, ſhall feel the Effects of her Indiſcretion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:47213:147"/>
                     <hi>Don</hi> Pedro <hi>knew very well, that</hi> Conſtantia
<hi>was not ignorant of his Sentiments for</hi> Agnes;
<hi>but he knew alſo with what Moderation ſhe
receiv'd it: He was very ſenſible of the King's
Reproaches; but as his Fault was not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
and that a commanding Power, a fatal
Star had forc'd him to love in ſpight of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he appear'd afflicted and confus'd:</hi> You
condemn me, Sir, (<hi>anſwered he</hi>) without having
well examin'd me; and if my Intentions were
known to you, perhaps you would not find me ſo
criminal: I would take the Princeſs for my
Judge, whom you ſay, I ſacrifice, if ſhe were
in a condition to be conſulted. If I am guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any Weakneſs, her Juſtice never reproach'd
me for it; and my Tongue never inform'd <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
of it. But, ſuppoſe I have committed any
Fault, why wou'd you puniſh an Innocent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
who perhaps condemns me for it as much
as you? Ah, Villain! (<hi>interrupted the King,</hi>)
ſhe has but too much favour'd you: You would
not have lov'd thus long, had ſhe not made you
ſome Returns. Sir, (<hi>reply'd the Prince, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with Grief for the Outrage that was
committed againſt</hi> Agnes,) you offend a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
than which nothing can be purer; and thoſe
Expreſſions which break from your Choler, are
not worthy of you. <hi>Agnes</hi> never granted me
any Favours; I never asked any of her; and
I protest to Heaven, I never thought of any thing
contrary to the Duty I owe <hi>Conſtantia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As they thus argued, one of the Princeſs's
Women came all in Tears, to acquaint Don
<hi>Pedro,</hi> That the Princeſs was in the laſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47213:148"/>
of Life: <hi>Go ſee thy fatal Work,</hi> (ſaid
the King,) <hi>and expect from a too-long-patient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage thou deſerv'st.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince ran to <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> whom he
found dying, and <hi>Agnes</hi> in a ſwoon, in the
Arms of ſome of the Ladies. What caus'd
this double Calamity, was, that <hi>Agnes,</hi> who
could ſuffer no longer the Indifferency of the
Princeſs, had conjur'd her to tell her what was
her Crime, and either to take her Life from
her, or reſtore her Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>Conſtantia, <hi>who found ſhe muſt die, could
no longer keep her ſecret Affliction from</hi> Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
<hi>and after ſome Words, which were a
Preparative to the ſad Explanation, ſhe ſhew'd
her that fatal Billet which</hi> Elvira <hi>had caus'd to
be written:</hi> Ah! Madam, (<hi>cry'd out the fair</hi>
Agnes, <hi>after having read it;</hi>) Ah, Madam!
How many cruel Inquietudes had you ſpar'd me, had
you open'd your Heart to me with your wonted Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
'Tis eaſy to ſee that this Letter is counterfeit,
and that I have Enemies without compaſſion. Cou'd
you believe the Prince ſo Impudent, to make uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other hand but his own, on an occaſion like this?
And do you believe me ſo Simple, to keep about me
this Teſtimony of my Shame, with ſo little Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
You are neither betray'd by your Husband nor
me; I attest Heaven, and thoſe Efforts I have made,
to leave <hi>Coimbra.</hi> Alas, my dear Princeſs! how
little have you known her, whom you have ſo much
honour'd? Do not believe, that when I have juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
myſelf, I will have any more Communication
with the World. No, no; there will be no Retreat
far enough from hence for me. I will take care to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47213:148"/>
hide this unlucky Face, where it ſhall be ſure to do no
more Harm.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs touch'd at this Diſcourſe, and
the Tears of <hi>Agnes,</hi> preſs'd her hand, which
ſhe held in hers; and fixing looks upon her,
capable of moving pity in the moſt inſenſible
Souls, <hi>If I have committed any Offence, my dear</hi>
Agnes, (anſwer'd ſhe) <hi>Death, which I expect
in a moment, ſhall revenge it. I ought alſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to you, That I have not ceas'd loving you, and
that I believe every thing you have ſaid, giving you
back my most tender Affections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Twas at this time that the Grief, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
oppreſs'd 'em, put the Princeſs into
ſuch an Extremity, that they ſent for the
Prince. He came and found himſelf almoſt
without life or motion at this ſight. And
what ſecret Motive ſoever might call him to
the Aid of</hi> Agnes, <hi>'twas to</hi> Conſtantia <hi>he ran.
The Princeſs, who finding her laſt Moments
drawing on, by a cold Sweat that cover'd her
all over; and finding ſhe had no more buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with Life, and cauſing thoſe Perſons ſhe
moſt ſuſpected to retire,</hi> Sir, (<hi>ſaid ſhe to Don</hi>
Pedro,) If I abandon Life without Regret, it is not
without Trouble that I part with you. But, Prince,
we must vanguiſh when we come to die; and I will
forget myſelf wholly, to think of nothing but of you.
I have no Reproaches to make against you, knowing
that 'tis Inclination that diſpoſes Hearts, and not
Reaſon. <hi>Agnes</hi> is beautiful enough to inſpire the
most ardent Paſſion, and vertuous enough to deſerve
the first Fortunes in the World. I ask her, once
more, Pardon for the Injuſtice I have done her, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47213:149"/>
recommend her to you, as a Perſon most dear to me.
Promiſe me, my dear Prince, before I Expire, to
give her my Place in your Throne; it cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fill'd; you cannot chuſe a Princeſs more perfect
for your People, nor a better Mother for our little
Children. And you, my Dear, and my faithful
<hi>Agnes (purſu'd ſhe</hi>) liſten not to a Vertue too
ſcrupulous, that they may make any oppoſition to the
Prince of <hi>Portugal:</hi> Refuſe him not a Heart, of
which he is worthy; and give him that Friendſhip
which you had for me, with that which is due to his
Merit. Take care of my little <hi>Fernando,</hi> and the
two young Princeſſes: let 'em find me in you, and
ſpeak to 'em ſometimes of me. Adieu; live both of
you happy, and receive my last Embraces.</p>
                  <p>The afflicted <hi>Agnes,</hi> who had recover'd a
little her Forces, loſt 'em again a ſecond time:
Her Weakneſs was follow'd with Convulſions
ſo vehement, that they were afraid of her
Life; but Don <hi>Pedro</hi> never remov'd from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia:
What, Madam,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>you will leave
me then; and you think 'tis for my Good. Alas,</hi>
Conſtantia! <hi>if my Heart has committed any Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
against you, your Vertue has ſufficiently reveng'd
you on me, in ſpight of you. Can you think me ſo
barbarous?</hi>—As he was going on, he ſaw
Death ſhut the Eyes of the moſt generous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
for ever; and he was within a very little
of following her.</p>
                  <p>But what loads of Grief was this for <hi>Agnes,</hi>
when ſhe found that in that Interval, when
Life and Death were ſtruggling in her Soul,
that <hi>Conſtantia</hi> was newly expir'd! She would
then have taken away her own Life, and have
let her Deſpair fully appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:47213:149"/>
At the noiſe of the Death of the Princeſs,
the Town and the Palace was all in Tears. <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira,</hi>
who ſaw then Don <hi>Pedro</hi> free to engage
himſelf, repented of having contributed to the
Death of <hi>Agnes,</hi> who thought herſelf the cauſe
of it, promis'd her Griefs never to Pardon
herſelf.</p>
                  <p>She had need of being guarded ſeveral days
together; during which time, ſhe fail'd not
inceſſantly to weep. And the Prince gave all
thoſe days to deepeſt Mourning. But when
the firſt Emotions were paſt, thoſe of his Love
made him feel that he was ſtill the ſame.</p>
                  <p>He was a long time without ſeeing <hi>Agnes,</hi>
but this Abſence of his ſerv'd only to make her
appear the more charming when he did ſee
her.</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> who was afraid of the Liberty
of the Prince, made new Efforts to move <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
de Caſtro;</hi> who was now become inſenſible
to every thing but Grief. <hi>Elvira,</hi> who was
willing to make the beſt of the Deſign ſhe had
begun, conſulted all her Womens Arts, and
the delicacy of her Wit, to revive the Flames
with which the Prince once burnt for her:
But his Inconſtancy was bounded, and it was
<hi>Agnes</hi> alone that was to reign over his Heart.
She had taken a firm Reſolution, ſince the
Death of <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> to paſs the reſt of her days
in a ſolitary Retreat. In ſpight of the Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhe took to hide this Deſign, the Prince
was inform'd of it, and did all he was able to
diſpoſe his Conſtancy and Fortitude to it. He
thought himſelf ſtronger than he really was;

                     <hi>but after he had too well conſulted his Heart,
he found but too well how neceſſary the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of</hi> Agnes <hi>was to him:</hi> Madam, (<hi>ſaid he
to her one day, with a Heart big, and his
Eyes in Tears</hi>) Which Action of my Life has made
you determine my Death? Though I never told you
now much I lov'd you, yet I am perſwaded you are
not ignorant of it. I was conſtrain'd to be ſilent
during ſome Years for your ſake, for <hi>Conſtantia</hi>'s
and my own; but 'tis not poſſible for me to put this
Force upon my Heart for ever: I must once at least
tell you how it languiſhes. Receive then the Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a Paſſion, full of Reſpect and Ardour; with
an Offer of my Fortune, which I wiſh not better, but
for your Advantage.</p>
                  <p>Agnes <hi>anſwer'd not immediately to theſe
Words, but with abundance of Tears; which
having wip'd away, and beholding Don</hi> Pedro
<hi>with an Air which made him eaſily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
ſhe did not agree with his Deſires:</hi> If I
were capable of the Weakneſs with which you'd inſpire
me, you'd be oblig'd to puniſh me for it. What! (<hi>ſaid
ſhe) Conſtantia</hi> is ſcarce bury'd, and you wou'd have
me offend her! No, my Princeſs, (<hi>added ſhe
with more Softneſs;</hi>) No, no, ſhe whom you
have heap'd ſo many Favours on, will not call down
the Anger of Heaven, and the Contempt of Men
upon her, by an Action ſo perfidious. Be not obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
then in a Deſign in which I will never ſhew you
Favour. You owe to <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> after her Death,
a Fidelity that may juſtifie you: And I to repair the
Ills I have made her ſuffer, ought to ſhun all Converſe
with you. Go, Madam, <hi>reply'd the Prince,
growing pale;</hi>) go, and expect the News of my
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47213:151"/>
Death, in that part of the World, whither your
Cruelty ſhall lead you, the News ſhall follow cloſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
you ſhall quickly hear of it; and I will go ſeek
it in thoſe Wars which reign among my Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe words made the fair</hi> Agnes de Caſtro
<hi>perceive that her Innocency was not ſo great
as ſhe imagin'd, and that her Heart intereſted
itſelf in the Preſervation of Don</hi> Pedro: You
ought, Sir, to preſerve your Life, (<hi>reply'd</hi> Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes)
for the ſake of the little Prince and Princeſſes,
which <hi>Conſtantia</hi> has left you. Wou'd you aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
their Youth (<hi>continu'd ſhe, with a tender
Tone</hi>) to the Cruelty of Don <hi>Alvaro?</hi> Live, Sir,
live! and let the unhappy <hi>Agnes</hi> be the only Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
Alas, cruel Maid! (<hi>interrupted Don</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro;)
why do you command me to live, if I cannot
live with you? Is it an effect of your Hatred? No,
Sir, (<hi>replyed</hi> Agnes) I do not hate you; and I
wiſh to God that I cou'd be indifferent, that I might
be able to defend myſelf against the Weakneſs with
which I find myſelf poſſeſs'd. Oblige me to ſay no
more, Sir: You ſee my Bluſhes, interpret them as
you pleaſe; but conſider yet, that the leſs Averſion I
find I have for you, the more culpable I am; and
that I ought no more to ſee, or ſpeak to you. In fine,
Sir, if you oppoſe my Retreat, I declare to you, that
Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> as odious as he is to me, ſhall ſerve
for a Defence against you; and that I will ſooner
conſent to marry a Man I abhor, than to favour a
Paſſion that cost <hi>Conſtantia</hi> her Life. Well then,
<hi>Agnes, (reply'd the Prince, with looks all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
and dying</hi>) follow the Motions which
barbarous Vertue inſpires you with; take thoſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
you judge neceſſary, against an unfortunate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47213:152"/>
and enjoy the Glory of having cruelly refus'd
me.</p>
                  <p>At theſe Words he went away; and as
troubled as <hi>Agnes</hi> was, ſhe would not ſtay
him: Her Courage combated with her Grief,
and ſhe thought now, more than ever of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Twas difficult for her to go out of</hi> Coimbra;
<hi>and not to defer what appear'd to her ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
ſhe went immediately to the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the King, notwithſtanding the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of Don</hi> Alvaro. <hi>the King receiv'd her
with a Countenance ſevere, not being able to
conſent to what ſhe demanded:</hi> You ſhall not
go hence, (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) and if you are wiſe, you ſhall
enjoy here, with Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> both my Friendſhip,
and my Favour. I have taken another Reſolution,
(<hi>anſwer'd</hi> Agnes) and the World has no part in it.
You will accept Don <hi>Pedro, (reply'd the King;</hi>)
his Fortune is ſufficient to ſatisfie an Ambitious
Maid: But you will not ſucceed <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> who
lov'd you ſo tenderly; and <hi>Spain</hi> has Princeſſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to fill up part of the Throne which I ſhall leave
him. Sir, (<hi>reply'd</hi> Agnes, <hi>piqu'd at this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi>)
If I had a diſpoſition to Love, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to Marry, perhaps the Prince might be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Perſon on whom I would fix 'em: And you know,
if my Anceſtors did not poſſeſs Crowns, yet they
were worthy to wear 'em. But let it be how it will,
I am reſolv'd to depart, and to remain no longer a
Slave in a place to which I came Free.</p>
                  <p>This bold Anſwer, which ſhew'd the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>Agnes,</hi> anger'd and aſtoniſh'd the
King: <hi>You ſhall go when we think fit,</hi> (reply'd he)
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47213:152"/>
                     <hi>and without being a Slave at</hi> Coimbra, <hi>you ſhall
attend our Orders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes</hi> ſaw ſhe muſt ſtay, and was ſo griev'd
at it, that ſhe kept her Chamber ſeveral days,
without daring to inform herſelf of the Prince;
and this Retirement ſpar'd her the Affliction
of being viſited by Don <hi>Alvaro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During this, Don <hi>Pedro</hi> fell ſick, and was
in ſo great Danger, that there was a general
Apprehenſion of his Death. <hi>Agnes</hi> did not in
the leaſt doubt, but it was an Effect of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content:
ſhe thought at firſt ſhe had ſtrength
and reſolution enough to ſee him die, rather
than to favour him; but had ſhe reflected a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
ſhe had ſoon been convinc'd to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
She found not in her Heart that cruel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
ſhe thought there ſo well eſtabliſh'd;
ſhe felt Pains and Inquietude, ſhed Tears, made
Wiſhes; and in fine, diſcover'd that ſhe
Lov'd.</p>
                  <p>'Twas impoſſible to ſee the Heir of the
Crown, a Prince that deſerv'd ſo well, even
at the point of Death, without a general Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
The People who lov'd him, paſs'd whole
days at the Palace-gate to hear News of him:
The Court was all overwhelm'd with Grief.</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> knew very well how to conceal
a malicious Joy, under an Appearance of Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<hi>Elvira,</hi> full of Tenderneſs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
of Remorſe, ſuffer'd alſo on her ſide.
The King, altho' he condemn'd the Love of
his Son, yet ſtill had a Tenderneſs for him,
and cou'd not reſolve to loſe him. <hi>Agnes de
Caſtro,</hi> who knew the Cauſe of his Diſtemper,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47213:153"/>
expected the end of it with ſtrange Anxieties.
In fine, after a Month had paſs'd away in Fears,
they began to have a little Hopes of his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
The Prince, and Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> were the
only Perſons that were not glad of it. But
<hi>Agnes</hi> rejoyc'd enough for all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> ſeeing that he muſt live whether
he wou'd or no, thought of nothing, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his days in Melancholly and Diſcontent:
As ſoon as he was in a condition to walk, he
ſought out the moſt ſolitary Places, and gain'd
ſo much upon his own Weakneſs, to go every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
where <hi>Agnes</hi> was not; but her Idea
follow'd him always, and his Memory, faithful,
to repreſent her to him, with all her Charms,
render'd her always dangerous.</p>
                  <p>One day, when they had carry'd him into
the Garden, he ſought out a Labyrinth which
was at the fartheſt part of it, to hide his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly,
during ſome hours; there he found
the ſad <hi>Agnes,</hi> whom Grief, little different
from his, had brought thither; the ſight of
her, whom he expected not, made him trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
She ſaw by his pale and meagre Face, the
remains of his Diſtemper; his Eyes full of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment
troubled her, and tho' her deſire
was ſo great to have fled from him, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Power ſtopt her, and 'twas impoſſible
for her to go.</p>
                  <p>After ſome Moments of Silence, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sighs interrupted, Don <hi>Pedro</hi> rais'd himſelf
from the place, where his Weakneſs had forc'd
him to ſit; he made <hi>Agnes</hi> ſee, as he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, the ſad Marks of his Sufferings, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47213:153"/>
not content with the Pity he ſaw in her Eyes,
<hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

(ſaid he) <hi>my deſire was the ſame with yours; but
Heaven has thought fit to reſerve me for other Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,

in love than ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was no need of theſe Words to move
<hi>Agnes</hi> to Compaſſion, the Languiſhment of the
Prince ſpoke enough: And the Heart of this
fair Maid, was but too much diſpos'd to yield
itſelf: She thought then that <hi>Conſtantia</hi> ought
to be ſatisfied; Love, which combated for
Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> triumphed over Friendſhip, and

                  <p>The Prince took loudly her part, and this
joyn'd to the Refuſal he made of marrying the

Truth in the King his Father. He was ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by thoſe that were too much intereſted,

into all the Rage and Fury ſo great a Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment

into the moſt violent Hatred, appeas'd the
firſt Tranſports of the King, by making him
comprehend, that if they could break the
Marriage of 'em, that would not be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Revenge, and ſo poyſoned the Soul of the
King, to conſent to the Death of <hi>Agnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Barbarous Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> offered his Arm
for this terrible Execution, and his Rage was
Security for the Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>The King, who thought the Glory of his
Family diſgraced, by this Alliance, and his
own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> particular in the Procedure of his Son,
gave full Power to this Murder, to make the
innocent <hi>Agnes,</hi> a Victim to his Rage.</p>
                  <p>It was not eaſie to execute this horrid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign:
Though the Prince ſaw <hi>Agnes</hi> but in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
yet all his Cares were ſtill awake for her,
and he was married to her above a Year, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> could find out an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſo long ſought for.</p>
                  <p>The Prince delivered himſelf but little, and
very rarely went far from <hi>Coimbra:</hi> but on a
Day, an Unfortunate Day, and mark'd out by
Heaven for an unheard of and horrid Aſſaſſin,
he made a Party to hunt at a fine Houſe, which
the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had near the City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes</hi> lov'd every thing that gave the Prince
ſatisfaction; but a ſecret Trouble made her
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47213:155"/>
apprehend ſome Misfortune in this unhappy
Journey: <hi>Sir,</hi> (ſaid ſhe, to him alarm'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing the Reaſon why I tremble) <hi>ſeeing
you to day, as it were deſign'd the last of my Life
Preſerve yourſelf, my Dear Prince, and though the
Exerciſe you take be not very dangerous, beware of
the least Hazards, and bring me back all that I trust
with you.</hi> Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> who had never found
her ſo Handſome and ſo Charming before,
embraced her ſeveral times, and went out of
the Palace with his Followers, with a deſign
not to return till the next Day.</p>
                  <p>He was no ſooner gone, but the Cruel Don
<hi>Alvaro</hi> prepared himſelf for the Execution he
had reſolv'd on; he thought it of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that it required more Hands than his
Own; and ſo choſe for his Companions <hi>Diego
Lopes Pacheo,</hi> and <hi>Pedro Cuello,</hi> two Monſters
like himſelf, whoſe Cruelty he was aſſur'd of
by the Preſents he had made 'em.</p>
                  <p>They waited the coming of the Night, and
the lovely <hi>Agnes</hi> was in her firſt ſleep, which
the laſt of her Life, when theſe Aſſaſſins ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
her Bed. Nothing made reſiſtance
to Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> who could do every thing, and
whom the blackeſt Furies introduced to <hi>Agnes,</hi>
ſhe wakened, and opening her Curtains, ſaw,
by the Candle burning in her Chamber, the
Poinard with which Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> was arm'd;
he having not his Face covered ſhe eaſily knew
him, and forgetting herſelf, to think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Prince: <hi>Just Heaven,</hi> (ſaid ſhe,
lifting up her fine Eyes) <hi>if you will revenge</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia,
<hi>ſatisfie yourſelf with my Blood only, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47213:155"/>
ſpare that of</hi> Don <hi>Pedro.</hi> The Barbarous Man
that heard her, gave her not time to ſay more;
and finding he could never (by all he could do
by Love) touch the Heart of the Fair <hi>Agnes,</hi>
he pierc'd it with his Poinard; his Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
gave her ſeveral Wounds, tho' there were
no Neceſſity of ſo many to put an End to an
Innocent Life.</p>
                  <p>What a ſad Spectacle was this for thoſe who
approach'd her Bed the next Day: And what
diſmal News was this to the Unfortunate
Prince of <hi>Portugal!</hi> He return'd to <hi>Coimbra,</hi> to
the firſt Report of this Adventure, and ſaw
what had certainly coſt him his Life, if Men
could die of Grief; after having a thouſand
times embraced the bloody Body of <hi>Agnes,</hi> and
ſaid all that a juſt Deſpair could inſpire him
with, he ran like a Mad-man into the Palace,
demanding the Murderers of his Wife, of
things that could not hear him: In fine, he
ſaw the King, and without obſerving any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
he gave a Looſe to his Reſentment: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having rail'd a long time, overwhelm'd
with Grief, he fell into a Swoon, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
all that Day. They carried him into
his Apartment; and the King, believing that
this Misfortune would prove his Cure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
not of what he had permitted,</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> and the two other Aſſaſſins,
quitted <hi>Coimbra.</hi> This Abſence of theirs,
made 'em appear guilty of the Crime, for
which the Afflicted Prince vowed a ſpeedy
Vengeance to the Ghoſt of his Lovely <hi>Agnes,</hi>
reſolving to purſue them to the uttermoſt part
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47213:156"/>
of the Univerſe: He got a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men together, ſufficient to have made
Reſiſtance, even on the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
if he ſhould yet take the Part of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers;
with theſe he ravag'd the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as far as the <hi>Duero</hi> Waters, and carried
on a War, even till the Death of the King,
continually mixing Tears with Blood, which
he gave to the Revenge of his Deareſt <hi>Agnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such was the deplorable End of the Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Love of Don <hi>Pedro</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and of
the Fair <hi>Agnes de Caſtro,</hi> whoſe Remembrance

                     <p>'TIS in the moſt Happy and August
Court of the Beſt and Greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of the World, that <hi>Damon,</hi> a
young Nobleman, whom we will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
under that Name, languiſhes for a Maid of
Quality, who will give us leave to call her <hi>Iris:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their Births are equally Illuſtrious; they are
both Rich, and both Young; their Beauty ſuch, as
I dae not too nicely particularize, leſt I ſhould
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47213:158"/>
diſcover (which I am not permitted to do) who theſe
charming Lovers are. Let it ſuffice, that <hi>Iris</hi> is
the moſt fair and accompliſht Perſon that ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
a Court; and that <hi>Damon</hi> is only worthy
of the Glory of her Favour; for he has all that can
render him lovely in the fair Eyes of the Amiable
<hi>Iris.</hi> Nor is he Maſter of thoſe Superficial Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
alone, that pleaſe at firſt Sight; he can charm
the Soul with a thouſand Arts of Wit and Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
And, in a word, I may ſay, without flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either, that there is no one Beauty, no one Grace,
no perfection of Mind and Body, that wants to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
a Victory on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>The Agreement of Age, Fortunes, Quality and
Humours in theſe two fair Lovers, made the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
<hi>Damon</hi> hope, that nothing would oppoſe his
Paſſion; and if he ſaw himſelf every Hour lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
for the Adorable Maid, he did not howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deſpair: And if <hi>Iris</hi> ſigh'd, it was not for fear
of being one day more happy.</p>
                     <p>In the midst of the Tranquility of theſe two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<hi>Iris</hi> was obliged to go into the Country for ſome
Months, whither 'twas impoſſible for <hi>Damon</hi> to
wait on her, he being oblig'd to attend the King his
Maſter; and being the moſt Amorous of his Sex,
ſuffer'd with extream Impatience th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Abſence of his
Miſtreſs. Nevertheleſs, he fail'd not to ſend to
her every day, and gave up all his melancholly
Hours to Thinking, Sighing, and Writing to her
the ſoftest Letters that Love could inſpire. So that
<hi>Iris</hi> even bleſſed that Abſence, that gave her ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and convincing Proofs of his Paſſion; and found
this dear way of Converſing, even recompenſed all
her Sighs for his Abſence.</p>

After a little Intercourſe of this kind, <hi>Damon</hi>
be thought himſelf to ask <hi>Iris</hi> a <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> which
he had won of her, before ſhe left the Town; and
in a <hi>Billet-doux</hi> to that purpoſe, prest her very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
for it. <hi>Iris</hi> being infinitely pleas'd with his
Importunity, ſuffer'd him to ask it often; and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fail'd of doing ſo.</p>
                     <p>But as I do not here deſign to relate the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

                     <p>IT muſt be confeſt, <hi>Damon,</hi> that you are
the moſt importuning Man in the World.
Your Billets have an hundred times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> which you won of me;
and tell me, you will not wait my Return, to
be paid. You are either a very faithleſs Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,
or believe me very unjuſt, that you dun
with ſuch Impatience. But, to let you ſee I
am a Maid of Honour, and value my Word, I
will acquit myſelf of this Obligation I have to
you, and ſend you a <hi>Watch</hi> of my faſhion; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you never ſaw any ſo good. It is not
one of thoſe, that have always ſomething to
be mended in it; but one that is without Fault,
very juſt and good, and will remain ſo, as long
as you continue to love me. But <hi>Damon,</hi> know,
that the very Minute you ceaſe to do ſo, the
String will break, and it will go no more. 'Tis
only uſeful in my Abſence, and when I return,
'twill change its Motion: And though I have
ſet it but for the Spring-time, 'twill ſerve you
the whole Year round; and 'twill be neceſſary
only, that you alter the buſineſs of the Hours
(which my <hi>Cupid,</hi> in the middle of my <hi>Watch,</hi>
points you out) according to the length of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:159"/>
Days and Nights. Nor is the Dart of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
God directed to thoſe Hours, ſo much to
inform you how they paſs, as how you ought
to paſs them, how you ought to employ thoſe
of your Abſence from <hi>Iris.</hi> 'Tis there you ſhall
find the whole Buſineſs of a Lover, from his
Miſtreſs; for I have deſign'd it a Rule to all
your Actions. The Conſideration of the
Workman, ought to make you ſet a Value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Work: And though it be not an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht,
and perfect Piece; yet <hi>Damon,</hi> you
ought to be grateful, and eſteem it, ſince I have
made it for you alone. But however I may
boaſt of the Deſign, I know, as well as I believe,
you love me; that you will not ſuffer me to
have the Glory of it wholly, but will ſay in

too agreeably, not to ſucceed in all he

<q>

                              <l>Who can reſist his ſoft Commands?</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>But I ought to explain to you my <hi>Watch:</hi>
The naked <hi>Love</hi> which you will find in the
middle of it, with his Wings clip'd, to ſhew
you he is fix'd and conſtant, and will not fly
away, points you out, with his Arrow, the
four and twenty Hours that compoſe the Day
and the Night: Over every Hour you will find
written what you ought to do, during its
Courſe; and every Half-hour is marked with
a Sigh, ſince the quality of a Lover is, to ſigh
day and night: Sighs are the Children of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
that are born every hour. And that my
<hi>Watch</hi> may always be juſt, <hi>Love</hi> himſelf ought
to conduct it; and your Heart ſhould keep
Time with the Movement:
<q>
                              <l>My Preſent's delicate, and new,</l>
                              <l>If by your Heart the Motion's ſet;</l>
                              <l>According as that's falſe, or true,</l>
                              <l>You'll find, my <hi>Watch</hi> will anſwer it.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Every hour is tedious to a Lover, ſeparated
from his Miſtreſs; and, to ſhew you how good
I am, I will have my <hi>Watch</hi> inſtruct you, to
paſs ſome of them without Inquietude; that
the force of your Imagination may ſometimes
charm the Trouble you have for my Abſence:

                              <l>My Heart may too much Credit give;</l>
                              <l>But <hi>Damon,</hi> you can charm my Fear,</l>
                              <l>And ſoon my Error undeceive.</l>

However you find 'em <hi>Damon,</hi> conſtrue 'em
all to my Advantage: Poſſibly, ſome of 'em
have an Air of Coldneſs, ſomething different
from that Softneſs they are uſually too amply
fill'd with; but where you find they have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there, that Sence of Honour, and my Sexes
Modeſty, guided my Hand a little, againſt the
Inclinations of my Heart; and that it was a
kind of an Atonement, I believed, I ought to
make, for ſomething I feared, I had ſaid too
kind, and too obliging before: But where-ever
you find that, ſtop that Check in my Career
of Love; you will be ſure to find ſomething
that follows it to favour you, and deny that
unwilling Impoſition upon my Heart; which,
leſt you ſhould miſtake, <hi>Love</hi> ſhews himſelf in
Smiles again, and flatters more agreeably, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
the Tyranny of Honour, and Rigid
Cuſtom, that Impoſition on our Sex; and will,
in ſpight of me, let you ſee, he Reigns abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
in my Soul.</p>
                        <p>The reading my <hi>Billet-doux</hi> may detain you
an Hour; I have had Goodneſs enough to write
you enough to entertain you ſo long, at leaſt,
and ſometimes reproach my ſelf for it; but,
contrary to all my Scruples, I find my ſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to give you thoſe frequent Marks of my
Tenderneſs. If yours be ſo great as you expreſs
it, you ought to kiſs my Letters a Thouſand
times, you ought to read them with Attention,
and weigh every Word, and value every Line.
A Lover may receive a Thouſand indearing

One ſays a great many kind Things of

to write, or to give teſtify'd under one's Hand,
Sign'd and Seal'd. But when once a Lover

                     <p>IF my <hi>Watch</hi> did not inform you, 'tis now time
to Write: I believe, <hi>Damon,</hi> your Heart
wou'd; and tell you alſo, that I ſhould take it
kindly, if you would employ a whole Hour that
way; and that you ſhould never loſe an Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of writing to me, ſince you are aſſured of
the Welcome I give your Letters. Perhaps you
will ſay, an Hour is too much, and that 'tis not
the Mode to write long Letters. I grant you,
<hi>Damon,</hi> when we write thoſe indifferent ones,
of Gallantry in courſe, or neceſſary Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the handſom comprizing of which, in
the feweſt words, renders 'em the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
But in Love we have a Thouſand fooliſh
things to ſay, that, of themſelves, bear no
great Sound, but have a mighty Sence in Love;
for there is a peculiar Eloquence, natural alone
to a Lover, and to be underſtood by no other
Creature: To thoſe, Words have a thouſand
Graces and Sweetneſſes; which, to the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
appears Meanneſs, and Eaſie Senſe,
at the beſt. But, <hi>Damon,</hi> you and I are none of
thoſe ill Judges of the Beauties of Love; we can
penetrate beyond the Vulgar, and perceive the
fine Soul in every Line, through all the humble
Dreſs of Phraſe; when poſſibly, they who
think they diſcern it beſt in florid Language,
do not ſee it at all. <hi>Love</hi> was not born, or bred
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47213:166"/>
in Courts, but Cottages; and nurs'd in Groves
and Shades, ſmiles on the Plains, and wantons
in the Streams; all unador'd, and harml<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>
Therefore, <hi>Damon,</hi> do not conſult your Wit in
this Affair, but Love alone; and ſpeak all that
he and Nature taught you, and let the fine
Things you learn in Schools alone: Make uſe
of thoſe Flowers you have gather'd there,
when you converſe with States-men and the
Gown. Let <hi>Iris</hi> poſſeſs your Heart in all its
ſimple Innocence, that's the beſt Eloquence to
her that loves; and this is my Inſtruction to a
Lover, that would ſucceed in his Amours; for
I have a Heart very difficult to pleaſe, and this
is the neareſt Way to it.</p>

a long Pleaſure: Do not trouble yourſelf to

Sence in a few Lines; that is the Notion of a

                        <p>This ſort of Creature, <hi>Damon,</hi> is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
not that I fear you will ſquander away
a Heart upon her, but your Hours; for, in
ſpight of you, ſhe'll detain you with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Impertinencies, and eternal Tattle. She
paſſes for a judging Wit; and there is nothing
ſo troubleſome, as ſuch a Pretender. She, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
may get ſome Knowledge of our Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence;
and then, no doubt, will improve
it, to my diſadvantage. Poſſibly ſhe may rail at
me; that is her Faſhion, by the way of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Speaking; and an Aukward Commendation,
the moſt effectual Way of Defaming, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing.
Perhaps ſhe tells you, in a cold Tone,
that you are a happy Man, to be belov'd by me:
That <hi>Iris,</hi> indeed, is handſome; and ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ſhe has no more Lovers; but the Men are
not of her Mind; if they were, you ſhould have
more Rivals. She commends my Face, but that
I have blue Eyes, and 'tis pity my Complexion
is no better: My Shape, but too much inclining
to Fat. Cries—She would charm infinitely
with her Wit, but that ſhe knows too well, ſhe
is Miſtreſs of it. And concludes,—But all
together, ſhe is well enough.—Thus ſhe runs
on, without giving you leave to edge in a Word,
in my Defence; and ever and anon, crying
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:171"/>
up her own Conduct, and Management: Tell
you, how ſhe is oppreſt with Lovers, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd
with Addreſſes; and recommending her
ſelf, at every turn, with a perceivable Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
And all the while, is Jilting you of your
good Opinion; which ſhe would buy, at the
Price of any Body's Repoſe, or her own Fame,
tho' but for the Vanity of adding to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of her Lovers. When ſhe ſees a new Spark,
the firſt thing ſhe does, ſhe enquires into his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate:
If ſhe find it ſuch, as may (if the Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb
be well manag'd) ſupply her Vanity, ſhe
makes Advances to him, and applies herſelf to
all thoſe little Arts ſhe uſually makes uſe of, to
gain her Fools; and, according to his Humour,
dreſſes and affects her own. But, <hi>Damon,</hi> ſince
I point to no particular Perſon, in this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
I will not name who you ſhould avoid; but
all of this ſort, I conjure you, whereſoever you
find 'em. But if unlucky Chance throw you
in their Way, hear all they ſay, without Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
or Regard, as far as Decency will ſuffer
you: Hear 'em, without approving their Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery:
and hear 'em, without giving 'em Cauſe
to cenſure you. But 'tis ſo much Time loſt, to
liſten to all the Novels, this ſort of People will
perplex you with; whoſe Buſineſs is to be idle;
and who even tire themſelves with their own
Impertinencies. And be aſſur'd, after all, there
is nothing they can tell you, that is worth your
knowing. And, <hi>Damon,</hi> a perfect Lover ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
asks any News, but of the Maid he loves.</p>

                     <p>LEave all thoſe fond Entertainments, or you
will diſoblige me, and make Dinner wait
for you; for my <hi>Cupid</hi> tells you, 'tis that Hour.
<hi>Love</hi> does not pretend to make you loſe that;
nor is it my Province to order you your Diet.
Here I give you a perfect Liberty, to do what
you pleaſe: And poſſibly, 'tis the only Hour in
the whole Four and twenty, that I will abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
reſign you, or diſpence with your even
ſo much as Thinking on me. 'Tis true, in
ſeating yourſelf at Table, I would not have
you placed over-againſt a very Beautiful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
for in ſuch a one there are a thouſand
little Graces, in Speaking, Looking, and
Laughing, that fail not to Charm if one gives
way to the Eyes, to gaze and wander that
way; in which, perhaps, in ſpight of you,
you will find a Pleaſure; And while you do ſo,
though without Deſign or Concern, you give
the fair Charmer a ſort of Vanity, in believing
you have placed yourſelf there, only for the
Advantage of Looking on her; and aſſumes a
hundred little Graces and Affectations, which
are not Natural to her, to compleat a Conqueſt,
which ſhe believes ſo well begun already. She
ſoftens her Eyes, and ſweetens her Mouth; and
in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, puts on another Air, than when ſhe had
no Deſign; and when you did not, by your
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47213:172"/>
continual looking on her, rouze her Vanity,
and increaſe her eaſie Opinion of her own
Charms. Perhaps ſhe knows, I have ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in your Heart; and Prides herſelf, at
leaſt, with believing, ſhe has attracted the Eyes
of my Lover, if not his Heart; and thinks it
eaſie to vanquiſh the Whole, if ſhe pleaſes; and
triumphs over me in her ſecret Imaginations.
Remember, <hi>Damon,</hi> that while you act thus in
the Company and Converſation of other Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that every Look, or Word you give in
favour of 'em, is an Indignity to my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and, which you cannot ſuffer, if you
love me truly, and with Honour: And, aſſure
yourſelf, ſo much Vanity as you inſpire in her,
ſo much Fame you rob me of; for whatever
Praiſes you give another Beauty, ſo much you
take away from mine. Therefore, if you Dine
in Company, do as others do: Be generally
Civil, not applying yourſelf, by Words, or
Looks to any particular Perſon: Be as gay as
you pleaſe: Talk and laugh with all, for this is
not the Hour for Chagrin.</p>

ſhould be obliged to renounce the Society of his

                        <l>And will be Abſolute in Souls.</l>
                        <p>I ſhould be very angry; if you had any of
thoſe Friendſhips, which one ought to deſire in
a Miſtreſs only; for many times it happens,
that you have Sentiments a little too tender for
thoſe Amiable Perſons; and many times Love
and Friendſhip are ſo confounded together, that
one cannot eaſily diſcern one from t'other. I
have ſeen a Man flatter himſelf with an Opinion,
that he had but an Eſteem for a Woman, when
by ſome Turn of Fortune in her Life, as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47213:174"/>
or Receiving the Addreſſes of Men, he
has found, by Spight and Jealouſies within, that
that was Love, which he before took for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance,
or Friendſhip. Therefore have a
Care; for ſuch Amities are dangerous. Not
but that a Lover may have Fair and Generous
Female-Friends, whom he ought to viſit; and
perhaps, I ſhou'd eſteem you leſs, if I did not
believe you were valued by ſuch, if I were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
aſſured they were Friends, and not Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
But have a Care, you hide not a Miſtreſs
under this Veil, or that you gain not a Lover
by this Pretence: For you may begin with
Friendſhip, and end with Love; and I ſhou'd
be equally afflicted, ſhou'd you give it, or receive
it. And though you charge our Sex with all
the Vanity; yet I often find Nature to have
given you as large a Portion of that Common
Crime, which you wou'd ſhuffle off, as aſham'd
to own; and are as fond and vain of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of a Conqueſt, as any Coquet of us all;
though, at the ſame time, you deſpiſe the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim,
you think it adds a Trophy to your Fame.
And I have ſeen a Man dreſs, and trick, and
adjuſt his Looks and Mien, to make a Viſit to a
Woman he lov'd, nor ever cou'd love, not as for
thoſe he made to his Miſtreſs; and only for the
Vanity of making a Conqueſt upon a Heart, even
unworthy of the little Pains he has taken about
it. And what is this but buying Vanity at the
Expence of Sence and Eaſe; and with Fatigue,
purchaſe the Name of a Conceited Fop, beſides
that of a Diſhoneſt Man? For he who takes
Pains to make himſelf Belov'd, only to pleaſe his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47213:174"/>
curious Humour, tho' he ſhould ſay nothing that
tends to it, more than by his Looks, his Sighs,
and now and then breaking into Praiſes and
Commendations of the Object, by the Care he
takes, to appear well dreſt before her, and in
good order; he lyes in his Looks, he deceives
with his Mien and Faſhion, and cheats with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Motion, and every Grace he puts on: He
cozens when he Sings, or Dances; he diſſembles
when he Sighs; and every thing he does, that
wilfully gains upon her, is Malice propenſe,
Baſeneſs, and Art below a Man of Sence, or
Vertue: And yet theſe Arts, theſe Coz'nages,
are the common Practices of the Town. What's
this but that damnable Vice, of which they ſo
reproach our Sex; that of Jilting for Hearts?
And 'tis in vain, that my Lover, after ſuch foul
Play, ſhall think to appeaſe me, with ſaying, <hi>He
did it to try how eaſie he cou'd Conquer, and of how
great Force his Charms were: And why ſhou'd I be
angry, if all the Town lov'd him, ſince he lov'd none
but</hi> Iris? Oh fooliſh Pleaſure! How little Sence
goes to the making of ſuch a Happineſs? And
how little Love muſt he have for one particular
Perſon, who wou'd wiſh to inſpire it into all the
World, and yet himſelf pretend to be inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
But this (<hi>Damon</hi>) is rather what is but
too much practiſed by your Sex, than any Guilt
I charge on you; tho' Vanity be an Ingredient
that Nature very ſeldom omits in the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of either Sex; and you may be allow'd a
Tincture of it at leaſt. And, perhaps, I am not
wholly exempt from this Leaven in my Nature,
but accuſe myſelf ſometimes of finding a ſecret
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47213:175"/>
Joy of being ador'd, tho' I even hate my Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper.
But if any ſuch Pleaſure touch my
Heart, I find it at the ſame time bluſhing in my
Cheeks with a guilty Shame; which ſoon checks
the petty Triumph, and I have a Vertue at ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berer
Thoughts, that I find ſurmounts my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Indiſcretion; and I hope <hi>Damon</hi> finds
the ſame: For, ſhould he have any of thoſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments,
I ſhould have no Pity for him.</p>

Converſation with 'em; but thoſe Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ought to be General, and of General
Things; for there is no neceſſity of making
your Friend the Confident of your Amours:
'Twould infinitely diſpleaſe me, to hear you
have reveal'd to them, all that I have repos'd in
you; tho' Secrets never ſo trivial, yet, ſince
utter'd between Lovers, they deſerve to be
priz'd at a higher rate: For what can ſhew a
Heart more indifferent and indiſcreet, than to
declare in any Faſhion, or with Mirth, or Joy,
the tender Things a Miſtreſs ſays to a Lover;
and which poſſibly, related at Second Hand,
bear not the ſame Sence, becauſe they have
not the ſame Sound, and Air, they had origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
when they came from the ſoft Heart of
her, who ſigh'd 'em firſt to her laviſh Lover.
Perhaps they are told again with Mirth, or Joy,
unbecoming their Character and Buſineſs; and
then they loſe their Graces; (for Love is
the moſt Solemn Thing in Nature, and the moſt
unſuiting with Gaiety.) Perhaps the ſoft Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
ſuit not ſo well the harſher Voice of
the Maſculine Lover, whoſe Accents were not

                           <l>That will not bear the Sound away:</l>

                        <p>There is nothing more true, than thoſe two
laſt Lines; and that Love ceaſes to be a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
when it ceaſes to be a Secret, and one you
ought to keep ſacred: For the World, who
never makes a right Judgment of Things, will
miſinterpret Love, as they do Religion; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one judging it, according to the Notion he
had of it, or the Talent of his Sence. <hi>Love,</hi> as
a great Duke ſaid, <hi>is like Apparitions; every one
talks of 'em, but few have ſeen 'em:</hi> Every Body
thinks himſelf capable of underſtanding Love,
and that he is a Maſter in the Art of it; when
there is nothing ſo nice, or difficult, to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comprehended; and indeed, cannot be, but
to a Soul very delicate. Nor will he make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
known to the Vulgar: There muſt be an
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47213:177"/>
uncommon Fineneſs in the Mind, that contains
him; the reſt, he only viſits in as many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes,
as there are Diſpoſitions and Natures;
where he makes but a ſhort ſtay, and is gone.
He can fit himſelf to all Hearts, being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Flatterer in the World: And he poſſeſſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one with a Confidence, that they are in the
Number of his Elect; and they think, they know
him perfectly, when nothing but the Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd,
poſſeſs him in his Excellency. From this
difference of Love, in different Souls, proceeds
thoſe odd fantaſtick Maxims, which ſo many
hold of ſo different Kinds: And this makes the
moſt innocent Pleaſures paſs oftentimes for
Crimes, with the unjudging Crowd, who call
themſelves Lovers: And you will have your
Paſſion cenſur'd, by as many as you ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it to, and as many ſeveral Ways. I adviſe
you therefore (<hi>Damon</hi>) to make no Confidents
of your Amours; and believe, that Silence has,
with me, the moſt powerful Charm.</p>
                        <p>'Tis alſo in theſe Converſations, that thoſe
indiſcreetly civil Perſons often are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who think
to oblige a good Man, by letting him know he
is belov'd by ſome one or other; and making
him underſtand how many good Qualities he is
Maſter of, to render him agreeable to the Fair

we deſire to hear often told, and which never the

to <hi>Damon;</hi> 'tis all ſincere and honeſt as his

credit every thing you ſay; though I believe,
you ſay abundance of Truths, in a great Part of
my Character. But when you advance to that,
which my own Senſe, my Judgment, or my

give me leave either to believe you think me
vain enough to credit you, or pleas'd that your

himſelf belov'd, than that he flatter'd;
tho' ſhe wou'd ſeem to make that a great part
of the Qsuarrel, and Cauſe of her Reſentment:
For we are often in an Humour to ſeem more
modeſt in that Point, than naturally we are;
being too apt to have a favourable Opinion of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47213:180"/>
ourſelves: And 'tis rather, the Effects of a Fear
that we are flatter'd, than our own ill Opinion
of the Beauty flatter'd; and that the Praiſer
does not think ſo well of it, as we do our ſelves,
or as at leaſt he wiſh ſhe ſhou'd. Not but there
are Grains of Allowance for the Temper of him
that ſpeaks: One Man's Humour is to talk much;
and he may be permitted to enlarge upon the
Praiſe he gives the Perſon he pretends to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being accus'd of much Guilt. Another
hates to be Wordy; from ſuch an one, I have
known one ſoft Expreſſion, one tender Thing,
go as far as whole Days everlaſting Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
urg'd with Vows, and mighty Eloquence:
And both the one, and the other, indeed, muſt
be allow'd in good Manners, to ſtretch the
Complement beyond the Bounds of nice Truth:
and we muſt not wonder to hear a Man call a
Woman a Beauty, when ſhe is not Ugly; or
another, a Great Wit, if ſhe have but common
Sence above the Vulgar; well Bred, when well
Dreſt; and good Natur'd when Civil. And
as I ſhou'd be very ridiculous, if I took all you
ſaid for abſolute Truth; ſo I ſhould be very
unjuſt, not to allow you very ſincere, in almoſt
all you ſaid beſides; and thoſe Things, the
moſt material to Love, Honour, and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
And for the reſt (<hi>Damon</hi>) be it true, or
falſe, this believe: You ſpeak with ſuch a Grace,
that I cannot chuſe but Credit you; and find an
infinite Pleaſure in that Faith, becauſe I lovu
you: And if I cannot find the Cheat, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
you ſhou'd deceive me on, becauſe yoe

call your Page into your Cabinet, or him whom
you truſted with your laſt Letter to me; where
you ought to enquire of him a thouſand things;
and all of me. Ask impatiently; and be angry,
if he anſwers not your Curioſity ſoon enough:
Think that he has a Dreaming in his Voice, in
theſe Moments, more than at other times; and
reproach him with Dulneſs. For 'tis moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that when one loves tenderly, we wou'd
know in a Minute, what cannot be related in an
Hour. Ask him, How I did? How I receiv'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47213:184"/>
his Letter? And if he examin'd the Air of my
Face, when I took it? If I bluſh'd, or look'd
pale? If my Hand trembled, or I ſpoke to him
with ſhort interrupting Sighs? If I ask'd him
any Queſtions about you, while I was opening
the Seal? Or if I cou'd not well ſpeak, and was
ſilent? If I read it attentively, and with Joy?
And all this, before you open the Anſwer I have
ſent you by him: Which, becauſe you are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to read, you, with the more Haſte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Earneſtneſs, demand all you expect from him;
and that you may the better know, what Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
I was in, when I writ that to you. For,
Oh! A Lover has a thouſand little Fears, and
Dreads, he knows not why. In fine, make him
recount to you all that paſt, while he was with
me: And then you ought to read that which I
have ſent, that you may inform your ſelf of all
that paſſes in my Heart; for you may aſſure
your ſelf, all that I ſay to you that way, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds

one loves, and though you ſpeak of her every
Minute; though you are writing to her every
Day, and though you are infinitely pleas'd with
the dear and tender Anſwers; yet, to ſpeak ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
it muſt be confeſs'd, that the Felicity of
a true Lover, is to be always near his Miſtreſs.
And you may tell me, O <hi>Damon!</hi> what you
pleaſe; and ſay, that Abſence inſpires the Flame,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47213:185"/>
which perpetual Preſence would fatiate; I love
too well to be of that Mind; and when I am, I
ſhall believe my Paſſion is declining. I know
not whether it advances your Love; but ſurely,
it muſt ruine your Repoſe: And is it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be, at once, an abſent Lover, and happy
too? For my part, I can meet with nothing
that can pleaſe, in the abſence of <hi>Damon;</hi> but,
on the contrary, I ſee all things with Diſguſt.
I will flatter my ſelf, that 'tis ſo with you; and
that the leaſt Evils appear great Misfortunes;
and that all thoſe who ſpeak to you of any thing
but of what you love, increaſe your Pain, by
a new remembrance of her Abſence. I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that theſe are your Sentiments, you are
aſſur'd not to ſee me in ſome Weeks; and, if
your Heart do not betray your Words, all thoſe
Days will be tedious to you. I would not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
have your Melancholy too extream; and
to leſſen it, you may perſwade yourſelf, that I
partake it with you; for, I remember, in your
laſt you told me, you would wiſh we ſhould be
both griev'd at the ſame time, and both at the
ſame time pleas'd; and, I believe, I love too
well, not to obey you.</p>

Think it a Bleſſing, to be permitted to love me:
Think it ſo, becauſe I permit it to you alone;
and never could be drawn to allow it any other.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47213:186"/>
The firſt thing you ought to conſider is, that at
length I have ſuffer'd my ſelf to be overcome, to
quit that Nicety that is natural to me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your Addreſſes; nay, thought 'em agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and that I have at laſt confeſt, the Preſent
of your Heart is very dear to me. 'Tis true, I
did not accept of it the firſt time it was offer'd
me, nor before you had told me a thouſand
times, that you could not eſcape expiring, if I
did not give you leave to ſigh for me, and gaze
upon me; and that there was an abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
for me, either to give you leave to love, or
die. And all thoſe Rigors my Severity has made
you ſuffer, ought now to be recounted to your
Memory, as Subjects of Pleaſure; and you ought
to eſteem and judge of the Price of my Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by the Difficulties you found in being able
to touch my Heart: Not but you have Charms
that can conquer at firſt ſight; and you ought
not to have valued me leſs, if I had been more
eaſily gain'd: But 'tis enough to pleaſe you, to
think and know I am gain'd; no matter when
or how. When, after a thouſand Cares and
Inquietudes, that which we wiſh for ſucceeds
to our Deſires, the Remembrance of thoſe Pains
and Pleaſures we encounter'd, in arriving at it,
gives us a new Joy.</p>
                     <p>Remember alſo (<hi>Damon</hi>) that I have prefer'd
you before all thoſe that have been thought
worthy of my Eſteem; and that I have ſhut
my Eyes to all their pleading Merits, and cou'd
ſurvey none but yours.</p>
                     <p>Conſider then, that you had not only the
Happineſs to pleaſe me, but that you only
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47213:187"/>
found out the way of doing it, and I had the
Goodneſs at laſt to tell you ſo, contrary to all
the Delicacy and Niceneſs of my Soul; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to my Prudence, and all thoſe Scruples, you
know, are natural to my Humour.</p>
                     <p>My Tenderneſs proceeded further, and I
gave you innocent Marks of my new-born Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
on all Occaſions that preſented themſelves:
For, after that, from my Eyes and Tongue you
knew the Sentiments of my Heart, I confirm'd
that Truth to you by my Letters. Confeſs,
(<hi>Damon</hi>) that if you make theſe Reflections,
you will not paſs this Hour very diſagreeably.</p>

though one is not the leſs eſteemable, for having
more of this than one ought; and though an

Have therefore ſome for thoſe with whom you

dance or ſing with 'em; yet think of me. You

and arbitrary, that my <hi>Watch</hi> ſhould pretend
to rule even your Sleeping Hours, and that my
<hi>Cupid</hi> ſhould govern your very Dreams; which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47213:193"/>
are but Thoughts diſorder'd, in which Reaſon
has no part; Chimera's of the Imagination, and
no more: But tho' my Watch does not pretend
to Counſel unreaſonable, yet you muſt allow it
here; if not to paſs the Bounds, at leaſt, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to the utmoſt limits of it. I am aſſur'd,
that after having thought ſo much of me in the
Day, you will think of me alſo in the Night. And
the firſt Dream my <hi>Watch</hi> permits you to make,
is to think you are in Converſation with me.</p>
                     <p>Imagine (<hi>Damon</hi>) that you are talking to
me of your Paſſion, with all the Tranſport of a
Lover, and that I hear you with Satisfaction:
That all my Looks and Bluſhes, while you are
ſpeaking, gives you new Hopes and Aſſurances,
that you are not indifferent to me, and that I
give you a thouſand Teſtimonies of my Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
all Innocent and Obliging.</p>
                     <p>While you are ſaying all that Love can dictate,
all that Wit and good Manners can invent, and
all that I wiſh to hear from <hi>Damon,</hi> believe in
this Dream, all flattering and dear; that after
having ſhew'd me the Ardour of your Flame,
that I confeſs to you the Bottom of my Heart,
and all the loving Secrets there; that I give you
Sigh for Sigh, Tenderneſs for Tenderneſs,
Heart for Heart, and Pleaſure for Pleaſure.
And I would have your Senſe of this Dream ſo
perfect, and your Joy ſo entire, that if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
you ſhould awake with the Satisfaction from
this Dream, you ſhould find your Heart ſtill pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the ſoft Pleaſure of the dear deceiving
Tranſport, and you ſhould be ready to cry
out,—

                        <p>Some ſuch Complaint as this, I know you will
make; but (<hi>Damon</hi>) if the little Quarrels of
Lovers render the reconciling Moments ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
Charming, you muſt needs allow, that
theſe little Chagrins in capricious Dreams muſt
awaken you to more Joy to find 'em but Dreams,
than if you had met with no Diſorder there.
'Tis for this Reaſon that I wou'd have you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a little Pain, for a coming Pleaſure; nor,
indeed, is it poſſible for you to eſcape the
Dreams my <hi>Cupid</hi> points you out. You ſhall
dream that I have a thouſand <hi>Foibleſſes,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the lightneſs of my Sex; that my Soul
is employ'd in a thouſand Vanities; that (proud
and fond of Lovers) I make Advances for the
Glory of a Slave, without any other Intereſt, or
Deſign, than that of being ador'd. I will give
you leave to think my Heart fickle, and that,
far from reſigning it to any one, I lend it only
for a Day, or an Hour, and take it back at
pleaſure, that I am a very <hi>Coquet,</hi> even to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence.</p>
                        <p>All this I give you leave to think, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
me; but 'tis in Sleep only that I permit it;
for I would never pardon you the leaſt Offence
of this nature, if in any other kind than in a
Dream. Nor is it enough Affliction to you, to
imagine me thus idly vain; but you are to paſs
on to an hundred more capricious Humours; as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47213:195"/>
that I exact of you a hundred unjuſt Things;
that I pretend you ſhould break off with all your
Friends, and for the future, have none at all;
that I will, myſelf, do thoſe Things, which I
violently condemn in you; and that I will have
for others, as well as you, that tender Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
that reſembles Love, or rather that Love
which People call Friendſhip; and that I will
not, after all, have you dare complain on me.</p>

the Proof of all theſe Faults in me? But know,

every-where, and is eternally at your Heels if
you approach me; that I careſs him with Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in my Eyes, and that Vanity in my Heart,
that poſſeſſes the Humors of almoſt all the Fair;
that is, to believe it greatly for my Glory to
have abundance of Rivals for my Lovers. I
know you love too well, not to be extreamly
uneaſie in the Company of a Rival, and to have
one perpetually near me; for let him be belov'd
or not by the Miſtreſs, it muſt be confeſs'd, a

Tenderneſs of the Heart, in the height of
their Quarrels, Love ſees all their Sufferings,
pities and redreſſes 'em: And when we begin
to cool, and a ſoft Repentance follows the
Chagrin of the Love-Quarrel, 'tis then that
Love takes the advantage of both Hearts, and
renews the charming Friendſhip more forcibly
than ever, puts a ſtop to all our Feuds, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Peace-making Minutes the moſt dear
and tender part of our Life. How pleaſing 'tis
to ſee your Rage diſſolve! How ſweet, how ſoft
is every Word that pleads for Pardon at my
Feet! 'Tis there that, you tell me, your very
Sufferings are over-paid, when I but aſſure you
from my Eyes, that I will forget your Crime:
And your Imagination ſhall here preſent me the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47213:198"/>
moſt ſenſible of your paſt Pain, that you can
wiſh; and that, all my Anger being vaniſh'd, I
give you a thouſand Marks of my Faith and
Gratitude; and laſtly, to crown all, that we
again make new Vows to one another of invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
Peace.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>After theſe Debates of Love,</l>
                        <l>Lovers thouſand Pleaſures prove,</l>
                        <l>Which they ever think to taſte,</l>
                        <l>Tho' oftentimes they do not last.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Enjoy then all the Pleaſures that a Heart that
is very amorous, and very tender, can enjoy.
Think no more on thoſe Inquietudes that you
have ſuffer'd, bleſs <hi>Love</hi> for his Favours, and
thank me for my Graces; and reſolve to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any thing, rather than enter upon any new
Quarrels. And however dear the reconciling
Moments are, there proceeds a great deal of
Evil from theſe little frequent Quarrels; and I
think, the beſt Counſel we can follow, is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
'em as near as we can: And if we cannot,
but that, in ſpight of Love and good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
they ſhould break out, we ought to
make as ſpeedy a Peace as poſſible, for 'tis not
good to grate the Heart too long, leſt it grow
harden'd inſenſibly, and loſe its native Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
A few Quarrels there muſt be in Love;
Love cannot ſupport itſelf without 'em; and,
beſides the Joy of an Accommodation, Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
by it more ſtrongly united, and more
charming. Therefore let the Lover receive this
as a certain Receipt againſt declining Love:</p>

Who will leave this wondrous Piece of

for its Situation, its Proſpects, and its
marvellous Contrivances, one of the fineſt <hi>Villa</hi>'s

and would ſufficiently declare the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifick
Soul of the Hero that caus'd it to be
built, and contriv'd all its Fineneſs. And this
makes up not the leaſt part of the beautiful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
from the Palace-Royal, while on the other
ſide lies ſpread a fruitful and delightful Park and
Foreſt, well ſtor'd with Deer, and all that make
the Proſpect charming; fine Walks, Groves,
diſtant Valleys, Downs and Hills, and all that
Nature could invent, to furniſh out a quiet ſoft
Retreat for the moſt Fair and moſt Charming
of Queens, and the moſt Heroick, Good, and
Juſt of Kings: And theſe Groves alone are fit
and worthy to divert ſuch Earthly Gods.</p>
                     <p>Nor can Heaven, Nature, or Humane Art
contrive an Addition to this Earthly Paradiſe,
unleſs thoſe great Inventors of the Age, Sir <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47213:200"/>
Fountains, both uſeful and beautiful.
Theſe are only wanting, to render the Place all
Perfection, without Exception.</p>
                     <p>This, <hi>Damon,</hi> is a long Digreſſion from the
Buſineſs of my Heart; but, you know, I am ſo
in Love with that charming Court, that when
you gave me an Occaſion, by your being there
now, but to name the Place, I could not forbear
tranſgreſſing a little, in favour of its wondrous
Beauty; and the rather, becauſe I wou'd, in
recounting it, give you to underſtand how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fine Objects there are, beſides the Ladies that
adorn it, to employ your vacant Moments in;
and hope you will, without my Inſtructions,
paſs a great part of your idle Time in ſurveying
theſe Proſpects, and give that Admiration you
ſhou'd pay to living Beauty, to thoſe more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Monuments of everlaſting Fame.</p>
                     <p>Neither need I (<hi>Damon</hi>) aſſign you your wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Times; your Honour, Duty, Love, and
Obedience will inſtruct you when to be near
the Perſon of the King; and, I believe, you will
omit no part of that Devoir. You ought to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
your Fortune aud your Glory: For I
am not of the Mind of thoſe Critical Lovers,
who believe it a very hard Matter to reconcile
Love and Intereſt, to adore a Miſtreſs, and ſerve
a Maſter at the ſame time. And I have heard
thoſe, who, on this Subject, ſay, <hi>Let a Man be
never ſo careful in theſe double Duties, 'tis Ten to
One but he loſes his Fortune or his Miſtreſs.</hi> Theſe
are Errors that I condemn: And I know, that
Love and Ambition are not incompatible, but
that a brave Man may preſerve all his Duties to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47213:201"/>
his Soveraign, and his Paſſion and his Reſpect
for his Miſtreſs. And this is my Notion of it.</p>

my <hi>Watch:</hi> The more you regard it, the better
you will like it; and, whatever you think of it

chuſe Words to thank you in; (Words,

all I can ſay will but too dully expreſs my
Senſe of Gratitude, my Joy, and the Pleaſure

for my Expectation; and though my Love and
Faith deſerve it, yet my humbler Hope never

Sighs, though I am oblig'd to 'em there but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Half-hour.—</p>
                     <p>You tell me, fair <hi>Iris,</hi> that I ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it tenderly, and yet you have ſent it me
without a Caſe. But that I may obey you juſtly,
and keep it dear to me, as long as I live, I will
give it a Caſe of my Faſhion: It ſhall be delicate,
and ſuitable to the fine Preſent; of ſuch Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials

Does not your <hi>Watch, Iris,</hi> rule the Heart?
It was your Heart that contriv'd it, and 'twas
your Heart you conſulted in all the management
of it; and 'twas your Heart that brought it to
ſo fine a Concluſion. The Heart never acts
without Reaſon, and all the Heart projects, it
performs with Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Watch,</hi> my lovely Maid, has explain'd
to me a World of rich Secrets of Love: And
where ſhou'd Thoughts ſo ſacred be ſtor'd, but
in the Heart, where all the Secrets of the Soul
are treaſur'd up, and of which only <hi>Love</hi> alone
can take a View? 'Tis thence he takes his Sighs
and Tears, and all his little Flatteries and Arts
to pleaſe. All his fine Thoughts, and all his
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47213:203"/>
mighty Raptures, nothing is ſo proper as the
Heart to preſerve it; nothing ſo worthy, as the
Heart to contain it; and it concerns my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
too much, not to be infinitely careful of ſo
dear a Treaſure: And, believe me, charming
<hi>Iris,</hi> I will never part with it.</p>

any Vows or Wiſhes, ever to retrieve yours;

It will not, my fair <hi>Iris,</hi> ſuffice, that my Love

A Lover that is not ſecret, but ſuffers every

Paſſion, ſuch as produces ſudden and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory

true Love has not this Character; for whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
'tis made Publick, it ceaſes to be a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and is only the Reſult of Vanity. Not
that I expect our Loves ſhou'd always remain a

to a Bleſſing, which, above all the Glories
of the Earth, I aſpire to; but even then, there

conceal the leaſt part of their Love; but Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
has an Ardour, as well as Roſes; and a
Lover ought to eſteem that as the deareſt and
tendereſt Thing; not only that of his own,
which is, indeed, the leaſt part; but that of his
Miſtreſs, more valuable to him than Life. He
ought to endeavour to give People no occaſion
to make falſe Judgments of his Actions or to
give their Cenſures; which, moſt certainly are
never in the Favour of the fair Perſon; for
likely, thoſe falſe Cenſures are of the buſie Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Sex, the Coquets of that number; whoſe
little Spights and Railleries, joyn'd to that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd
Wit they boaſt of, ſets 'em at Odds with
all the Beautiful and Innocent: And how very
little of that kind ſerves to give the World a
Faith, when a thouſand Vertues, told of the
ſame Perſons, by more credible Witneſſes and
Judges, ſhall paſs unregarded; ſo willing and
inclin'd is all the World to credit the Ill, and

this fooliſh ſcandalous World! And tho' we
know each others Vertue and Honour, we are
oblig'd to obſerve that Caution (to humour the
Talking Town) which takes away ſo great a
part of the Pleaſure of Life! 'Tis therefore that

by which you may imagine, that in Love, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution
is neceſſary to its Secrecy: And we muſt
reſtrain our ſelves, upon a thouſand Occaſions,

                        <l>Allow me Faith as well as Love;</l>
                        <l>Since that alone affords no Bliſs,</l>

                        <l>Either reſolve to let me die</l>
                        <l>By fairer Play, your Cruelty;</l>

                           <pb n="106" facs="tcp:47213:210"/>
Than not your Love, with Faith impart,</l>
                        <l>And with your Vows, to give your Heart.</l>
                        <l>In mad Deſpair I'd rather fall,</l>
                        <l>Than loſe my glorious Hopes of conqu'ring all.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>So certain it is, that Love without Faith, is
of no value.</p>
                     <p>In fine, my adorable <hi>Iris,</hi> this Caſe ſhall be,
as near as I can, like thoſe delicate ones of <hi>Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligrin</hi>
Work, which do not hinder the Sight
from taking a View of all within: You may
therefore ſee, through this Heart, all your
Watch. Nor is my Deſire of preſerving this
ineſtimable Piece more, than to make it the
whole Rule of my Life and Actions. And my
chiefeſt Deſign in theſe Cyphers, is to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
in them, the principal Vertues that are
moſt neceſſary to Love. Do not we know,
that Reciprocal Love is Juſtice; Conſtant Love,
Fortitude; Secret Love, Prudence? Though
'tis true, that Extream Love, that is, Exceſs
of Love, in one Senſe, appears not to be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance;
yet you muſt know, my <hi>Iris,</hi> that in
Matters of Love, Exceſs is a Vertue, and that
all other Degrees of Love are worthy Scorn
alone. 'Tis this alone, that can make good
the glorious Title: 'Tis this alone, that can
bear the true Name of Love; and this alone,
that can bear the true Name of Love; and
this alone, that renders the Lovers truly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
in ſpight of all the Storms of Fate, and
Shocks of Fortune. This is an Antidote againſt
all other Griefs: This bears up the Soul in all
Calamity; and is the very Heaven of Life, the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47213:210"/>
laſt Refuge of all Worldly Pain and Care, and
may well bear the Title of Divine.</p>

                  <p>HOW long, O charming <hi>Iris!</hi> ſhall
I ſpeak in vain of your adorable
Beauty? You have been juſt, and
believe I love you with a Paſſion
perfectly tender and extream; and yet you
will not allow your Charms to be infinite.
You muſt either accuſe my Flames to be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
and that my Eyes and Heart are falſe
Judges of Wit and Beauty; or allow, that
you are the moſt perfect of your Sex. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of that, you always accuſe of me Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
when I ſpeak of your infinite Merit; and
when I refer you to your Glaſs, you tell me,
that flatters, as well as <hi>Damon;</hi> though one
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47213:214"/>
wou'd imagine, that ſhou'd be a good Witneſs
for the Truth of what I ſay, and undeceive you
of the Opinion of my Injuſtice. Look—and
confirm yourſelf, that nothing can equal your
Perfections. All the World ſays it, and you
muſt doubt it no longer. <hi>O Iris!</hi> Will you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
againſt the whole World?</p>
                  <p>But ſince you have ſo long diſtruſted your
own Glaſs, I have here preſented you with one,
which I know is very true; and having been
made for you only, can ſerve only you. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Glaſſes preſent all Objects, but this reflects
only <hi>Iris;</hi> whenever you conſult it, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you; and tell you, how much Right I
have done you, when I told you, you were the
faireſt Perſon that ever Nature made. When
other Beauties look into it, it will ſpeak to all
the fair Ones; but let 'em do what they will,
'twill ſay nothing to their Advantage.</p>

a Woman of your Acquaintance, who, having
a greater Opinion of her own Perſon, than any
Body elſe, has ſcrew'd her Body into ſo fine a
Form (as ſhe calls it) that ſhe dares no more
ſtir a Hand, lift up an Arm, or turn her Head
aſide, than if, for the Sin of ſuch a Diſorder,
ſhe were to be turn'd into a Pillar of Salt; the
leſs ſtiff and fix'd Statue of the two. Nay, ſhe
dares not ſpeak or ſmile, leſt ſhe ſhou'd put her
Face out of that order ſhe had ſet it in her
Glaſs, when ſhe laſt look'd on herſelf: And is
all over ſuch a Lady Nice (excepting in her
Converſation) that ever made a ridiculous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
And there are many Ladies more, but
too much tainted with that nauſeous Formality,
that old-faſhion'd Vice: But <hi>Iris,</hi> the charming,
the all-perfect <hi>Iris,</hi> has nothing in her whole
Form, that is not free, natural, and eaſie; and

                        <p>I Shall not be put to much trouble to ſhew you
your Hands and Arms, becauſe you may view
them without my help; and you are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
if you have not admir'd 'em a Thouſand
times. The beautiful Colour and Proportion
of your Arm is unimitable, and your Hand is
dazling, fine, ſmall, and plump; long-pointed
Fingers, delicately turn'd; dimpl'd on the
Snowy out-ſide, but adorn'd within with Roſe,
all over the ſoft Palm. O <hi>Iris!</hi> Nothing equals
your fair Hand; that Hand, of which Love ſo
often makes ſuch uſe to draw his Bow, when he
wou'd ſend the Arrow home with more ſucceſs;
and which irreſiſtibly wounds thoſe, who poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
have not yet ſeen your Eyes: And when
you have been veil'd, that lovely Hand has gain'd
you a thouſand Adorers. And I have heard <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſay, <hi>Without the Aid of more Beauties, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
had been ſufficient to have made an abſolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
o'er his Soul.</hi> And he has often vow'd, <hi>It
never touch'd him, but it made his Blood run with
little irregular Motions in his Veins; his Breath
beat ſhort and double; his Bluſhes riſe, and his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Soul dance.</hi>

That generous Air, that adorns all your lovely

See how you move;—for only here

But here behold, and be convinc'd; and know,
no part of your Beauty can charm more than
this. O <hi>Iris,</hi> confeſs, Love has adorn'd you

                        <p>BUT O <hi>Iris!</hi> The Beauties of the Body
are imperfect, if the Beauties of the Soul
do not advance themſelves to an equal height.
But, O <hi>Iris!</hi> What Mortal is there ſo damned
to Malice, that does not, with Adoration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that you (O charming Maid!) have an
equal Portion of all the Braveries and Vertues
of the Mind? And, who is it, that confeſſes
your Beauty, that does not, at the ſame time
acknowledge and bow to your Wiſdom? The
whole World admires both in you; and all,
with impatience, ask, Which of the two is
moſt ſurpriſing, your Beauty, or your Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
But we diſpute in vain on that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Subject; for after all, 'tis determin'd, that
the two Charms are equal. 'Tis none of thoſe
idle Diſcretions that conſiſts in Words alone,
and ever takes the Shadow of Reaſon for the
Subſtance; and that makes uſe of all the little
Artifices of Subtilty, and florid Talking, to
make the outſide of the Argument appear fine,
and leave the inſide wholly miſ-underſtood:
Who runs away with Words, and never thinks
of Sence. But you, O lovely Maid! never
make uſe of theſe affected Arts; but without
being too brisk, or too ſevere; too ſilent, or
too talkative; you aſpire in all your Hearers,
a Joy, and a Reſpect. Your Soul is an Enemy
to that uſual Vice of your Sex, of uſing little
Arguments againſt the Fair; or by a Word,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47213:222"/>
or Jeſt, make your ſelf and Hearers pleaſant,
at the Expence of the Fame of others.</p>
                        <p>Your Heart is an Enemy to all Paſſions, but
that of Love. And this is one of your noble
Maxims: <hi>That every one ought to love, in ſome
part of his Life: And that, in a Heart truly brave,
Love is without Folly: That Wiſdom is a Friend to
Love, and Love to perfect Wiſdom.</hi> Since theſe

that your Empire is eternally eſtabliſh'd, by

ſweet Marks of it; and only your Lovers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain:
Yet even then you charm. And though
ſometimes you can be a little diſturb'd, yet
through your Anger, your Goodneſs ſhines;
and you are but too much afraid, that that may
bear a falſe Interpretation: For oftentimes
Scandal makes that paſs for an Effect of Love,
which is purely that of Complaiſance.</p>

reigns in your Heart, and Sincerity on your
Tongue. Your Friendſhip is ſo ſtrong, ſo
conſtant, and ſo tender, that it charms,
pleaſes, and ſatisfies all, that are not your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers.
'Tis therefore, <hi>Damon</hi> is excuſable,

Lucky Miſtake.
A NEW
NOVEL.</head>
                  <p>THe River <hi>Loyre</hi> has on its delightful Banks
abundance of handſome, beautiful and rich
Towns and Villages, to which the noble
Stream adds no ſmall Graces and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
bleſſing their Fields with Plenty, and their
Eyes with a thouſand Diverſions: In one of theſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
ſituated Towns, called <hi>Orleance,</hi> where abundance
of People of the beſt Quality and Condition reſide,
there was a rich Nobleman, now retird from the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
Court, where, in his Youth he had been bred, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with the Toyls of Ceremony and Noiſe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
that perfect Tranquility of Life, which is no where
to be found, but in Retreat, a faithful Friend, and a
good Library; and, as the Admirable <hi>Horace</hi> ſays, in
a little Houſe and large Gardens, Count <hi>Bellyaurd,</hi>
for ſo was this Nobleman call'd, was of this Opinion:
and the rather, becauſe he had one only Son, call'd
<hi>Rinaldo,</hi> now grown to the Age of Fifteen, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all the excellent Qualities and Graces of Youth,
by Nature, he would bring him up in all Vertues and
noble Sciences, which he believ'd the Gaiety and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
of the Court might divert: He therefore in his
Retirement ſpar'd no Coſt, to thoſe that could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
and accompliſh him; and he had the beſt Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47213:227"/>
and Maſters that could be purchaſed at Court;
<hi>Bellyaurd</hi> making far leſs account of Riches than of
fine Parts. He found his Son capable of all Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
having a Wit ſuitable to his delicate Perſon, ſo
that he was the ſole Joy of his Life, and the Darling
of his Eyes.</p>
                  <p>In the very next Houſe, which joyn'd cloſe to that
of <hi>Bellyaurd</hi>'s, there liv'd another Count, who had in
his Youth been baniſh'd the Court of <hi>France</hi> for ſome
Miſunderſtandings, in ſome high Affairs wherein he
was concern'd; his name was <hi>De Pais,</hi> a Man of great
Birth, but no Fortune; or at leaſt one not ſuitable to
the Grandeur of his Original: And as it is moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
for great Souls to be moſt proud (if I may call
a handſome Diſdain by that vulgar Name,) when they
are moſt depreſs'd; ſo <hi>De Pais</hi> was more retir'd, more
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſtrang'd from his Neighbours, and kept a greater Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
than if he had enjoy'd all he had loſt at Court,
and took more Solemnity and State upon him, becauſe
he would not be ſubject to the Reproaches of the
World, by making himſelf familiar with it. So that
he rarely viſited, and was as rarely viſited; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Cuſtom of thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> who are eaſie
of Exceſs, and free of Converſation, he kept his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
retir'd ſo cloſe, that 'twas rare to ſee any of 'em;
but when they went abroad, which was but ſeldom,
they wanted nothing as to outward appearance, that
was fit for his Quality, and was much above his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>This old Count had two only Daughters, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Beauty, who gave the generous Father Ten
thouſand Torments, as often as he beheld them, when
he conſider'd their extream Beauty, their fine W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,
their Innocence, Modeſty, and above all, their Birth;
and that he had not the Fortune to marry them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and below it, he had rather
ſee them laid in their ſilent Graves, than conſent to;
for he ſcorn'd the World ſhould ſee him forced by his
Poverty, to commit an Action below his Dignity.</p>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47213:227"/>
There lived in a Neighbouring Town, a certain
Nobleman, Friend to <hi>De Pais,</hi> call'd Count <hi>Vernole,</hi> a
Man of about Forty Years of Age, of low Stature,
Complexion very black and ſwarthy, lean, lame, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
proud and haughty; extracted of a Deſcent
from the Blood-Royal; not extreamly brave, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glorious: He had no very great Eſtate, but was in
Election of a greater, and of an Addition of Honour
from the King, his Father having done moſt worthy
Services againſt the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and by the high Favour
of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> was repreſented to his Majeſty,
as a Man related to the Crown, of great Name, but
ſmall Eſtate; ſo that there was now nothing but great
Expectations and Preparations in the Family of Count
<hi>Vernole</hi> to go to Court, to which he daily hop'd an
Invitation or Command.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vernole</hi>'s Fortune being hitherto ſomething a kin to
that of <hi>De Pais,</hi> there was a greater Correſpondency
between theſe two Gentlemen, than they had with
any other Perſons; they accounting themſelves above
the reſt of the World, believ'd none ſo proper and fit
for their Converſation, as that of each other; ſo that
there was a very particular Intimacy between them:
Whenever they went abroad, they clubb'd their Train,
to make one great Show, and were always together,
bemoaning each other's Fortune, that from ſo high a
Deſcent, as one from Monarchs by the Mother's ſide,
and the other from Dukes of his ſide, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by Fate, to the degree of private Gentlemen.
They would often conſult how to manage Affairs moſt
to advantage, and often <hi>De Pais</hi> would ask Counſel of
<hi>Vernole,</hi> how beſt he ſhould diſpoſe of his Daughters,
which now were about their ninth Year the eldeſt,
and eight the youngeſt. <hi>Vernole</hi> had often ſeen theſe
two Buds of Beauty, and already ſaw opening in <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante</hi>'s
Face and Mind (for that was the Name of the
eldeſt, and <hi>Charlot</hi> the youngeſt) a Glory of Wit and
Beauty, which could not but one day diſplay itſelf,
with dazling Luſtre, to the wondring World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47213:228"/>
                     <hi>Vernole</hi> was a great Virtuoſo, of a Humour, Nice,
Delicate, Critical and Opinionative: He had nothing of
the <hi>French</hi> Mien in him, but all the Gravity of the
Don. His ill-favour'd Perſon, and his low Eſtate, put
him out of Humour with the World; and becauſe
that ſhould not upbraid or reproach his Follies and
Defects, he was ſure to be before-hand with that, and
to be always Satyrick upon it, and lov'd to live and
act contrary to the Cuſtom and Uſage of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
beſides.</p>
                  <p>He was infinitely delighted to find a Man of his own
Humour in <hi>De Pais,</hi> or at leaſt a Man that would be
perſwaded to like his ſo well, to live up to it; and it
was no little Joy and Satisfaction to him to find, that
he kept his Daughters in that ſeverity, which was
wholly agreeable to him, and ſo contrary to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and Faſhion of the <hi>French</hi> of Quality; who allow
all Freedoms, which to <hi>Vernole</hi>'s rigid Nature, ſeem'd
as ſo many Steps to Vice, and in his Opinion, the
Ruiner of all Vertue and Honour in Woman-kind.
<hi>De Pais</hi> was extreamly glad his Conduct was ſo well
interpreted, which was no other in him, than a proud
Frugality; who, becauſe they could not appear, inſo
much Gallantry, as their Quality requir'd, kept 'em
retir'd, and unſeen to all, but his particular Friends,
of which <hi>Vernole</hi> was chief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vernole</hi> never appear'd before <hi>Atlante</hi> (which was
ſeldom,) but he aſſum'd a Gravity and Reſpect, fit to
have entertain'd a Maid of Twenty, or rather a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
of much greater Years and Judgment. His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
were always of Matters of State or Philoſophy;
and ſometimes when <hi>De Pais</hi> would Laughing, ſay, <hi>He
might as well entertain</hi> Atlante <hi>with</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Hebrew,
would reply gravely; <hi>You are miſtaken Sir, I find the
Seeds of great and profound Matter in the Soul of the
young Maid, which ought to be nouriſh'd, now while ſhe
was young, and they will grow up to very great Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I find</hi> Atlante <hi>capable of all the Noble Vertues of the
Mind, and am infinitely miſtaken in my Obſervations,
and Art of Phiſiognomy, if</hi> Atlante <hi>be not born for greater
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:228"/>
Things than her Fortune does now promiſe: She will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Conſiderable in the World, believe me, and this will
arrive to her perfectly from the Force of her Charms. De
Pais</hi> was extreamly overjoy'd to hear ſuch Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied
to <hi>Atlante,</hi> and from that time, ſet a ſort of
an Eſteem upon her, which he did not on <hi>Charlot</hi> his
younger; who, by the Perſwaſions of <hi>Vernole,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to put in a Monaſtery, that what he had might
deſcend to <hi>Atlante;</hi> not but he confeſs'd <hi>Charlot</hi> had
Beauty, extreamly attractive, and a Wit that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
much, when it ſhould be cultivated by Years and
Experience; and would ſhew itſelf with great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and Luſtre in a Monaſtery: All this pleaſed <hi>De
Pais</hi> very well, who was eaſily perſwaded, ſince he
had not a Fortune to marry her well in the World.</p>
                  <p>As yet <hi>Vernole</hi> had never ſpoke to <hi>Atlante</hi> of Love;
nor did his Gravity think it Prudence to diſcover his
Heart to ſo young a Maid, he waited her more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Years, when he could hoope to have ſome return.
And all he expected from this her tender Age, was by
his daily Converſe with her, and the Preſents, he made
her ſuitable to her Years, to ingratiate himſelf inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
into her Friendſhip and Eſteem: Since ſhe was
not yet capable of Love, but even in that he miſtook
his Aim, for every day he grew more and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
to <hi>Atlante,</hi> and would have been her abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Averſion, had ſhe known, ſhe had every day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
a Lover; but as ſhe grew in Years and Senſe,
he ſeemed the more deſpicable in her Eyes as to his
Perſon; but as ſhe had reſpect to his Parts, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
ſhe paid him all the Complaiſance ſhe could,
and which was due to him; and ſo muſt be confeſs'd,
tho' he had a ſtiff Formality in all he ſaid and did,
yet he had Wit and Learning, and was a great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher;
as much of his Learning, as <hi>Atlante</hi> was
capable of attaining to, he made her Miſtreſs of, and
that was no ſmall Portion, for all his Diſcourſe was
fine and eaſily comprehended, his Notions of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
fit for Ladies; and he took greater Pains with
<hi>Atlante,</hi> than any Maſter would have done with a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:229"/>
Scholar; ſo that it was moſt certain, he added<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very
great Accompliſhment to her Natural Wit, and the
more becauſe ſhe took a very great Delight in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy;
which very often made her impatient of his
coming; eſpecially when ſhe had many Queſtions to
ask him concerning it, and ſhe wou'd often receive
him with a Pleaſure in her Face; which he did not
fail to interpret to his own Advantage, being very apt
to flatter himſelf. Her Siſter <hi>Charlot</hi> would often ask
her, <hi>How ſhe could give whole Afternoons to ſo diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Man: What is it,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that charms <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
Eyes, his lean Carcaſe, and his lame and haulting Hips?</hi>
But <hi>Atlante</hi> wou'd diſcreetly reply, <hi>If I must grant al
you ſay of Count</hi> Vernole <hi>to be true, yet he has a Wit and
Learning, that will attone ſufficiently for all thoſe Faults
you mention: A fine Soul is infinitely to be preferr'd to a
fine Body; this decays, but that's eternal; and Age that
ruins one, refines the other.</hi> Though poſſibly <hi>Atlante</hi>
thought as ill of the Count, as her Siſter; yet in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to him, ſhe would not own it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atlante</hi> was now arriv'd to her thirteenth Year,
when her Beauty, which every day increas'd, became
the Diſcourſe of the whole Town; which had already
gain'd her as many Lovers as had beheld her, for none
ſaw her without languiſhing for her, or at leaſt, but
what were in very great Admiration of her. Every
body talk'd of the young <hi>Atlante,</hi> and all the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who had Sons (knowing the Smallneſs of her
Fortune, and the Luſtre of her Beauty) would ſend
them for fear of their being Charm'd with her, either
to ſome other part of the World, or exhorted them,
by way of Precaution, to keep out of her ſight. Old
<hi>Bellyuard</hi> was one of thoſe wiſe Parents, and by a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prevention, as he thought of <hi>Rinaldo</hi>'s falling in
Love with <hi>Atlante,</hi> perhaps was the Occaſion of his
being ſo; he had before heard of <hi>Atlante,</hi> and of her
Beauty, but it had made no Impreſſions on his Heart;
but his Father no ſooner forbid him Loving, then he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47213:229"/>
felt a new Deſire tormenting him, of ſeeing this love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and dangerous young Perſon; he wonders at his
unaccountable Pain, which daily ſolicits him within,
to go where he may behold this Beauty; of whom he
frames a thouſand Idea's, all ſuch as were moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him; but then upbraids his Fancy, for not
forming her half ſo delicate as ſhe was; and longs yet
more to ſee her, to know how near ſhe approaches to
the Picture he has drawn of her in his Mind; and
tho' he knew ſhe liv'd the next Houſe to him, yet he
knew alſo ſhe was kept within like a Vow'd <hi>Nun,</hi> or
with the Severity of a <hi>Spaniard:</hi> And tho' he had a
Chamber, which had a jetting Window, that look'd
juſt upon the Door of Monſieur <hi>De Pais,</hi> and that he
would watch many Hours at a time, in hope to ſee
them go out, yet he could never get a glimps of her;
yet he heard ſhe often frequented the Church of our
<hi>Lady:</hi> Thither then young <hi>Rinaldo</hi> reſolv'd to go, and
did ſo two or three Mornings, in which time, to his
unſpeakable Grief, he ſaw no Beauty appear that
charm'd him; and yet he fancy'd that <hi>Atlante</hi> was
there, and that he had ſeen her, that ſome one of thoſe
young Ladies, that he ſaw in the Church was ſhe, tho'
he had no body to enquire of, and that ſhe was not
ſo fair as the World reported; for which he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſigh, as if he had loſt ſome very great Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
however he ceaſed not to frequent this
Church, and one day ſaw a young Beauty, who at firſt
glimps made his Heart leap to his Mouth, and fell
trembling again into its wanted place, for it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
told him, that that young Maid was <hi>Atlante;</hi> ſhe
was with her Siſter <hi>Charlot,</hi> who was very handſome,
but not comparable to <hi>Atlante:</hi> He fix'd his Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, as ſhe kneel'd at the Altar, he never remov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
from that charming Face as long as ſhe remain'd there;
he forgot all Devotion, but what he paid to her, he
ador'd her, he burnt and languiſh'd already for her,
and found he muſt poſſeſs <hi>Atlante,</hi> or die: Often as
he gaz'd upon her, he ſaw her fair Eyes lifted up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his, where they often met; which ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:230"/>
would caſt hers down into her Boſom, or on her
Book, and bluſh as if ſhe had done a Fault: <hi>Charlot</hi>
perceiv'd all the Motions of <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> how he folded
his Arms, how he ſigh'd, and how he gaz'd on her
Siſter; ſhe took notice of his Cloaths, his Garniture,
and every particular of his Dreſs, as young Girls uſe
to do, and ſeeing him ſo very handſome, and ſo much
better dreſs'd than all the young Cavaliers that were
in the Church, ſhe was very much pleas'd with him;
and could not forbear ſaying, in a low Voice, to <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante,
Look, look, my Siſter, what a pretty Monſieur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>

gallant his Dreſs; and do but look how he gazes on you:</hi>
This would make <hi>Atlante</hi> bluſh anew, who durſt not
raiſe her Eyes for fear ſhe ſhould encounter his. While
he had the Pleaſure to imagine they were talking of
him, and he ſaw in the pretty Face of <hi>Charlot,</hi> that
what he ſaid, was not to his diſadvantage, and by the
Bluſhes of <hi>Atlante,</hi> that ſhe was not diſpleas'd with
what was ſpoken to her; he perceiv'd the young one
importunate with her, and <hi>Atlante</hi> jogging her with
her Elbow, as much as to ſay, Hold your peace; all
this, he made a very kind Interpretation of, and was
tranſported with Joy, at the good Omens. He was
willing to flatter his new Flame, and to Complement
his young Deſire with a little Hope; but the Divine
Ceremony ceaſing, <hi>Atlante</hi> left the Church, and it
being very fair Weather, ſhe walk'd home, <hi>Rinaldo,</hi>
who ſaw her going, felt all the Agonies of a Lover,
who parts with all that can make him happy, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only <hi>Atlante</hi> attended with her Siſter, and a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
following with their Books, he was a thouſand times
about to ſpeak to 'em, but he no ſooner advanc'd a ſtep
or two towards 'em, to that Purpoſe (for he followed
them) but his Heart fail'd, and a certain Awe and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
or rather the Fears and Tremblings of a Lover,
prevented him; but when he conſider'd, that poſſible
he might never have ſo favourable an Opportunity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
he reſolv'd a-new, and call'd up ſo much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to his Heart, as to ſpeak to <hi>Atlante;</hi> but before he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47213:230"/>
did ſo, <hi>Charlot</hi> looking behind her, ſaw <hi>Rinaldo</hi> very
near to 'em, and cry'd out, with a Voice of Joy, Oh!
Siſter, Siſter, look where the handſome Monſieur is,
juſt behind us; ſure he is Some-body of Quality, for
ſee he has two Foot-men that follow him, in juſt ſuch
Liveries, and ſo rich as thoſe of our Neighbour, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Bellyaurd.</hi> At this, <hi>Atlante</hi> could not forbear, but
before ſhe was aware of it, turn'd her Head, and look'd
on <hi>Rinaldo;</hi> which encourag'd him to advance, and
putting off his Hat, which he clapt under his Arm,
with a low Bow, ſaid, <hi>Ladies, you are ſlenderly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſo many Accidents arrive to the Fair in the rude
Streets, that I humbly implore, you will permit me, whoſe
Duty it is, as a Neighbour, to wait on you to your Door.
Sir,</hi> ſaid <hi>Atlante,</hi> bluſhing, <hi>we fear no Inſolence, and need
no Protector; or if we did, we ſhould not be ſo rude, to
take you out of your Way, to ſerve us. Madam,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>my Way lies yours, I live at the next Door, and am Son
to</hi> Bellyaurd, <hi>your Neighbour. But, Madam,</hi> added
he, <hi>if I were to go all my Life out of the Way, to do you
Service, I ſhould take it for the greatest Happineſs, that
could arrive to me; but, Madam, ſure a Man can never
be out of his Way, who has the Honour of ſo charming
Company. Atlante</hi> made no Reply to this, but bluſh'd
and bow'd: But <hi>Charlot</hi> ſaid, <hi>Nay, Sir, if you are our
Neighbour, we will give you leave to Conduct us home;
But pray, Sir, how came you to know we are your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
for we never ſaw you before, to our knowledge.
My pretty Mis,</hi> reply'd <hi>Rinaldo, I knew it from the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
Beauty appear'd in your Faces, and ſine Shapes;
for I have heard, there was no Beauty in the World, like
that of</hi> Atlante<hi>'s; and I no ſooner ſaw her, but my Heart
told me, it was ſhe. Heart,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charlot</hi> laughing, <hi>Way,
does Hearts uſe to ſpeak? The most intelligibly of any
thing, Rinaldo</hi> reply'd, <hi>when 'tis tenderly touch'd, when
'tis charm'd and tranſported.</hi> At theſe Words he ſigh'd,
and <hi>Atlante,</hi> to his extream Satisfaction, bluſhed.
<hi>Touch, charm'd, and tranſported, ſaid</hi> Charlot, <hi>what's
that? And how do you do to have it be all theſe Things?
For I would give any thing in the World to have my Heart</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:231"/>
ſpeak. Oh! <hi>ſaid</hi> Rinaldo, your Heart is too young, it is
not yet arrived to the Years of ſpeaking; about thirteen
or fourteen, it may poſſibly be ſaying a thouſand ſoft
Things to you; but it must be first inſpir'd by ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Object, whoſe Idea it must retain. What, <hi>reply'd
this pretty Pratlet,</hi> I'll warrant I must be in love? Yes,
<hi>ſaid</hi> Rinaldo, most paſſionately, or you will have but little
Converſation with your Heart. Oh! <hi>reply'd ſhe,</hi> I am
afraid the Pleaſure of ſuch a Converſation, will not make
me Amends for the Pain that Love will give me. That,
<hi>ſaid</hi> Rinaldo, is according as the Object is kind; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Pleaſure: And in this, how great an Advantage have
you, fair Ladies, above us Men? 'Tis almost impoſſible
for you to love in vain, you have your Choice of a thouſand
Hearts, which you have ſubdu'd, and may not only chuſe
your Slaves, but be aſſur'd of 'em; without ſpeaking you
are belov'd, it needs not cost you a Sigh or a Tear: But
unhappy Man, is often deſtsn'd to give his Heart, where
it is not regarded, to ſigh, to weep, and languiſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any hope of Pity. You ſpeak ſo feelingly, Sir, <hi>ſaid
Charlot,</hi> that I am afraid this is your Caſe? Yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<hi>reply'd</hi> Rinaldo, <hi>ſighing,</hi> I am that unhappy Man,
Indeed, 'tis pity, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> Pray how long have you been
ſo? Ever ſince I heard of the charming <hi>Atlante, reply'd
he, ſighing again;</hi> I ador'd her Character, but now I
have ſeen her, I die for her. For me, Sir, <hi>ſaid</hi> Atlante,
(who had not yet ſpoke) this is the common Complement
of all the young Men, who pretend to be Lovers; and if
one ſhould pity all thoſe Sighers, we ſhould have but very
little left for ourſelves. I believe, <hi>ſaith</hi> Rinaldo, there
are none that tell you ſo, who do not mean as they ſay;
yet among all thoſe Adorers, and thoſe that ſay they will
die for you, you will find none will be ſo good as their Words
as <hi>Rinaldo.</hi> Perhaps, <hi>ſaid</hi> Atlante, of all thoſe who tell
me of dying, there are none that tell it with ſo little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> if that be your Name, Sir. Madam, it
is, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> and who am tranſported with an unſpeakable
Joy, to hear thoſe last Words from your fair Mouth; and
let me, O lovely <hi>Atlante,</hi> aſſure you, that what I have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:231"/>
ſaid, are not Words of Courſe, but proceed from a Heart
that has vow'd itſelf eternally yours, even before I had the
Happineſs to behold this Divine Perſon; but now that
my Eyes have made good all my Heart before imagin'd,
and did but hope: I ſwear, I will die à thouſand
Deaths, rather than violate what I have ſaid to you; That
Indore you, that my Soul, and all my Faculties are charm'd
with your Beauty and Innocence, and that my Life and
Fortune, not inconſiderable, ſhall be laid at your Feet.
<hi>This he ſpoke with a Fervency of Paſſion, that left her
no doubt of what he had ſaid; yet ſhe bluſh'd for
ſhame, and a little angry at herſelf, for ſuffering him
to ſay ſo much to her, the very firſt time ſhe ſaw him,
and accuſed herſelf for giving him any Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And in this Confuſion ſhe replied,</hi> Sir, you have
ſaid too much to be believed; and I cannot imagine ſo
ſhort an Acquaintance can make ſo conſiderable an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
of which Confeſſion I accuſe myſelf much more
than you, in that I did not only hearken to what you ſaid,
without forbidding you to entertain me at that rate, but
for unheedily ſpeaking ſomething, that has encourag'd this
Boldneſs, for ſo must I call it, in a Man ſo great a
Stranger to me. Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> if I have offended by
the ſuddenneſs of my preſumptuous Diſcovery, I beſeech
you to conſider my Reaſons for it, the few Opportunities I
am like to have, and the impoſſibility of waiting on you,
both from the Severity of your Father and mine; who e'r I
ſaw you, warn'd me of my Fate, as if he foreſaw I ſhould
fall in Love, as ſoon as I ſhould chance to ſee you; and
for that Reaſon has kept me cloſer to my Studies, than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
I have been: And from that time I began to feel
a Flame, which was kindled by Report alone, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
my Father gave of your wondrous, and dangerous
Beauty: Therefore, Madam, I have not ſuddenly told
you of my Paſſion, I have been long your Lover, and have
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ong languiſh'd without telling of my Pain, and you ought
to pardon it now, ſince it is done with all the Reſpect and
Religious Awe, that 'tis poſſible for a Heart to deliver
and unload itſelf in, therefore, Madam, if you have by
Chance uttered any thing, that I have taken advantage
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47213:232"/>
or hope from, I aſſure you, 'tis ſo ſmall, that you have no
Reaſon to repent it; but rather, if you would have me
live, ſend me not from you, without a Confirmation of
that little hope, See, Madam, <hi>ſaid he, more earneſtly
and trembling,</hi> ſee we are almost arriv'd at our Homes,
ſend me not to mine in a Deſpair, that I cannot ſupport
with Life; but tell me, I ſhall be bleſs'd with your Sight,
ſometimes in your Balcony, which is very near to a jetting
Window in our Houſe, from whence I have ſent many a
longing Look towards yours, in hope to have ſeen my Soul's
Tormenter. I ſhall be very unwilling, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> to enter
into an Intreigue of Love, or Friendſhip, with a Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whoſe Parents will be averſe to my Happineſs, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
mine as refractory, tho' he cannot but know ſuch an
Alliance would be very conſiderable, my Fortune being
not ſuitable to yours: I tell you this, that you may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
in time from an Engagement, in which I find there
will be a great many Obſtacles. Oh! Madam, <hi>replied</hi>
Rinaldo, <hi>ſighing,</hi> if my Perſon be not diſagreeable to you,
you will have no occaſion to fear the rest, 'tis that I dread,
and that which is all my fear. <hi>He, ſighing, beheld her
with a languiſhing Look, that told her, he expected
her Anſwer; when ſhe reply'd,</hi> Sir, if that will be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
enough for you at this time, I do aſſure you, I
have no Averſion for your Perſon, in which I find more to
be valu'd, than in any I have yet ſeen; and if what you
ſay be real, and proceed from a Heart truly affected, I
find, in ſpight of me, you will oblige me to give you
hope.</p>
                  <p>They were come ſo near their own Houſes, that he
had not time to return her any Anſwer, but with a low
Bow he acknowledg'd her Bounty, and expreſs'd the
Joy her laſt Words had given him, by a Look that
made her underſtand, he was charm'd and pleas'd;
and ſhe bowing to him with an Air of Satisfaction in
her Face, he was well aſſured, there was nothing to
be ſeen ſo lovely as ſhe then appear'd, and left her to
go into her own Houſe; but 'till ſhe was out of ſight,
he had not power to ſtir, and then ſighing, retired to
his own Appartment, to think over all that had paſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47213:232"/>
between them. He found nothing but what gave him
a thouſand Joys, in all ſhe had ſaid; and he bleſt this
happy Day, and wondred how his Stars came ſo kind,
to make him one hour at once ſee <hi>Atlante,</hi> and have the
Happineſs to know from her own Mouth, that he was
not diſagreeable to her: Yet with this Satisfaction, he
had a thouſand Thoughts mix'd, which were torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and thoſe were the Fear of their Parents; he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
from what his Father had ſaid to him already, that
it would be difficult to draw him to a Conſent of his
Marriage with <hi>Atlante:</hi> Theſe Joys and Fears were
his Companions all the Night, in which he took but
little reſt. Nor was <hi>Atlante</hi> without her Inquietudes:
She <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound <hi>Rinaldo</hi> more in her Thoughts, than ſhe wiſh'd,
and a ſudden change of Humour, that made her know
ſomething was the matter with her, more than uſual;
ſhe calls to mind <hi>Rinaldo</hi>'s ſpeaking of the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with his Heart, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound hers would be tarling
to her, if ſhe would give way to it; and yet the more
ſhe ſtrove to avoid it, the more it importun'd her, and
in ſpight of all her Reſiſtance, would tell her, that <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi>
had a thouſand Charms: It tells her, that he
loves and adores her, and that ſhe would be the moſt
cruel of her Sex, ſhould ſhe not be ſenſible of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
She finds a thouſand Graces in his Perſon and
Converſation, and as many Advantages in his Fortune,
which was one of the moſt conſiderable in all thoſe
Parts; for his Eſtate exceeded that of the moſt Noble
Men in <hi>Orleance,</hi> and ſhe imagines ſhe would be the
moſt fortunate of all Womankind, in ſuch a Match.
With theſe Thoughts ſhe employ'd all the Hours of the
Night; ſo that ſhe lay ſo long in Bed the next Day,
that Count <hi>Vernole,</hi> who had invited himſelf to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
came before ſhe had quitted her Chamber, and
ſhe was forc'd to ſay, ſhe had not been well. He had
brought her a very fine Book, newly come out, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Philoſophy, fit for the Study of Ladies. But he
appear'd ſo diſagreeable to that Heart, wholly taken
up with a new and fine Object, that ſhe could now
hardly pay him that Civility ſhe was wont to do; while
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47213:233"/>
on the other ſide, that little State and Pride <hi>Atlante</hi>
aſſum'd, made her appear the more charming to him;
ſo that if <hi>Atlante</hi> had no Mind to begin a new Leſſon
of Philoſophy, while ſhe fancied her Thoughts were
much better employ'd, the Count every Moment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
his Tenderneſs and Paſſion, had as little an
Inclination to inſtruct her, as ſhe was to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Love had taught her a new Leſſon, and he would
fain teach her a new Leſſon of Love, but fears it will
be a diminiſhing of his Gravity and Grandeur, to open
the Secrets of his Heart to ſo young a Maid; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thinks it more agreeable to his Quality and Years,
being about Forty, to uſe her Father's Authority in
this Affair, and that it was ſufficient for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himſelf to Monſieur <hi>De Pais,</hi> who he knew would
be proud of the Honour he did him ſome time paſt,
before he could perſwade himſelf, even to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to her Father; he fancies, the little Coldneſs and
Pride he ſaw in <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Face, which was not uſual,
proceeded from ſome Diſcovery of Paſſion, which his
Eyes had made, or now and then a Sigh, that una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
broke forth, and accuſes himſelf of a Levity
below his Quality, and the Dignity of his Wit and
Gravity; and therefore, aſſumes a more rigid and
formal Behaviour than he was wont, which rendred
him yet more diſagreeable than before; and 'twas
with greater Pain than ever, ſhe gave him that Reſpect
which was due to his Quality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> after a reſtleſs Night, was up very early
in the Morning; and tho' he was not certain of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his adorable <hi>Atlante,</hi> he dreſs'd himſelf with all

                  <p>He having writ and ſeal'd this, toſs'd it into the
Balcony, to <hi>Charlot,</hi> having firſt look'd about to ſee
if none perceiv'd them: She put it in her Boſom, and
ran into her Siſter, whom by chance ſhe found alone;
<hi>Vernole</hi> having taken <hi>De Pais</hi> into the Garden, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
him concerning the ſending <hi>Charlot</hi> to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery;
which Work he deſir'd to ſee perform'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he declar'd his Intentions to <hi>Atlante;</hi> for among
all his other good Qualities, he was very avaritious;
and as fair as <hi>Atlante</hi> was, he thought ſhe would be
much fairer with the Addition of <hi>Charlot</hi>'s Portion:
This Affair of his, with Monſieur <hi>De Pays,</hi> gave <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi>
an Opportunity of delivering her Letter to her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
who no ſooner drew it from her Boſom, but <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante</hi>'s
Face was cover'd over with Bluſhes: For
ſhe imagin'd from whence it came, and had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Joy in that Imagination, tho' ſhe thought ſhe muſt
put on the Severity and Niceneſs of a Virgin, who
would not be thought to have ſurrendred her Heart

angry to have receiv'd a Letter from him; he look'd ſo

Which ſhe did, and finiſhed with a Sigh. While ſhe

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47213:234"/>
were not likely to be ſurprized; and finding the Count
and her Father ſet in an Arbor, in deep Diſcourſe, ſhe
brought Pen, Ink, and Paper, to her Siſter, and told
her, ſhe might write without the fear of being diſturbed;
and urged her ſo long to what was enough her Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhe at laſt obtained this Anſwer:</p>

                           <hi>CHarlot,</hi> your little importunate Advocate, has, at last
ſubdued me to a Conſent of returning you this. She
has put me on an Affair which I am wholly unacquainted
with; and you ought to take this very kindly from me, ſince
it is the very first time I ever writ to one of your Sex, tho'
perhaps I might with leſs Danger have done it to any other
Man. I tremble while I write, ſince I dread a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

                  <p>She gave this Letter to <hi>Charlot;</hi> who immediately
ran into the Balcony with it, where ſhe ſtill found <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi>
in a Melancholy Poſture, leaning his Head on his
Hand: She ſhewed him the Letter, but was afraid to
toſs it to him, for fear it might fall to the Ground; ſo
he ran and fetched a long Cane, which he cleft at one
end, and holding it where ſhe put the Letter into the
Cleft, and ſtaid not to hear what he ſaid to it: But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was Man ſo tranſported with Joy, as he was, at the
reading of this Letter; it gives him new Wounds; for
to the Generous, nothing obliges Love ſo much as Love:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47213:235"/>
Tho' it is now too much the Nature of that inconſtant
Sex, to ceaſe too Love as ſoon as they are ſure of the
Conqueſt. But it was far different with our Cavalier;
he was the more inflamed, by imagining he had made
ſome Impreſſions on the Heart of <hi>Atlante,</hi> and kindled
ſome Sparks there, that in time might increaſe to ſome
thing more; ſo that he now reſolves to die hers; and
conſidering all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bſtacles that may poſſibly hinder
his Happineſs, he found none but his Father's Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
perhaps occaſioned by the Meanneſs of <hi>Atlante</hi>'s
Fortune: To this he urged again, that he was his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Son, and a Son whom he loved equal to his own
Life; and that certainly, as ſoon as he ſhould behold
him dying for <hi>Atlante,</hi> which if forc'd to quit he muſt
be, that then he believed the Tenderneſs of ſo fond a
Parent, would break forth into Pity and Compaſſion,
and plead within for his Conſent. Theſe were the
Thoughts that flattered this young Lover all the Day,
and whether he were riding the great Horſe, or at his
Study of Philoſophy, or Mathematicks, Singing, Dancing,
or whatſoever other Exerciſe his Tutors ordered, his
Thoughts were continually on <hi>Atlante,</hi> and now he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
no more; whatever he ſeem'd to do, every Day
he fail'd not to write to her by the Hand of the kind <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot;</hi>
who young as ſhe was, had conceiv'd a very great
Friendſhip for <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> and fail'd not to fetch her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and bring him Anſwers, ſuch as he wiſh'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
But all this did not ſatisfie our impatient Lover;
Abſence kill'd, and he was no longer able to ſupport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
without a ſight of this adorable Maid; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
implores, ſhe will give him that Satisfaction: And
ſhe at laſt grants it, with a better Will than he imagin'd.
The next Day was the appointed time, when ſhe would,
under pretence of going to Church, give him an Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
And becauſe all Publick Places were dangerous,
and might make a great Noiſe, and they had no Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Place to truſt to, <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> under pretence of going
up the River in his Pleaſure-Boat, which he often did,
ſent to have it made ready againſt the next Day, at Ten
of the Clock. This was accordingly done, and he gave
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47213:235"/>
                     <hi>Atlante</hi> Notice of his Deſign, of going an Hour or two
on the River, in his Boat; which lay near to ſuch a
place, not far from the Church. She, and <hi>Charlot,</hi>
came thither; and becauſe they durſt not come out,
without a Foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>man, or two; they taking one, ſent him
with a <hi>How de ye?</hi> to ſome young Ladies; and told
him, he ſhould find them at Church. So getting rid of
their Spy, they haſtned to the River-ſide, and found a
Boat, and <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> waiting to carry them on Board his
little Veſſel; which was richly adorn'd, and a very
handſome Collation ready for them, of Cold Meats, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads,
and Sweetmeats. As ſoon as they were come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Pleaſure-Boat, unſeen of any, he kneel'd at the
Feet of <hi>Atlante;</hi> and there utter'd ſo many paſſionate
and tender Things to her, with a Voice ſo trembling,
and ſoft; with Eyes ſo languiſhing; and a Fervency,
and Fire, ſo ſincere; that her young Heart, wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of Artifice, could no longer reſiſt ſuch Language,
and ſuch Looks of Love, ſhe grows tender, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
it in her fine Eyes, who could not diſſemble; he
reads her Heart in her Looks, and found it yielding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace;
and therefore aſſaults it anew, with freſh Forces
of Sighs and Tears: He implores, ſhe would aſſure him
of her Heart; which ſhe could no other way do, then
by yielding to marry him: He would carry her to the
next Village, there conſummate that Happineſs, without
which he was able to live no longer; for he had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Fears, that ſome other Lover was, or would ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
be provided for her; and therefore he would
make ſure of her, while he had this Opportunity; and
to that end, he anſwered all the Objections ſhe could
make to the contrary: But ever, when he nam'd Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
ſhe trembled, with fear of doing ſomething that
ſhe fancy'd ſhe ought not to do, without the Conſent of
her Father: She was ſenſible of the Advantage, but had
been ſo us'd to a ſtrict Obedience, that ſhe could not,
without Horrour, think of violating it; and therefore
beſought him, as he valu'd her Repoſe, not to urge her
to that. And told him further, That if he fear'd any
Rival, ſhe would give him what other Aſſurance, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47213:236"/>
Satisfaction he pleas'd, but that of Marriage; which ſhe
could not conſent to, 'till ſhe knew ſuch an Alliance
would not be fatal to him; for ſhe fear'd as paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he lov'd her, when he ſhould find ſhe had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
him the loſs of his Fortune, or his Father's Affection,
he would grow to hate her; tho' he anſwer'd to this,
all that a fond Lover could urge, yet ſhe was reſolv'd,
and he was forc'd to content himſelf with obliging her
by his Prayers and Proteſtations, his Sighs, and his
Showers of Tears, to a Contract, which they ſolemnly
made each other, vowing on either ſide, that they would
never marry any other. This being ſolemnly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he aſſum'd a Look more gay, and contented than
before: He preſented her a very rich Ring; which ſhe
durſt not put on her Finger, but hid it in her Boſom:
And beholding each other now, as Man and Wife, ſhe
ſuffer'd him all the decent Freedoms he could wiſh to
take; ſo that the Hours of this Voyage, ſeem'd the moſt
ſoft and charming of his Life: And doubtleſs they were
ſo; every Touch of <hi>Atlante</hi> tranſported him, every
Look pierced his Soul, and he was all Raptures of Joy,
when he conſider'd this charming lovely Maid was his
own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlot</hi> all this while was gazing above Deck, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Motion of the little Veſſel, and how eaſily the
Wind and Tide bore her up the River. She had never
been in any thing of this kind before, and was very well
pleaſed and entertain'd, when <hi>Rinaldo</hi> call'd her down
to eat; where they enjoy'd themſelves as well as was
poſſible; and <hi>Charlot</hi> was wondering to ſee ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in their Eyes.</p>
                  <p>But now they thought it was high time for them to
return; they fancy the Foot-man miſſing them at
Church, would go home, and alarm their Father, and
the Knight of the Ill-favour'd Countenance, as <hi>Charlot</hi>
call'd Count <hi>Vernole;</hi> whoſe Severity put their Father
on a greater Reſtriction of them, than naturally he would
do of himſelf. At the Name of this Count, <hi>Rinaldo</hi>
chang'd Colour, fearing he might be ſome Rival; and
ask'd <hi>Atlante,</hi> if this <hi>Vernole</hi> was a-kin to her? She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47213:236"/>
No: But was a very great Friend to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and on who, from their Infancy, had had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Concern for their Breeding, and was her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
for Philoſophy. <hi>Ah!</hi> replied <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> ſighing, <hi>This
Man's Concern must proceed from ſomething more than
Friendſhip for her Father;</hi> and therefore conjured her to
tell him, whether he was not a Lover? <hi>A Lover,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Atlante; I aſſure you, he is a perfect Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that Paſſion;</hi> and tho' ſhe ſuffered his ugly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
now, ſhe ſhould loath and hate him, ſhould he
name but Love to her.</p>
                  <p>She ſaid, ſhe believ'd ſhe need not fear any ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
ſince he was a Man, who was not at all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous;
that he had too much of the Satyr in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to harbour any ſoftneſs there: And Nature had
form'd his Body to his Mind, wholly unfit for Love;
and that he might ſet his Heart abſolutely at reſt: She
aſſur'd him her Father had never yet propos'd any Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to her, tho' many advantagious ones are offer'd
him every day.</p>
                  <p>The Sails being turn'd to carry them back from
whence they came; after having diſcours'd of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
things, and all of Love and Contrivance, to carry
on their Mutual Deſign, they with Sighs parted, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi>
ſtaying behind in the Pleaſure-Boat, and they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Shoar in the Wherry, that attended; after which,
he caſt many an amorous and ſad Look, and perhaps
was anſwer'd by thoſe of <hi>Atlante.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was paſt Church time two or three Hours; when
they arriv'd at home, wholly unprepared with an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
ſo abſolutely was <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Soul poſſeſt with ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Buſineſs. The firſt Perſon they met withal, was
the Footman, who open'd the Door, and began to cry
out, how long he had waited in the Church, and how
in vain; without giving them time to reply. <hi>De Pais</hi>
came towards 'em; and with a frowning Look, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
where they had been? <hi>Atlante,</hi> who was not
accuſtomed to Excuſes, and Untruth, was a while at a
ſtand; when <hi>Charlot</hi> with a Voice of Joy cried out;
<hi>Oh, Sir, we have been a Board of a fine little Ship:</hi> At
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47213:237"/>
this <hi>Atlante</hi> bluſh'd, fearing ſhe would tell the Truth.
But ſhe proceeded on, and ſaid, that they had not
been above a Quarter of an Hour at Church, when
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ady—, with ſome other Ladies and Cavaliers,
were going out of the Church, and that ſpying them,
they wou'd needs have them go with 'em: My Siſter,
Sir, continued ſhe, was very loath to go, for fear you
ſhould be angry; but my Lady—was ſo importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
with her on one ſide, and I on the other; becauſe
I never ſaw a little Ship in my Life, that at laſt we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with her; therefore, good Sir, be not angry. He
promiſed them, he was not: And when they came in,
they found Count <hi>Vernole,</hi> who had been inſpiring <hi>De
Pais</hi> with Severity, and counſell'd him to chide the young
Ladies, for being too long abſent, under pretence of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Devotion. Nor was it enough for him to
ſet the Father on, but himſelf, with a Gravity, where
Concern and Malice were both apparent, reproach'd
<hi>Atlante</hi> with Levity; and told her, He believ'd ſhe had
ſome other Motive, than the Invitation of a Lady, to
go on Ship-board; and that ſhe had too many Lovers,
not to make them doubt that this was a deſign'd thing;
and that ſhe had heard Love from ſome one, for whom
it was deſign'd. To this ſhe made him but a ſhort Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
That if it was ſo, ſhe had no Reaſon to conceal it,
ſince ſhe had Sence enough to look after herſelf; and if
any Body had made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ove to her, he might be aſſur'd,
it was ſome one, whoſe Quality and Merit deſerv'd to
be heard: And with a Look of Scorn, ſhe paſt on to
another Room, and left him ſilently raging within with
Jealouſie: Which, if before ſhe tormented him, this
Declaration increas'd it to a Pitch not to be conceal'd.
And this Day he ſaid ſo much to the Father, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
forthwith to ſend <hi>Charlot</hi> to a Nunnery: And
accordingly, the next Day, he bid her prepare to go.
<hi>Charlot,</hi> who was not yet arrived to the Years of Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
did not much regret it; and having no Trouble,
but leaving her Siſter, ſhe prepared to go to a Nunnery,
not many Streets from that where ſhe dwelt. The Lady
Abbeſs was her Father's Kinſwoman, and had treated
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47213:237"/>
her very well, as often as ſhe came to viſit her; ſo that
with Satisfaction enough, ſhe was condemned to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick
Life, and was now going for her Probation-Year.
<hi>Atlante</hi> was troubled at her Departure, becauſe
ſhe had no Body to bring, and to carry Letters between
<hi>Rinaldo</hi> and ſhe: However ſhe took her leave of her,
and promis'd to come and ſee her, as often as ſhe ſhould
be permitted to go abroad; for ſhe fear'd now ſome
Conſtraint extraordinary would be put upon her; and
ſo it happen'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Chamber was that to which the Balcony
belong'd, and though ſhe durſt not appear there in the
Day-time, ſhe could in the Night, and that way give
her Lover as many Hours of Converſation, as ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
without being perceived: But how to give <hi>Rinaldo</hi>
notice of this, ſhe could not tell, who not knowing
<hi>Charlot</hi> was gone to a Monaſtery, waited many Days
at his Window to ſee her; at laſt they neither of them
knowing who to truſt with any Meſſage, one Day
when he was, as uſual, upon his watch, he ſaw <hi>Atlante</hi>
ſtep into the Balcony, who having a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whoſe Caſement was open, and run in again unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

this:</p>
                  <p>My Chamber is that which looks into the Balcony, from

                  <p>There needed no more to make him a diligent Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and accordingly ſhe was no ſooner retired to her
Chamber, but ſhe would come into the Balcony, where
ſhe fail'd not to ſee him attending at his Window. This
happy Contrivance was thus carry'd on for many
Nights, where they entertain'd one another, with all
the Indearment that two Hearts could dictate, who
were perfectly united and aſſured of each other, and
this pleaſing Converſation would often laſt till Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and forced them to part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:47213:238"/>
But old <hi>Belyuard</hi> perceiving his Son frequent that
Chamber more than uſual, fancy'd ſomething extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
muſt be the Cauſe of it; and one Night asking
for his Son, his Vallet told him, he was gone into the great
Chamber; ſo this was called: <hi>Belyuard</hi> asked the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
what he did there; he told him, he could not tell;
for often he had lighted him thither; and, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
would take the Candle from him, at the Chamber
Door, and ſuffer him to go no further: Tho' the old
Gentleman could not imagine, what Affairs he could
have alone every Night in that Chamber, he had a
Curioſity to ſee; and one unlucky Night, putting off
his Shooes, he came to the Door of the Chamber,
which was open, he entered ſoftly, and ſaw the Candle
ſet in the Chimney, and his Son at a great open Bay
Window; he ſtopt a while to wait when he would
turn, but finding him immovable, he advanced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
further, and at laſt heard the ſoft Dialogue of
Love, between him and <hi>Atlante;</hi> whom he knew to
be ſhe, by his often calling her by her Name in their
Diſcourſe: He heard enough to confirm him how Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
went; and unſeen as he came, he returned, full
of Indignation, and thought how to prevent ſo great
an Evil, as this Paſſion of his Son might produce; at
firſt he thought to round him ſeverely in the Ear about
it, and upbraid him for doing the only thing he had
thought fit to forbid him; but then he thought that
would but terrifie him for a while, and he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again, where he had ſo great an Inclination, if he
were near her: He therefore reſolves to ſend him to
<hi>Paris,</hi> that by abſence he might forget the young Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that had charmed his Youth: Therefore, without
letting <hi>Rinaldo</hi> know the Reaſon, and without taking
notice that he knew any thing of his Amour, he came
to him one Day, and told him all the Maſters he had
for the improving him in noble Sciences were very dull,
or very remiſs; and that he reſolved he ſhould go for a
Year or two, to the Academy at <hi>Paris.</hi> To this, the
Son made a thouſand Evaſions; but the Father was
poſitive, and not to be perſwaded by all his Reaſons;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47213:238"/>
and finding he ſhould abſolutely diſpleaſe him, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to go, and not daring to tell him the dear Cauſe
of his Deſire to remain at <hi>Orleance.</hi> He therefore,
with a breaking Heart, conſents to go, nay, reſolves it,
though it ſhould be his Death: But, alas! he conſiders,
that this parting will not only prove the greateſt Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon Earth to him, but that <hi>Atlante</hi> will ſhare
in his Misfortunes alſo: This Thought gives him a
double Torment, and yet finds no way to evade it.</p>
                  <p>The Night that finiſhed this fatal Day, he goes again
to his wonted Station, the Window; where he had
not ſig'hd very long, but he ſaw <hi>Atlante</hi> enter the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony:
He was not able a great while to ſpeak to her,
or to utter one Word. The Night was light enough
to ſee him at the wonted place; and ſhe admires at his
Silence, and demands the Reaſon in ſuch obliging
Terms, as adds to his Grief; and he, with a deep
Sigh, replied, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rge me not, my fair</hi> Atlante, <hi>to ſpeak
lest by obeying you, I give you more cauſe of Grief, than
my Silence is capable of doing:</hi> And then ſighing again,
he held his Peace, and gave her leave to ask the Cauſe
of theſe laſt Words. But when he made no Reply,
but by ſighing, ſhe imagin'd it much worſe, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was; and with a trembling and fainting Voice,
ſhe cried, <hi>Oh!</hi> Rinaldo, <hi>give me leave to divine that
cruel News you are ſo unwilling to tell me: It is ſo,</hi> added
ſhe, <hi>you are deſtined to ſome more fortunate Maid than</hi>
Atlante: At this, Tears ſtopp'd her Speech, and ſhe
could utter no more. <hi>No, my dearest Charmer,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Rinaldo</hi> (elevating his Voice) <hi>if that were all, you
ſhould ſee with what Fortitude I would die, rather than
obey any ſuch Commands: I am vowed yours to the last
Moment of my Life; and will be yours in ſpight of all the
Oppoſition in the World; that Cruelty I could evade, but
cannot this that threatens me. Ah!</hi> cried <hi>Atlante, let
Fate do her worſt, ſo ſhe ſtill continue</hi> Rinaldo <hi>mine, and
keep that Faith he hath ſworn to me entire: What can ſhe
do beſide that can afflict me? She can ſeparate me,</hi> cried
he, <hi>for ſome time from</hi> Atlante. <hi>Oh!</hi> replied ſhe, <hi>all
Misfortunes fall ſo below that which I first imagined, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47213:239"/>
methinks I do not reſent this, as I ſhould otherwiſe have
done; but I know, when I have a little more conſidered it,
I ſhall even die with the Grief of it. Abſence being ſo
great an Enemy to Love, and makes us ſoon forget the
Object beloved: This, though I never experienced, I have
heard, and fear it may be my Fate.</hi> He then convinced
her Fear with a thouſand new Vows, and a thouſand
Imprecations of Conſtancy. She then asked him, <hi>If
their Loves were diſcovered, that he was with ſuch haſte to
depart?</hi> He told her, <hi>Nothing of that was the Cauſe; and
he could almost wiſh it were diſcovered, ſince he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
then refuſe to go: But it was only to cultivate his
Mind, more effectually than he could do here; 'twas the
Care of his Father to accompliſh him the more; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could not contradict it. But,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am not
ſent where Seas ſhall part us, nor vast diſtances of Earth,
but to</hi> Paris; <hi>from whence he might come in two Days to
ſee her again, and that he would expect from that Balco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that had gave him ſo many happy Moments, many
more when he ſhould come to ſee her.</hi> He beſought her to
ſend him away with all the Satisfaction ſhe could,
which ſhe could no otherwiſe do, than by giving him
new Aſſurances, that ſhe would never give away that
Right he had in her, to any other Lover: She vows
this with innumerable Tears; and is almoſt angry with
him for queſtioning her Faith. He tells her then he has
but one Night more to ſtay, and his Grief would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable,
if he ſhould not be able to take a better
Leave of her, than at a Window; and that, if ſhe
would give him leave, he would by a Rope or two
tied together, ſo as it may ſerve for Steps, aſcend her
Balcony; he not having time to provide a Ladder of
Ropes. She tells him, ſhe has ſo great a Confidence in
his Vertue and Love, that ſhe will refuſe him nothing,
though it would be a very bold venture for a Maid, to
truſt herſelf with a paſſionate young Man, in ſilence of
Night; and though ſhe did not exert a Vow from him
to ſecure her, ſhe expected he would have a Care of
her Honour. He ſwore to her, his Love was too Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
for ſo baſe an Attempt. There needed not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47213:239"/>
Vows to confirm her Faith; and it was agreed on
between them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he ſhould come the next Night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Chamber.</p>
                  <p>It happened that Night, as it often did, that Count
<hi>Vernole,</hi> lay with Monſieur <hi>De Pays,</hi> which was in a
Ground-Room, juſt under that of <hi>Atlante</hi>'s: And as
ſoon as ſhe knew all were in Bed, ſhe gave the Word
to <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> who was attending with the Impatience of
a paſſionate Lover below, under the Window; and,
who ſooner heard the Balcony open, but he aſcended
with ſome difficulty, and entered the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mber, where
he found <hi>Atlante</hi> tremble with Joy and Fear: He
throws himſelf at her Feet, as unable to ſpeak as ſhe;
who nothing but bluſhed and bent down her Eyes,
hardly daring to glance them towards the dear Object
of her Deſires, the Lord of all her Vows: She was
was aſhamed to ſee a Man in her Chamber, where yet
none had ever been alone, and by Night too. He ſaw
her Fear, and felt her Trembling; and after a thouſand
Sighs of Love had made way for Speech, he beſought
her to fear nothing from him; for his Flame was too
ſacred, and his Paſſion too holy to offer any thing, but
what Honour with Love might afford him. At laſt he
brought her to ſome Courage, and the Roſes of her fair
Cheeks aſſumed their wonted Colour, not bluſhing too
Red, nor languiſhing too Pale. But when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
began between them, it was the ſofteſt
in the World: They ſaid all that parting Lovers
could ſay, all that Wit and Tenderneſs could expreſs:
They exchanged their Vows a-new, and to confirm his,
he tied a Bracelet of Diamonds about her Arm; and
ſhe returned him one of her Hair, which he had long
begged, and ſhe had on purpoſe made, which claſped
together with Diamonds; this ſhe put about his Arm,
and he ſwore to carry it to his Grave. The Night was
very far ſpent in tender Vows, ſoft Sighs and Tears on
both ſides; and it was high time to part: But as if
Death had been to have arrived to them in that Minute,
they both linger'd away the time, like Lovers who had
forgot themſelves; and Day was near approaching,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:240"/>
when he bid farewel; which he repeated very often,
for ſtill he was interrupted by ſome commanding Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
from <hi>Atlante,</hi> and then loſt all his Power of going;
till ſhe, more couragious and careful of his Intereſt,
and her own Fame, forc'd him from her; and it was
happy ſhe did ſo; for he was no ſooner got over the
Balcony, and ſhe had flung him down his Rope, and
ſhut the Door, but <hi>Vernole,</hi> whom Love and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
kept waking, fancied ſeveral times he heard a
Noiſe in <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Chamber. And whether in paſſing
over the Balcony, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> made any noiſe or not, or
whether it were ſtill his jealous Fancy, he came up in
his Night-Gown, with a Piſtol in his Hand. <hi>Atlante</hi>
was not ſo much loſt in Grief, though ſhe were all in
Tears, but ſhe heard a Man come up, and imagined it
had been her Father, ſhe not knowing of Count <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>'s
lying in the Houſe that Night; if ſhe had, ſhe
poſſibly had taken more care to have been ſilent: But
whoever it was, ſhe could not get to Bed ſoon enough;
and therefore turn'd herſelf to her Dreſſing-table, where
Candle ſtood, and where lay a Book open of the Story
of <hi>Ariadne</hi> and <hi>Theſias.</hi> The Count turning the Latch,
entred halting into her Chamber, in his Night-Gown
clapped cloſe about him, which betrayed an ill-favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Shape, his Night-Cap on, without a Perriwig, which
diſcovered all his lean withered Jaws, his pale Face, and
his Eyes ſtaring; and making altogether ſo dreadful a
Figure, that <hi>Atlante,</hi> who no more dreamt of him than
of a Devil, had poſſibly have rather ſeen the laſt. She
gave a great Shriek, which frighted <hi>Vernole;</hi> ſo both
ſtood for a while ſtaring on each other, till both were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected:
He told her, the Care of her Honour had
brought him thither; and then rolling his ſmall Eyes
round the Chamber, to ſee if he could diſcover any
Body; he proceed and cried, <hi>Madam, if I had no other
Motive than your being up at this time of Night, or rather
of Day, I could eaſily gueſs how you have been entertained.
What Inſolence is this,</hi> ſaid ſhe, all in a Rage, <hi>when to
cover your Boldneſs of approaching my Chamber at this
Hour, you would queſtion how I have been entertained;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47213:240"/>
either explain yourſelf, or quit my Chamber; for I do not
uſe to ſee ſuch terrible Objects here. Poſſibly thoſe you do
ſee,</hi> ſaid the Count, <hi>are indeed more agreeable, but I am
afraid have not that regard to your Honour as I have.</hi> And
at that Word he ſtepped to the Balcony, opened it,
and looked out, but ſeeing no Body, he ſhut it too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
This enraged <hi>Atlante</hi> beyond all Patience; and
ſnatching the Piſtol out of his Hand, ſhe told him, <hi>He
deſerved to have it aimed at his Head, for having the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to queſtion her Honour, or her Conduct; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nded
him to avoid her Chamber as he loved his Life;</hi>
which ſhe believed he was fonder of than of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
She ſpeaking this in a Tone wholly tranſported
with Rage; and at the ſame time holding the Piſtol to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, made him tremble with Fear; and he now
found whether ſhe were guilty or not, it was his turn
to beg pardon: For you muſt know, however it came
to paſs, that his Jealouſie made him come up in that
force Poſture; at other times <hi>Vernole</hi> was the moſt
tame and paſſive Man in the World, and one who was
afraid of his own Shadow in the Night: He had a
natural Averſion for Danger, and thought it below a
Man of Wit, or common Senſe, to be guilty of that
brutal Thing, called Courage or Fighting: His Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
told him, <hi>It was ſafe ſleeping in a whole Skin;</hi>
and poſſibly he apprehended as much Danger from this
<hi>Virago,</hi> as ever he did from his own Sex; he therefore
fell on his Knees, and beſought her to hold her fair
Hand; and not to ſuffer that, which was the greateſt
Mark of his Reſpect, to be the Cauſe of her Hate or
Indignation. The pitiful Faces he made, and the Signs
of mortal Fear in him, had almoſt made her laugh, at
leaſt it allayed her Anger; and ſhe bid him riſe and
play the Fool hereafter ſome-where-elſe, and not in her
Preſence: Yet for once, ſhe would deign to give him
this Satisfaction; that ſhe was got into a Book, which
had many moving Stories very well writ; and that
ſhe found herſelf ſo well entertained, ſhe had forgot
how the Night paſſed. He moſt humbly thanked her
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47213:241"/>
for this Satisfaction, and retired, perhaps not ſo well
ſatisfied as he pretended.</p>
                  <p>After this, he appeared more ſubmiſſive and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
towards <hi>Atlante;</hi> and ſhe carried herſelf more reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and haughty towards him; which was one Reaſon,
he would not yet diſcover his Paſſion.</p>

                  <p>It was now that <hi>Atlante</hi> arrived to her fifteenth
Year, ſhone out with a Luſtre of Beauty greater than

carried herſelf with that Severity of Life, without the
youthful Deſire of going abroad, or deſiring any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
but what ſhe found in her own retired
Thoughts: That <hi>Vernole,</hi> wholly unable longer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
his Paſſion, reſolved to make a Publication of it,
firſt to the Father, and then to the lovely Daughter,
of whom he had ſome hope, becauſe ſhe had carried
herſelf very well towards him for this Year paſt;
which ſhe would never have done, if ſhe had imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
he would ever have been her Lover: She had ſeen
no Signs of any ſuch Misfortune towards her in theſe
many Years he had converſed with her, and ſhe had
to cauſe to fear him. When one Day her Father ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her into the Garden, told her what Honour and
Happineſs was in ſtore for her; and that now the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his fallen Family would riſe again, ſince ſhe had
a Lover of an illuſtrious Blood, allied to Monarchs;
and one whoſe Fortune was newly encreas'd to a very
conſiderable Degree, anſwerable to his Birth. She
changed Colour at this Diſcourſe, imagining but too
well, who this illuſtrious Lover was: When <hi>De Pais</hi>
proceeded, and told her, <hi>Indeed his Perſon was not the
most agreeable that ever was ſeen; but he married her to
Glory and Fortune, not the Man: And a Woman,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>ought to look no farther.</hi>

                  <p>She needed not any more to inform her, who this
intended Husband was; and, therefore burſting forth
into Tears, ſhe throws herſelf at his Feet, imploring
him not to uſe the Authority of a Father, to force her
to a thing ſo contrary to her Inclinations; aſſuring, ſhe
could not conſent to any ſuch thing; and that ſhe
would rather die than yield: She urged many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for this her Diſobedience. But none would paſs
for current with the old Gentleman, whoſe Pride had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47213:242"/>
ſlattered him with hopes of ſo conſiderable a Son-in-Law:
He was very much ſurprized at <hi>Atlante</hi>'s refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
what he believed ſhe would receive with Joy;
and finding that no Arguments on his ſide could draw
hers to an obedient Conſent, he grew to ſuch a Rage,
as very rarely poſſeſt him; vowing, if ſhe did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
her Will to his, he would abandon her to all the
Cruelty of Contempt and Poverty; ſo that at laſt ſhe
was forced to return him this Anſwer, <hi>That ſhe would
ſtrive all ſhe could with her Heart; but ſhe verily belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſhe ſhould never bring it to conſent to a Marriage
with Monſieur the Count.</hi> The Father continued threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her, and gave her ſome Days to conſider of it:
So leaving her in Tears, he returned to his Chamber,
to conſider what Anſwer he ſhould give Count <hi>Vernole,</hi>
whom he knew would be impatient to learn what Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
he had, and what himſelf was to hope: <hi>De Pais,</hi>
after ſome Conſideration, reſolved to tell him, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Offer very well; but, that he muſt expect
a little Maiden Nicety in the Caſe; and accordingly
did tell him ſo; and he was not at all doubtful of his
good Fortune.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Atlante,</hi> who reſolved to die a thouſand Deaths
rather than break her ſolemn Vows to <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> or to
marry the Count, caſt about how ſhe ſhould avoid it
with the leaſt Hazard of her Father's Rage. She found
<hi>Rinaldo</hi> the better and more advantageous Match of the
two, could they but get his Father's Conſent: He was
beautiful and young; his Title was equal to that of
<hi>Vernole,</hi> when his Father ſhould die; and his Eſtate
exceeded his; yet ſhe dares not make a Diſcovery, for
fear ſhe ſhould injure her Lover; who at this time,
though ſhe knew it not, lay ſick of a Fever, while ſhe
was wondering that he came not as he uſed to do:
However, ſhe reſolves to ſend him a Letter, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the Misfortune; which ſhe did in
theſe Terms:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">

                        <p>MY Father's Authority would force me to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

World, that I might ſhow you. I could even then
deſpiſe him for your ſake. My Father is already
too much inraged by my denial, to hear Reaſon

This Letter <hi>Rinaldo</hi> received; and there needed no
more to make him ſly to <hi>Orleance:</hi> This raiſed him
ſoon from his Bed of Sickneſs, and getting immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to hers, he arrived at his Father's Houſe; who did
not ſo much admire to ſee him, becauſe he heard he
was ſick of a Fever, and gave him leave to return, if
he pleas'd: He went directly to his Father's Houſe,
becauſe he knew ſomewhat of the Buſineſs; he was
reſolv'd to make his Paſſion known, as ſoon as he had
ſeen <hi>Atlante;</hi> from whom he was to take all his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
He therefore fail'd not, when all were in Bed,
to riſe and go from his Chamber, into the Street;
where finding a Light in <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Chamber, for ſhe
every Night expected him, he made the uſual Sign,
and ſhe went into the Balcony; and he having no
Conveniency of mounting up into it, they diſcours'd,
and ſaid all they had to ſay: From thence, ſhe tells
him of the Count's Paſſions, of her Father's Reſolution,
and her own, which was rather to die his than live
any body's elſe: And at laſt, as their laſt Refuge, they
reſolv'd to diſcover the whole Matter; ſhe to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and he to his, to ſee what Accommodation they
could make; if not, to die together. They parted at
this Reſolve, for ſhe would permit him no longer to ſtay
the Street, after ſuch a Sickneſs; ſo he went home to
Bed, but not to ſleep.</p>
                  <p>The next Day, at Dinner, <hi>Monſigniore Bellyuard</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
his Son abſolutely cur'd by Abſence of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and ſpeaking of all the News of the Town; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the reſt, told him, he was come in good time to
Dance at the Wedding of Count <hi>Vernole</hi> with <hi>Atlante,</hi>
the Match being agreed on: <hi>No, Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Rinaldo,
I ſhall never Dance at the Marriage of Count</hi> Vernole
<hi>with</hi> Atlante; <hi>and you will ſee in Monſieur</hi> De Pais'<hi>s Houſe
a Funeral ſooner than a Wedding:</hi> And thereupon, he
told his Father all his Paſſion, for that lovely Maid;
and aſſur'd him, if he would not ſee him laid in his
Grave, he muſt conſent to this Match: <hi>Bellyuard</hi> roſe
in a Fury, and told him, <hi>He had rather ſee him in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47213:243"/>
Grave, than in the Arms of</hi> Atlante: <hi>Not,</hi> continued he,
<hi>ſo much for any diſlike I have to the young Lady, or the
Smallneſs of her Fortune; but, becauſe I have ſo long warn'd
you from ſuch a Paſſion, and have with ſuch Care endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by your Abſence to prevent it.</hi> He traverſs'd the
Room very faſt, ſtill proteſting againſt this Alliance;
and was deaf to all <hi>Rinaldo</hi> could ſay: On the other
ſide, the Day being come, wherein <hi>Atlante</hi> was to
give her final Anſwer to her Father, concerning her
Marriage with Count <hi>Vernole:</hi> She aſſum'd all the
Courage and Reſolution ſhe could to withſtand the
Storm, that threaten'd a Denial. And her Father came
to her, and demanding her Anſwer; ſhe told him, <hi>She
could not be the Wife of</hi> Vernole, <hi>ſince ſhe was Wife to</hi>
Rinaldo, <hi>only Son to</hi> Bellyuard. If her Father ſtorm'd
before, he grew like a Man diſtracted at her Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and <hi>Vernole</hi> hearing them loud, ran to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to learn the Cauſe; where, juſt as he entered, he
found <hi>De Pais</hi>'s Sword drawn, and ready to kill his
Daughter, who lay all in Tears at his Feet, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
his Hand; and asking the Cauſe of this Rage, he
was told all that <hi>Atlante</hi> had confeſs'd; which put
<hi>Vernole</hi> quite beſide all his Gravity, and made him
diſcover the Infirmity of Anger; which he us'd to ſay,
ought to be diſſembled by all wiſe Men: So that <hi>De
Pais</hi> forgot his own to appeaſe his; but 'twas in vain,
for he went out of the Houſe, vowing Revenge on <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo:</hi>
And to that end, being not very well aſſur'd of
his own Courage, as I ſaid before, and being of the
Opinion, that no Man ought to expoſe his Life to him,
who has injur'd him: He hir'd <hi>Swiſs</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to attend him in the Nature of Footmen; and
watch'd ſeveral Nights about <hi>Bellyuard</hi>'s Door: And
that of <hi>De Pais,</hi> believing he ſhould ſometime or other
ſee him under the Window of <hi>Atlante,</hi> or perhaps
mounting in it; for now he no longer doubted, but
this happy Lover was he, whom he fancy'd he heard
go from the Balcony that Night, he came up with his
Piſtol; and being more a <hi>Spaniard</hi> than a <hi>French</hi> Man
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47213:244"/>
in his Nature, he reſolv'd to take him any way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded
or unarmed, if he came in his way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atlante,</hi> who heard his Threatnings, when he went
from her in a Rage, fear'd his Cowardize might put
him on ſome baſe Action, to deprive <hi>Rinaldo</hi> of his
Life; and therefore thought it not ſafe to ſuffer him
to come to her by Night, as he had before done; but
ſent him word in a Note, that he ſhould forbear her
Window, for <hi>Vernole</hi> had ſworn his Death: This Note
came unſeen by his Father to his Hands; but this could
not hinder him from coming to her Window, which
he did as ſoon as it was dark, he came thither, only
attended with his Vallet and two Footmen; for now
he cared not who knew the Secret: He had no ſooner
made the Sign, but he found himſelf incompaſs'd with
<hi>Vernole</hi>'s Bravoes; and himſelf ſtanding at a diſtance,
cry'd out, <hi>That he is:</hi> With that, they all drew on both
ſides, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> receiv'd a Wound in the Arm. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante</hi>
heard this, and ran crying out, <hi>That</hi> Rinaldo,
preſt by Numbers, <hi>would be kill'd. De Pais,</hi> who was
reading in his Cloſet, took his Sword, and ran out;
and contrary to all expectation, ſeeing <hi>Rinaldo</hi> fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his back to the Door, pull'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the
Houſe, and fought himſelf with the Bravoes. Who
being very much wounded by <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> gave ground
and ſheer'd off; and <hi>De Pais</hi> putting up old <hi>Billo</hi> into
the Scabbard, went into his Houſe, where he found
<hi>Rinaldo</hi> almoſt fainting with loſs of Blood, and <hi>Atlante</hi>
with her Maids binding up his Wound; to whom <hi>De
Pais</hi> ſaid, <hi>This Charity</hi> Atlante <hi>very well becomes you, and
is what I can allow you; and I could wiſh you had no other
Motive for this Action. Rinaldo</hi> by degrees recovered
of his Fainting, and as well as his Weakneſs would
permit him, he got up and made a low Reverence to
<hi>De Pais;</hi> telling him, <hi>He had now a double Obligation
to pay him all the Reſpect in the World; first, for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Father of</hi> Atlante; <hi>and ſecondly, for being the
Preſerver of his Life; two Tyes that ſhould eternally oblige
him to Love and Honour him, as his own Parent:</hi> De Pais
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47213:244"/>
reply'd, <hi>He had done nothing but what common Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
compelled him to: But if he would make good that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
he profeſs'd towards him, it must be in quitting all
Hopes of</hi> Atlante, <hi>whom he had deſtin'd to another, or to
an eternal Incloſure in a Monaſtery: He had another
Daughter, whom if he would think worthy of his regard,
he ſhould take his Alliance as a very great Honour; but
his Word and Reputation, nay, his Vows were past, to give</hi>
Atlante <hi>to Count</hi> Vernole. <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> who before he ſpoke,
took meaſure from <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Eyes; which told him,
her Heart was his; return'd this Anſwer to <hi>De Pais:
That he was infinitely glad to find by the Generoſity of his
Offer, that he had no Averſion to his being his Son-in-Law;
and that next to</hi> Atlante, <hi>the greatest Happineſs he
could wiſh would be, his receiving</hi> Charlot <hi>from his Hands,
but that he could not think of quitting</hi> Atlante, <hi>how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
ſoever it would be for Glory, and his—(the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
Repoſe. De Pais</hi> would not let him at this time,
argue the Matter further, ſeeing he was ill, and had
need of looking after; he therefore begg'd he would
for his Health's ſake retire to his own Houſe, whither
he himſelf conducted him; and left him to the Care of
his Men, who were eſcap'd the Fray; and return'd to
his own Chamber, he found <hi>Atlante</hi> retir'd, and ſo he
went to Bed full of Thoughts; this Night had increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Eſteem for <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> and leſſen'd it for Count
<hi>Vernole;</hi> but his Word and Honour being paſt, he
could not break it, neither with Safety nor Honour;
for he knew the haughty reſenting Nature of the Count,
and he fear'd ſome Danger might arrive to the brave
<hi>Rinaldo,</hi> which troubled him very much: At laſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd,
that neither might take any thing ill at his
Hands, to looſe <hi>Atlante,</hi> and ſend her to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
where her Siſter was, and compel her to be a
Nun. This he thought would prevent Miſchiefs on
both ſides; and accordingly, the next day (having in
the Morning ſent word to the Lady <hi>Abbeſs</hi> what he
would have done; he carries <hi>Atlante</hi> under pretence
of viſiting her Siſter, which they often did) to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47213:245"/>
where ſhe was no ſooner come, but ſhe was
led into the Incloſure: Her Father he had rather Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
her than ſhe ſhould be the Cauſe of the
Murther of two ſuch Noble Men as <hi>Vernole</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Noiſe of <hi>Atlante</hi>'s being inclos'd, was ſoon ſpread
all over the buſie Town, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> was not the laſt
to whom the News arriv'd: He was for a few Days
confin'd to his Chamber; where, when alone, he rav'd
like a Man diſtracted. But his Wounds had ſo incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Father againſt <hi>Atlante,</hi> that he ſwore he would
ſee his Son die of them, rather than ſuffer him to marry
<hi>Atlante;</hi> and was extreamly over-joyed, to find ſhe was
condemned for ever to the Monaſtery; ſo that the Son
thought it the wiſeſt Courſe, and the moſt for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his Love, to ſay nothing to contradict his
Father; but being almoſt aſſured <hi>Atlante</hi> would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſent to be ſhut up in a Cloyſter, and abandon
him, he flatter'd himſelf with hope, that he ſhould ſteal
her from thence, and marry her in ſpight of all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
This he was impatient to put in Practice: He
believed, if he were not permitted to ſee <hi>Atlante,</hi> he
had ſtill a kind Advocate in <hi>Charlot,</hi> who was now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to her Thirteenth Year, and infinitely advanc'd in
Wit and Beauty. <hi>Rinaldo</hi> therefore often goes to the
Monaſtery, ſurrounding it, to ſee what poſſibility there
was of accompliſhing his Deſign; if he could get her
Conſent, he finds it not impoſſible, and goes to viſit
<hi>Charlot;</hi> who had Command not to ſee him, or ſpeak
to him. This was a Cruelty he look'd not for, and
which gave him an unſpeakable Trouble, and without
her Aid it was wholly impoſſible to give <hi>Atlante</hi> any
Account of his Deſign. In this Perplexity he remain'd
many Days, in which he languiſh'd almoſt to Death;
he was diſtracted with Thought, and continually ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
about the Nunnery-Walls, in hope, at ſome
time or other, to ſee or hear from the lovely Maid,
who alone could make his Happineſs. In theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes
he often met <hi>Vernole,</hi> who had liberty to ſee her
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47213:245"/>
when he pleas'd: If it happen'd that they chanc'd to
meet in the Day-time, tho' <hi>Vernole</hi> were attended with
an Equipage of Ruffians, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> but only with a
couple of Footmen, he could perceive <hi>Vernole</hi> ſhun him,
grow pale, and almoſt tremble with Fear ſometimes,
and get to the other ſide of the Street; and if he did
not, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> having a mortal hate to him, would often
bear up cloſe to him, that he would joſtle him againſt
the Wall; which <hi>Vernole</hi> would patiently put up, and
paſs on; ſo that he could never be provok'd to fight by
Day-light, how ſolitary ſoever the place was where they
met: but if they chanc'd to meet at Night, they were
certain of a Skirmiſh, in which he would have no part
himſelf; ſo that <hi>Rinaldo</hi> was often like to be aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but ſtill came off with ſome ſlight Wound. This
continued ſo long, and made ſo great a Noiſe in the
Town, that the two Old Gentlemen were mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
by it; and Count <hi>Bellyuard</hi> came to <hi>De Pays,</hi>
one Day, to diſcourſe with him of this Affair; and
<hi>Bellyuard,</hi> for the Preſervation of his Son, as almoſt
conſenting, ſince there was no Remedy, that he ſhould
marry <hi>Atlante. De Pays</hi> confeſs'd the Honour he prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him, and how troubled he was, that his Word
was already paſt to his Friend, the Count <hi>Vernole,</hi> whom
he ſaid ſhe ſhould marry, or remain for ever a Nun;
but if <hi>Rinaldo</hi> could diſplace his Love from <hi>Atlante,</hi>
and place it on <hi>Charlot,</hi> ſhe ſhould gladly conſent to the
Match. <hi>Bellyuard,</hi> who would now do any thing for
the Repoſe of his Son, tho' he believ'd this Exchange
would not paſs, yet reſolv'd to propoſe it, ſince by
Marrying him, he took him out of the Danger of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>'s
Aſſaſſinates, who would never leave him, 'till they
had diſpatch'd him, ſhould he marry <hi>Atlante.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While <hi>Rinaldo</hi> was contriving a thouſand Ways to
come to ſpeak to, or ſend Billets to <hi>Atlante,</hi> none of
which would ſucceed without the Aid of <hi>Charlot,</hi> his
Father came and propoſed this Agreement between <hi>De
Pays,</hi> and himſelf, to his Son. At firſt <hi>Rinaldo</hi> receiv'd
it with chang'd Countenance, and a breaking Heart;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47213:246"/>
but ſwiftly turning from Thought to Thought, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
this the only way to come at <hi>Charlot,</hi> and ſo
conſequently at <hi>Atlante;</hi> he therefore, after ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
Regret, conſents, with a ſad put-on-Look:
And <hi>Charlot</hi> had Notice given her, to ſee and entertain
<hi>Rinaldo.</hi> As yet they had not told her the Reaſon;
which her Father would tell her, when he came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
her, he ſaid. <hi>Rinaldo</hi> over-joy'd at this Contrivance,
and his own Diſſimulation, goes to the Monaſtery, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits
<hi>Charlot;</hi> where he ought to have ſaid ſomething of
this Propoſition; but wholly bent upon other Thoughts,
he ſolicits her to convey ſome Letters, and Preſents to
<hi>Atlante;</hi> which ſhe readily did, to the unſpeakable Joy
of the poor Diſtreſt. Sometimes he would talk to
<hi>Charlot</hi> of her own Affairs; asking her, If ſhe reſolv'd
to become a Nun? To which ſhe would ſigh, and ſay,
If ſhe muſt, it would be extreamly againſt her Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and, if it pleaſed her Father, ſhe had rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the World with any tolerable Match.</p>
                  <p>Things paſt thus for ſome Days, in which our Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
were happy, and <hi>Vernole</hi> aſſured he ſhould have
<hi>Atlante.</hi> But at laſt <hi>De Pays</hi> came to viſit <hi>Charlot,</hi> who
asked her, if ſhe had ſeen <hi>Rinaldo?</hi> ſhe anſwered, She
had. <hi>And how does he entertain you?</hi> reply'd <hi>De Pays;
Have you received him as a Husband? and has he behaved
himſelf like one?</hi> At this a ſudden Joy ſeized the Heart
of <hi>Charlot;</hi> and loth to confeſs what ſhe had done for
him to her Siſter, ſhe hung down her bluſhing Face, to
ſtudy for an Anſwer. <hi>De Pays</hi> continued, and told her
the Agreement between <hi>Bellyuard</hi> and him, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Bloodſhed.</p>
                  <p>She, who bleſt the Cauſe, whatever it was, having
always a great Friendſhip and Tenderneſs for <hi>Rinaldo,</hi>
gave her Father a thouſand Thanks for his Care; and
aſſured him, ſince ſhe was commanded by him, ſhe
would receive him as her Husband.</p>
                  <p>And the next Day, when <hi>Rinaldo</hi> came to viſit her,
as he uſed to do, and bringing a Letter with him,
wherein he propoſed the ſight of <hi>Atlante:</hi> He found a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47213:246"/>
Coldneſs in <hi>Charlot,</hi> as ſoon as he told her his Deſign,
and deſired her to carry the Letter. He asked the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of this Change<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She tells him, ſhe was informed of
the Agreement between their two Fathers, and that ſhe
look'd upon herſelf as his Wife, and would act no
more as a Confident, that ſhe had ever a violent Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Friendſhip for him, which ſhe would ſoon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
into ſomething more ſoft.</p>
                  <p>He could not deny the Agreement, nor his Promiſe;
but it was in vain to tell her, he did it only to get a
Correſpondence with <hi>Atlante:</hi> She is obſtinate, and he
as preſſing, with all the Tenderneſs of Perſwaſion: He
vows he can never be any but <hi>Atlante</hi>'s; and ſhe may
ſee him die, but never break his Vows. She urges her
Claim in vain, ſo that at laſt ſhe was overcome, and
promiſed ſhe would carry the Letter; which was to
have her make her eſcape that Night. He waits at the
Grate for her Anſwer, and <hi>Charlot</hi> returns with one that
pleaſed him very well; that was, that Night her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
would make her eſcape, and that he muſt ſtand in
ſuch a place of the Nunnery-Wall, and ſhe would come
out to him.</p>
                  <p>After this ſhe upbraids him with his falſe Promiſe to
her, and of her Goodneſs to ſerve him after ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.
He receives her Reproaches with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Sighs, and bemoans his Misfortune in not being
capable of more than Friendſhip for her; and vows,
that next <hi>Atlante,</hi> he eſteems her of all Womenkind.
She ſeems to be obliged by this, and aſſured him, ſhe
would haſten the Flight of <hi>Atlante;</hi> and taking leave,
he went home to order a Coach, and ſome Servants to
aſſiſt him.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, Count <hi>Vernole</hi> came to viſit <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante;</hi>
but ſhe refuſed to be ſeen by him: And all he
could do there that Afternoon, was entertaining <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi>
at the Grate; to whom he ſpoke a great many fine
Things, both of her improved Beauty and Wit; and
how happy <hi>Rinaldo</hi> would be in ſo fair a Bride. She
received this with all the Civility that was due to his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47213:247"/>
Quality; and their Diſcourſe being at an end, he took
his leave, it being towards the Evening.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> wholly impatient, came betimes to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the dead Wall, where he was appointed to ſtand,
having ordered his Footmen and Coach to come to him
as ſoon as it was dark: While he was there walking
up and down, <hi>Vernole</hi> came by the end of the Wall to
go home, and looking about, he ſaw at the other end
<hi>Rinaldo</hi> walking, whoſe Back was towards him; but
he knew him well; and tho' he feared and dreaded his
Bus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neſs there, he durſt not encounter him, they being
both attended but by one Footman a piece. But <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>'s
Jealouſie and Indignation was ſo high, that he
reſolv'd to fetch his Bravoes to his Aid, and come and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
him; for he knew he waited there for ſome Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
from <hi>Atlante.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time it grew dark, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi>'s Coach
came with another Footman; which were hardly arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
when <hi>Vernole,</hi> with his aſſiſtance, came to the
Corner of the Wall, and ſcreening themſelves a little
behind it, near to the place where <hi>Rinaldo</hi> ſtood, who
waited now cloſe to a little Door, out of which the
Gardeners uſed to throw the Weeds and Dirt. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>
could perceive anon, the Door to open, and a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
come out of it, calling <hi>Rinaldo</hi> by his Name; who
ſtept up to her, and caught her in his Arms, with Signs
of infinite Joy. <hi>Vernole</hi> being now all Rage, cried to
his Aſſaſſinate, <hi>Fall on, and kill the Raviſher:</hi> And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
they all fell on. <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> who had only his
two Footmen on his ſide, was forced to let go the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
who would have run into the Garden again, but
the Door fell too, and lock'd; ſo that while <hi>Rinaldo</hi>
was fighting, and beaten back by the Bravoes, one of
which he laid dead at his Feet, <hi>Vernole</hi> came up to the
frighted Lady, and taking her by the Hand, cried,
<hi>Come, my fair Fugitive, you must along with me.</hi> She,
wholly ſcared out of her Senſes, was willing to go any
where out of the Terror ſhe heard ſo near her, and
without Reply, gave herſelf into his Hand; who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47213:247"/>
her directly to her Father's Houſe; where ſhe was
no ſooner come, but he told her Father all that had
paſt, and how ſhe was running away with <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> but
that his good Fortune brought him juſt in the lucky Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute.
Her Father turning to reproach her, found by
the Light of a Candle, that this was <hi>Charlot,</hi> and not
<hi>Atlante,</hi> whom <hi>Vernole</hi> had brought home: At which
<hi>Vernole</hi> was extreamly aſtoniſh'd. Her Father deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of her, Why ſhe was running away with a Man,
who was deſigned her by Conſent. <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charlot,
you had his Conſent, Sir, and that of his Father; but I
was far from getting it: I found he reſolved to die, rather
than quit</hi> Atlante; <hi>And promiſing him my aſſiſtance in
his Amour, ſince he could never be mine, he got me to carry
a Letter to</hi> Atlante; <hi>which was, to deſire her to fly away
with him. Inſtead of carrying her this Letter, I told her, he
was deſigned for me, and had cancelled all his Vows to her:
She ſwooned at this News; and being recovered a little, I
left her in the Hands of the Nuns, to perſwade her to
live; which ſhe reſolves not to do without</hi> Rinaldo.
<hi>Though they preſs'd me, yet I reſolved to purſue my Deſign,
which was to tell</hi> Rinaldo, <hi>ſhe would obey his kind Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
He waited for her; but I put myſelf into his Hands
in lieu of</hi> Atlante; <hi>and had not the Count received me,
we had been married by this time, by ſome falſe Light
that could not have diſcovered me: But I am ſatisfied, if
I had, he would never have lived with me longer than the
Cheat had been undiſcovered; for I find them both reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to die, rather than change: And for my part, Sir, I
was not ſo much in Love with</hi> Rinaldo, <hi>as I was out of
Love with a Nunnery; and took any Opportunity to quit
a Life abſolutely contrary to my Humour.</hi> She ſpoke
this with a Gaiety ſo brisk, and an Air ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that <hi>Vernole</hi> found it touch'd his Heart; and
the rather, becauſe he found <hi>Atlante</hi> would never be
his; or if ſhe were, he ſhould be ſtill in Danger from
the Reſentment of <hi>Rinaldo;</hi> he therefore bowing to
<hi>Charlot,</hi> and taking her by the Hand, cryed, <hi>Madam,
ſince Fortune has diſpos'd you thus luckily for me, in my
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47213:248"/>
Poſſeſſion, I humbly implore you would conſent ſhe ſhould
make me entirely happy, and give me the Prize for which
I fought, and have conquered with my Sword. My Lord,</hi>
replied <hi>Charlot,</hi> with a modeſt Air, <hi>I am ſuperſtitious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to believe, that ſince Fortune, ſo contrary to all our
Deſigns, has given me into your Hands, that ſhe from the
beginning doſtined me to the Honour; which, with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Conſent, I ſhall receive as becomes me. De Pais</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
with Joy, to find all things would be ſo well
brought about; it being all one to him, whether <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi>
or <hi>Atlante</hi> gave him Count <hi>Vernole</hi> for his Son-in-Law,
readily conſented; and immediately a Prieſt was
ſent for; and they were that Night married. And
it being now not above Seven a Clock, many of their
Friends were invited, the Muſick ſent for, and as
good a Supper as ſo ſhort a time would provide, was
made ready.</p>
                  <p>All this was performed in as ſhort a time as <hi>Rinaldo</hi>
was fighting; and having killed one, and wounded
the reſt, they all fled before his conquering Sword;
which was never drawn with ſo good a Will. When
he came where his Coach ſtood, juſt againſt the Back-Garden-Door,
he looked for his Miſtreſs: But the
Coachman told him, He was no ſooner engaged, but a
Man came, and with a thouſand Reproaches on her
Levity, bore her off.</p>
                  <p>This made our young Lover rave; and he is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
ſhe is in the Hands of his Rival; and that he had
been fighting, and ſhedding his Blood, only to ſecure
her Flight with him. He loſt all Patience; and it was
with much ado his Servants perſwaded him to return;
telling him, in their Opinion, ſhe was more likely to get
out of the Hands of his Rival, and come to him, than
when ſhe was in the Monaſtery.</p>
                  <p>He ſuffers himſelf to go into his Coach, and be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
home; but he was no ſooner alighted, but he heard
Muſick, and a Noiſe of Feſtival at <hi>De Pays</hi>'s Houſe.
He ſaw Coaches ſurround his Door, and Pages and
Footmen, with Flambeaus. This Sight and Noiſe of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47213:248"/>
Joy made him ready to ſink at the Door; and ſending
his Footman to learn the Cauſe of this Triumph; the
Pages that waited there, told him, That Count <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>
was, this Night, married to Monſieur <hi>De Pais</hi>'s
Daughter. He needed no more to deprive him of all
Senſe; and ſtaggering againſt his Coach, he was
caught by his Footmen, and carried into his Houſe,
and to his Chamber, where they put him to Bed, all
ſenſleſs as he was, and had much ado to recover him
to Life. He asked for his Father, with a faint Voice;
for he deſired to ſee him before he died. It was told
him, he was gone to Count <hi>Vernole</hi>'s Wedding, where
there was a perfect Peace agreed on between them, and
all Animoſities laid aſide. At this News <hi>Rinaldo</hi> faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again; and his Servants called his Father home, and
told him in what Condition they had brought home their
Maſter, recounting to him all that was paſt. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
to <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> whom he found juſt recovered of his
Swooning; who, putting his Hand out to his Father,
all cold, and trembling, cry'd, <hi>Well, Sir, now you are
ſatisfied, ſince you have ſeen</hi> Atlante <hi>married to Count</hi>
Vernole: <hi>I hope now you will give your unfortunate Son
leave to die; as you wiſh'd he ſhould, rather than give him
to the Arms of</hi> Atlante. Here his Speech failed, and he
fell again into a Fit of Swoooning: His Father ready
to die with Fear of his Son's Death, kneeled down by
his Bed-ſide; and after having recovered him a little,
he ſaid, <hi>My dear Son, I have been indeed at the Wedding
of Count</hi> Vernole; <hi>but 'tis not to</hi> Atlante, <hi>to whom he is
married, but</hi> Charlot; <hi>who was the Perſon you were bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Monaſtery, inſtead of</hi> Atlante; <hi>who is ſtill
reſerved for you, and is dying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>till ſhe hear you are reſerved
for her: Therefore, as you regard her Life, make much of
your own, and make your ſelf fit to receive her: For her
Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I have agreed the Marriage already.</hi> And
without giving him leave to thank him, he called to
one of his Gentlemen, and ſent him to the Monaſtery,
with this News to <hi>Atlante. Rinaldo</hi> bowed himſelf as
low as he could in his Bed, and kiſs'd the Hand of his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47213:249"/>
Father, with Tears of Joy: But his Weakneſs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
all next Day; and they were fain to bring <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante</hi>
to him, to confirm his Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>It muſt only be gueſſed by Lovers, the perfect Joy
theſe two received in the ſight of each other. <hi>Bellyuard</hi>
received her as his Daughter; and the next Day made
her ſo with very great Solemnity; at which were <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>
and <hi>Charlot:</hi> Between <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> and him, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
a perfect Peace, and all thought themſelves
happy in this double Union.</p>

                  <head>THE
COURT
OF THE
King of Bantam.</head>
                  <p>THIS <hi>Money,</hi> certainly, is a moſt
Dev'liſh Thing! I'm ſure, the want
of it had like to have ruin'd my dear
<hi>Philibella</hi> in her Love to <hi>Valentine
Goodland;</hi> who was, really, a pretty
deſerving Gentleman, Heir to about Fifteen-hundred
Pound a Year; which, however did
not ſo much recommend him, as <hi>the Sweetneſs of
his Temper, the Comelineſs of his Perſon,</hi> and <hi>the
Excellency of his Parts:</hi> In all which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
my obliging Acquaintance equall'd him,
unleſs in the advantage of their Fortune. Old
Sir <hi>George Goodland</hi> knew of his Son's Paſſion
for <hi>Philibella;</hi> and though he was Generous,
and of an Humour ſufficiently Complying, yet
he cou'd by no means think it convenient, that
his only Son ſhou'd marry with a young Lady
of ſo ſlender a Fortune as my Friend, who had
not above Five hundred Pound, and that the
Gift of her Uncle Sir <hi>Philip Friendly;</hi> though
her Vertue and Beauty might have deſerv'd and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47213:251"/>
have adorn'd the Throne of an <hi>Alexander</hi> or
<hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, indeed, was but a Younger
Brother, though of a Good Family, and of a
Generous Education; which with his <hi>Perſon,
Bravery</hi> and <hi>Wit,</hi> recommended him to his
Lady <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Widow of Sir <hi>Bartholomew
Banquier,</hi> who left her poſſeſs'd of Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> beſides Twenty thouſand
Pound in Money and Jewels; which oblig'd
him to get himſelf <hi>Dubb'd,</hi> that ſhe might not
deſcend to an <hi>inferior</hi> Quality. When he was in
Town, he liv'd—Let me ſee! in the <hi>Strand;</hi>
or, as near as I can remember, ſomewhere
about <hi>Charing-Croſs;</hi> where, firſt of all,
Mr. <hi>Wou'd be King,</hi> a Gentleman of a large
Eſtate in Houſes, Land and Money, of a <hi>ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ghty,
extravagant</hi> and <hi>profuſe Humour,</hi> very fond of
every new Face, had the misfortune to fall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately
in love with <hi>Philibella,</hi> who then liv'd
with her Uncle.</p>
                  <p>This Mr. <hi>Wou'd be</hi> (it ſeems) had often been
told, when he was yet a Stripling, either by one
of his <hi>Nurſes,</hi> by his own <hi>Grand-mother,</hi> or by
ſome other <hi>Gypſie,</hi> that he ſhou'd infallibly be
what his Sirname imply'd, <hi>a King,</hi> by <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
or <hi>Chance,</hi> e're he dy'd, or never. This
glorious <hi>Prophecy</hi> had ſo great an Influence on
all his Thoughts and Actions, that he diſtributed
and diſpers'd his Wealth ſometimes ſo largely,
that one wou'd ha' thought he had undoubtedly
been King of ſome part of the <hi>Indies;</hi> to ſee a
Preſent made, to day, of a <hi>Diamond-Ring,</hi> worth
Two or Three hundred Pound, to <hi>Madam Flip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant;</hi>
tomorrow, a large Cheſt of the fineſt <hi>China,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:251"/>
to <hi>my Lady Fleecewell;</hi> and next day (perhaps)
a rich <hi>Necklace of large Oriental Pearl,</hi> with a
<hi>Locquet</hi> to it of <hi>Saphires, Emeralds, Rubies,</hi> &amp;c.
to pretty <hi>Miſſ. Ogleme,</hi> for an Amorous Glance,
for a Smile, and (it may be, though but rarely)
for the mighty Bleſſing of one ſingle Kiſs.
But ſuch were his Largeſſes, not to reckon his
Treats, his Balls, and Serenades beſides, that
at the ſame time he had marry'd a Vertuous
Lady, and of Good Quality: but her Relation
to him (it may be fear'd) made her very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable:
For a Man of his Humour and Eſtate
can no more be ſatisfy'd with one Woman, than
with one Diſh of Meat: And, to ſay truth, 'tis
ſomething unmodiſh. However, he might ha'
dy'd a pure Celibate, and altogether unexpert
of Woman, had his good or bad hopes only
terminated in Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s Niece. But the <hi>Brave</hi>
and <hi>Haughty</hi> Mr. <hi>Wou'd be</hi> was not to be baulk'd
by <hi>Appearances</hi> of Virtue, which he thought all
Womankind did only affect; beſides, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
himſelf the Victory over any Lady whom
he attempted, by the force of his damn'd Money,
though her Virtue were never ſo real and
ſtrict.</p>
                  <p>With <hi>Philibella</hi> he found another pretty
young Creature, very like her, who had been
a <hi>quondam</hi> Miſtreſs to Sir <hi>Philip:</hi> He, with
young <hi>Goodland,</hi> was then diverting his Miſtreſs
and Niece at a Game of Cards, when <hi>Wou'd be</hi>
came to viſit him: he found 'em very merry,
with a Flaſque of Claret or two before 'em, and
Oranges roaſting by a large Fire, (for it was
<hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-time.) The Lady <hi>Friendly</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
that this Extraordinary Man was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:252"/>
with Sir <hi>Philip</hi> in the Parlour, came in to 'em,
to make the number of both Sexes equal, as
well as in hopes to make up a Purſe of Guinea's
toward the purchaſe of ſome new fine bus'neſs
that ſhe had in her head, from his accuſtom'd
Deſign of loſing at play to her. Indeed, ſhe
had part of her Wiſh; for ſhe got Twenty
Guinea's of him; <hi>Philibella,</hi> Ten; and <hi>Lucy,</hi>
Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s Quondam, Five: Not but that
<hi>Wou'd be</hi> intended better Fortune to the young
ones, than he did to Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s Lady; but her
Ladyſhip was utterly unwilling to give him
over to their Management, though at the laſt.
When they were all tir'd with the Cards, after
<hi>Wou'd be</hi> had ſaid as many obliging things as his
preſent Genius wou'd give him leave, to <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
and <hi>Lucy,</hi> eſpecially to the firſt, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
his Baiſemains to the Lady <hi>Friendly,</hi> he
bid the Knight and <hi>Goodland</hi> adieu; but with a
Promiſe of repeating his Viſit at ſix a clok in the
Evening o' <hi>Twelfth-day,</hi> to renew the famous and
ancient Solemnity of <hi>Chuſing King and Queen;</hi>
to which Sir <hi>Philip</hi> before invited him, with a
Deſign yet unknown to you, I hope.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as he was gone, every one made their
Remarks on him, but with very little or no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in all their figures of him. In ſhort,
<hi>all Mankind,</hi> had they ever known him, wou'd
have univerſally agreed in this his Character,
<hi>That he was an Original;</hi> ſince nothing in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi>
was ever ſo <hi>Vain,</hi> ſo <hi>Haughty,</hi> ſo <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe,</hi>
ſo <hi>Fond,</hi> and ſo <hi>ridiculouſly Ambitious</hi> as
<hi>Mr. Wou'd be King.</hi> They Laugh'd and Talk'd
about an hour longer, and then young <hi>Goodland</hi>
was oblig'd to ſee <hi>Lucy</hi> home in his Coach; tho'
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47213:252"/>
he had rather have ſate up all Night in the
ſame Houſe with <hi>Philibella,</hi> I fanſie, of whom
he took but an unwilling leave; which was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
enough to every one there, ſince they
were all acquainted with his Paſſion for my
Fair Friend.</p>
                  <p>About Twelve a' clock on the Day prefix'd,
young <hi>Goodland</hi> came to Dine with Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>
whom he found juſt return'd from Court, in a
very good Humour. On the ſight of <hi>Valentine,</hi>
the Knight ran to him, and embracing him,
told him, That he had prevented his Wiſhes,
in coming thither before he ſent for him, as he
had juſt then deſign'd. T'other return'd, That
he therefore hop'd he might be of ſome ſervice
to him, by ſo happy a prevention of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Kindneſs. No doubt, (reply'd Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>)
the Kindneſs, I hope, will be to us both; I am
aſſur'd it will, if you will act according to my
meaſures. I deſire no better Preſcriptions for
my Happineſs (return'd <hi>Valentine</hi>) than what
you ſhall pleaſe to ſet down to me: But is it
neceſſary or convenient that I ſhou'd know 'em
firſt? It is, (anſwer'd Sir <hi>Philip;</hi>) Let us ſit,
and you ſhall underſtand 'em.—I am very
ſenſible (continu'd he) of your ſincere and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Affection and Pretention to my Niece,
who, perhaps, is as dear to me as my own Child
cou'd be, had I one; nor am I ignorant how
averſe Sir <hi>George</hi> your Father is to your marriage
with her, inſomuch that I am confident he
would diſhinherit you immediately upon it,
meerly for want of a Fortune ſomewhat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to your Eſtate; but I have now
contriv'd the means to add Two or Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:253"/>
Pounds to the Five hundred I deſign'd to
give with her; I mean, if you marry her, <hi>Val.</hi>
not otherwiſe; for I will not labour ſo for any
other Man. What inviolable Obligations you
put upon me! (cry'd <hi>Goodland.</hi>) No Returns
by way of Complements, good <hi>Val.</hi> (ſaid the
Knight:) Had I not engag'd to my Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
marriage, that I wou'd not diſpoſe of
any part of what ſhe brought me, without her
conſent, I wou'd certainly make <hi>Philibella's</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
anſwerable to your Eſtate: And beſides,
my Wife is not yet full Eight and twenty, and
we may therefore expect Children of our own,
which hinders me from propoſing any thing
more for the advantage of my Niece:—But
now to my Inſtructions;—<hi>King</hi> will
be here this Evening, without fail, and, at ſome
time or other to night, will ſhew the Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Temper to you, I doubt not, ſince
you are in a manner a Stranger to him: Be ſure
therefore you ſeem to quarrel with him before
you part, but ſuffer as much as you can firſt
from his tongue; for I know he will give you
occaſions enough to exerciſe your paſſive Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:
I muſt appear his Friend; and you muſt
retire home, if you pleaſe, for this night, but
let me ſee you early as your convenience will
permit to morrow: My late Friend <hi>Lucy</hi> muſt
be my Niece too:—Obſerve this, and leave
the reſt to me. I ſhall moſt punctually, and
will in all things be directed by you, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
<hi>Valentine.</hi>) I had forgot to tell
you (ſaid <hi>Friendly</hi>) that I have ſo order'd
matters, that He muſt be <hi>King</hi> to Night, and

                  <p>Exactly at Six a' clock came <hi>Wou'd be</hi> in his
Coach and Six, and found Sir <hi>Philip</hi> and his
Lady, <hi>Goodland, Philibella</hi> and <hi>Lucy</hi> ready to
receive him; <hi>Lucy</hi> as Fine as a Dutcheſs, and
almoſt as Beautiful as ſhe was before her Fall.
All things were in ample Order for his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.
They Play'd till Supper was ſerv'd
in, which was between Eight and Nine. The
Treat was very ſeaſonable and ſplendid. Juſt
as the Second Courſe was ſet on the Table,
they were all on a ſudden ſurpriz'd, except
<hi>Wou'd be,</hi> with a Flouriſh of Violins, and other
Inſtruments, which proceeded to entertain 'em
with the beſt and neweſt Airs in the laſt new
Plays, being then in the Year 1683. The
Ladies were curious to know to whom they
ow'd this chearful part of their Entertainment:
On which he call'd out, Hey! <hi>Tom Farmer!
Aleworth! Eccles! Hall!</hi> and the reſt of you!
Here's a Health to theſe Ladies, and all this
Honourable Company. They Bow'd; He Drank,
and commanded another Glaſs to be fill'd, into
which he put ſomething yet better than the
<hi>Wine,</hi> I mean, Ten Guinea's: Here, <hi>Farmer,</hi>
(ſaid he then;) This for you and your Friends.
We humbly thank the Honourable Mr. <hi>Wou'd be
King.</hi> They all return'd, and ſtruck up with
more ſpritelyneſs than before. For <hi>Gold</hi> and
<hi>Wine,</hi> doubtleſs, are the beſt Roſin for Muſicians.</p>
                  <p>After Supper, they took a hearty Glaſs or
two to the King, Queen, Duke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then
the mighty <hi>Cake,</hi> Teeming with the Fate of
this Extraordinary Perſonage was brought in,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:254"/>
the Muſicians playing an <hi>Overture</hi> at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the <hi>Alimental Oracle;</hi> which was then
Cut and Conſulted, and the Royal <hi>Bean</hi> and
<hi>Pea</hi> fell to thoſe to whom Sir <hi>Philip</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
'em. 'Twas then the Knight began a
merry Bumper, with Three Huzza's, and,
<hi>Long live King Wou'd be!</hi> to <hi>Goodland;</hi> who
Echo'd, and Pledg'd him, putting the Glaſs
about to the Harmonious Attendants: while
the Ladies drank their own quantities, among
themſelves, <hi>To his aforeſaid Majeſty.</hi> Then of
courſe, you may believe, <hi>Queen Lucy</hi>'s Health
went merrily round, with the ſame Ceremony.
After which, he ſaluted his Royal <hi>Conſort,</hi>
and condeſcended to do the ſame Honour to
the two other Ladies.</p>
                  <p>Then they fell a Dancing like Lightning;
I mean, they mov'd as ſwift, and made <hi>almoſt</hi>
as little Noiſe: But His <hi>Majeſty</hi> was ſoon weary
of that; for he long'd to be making Love
both to <hi>Philibella</hi> and <hi>Lucy,</hi> who (believe me)
that Night might well enough have paſs'd for
a Queen.</p>
                  <p>They fell then to <hi>Queſtions and Commands;</hi>
to <hi>Croſs Purpoſes; I Think a Thought, What is
it like?</hi> &amp;c. In all which, His <hi>Wou'd be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
took the opportunity of ſhewing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of his Parts, as, How Fit he was to
Govern; How Dexterous at Mining and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining;
and, How he cou'd Reconcile the
moſt Contrary and Diſtant Thoughts. The
Muſick, at laſt, good as it was, grew trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
and too loud; which made him diſmiſs
'em: And then he began to this effect, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
himſelf to <hi>Philibella;</hi> Madam, had Fortune
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:254"/>
been Juſt, and were it poſſible that the World
ſhou'd be Govern'd and Influenc'd by Two
Suns, undoubtedly we had all been Subjects to
you, from this Night's Chance, as well as to
that Lady, who, indeed, alone can Equal you
in the Empire of Beauty, which yet you ſhare
with Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> here preſent, who only cou'd
diſpute it with you, and is only Superior to you
in <hi>Title.</hi> My Wife is infinitely oblig'd to your
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> (interrupted Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>) who, in my
opinion, has greater Charms, and more than
both of 'em together. You ought to <hi>think</hi> ſo,
Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> (return'd the New Dubb'd <hi>King;</hi>)
However, you ſhou'd not ſo liberally have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
your ſelf, in Oppoſition and Deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Majeſty:</hi>—Let me tell you, 'tis a
ſawcy Boldneſs that thus has loos'd your Tongue!
—What think you, young Kinſman and
Counſellor? (ſaid he to <hi>Goodland.</hi>) With all
Reſpect due to your Sacred Title, (return'd
<hi>Valentine,</hi> riſing and bowing,) Sir <hi>Philip</hi> ſpoke as
became a truly affectionate Husband; and it
had been Preſumption in him, unpardonable,
to have ſeem'd to preferr her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> or that
other ſweet Lady, in his Thoughts, ſince your
<hi>Majeſty</hi> has been pleas'd to ſay ſo much and ſo
particularly of their Merits: 'Twou'd appear
as if he durſt lift up his Eyes, with Thoughts,
too near the Heaven you only wou'd enjoy.
And only can <hi>deſerve,</hi> you ſhou'd have added,
(ſaid <hi>King,</hi> no longer <hi>Wou'd be.</hi>) How! May
it pleaſe your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> (cry'd <hi>Friendly,</hi>) Both
my Nieces! Though you deſerve Ten thouſand
more, and better, wou'd your <hi>Majeſty</hi> enjoy
'em Both? Are they then Both your Nieces?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47213:255"/>
(ask'd Chance's <hi>King.</hi>) Yes; Both, Sir, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
the Knight;) Her <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s the Eldeſt,
and in <hi>that</hi> Fortune has ſhewn ſome Juſtice.
So ſhe has, (reply'd the Titular <hi>Monarch;</hi>) My
Lot is fair, (purſu'd he,) though I can be bleſt
but with One:
<q>
                        <l>Let Majeſty with Majeſty be join'd,</l>
                        <l>To 'get and leave a Race of Kings behind.</l>
                     </q>
Come, Madam, (continu'd he, kiſſing <hi>Lucy:</hi>)
This, as an Earneſt of our future Endeavours.
I fear (return'd the pretty <hi>Queen</hi>) your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
will forget the unhappy <hi>Statira,</hi> when you
return to the Embraces of your Dear and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Roxana.</hi> There is none Beautiful but you,
(reply'd the Titular <hi>King,</hi>) unleſs this Lady,
to whom I yet cou'd pay my Vows moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly,
were't not that Fortune thus has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engag'd
me: But, Madam, (continu'd he,) to
ſhew that ſtill you hold our Royal Favour, and
that, next to our Royal <hi>Conſort,</hi> we Eſteem you,
we greet you thus, (kiſſing <hi>Philibella;</hi>) And,
as a Signal of our continued Love, wear this
rich Diamond: (here he put a Diamond-Ring
on her Finger, worth Three hundred Pounds.)
Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> (purſu'd he to <hi>Lucy</hi>) may pleaſe
to wear this Necklace, with this Locket of
Emeralds. Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> is Bounteous as
a God! (ſaid <hi>Valentine.</hi>) Art thou in want,
young Spark? (ask'd the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi>) I'll
give thee an Eſtate ſhall make thee merit the
Miſtreſs of thy Vows, be ſhe who ſhe will.
That is, my other Niece, Sir, (cry'd <hi>Friendly.</hi>)
How! How! Preſumptuous Youth! How are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47213:255"/>
thy Eyes and Thoughts exalted? Ha! To
Bliſs your <hi>Majeſty</hi> muſt never hope for, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Goodland.</hi>) How now, thou Creature
of the baſeſt Mold! Not hope for what thou
doſt aſpire to! <hi>Mock-King,</hi> thou canſt not,
dar'ſt not, ſhall not hope it, (return'd <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
in a Heat.) Hold, <hi>Val.</hi> (cry'd Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>)
you grow warm; forget your Duty to Their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties,</hi>
and abuſe your Friends, by making us
ſuſpected. Good-night, Dear <hi>Philibella,</hi> and
my <hi>Queen!</hi> Madam, I am your Ladyſhip's
Servant, (ſaid <hi>Goodland:</hi>) Farewell, Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>
Adieu, thou <hi>Pageant!</hi> thou <hi>Property-King!</hi>
I ſhall ſee thy Brother on the Stage, e're long;
but firſt I'll viſit <hi>Thee;</hi> and in the mean time,
by way of return to thy proffer'd Eſtate, I
will add a real Territory to the reſt of thy
empty Titles; for, from thy Education, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
manner of Converſation, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
I think, I may juſtly proclaim thee,
<hi>King of Bantam:</hi>—So, <hi>Hail, King that
Wou'd be! Hail, thou King of Chriſtmas! All
Hail, Wou'd be King of Bantam!</hi>—And ſo
he left 'em.—They all ſeem'd amaz'd,
and gaz'd on one another, without ſpeaking a
ſyllable; till Sir <hi>Philip</hi> broke the Charm, and
ſigh'd out, Oh, the monſtrous effects of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion!
Say rather, Oh, the fooliſh effects of a
mean Education! (interrupted his <hi>Majeſty of
Bantam;</hi>) For Paſſions were given us for Uſe,
Reaſon to govern and direct us in the Uſe, and
Education to cultivate and refine that Reaſon:
But (purſu'd he) for all his Impudence to me,
which I ſhall take a time to correct, I am oblig'd
to him, that at laſt he has found me out a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47213:256"/>
to my Title; and if I were Monarch of
that Place, (Believe me, Ladies,) I wou'd make
you all Princeſſes and Dutcheſſes; and Thou,
my old Companion, <hi>Friendly!</hi> ſhould'ſt Rule
the Roaſt with me: But theſe Ladies ſhou'd be
with us there; where we would erect Temples
and Altars to 'em: Build Golden Palaces of
Love, and Caſtles—In the Air (interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her Majeſty <hi>Lucy</hi> the Firſt, ſmiling.) 'Gad
take me, (cry'd King <hi>Woud be,</hi>) thou dear
Part'ner of my Greatneſs, and ſhalt be, of all
my Pleaſures! thy pretty ſatyrical Obſervation
has oblig'd me beyond Imitation. I think your
Majeſty is got into a vein of Rhiming to night,
(ſaid <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>) Ay! Pox o' that young
inſipid Fop, we cou'd elſe have been as Great as
an Emperor of <hi>China,</hi> and as Witty as <hi>Horace</hi>
in his Wine; but let him go, like a pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
captious, giddy Fool as he is! I ſhall take
a time to ſee him. Nay, Sir, (ſaid <hi>Philibella,</hi>)
he has promis'd your Majeſty a Viſit, in our
hearing: Come, Sir, I beg your Majeſty to
pledge me this Glaſs to your Long and Happy
Reign; laying aſide all thoughts of ungovern'd
Youth: Beſides, this Diſcourſe muſt needs be
ungreatful to her Majeſty, to whom, I fear, he
will be marry'd within this Month. How!
(cry'd <hi>King and no King,</hi>) Marry'd to my <hi>Queen!</hi>
I muſt not, cannot ſuffer it! Pray reſtrain
your ſelf a little, Sir, (ſaid Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>) and
when once theſe Ladies have left us, I will
diſcourſe your Majeſty further about this
Buſineſs. Well, Pray, Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> (ſaid his
Lady,) let not your Worſhip be pleas'd to ſit
up too long for his Majeſty: About Five o'clock
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47213:256"/>
I ſhall expect you: 'Tis your old Hour. And
yours, Madam, to wake, to receive me coming
to Bed:—Your Ladyſhip underſtands me,
(return'd <hi>Friendly.</hi>) You're merry, my Love,
you're merry, (cry'd <hi>Philadelphia:</hi>) Come,
Niece, to Bed! to Bed! Ay, (ſaid the Knight,)
Go both of you and ſleep together, if you can,
without the thoughts of a Lover, or a Husband.
His Majeſty was pleas'd to wiſh 'em a good
Repoſe; and ſo, with a Kiſs, they parted for
that time.</p>
                  <p>Now we're alone, (ſaid Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>) let me
aſſure you, Sir, I reſent this Affront done
to you by Mr. <hi>Goodland,</hi> almoſt as highly as
you can; and though I can't wiſh that you
ſhou'd take ſuch Satisfaction as, perhaps, ſome
other hotter Sparks wou'd; yet let me ſay, his
Miſcarriage ought not to go unpuniſh'd in him.
Fear not, (reply'd t'other,) I ſhall give him a
ſharp Leſſon. No, Sir, (return'd <hi>Friendly,</hi>)
I wou'd not have you think of a Bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
for 'tis that which, poſſibly, he deſigns
on you: I know him Brave as any Man: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
were it convenient that the Sword ſhou'd
determine betwixt you, you ſhou'd not want
mine: The Affront is partly to me, ſince done
in my Houſe: But I've already laid down ſafer
meaſures for us, though of more fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to him; that is, I've form'd 'em in my
Thoughts: Diſmiſs your Coach and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
all but one Servant, and I will diſcourſe
it to you at large: 'Tis now paſt Twelve;
and, if you pleaſe, I wou'd invite you to take
up as eaſie a Lodging here, as my Houſe will
afford. (Accordingly they were diſmiſs'd, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47213:257"/>
he proceeded:)—As I hinted to you before, he
is in love with my youngeſt Niece, <hi>Philibella;</hi> but
her Fortune not exceeding Five hundred Pound,
his Father will aſſuredly diſinherit him, if he
marries her; though he has given his Conſent
that he ſhou'd marry her Eldeſt Siſter, whoſe
Father dying e're he knew his Wife was with
Child of the Youngeſt, left <hi>Lucy</hi> Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds, being as much as he thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to match her handſomly; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
the Nuptials of Young <hi>Goodland</hi> and
<hi>Lucy</hi> are to be celebrated next <hi>Eaſter.</hi> They
ſhall not, if I can hinder 'em, (interrupted his
offended <hi>Majeſty.</hi>) Never endeavour the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
(ſaid the Knight,) for I'll ſhew you
the way to a dearer Vengeance: <hi>Women</hi> are
<hi>Women,</hi> your Majeſty knows; ſhe may be won
to your Embraces before that time, and then
you antedate him, <hi>your Creature.</hi> A Cuckold,
you mean, (cry'd <hi>King in Fanſie;</hi>) O Exquiſite
Revenge! But can you conſent that I ſhou'd at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it? What is't to me? we live not in
<hi>Spain,</hi> where all the Male Relations of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
are oblig'd to vindicate a Whore; No, I
wou'd wound him in his moſt Tender Part.
But how ſhall we compaſs it? (ask'd t'other.)
Why thus; Throw away Three thouſand
Pounds on the Youngeſt Siſter, as a Portion,
to make her as happy as ſhe can be in her new
Lover Sir <hi>Frederick Flygold,</hi> an Extravagant
young Fop, and wholly given over to Gaming;
ſo, ten to one, but you may retrieve your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of him, and have the two Siſters at your
devotion. Oh, Thou my better Genius than
that which was given to me by Heav'n at my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47213:257"/>
birth! What Thanks, what Praiſes ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and ſing to Thee, for this! (cry'd King
<hi>Conundrum.</hi>) No Thanks, no Praiſes, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
your Majeſty; ſince in this I gratifie my
ſelfe—You think I am your Friend? And,
you will agree to this? (ſaid <hi>Friendly,</hi> by way
of Queſtion.) Moſt readily, (return'd the <hi>Fop-King;</hi>)
Wou'd it were broad-Day, that I
might ſend for the Money to my Bankers; for
in all my Life, in all my Frolicks, Encounters
and Extravagancies, I never had one ſo grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and pleaſant as this will be, if you are in
earneſt, to gratifie both my Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge!
That I am in earneſt, you will not
doubt, when you ſee with what Application
I ſhall purſue my Deſign: In the mean time,
<hi>My Duty to your Majeſty; To our good Succeſs
in this Affair.</hi> While he drank, t'other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
<hi>With all my Heart;</hi> and pledg'd him.
Then <hi>Friendly</hi> began afreſh;—Leave the whole
Management of this to me; only one thing more
I think neceſſary, that you make a Preſent of
Five hundred Guinea's to Her Majeſty, the
Bride that muſt be. By all means, (return'd the
wealthy <hi>King of Bantam;</hi>) I had ſo deſign'd
before. Well, Sir, (ſaid Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>) what
think you of a Sett Party or two at <hi>Piquet,</hi> to
paſs away ſome few hours, till we can ſleep?
A ſeaſonable and welcome Propoſition, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
that <hi>King;</hi>) but I won't play above
Twenty Guinea's the Game, and Forty the
Lurch. Agreed, (ſaid <hi>Friendly;</hi>) Firſt call
in your Servant; mine is here already. The
Slave came in, and they began, with unequal
fortune at firſt; for the <hi>Knight</hi> had loſt an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47213:258"/>
Guinea's to <hi>Majeſty;</hi> which he paid in
<hi>Specie;</hi> and then propos'd Fifty Guinea's the
Game, and an Hundred the Lurch. To which
t'other conſented; and without winning more
than three Games, and thoſe not together,
made ſhift to get Three thouſand two hundred
Guinea's in debt to Sir <hi>Philip:</hi> For which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
was pleas'd to give him Bond, whether
<hi>Friendly</hi> wou'd or no, <hi>Seal'd and Deliver'd in
the Preſence of</hi>

                     </q>
A Couple of delicate Beagles, their mighty At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants.</p>
                  <p>It was then about the hour that Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s
(and, it may be, other Ladies) began to Yawn
and Stretch; when the Spirits Refreſh'd, Troul'd
about and Tickl'd the Blood with Deſires of
Action; which made <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> think
of a Retreat to Bed; where, in leſs than Half
an hour, or, before ever he could ſay his
Prayers, I'm ſure, the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but the laſt, perhaps, paid his accuſtom'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
e're he began his Progreſs to the <hi>Shadow
of Death:</hi> However, he wak'd earlier than
his <hi>Cully-Majeſty,</hi> and got up to receive young
<hi>Goodland,</hi> who came to his Word, with the
firſt Opportunity. Sir <hi>Philip</hi> receiv'd him
with more than uſual Joy, though not with
greater Kindneſs, and let him know every Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
and Accident that had paſs'd between 'em
till they went to bed: which you may believe
was not a little pleaſantly ſurpriſing to <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:47213:258"/>
who began then to have ſome Aſſurance of
his Happineſs with <hi>Philibella.</hi> His Friend told
him, that he muſt now be reconcil'd to his
<hi>Mock-Majeſty,</hi> though with ſome difficulty;
and ſo taking one hearty Glaſs a piece<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he left
<hi>Valentine</hi> in the Parlour, to carry the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
News of his Viſit to him that Morning.
<hi>King</hi>—was in an odd ſort of Taking, when he
heard that <hi>Valentine</hi> was Below; and had been,
as Sir <hi>Philip</hi> inform'd <hi>Majeſty,</hi> at <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
to enquire for him there: but when he
told him, that he had already ſchool'd him,
on his own behalf, for the Affront done in his
Houſe, and that he believ'd he cou'd bring
his Majeſty off without any loſs of preſent Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
his Countenance viſibly diſcover'd his
paſt Fear, and preſent Satisfaction; which was
much encreas'd too, when <hi>Friendly,</hi> ſhewing
him his Bond for the Money he won of him at
Play, let him know, that if he paid Three
thouſand Guinea's to <hi>Philibella,</hi> he wou'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
deliver him up his Bond, and not
expect the Two hundred Guinea's Over-plus.
His <hi>Majeſty of Bantam</hi> was then in ſo good an
humour, that he cou'd have made love to
Sir <hi>Philip;</hi> nay, I believe he cou'd a kiſs'd <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine,</hi>
inſtead of ſeeming angry. Down they
came, and ſaluted like Gentlemen: But after
the Greeting was over, <hi>Goodland</hi> began to talk
ſomething of <hi>Affront, Satisfaction, Honour,</hi> &amp;c.
when immediately <hi>Friendly</hi> interpos'd, and after
a little ſeeming Uneaſineſs and Reluctancy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
the Hot and Cholerick Youth to the

Madam <hi>Tattlemore,</hi> Miſs <hi>Medler,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Gingerly</hi>
a rich Grocer's Wife, and ſome others, beſides
Knights and Gentlemen of as good humours as

I think, was the firſt he ſpoke to in
Court, and whom firſt he ſurpriz'd with the
happy News of his Advancement to the Title
of <hi>King of Bantam.</hi> How wondrous haſty was
ſhe to be gone, as ſoon as ſhe heard it! 'Twas
not in her Power, becauſe not in her Nature,
to ſtay long enough to take a civil Leave of the
Company, but away ſhe flew, big with the
Empty Title of a Fantaſtick <hi>King,</hi> proclaiming
it to every one of her Acquaintance, as ſhe
paſs'd through every Room, till ſhe came to
the <hi>Preſence-Chamber,</hi> where ſhe only <hi>whiſper</hi>'d
it; but her Whiſpers made above half the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Company quit the Preſence of the

King Charles the Second</hi> ever ſent any Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
to Complement him; though, poſſibly,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47213:259"/>
He ſaluted him by his Title, the firſt time he
ſaw him afterwards: For, you know, <hi>He is
a wonderful Good-natur'd and a Well-bred Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After he thought the Court of <hi>England</hi> was
univerſally acquainted with his <hi>mighty Honour,</hi>
he was pleas'd to think fit to retire to his own
more private Palace, with Sir <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
whom he Entertain'd that night very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly,
till about Seven a clock; when they went
together to the <hi>Play,</hi> which was, that Night,
<hi>A King and No King.</hi> His Attendant-Friends
cou'd not forbear ſmiling, to think how aptly
the Title of the <hi>Play</hi> ſuited his Circumſtances.
Nor cou'd he chuſe but take notice of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Scenes, between Jeſt and Earneſt; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Players how kind <hi>Fortune</hi> had been
the Night paſt, in diſpoſing the <hi>Bean</hi> to him;
and juſtifying what one of her Propheteſſes
had foretold, ſome Years ſince: I ſhall now no
more regard (ſaid he) that old Doating Fellow
<hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Saying, <hi>Abſtineto à Fabis;</hi> That is,
(added he, by way of Conſtruction,) <hi>Abſtain
from Beans:</hi> For, I find the Excellency of 'em
in Cakes and Diſhes: From the firſt, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
the Soul with mighty Thoughts; and from
the laſt, our Bodies receive a ſtrong and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
Nouriſhment. That is, (ſaid a Wag
among thoſe ſharp Youths, I think 'twas my
Friend the <hi>Count;</hi>) Theſe Puff you up in
<hi>Mind,</hi> Sir; Thoſe, in <hi>Body.</hi> They had ſome
further Diſcourſe among the Nymphs of the
Stage, e're they went into the Pit; where
Sir <hi>Philip</hi> ſpread the News of his Friend's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
to the <hi>Title,</hi> tho' not yet to the <hi>Throne</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47213:260"/>
of <hi>Bantam;</hi> upon which he was there again
Complemented on that Occaſion. Several of
the Ladies and Gentlemen who ſaluted him,
he invited to the next Night's Ball at his
Palace.</p>
                  <p>The Play done, they took each of 'em a
Bottle at the <hi>Roſe,</hi> and parted till Seven the
Night following: which came not ſooner than
deſired; for he had taken ſuch care, that all
things were in readineſs before Eight, only he
was to expect the Muſick, till the end of the
Play. About Nine, Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> his Lady, <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Philibella</hi> and <hi>Lucy</hi> came. Sir <hi>Philip</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
him <hi>Rabelais,</hi> which he had borrow'd of
him, wherein the Knight had written, in an
old odd ſort of Character, this <hi>Prophecy</hi> of his
own making; with which he ſurpriz'd the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of Bantam,</hi> who vow'd he had never taken
notice of 'em before; but he ſaid, he perceiv'd
they had been long written, by the Character;
and here it follows, as near as I can remember:
<q>
                        <l>When M. D. C. come L before,</l>
                        <l>Three XXX<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. two II<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. &amp; one I more;</l>
                        <l>Then, <hi>KING,</hi> tho' <hi>now</hi> but <hi>Name</hi> to thee,</l>
                        <l>Shall both thy <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> be.</l>
                     </q>
They had hardly made an end of reading 'em,
e're the whole Company, and more than he
had invited, came in, and were receiv'd with
a great deal of Formality and Magnificence
<hi>Lucy</hi> was there attended as his <hi>Queen;</hi> and
<hi>Philibella,</hi> as the <hi>Princeſs</hi> her Siſter. They
Danc'd then till they were weary; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47213:260"/>
retir'd to another large Room, where
they found the Tables ſpread and furniſh'd with
all the moſt ſeaſonable Cold Meats; which was
ſucceeded by the choiceſt Fruits and the richeſt
Diſert of Sweet-meats that Luxury cou'd think
on, or, at leaſt, that this Town cou'd afford.
The Wines were all moſt excellent in their
kind; and their Spirits flew about through
every corner of the Houſe: There was ſcarce
a Spark ſober in the whole Company, with
drinking repeated Glaſſes to the Health of the
<hi>King of Bantam</hi> and his <hi>Royal Conſort,</hi> with the
Princeſs <hi>Philibella</hi>'s, who ſate together under a
Royal Canopy of State, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> between the
two Beautiful Siſters: only <hi>Friendly</hi> and <hi>Goodland</hi>
wiſely manag'd that Part of the Engagement
where they were concern'd, and preſerv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Heat of the Debauch.</p>
                  <p>Between Three and Four moſt of 'em began
to draw off, laden with Fruit and Sweet-meats,
and rich <hi>Favours</hi> compos'd of Yellow, Green,
Red and White, the <hi>Colours of his New Majeſty
of Bantam.</hi> Before Five they were left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
when the Lady <hi>Friendly</hi> was diſcompos'd,
for want of Sleep, and her <hi>uſual Cordial;</hi> which
oblig'd Sir <hi>Philip</hi> to wait on her home, with
his two Nieces: But his <hi>Majeſty</hi> wou'd by no
means part with <hi>Goodland;</hi> whom, before Nine
that Morning, he made as Drunk as a Lord,
and by conſequence one of his <hi>Peers;</hi> for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
was then, indeed, as Great as an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror:
He fancy'd himſelf <hi>Alexander,</hi> and young
<hi>Valentine</hi> his <hi>Hephaeſtion;</hi> and did ſo <hi>Be-buſs</hi> him,
that the young Gentleman fear'd he was faln
into the hands of an <hi>Italian.</hi> However, by the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47213:261"/>
kind Perſuaſions of his Condeſcending and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> he ventur'd to go into Bed
with him; where <hi>King Wou'd be</hi> fell aſleep,
<hi>hand-over-head;</hi> and not long after, <hi>Goodland,</hi>
his new made <hi>Peer,</hi> follow'd him to the cool
Retreats of <hi>Morpheus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About Three the next afternoon they both
Wak'd, as by conſent, and call'd to Dreſs.
And after that bus'neſs was over, I think, they
ſwallow'd each of 'em a Pint of <hi>Old-Hook,</hi> with
a little Sugar, by the way of Healing. Their
Coaches were got ready in the mean time; but
the <hi>Peer</hi> was forc'd to accept of the Honour of
being carry'd in his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s to Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s;
whom they found juſt riſen from Dinner, with
<hi>Philadelphia</hi> and his two Nieces. They ſate down,
and ask'd for ſomething to reliſh a Glaſs of
Wine; and Sir <hi>Philip</hi> order'd a cold Chine to
be ſet before 'em; of which they eat about an
Ounce a-piece: but they drank more by the
half, I dare ſay.</p>
                  <p>After their little Repaſt, <hi>Friendly</hi> call'd the
<hi>Wou'd be-Monarch</hi> aſide, and told him, that he
wou'd have him go the <hi>Play</hi> that Night, which
was, <hi>The London Cuckolds;</hi> promiſing to meet
him there in leſs than Half an Hour after his
departure; telling him withal, that he wou'd
ſurprize him with a much better Entertainment
than the Stage afforded. <hi>Majeſty</hi> took the
Hint, imagining, and that rightly, that the <hi>Knight</hi>
had ſome Intrigue in his head, for the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Commonwealth of Cuckoldom: in
order therefore to his Advice, he took his leave,
about a Quarter of an Hour after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:47213:261"/>
When he was gone, Sir <hi>Philip</hi> thus beſpoke
his pretended Niece; Madam, I hope your
<hi>Majeſty</hi> will not refuſe me the Honour of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on you to a Place where you will meet with
better Entertainment than your <hi>Majeſty</hi> can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from the beſt Comedy in Chriſtendom.
<hi>Val.</hi> (continu'd he,) you muſt go with us, to
ſecure me againſt the Jealouſie of my Wife.
That, indeed, (return'd his <hi>Lady</hi>) is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial;
and you are mightily concern'd not to
give me occaſion, I muſt own. You ſee I am
now, (reply'd he:) But—Come! on with
Hoods and Scarf! (purſu'd he, to <hi>Lucy.</hi>) Then
addreſſing himſelf again to his Lady; Madam,
(ſaid he,) we'll wait on you in leſs time than
I cou'd have drank a Bottle to my ſhare. (The
Coach was got ready, and on they drove to the
<hi>Play-houſe.</hi>) By the way, ſaid <hi>Friendly</hi> to <hi>Val.</hi>—Your
Honour, Noble <hi>Peer,</hi> muſt be ſet
down at <hi>Long</hi>'s; for only <hi>Lucy</hi> and I muſt be
ſeen to his <hi>Majeſty of Bantam:</hi> And now, I
doubt not, you underſtand what you muſt
truſt to.—To be robb'd of her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>'s
Company, I warrant, (return'd t'other)
for theſe long three Hours. Why, (cry'd
<hi>Lucy,</hi>) you don't mean, I hope, to leave me
with his <hi>Majeſty of Bantam?</hi> 'Tis for thy
Good, Child! 'Tis for thy Good! (return'd
<hi>Friendly.</hi>) To the <hi>Roſe</hi> they got then; where
<hi>Goodland</hi> lighted, and expected Sir <hi>Philip;</hi> who
led <hi>Lucy</hi> into the King's Box, to his <hi>New Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;</hi>
where, after the firſt Scene, he left 'em
together. The over-joy'd Fantaſtick <hi>Monarch</hi>
wou'd fain have ſaid ſome fine obliging things to
the Knight, as he was going out; but <hi>Friendly</hi>'s
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47213:262"/>
haſte prevented 'em, who went directly to
<hi>Valentine,</hi> took one Glaſs, call'd a Reck'ning,
mounted Chariot, and away home they came:
where, I believe, he was welcome to his Lady;
for I never heard any thing to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> had not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to ſtay out half the Play, at which he was
ſaluted by above twenty Gentlemen and Ladies
by his New and Mighty Title: but out he led
Miſs <hi>Majeſty,</hi> e're the Third Act was half done;
pretetending, that it was ſo Damn'd Bawdy
a Play, that he knew her Modeſty had been
already but too much offended at it; ſo into
his Coach he got her. When they were ſeated,
ſhe told him ſhe wou'd go to no place with him,
but to the Lodgings her Mother had taken for
her, when ſhe firſt came to Town, and which
ſtill ſhe kept. Your Mother! Madam, (cry'd
he;) Why, is Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s Siſter living then?
His Brother's Widow is, Sir, (ſhe reply'd.)
Is ſhe there? (he ask'd.) No, Sir, (ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd;)
ſhe's in the Countrey. Oh, then
we'll go thither to chuſe. The Coach-man
was then order'd to drive to <hi>Germin's-ſtreet;</hi>
where, when he came into the Lodgings, he
found 'em very rich and modiſhly furniſh'd.
He preſently call'd one of his Slaves, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
him to get three or four pretty Diſhes
for Supper; and then getting a Pen, Ink and
Paper, writ a Note to <hi>C</hi>—<hi>d</hi> the Goldſmith,
within <hi>Temple-Barr,</hi> for Five hundred Guinea's;
which <hi>Watchwell</hi> brought him in little more
than an Hour's time, when they were juſt in
the height of Supper; <hi>Lucy</hi> having invited her
Landlady, for the better colour of the matter.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47213:262"/>
His <hi>Bantamite Majeſty</hi> took the Gold from his
Slave, and threw it by him in the Window,
that <hi>Lucy</hi> might take notice of it; (which, you
may aſſure your ſelf ſhe did, and after Supper,
wink'd on the goodly Matron of the Houſe to
retire; which ſhe immediately obey'd.) Then
his <hi>Majeſty</hi> began his Court very earneſtly and
hotly, throwing the naked Guinea's into her
Lap: which ſhe ſeem'd to refuſe, with much
Diſdain; but, upon his repeated Promiſes,
confirm'd by unheard of Oaths and Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that he wou'd give her Siſter Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Guinea's to her Portion, ſhe began by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to mollifie, and let the Gold lie quietly
in her Lap: And the next night, after he had
drawn Notes on two or three of his Bankers,
for the Payment of Three thouſand Guinea's
to Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> or Order, and receiv'd his own
Bond, made for what he had loſt at Play, from
<hi>Friendly,</hi> ſhe made no great difficulty to admit
his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to her Bed. Where I think fit to
leave 'em for the preſent; for (perhaps) they
had ſome private Bus'neſs.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning, before the <hi>Titular King</hi>
was (I won't ſay, <hi>up,</hi> or <hi>ſtirring,</hi> but) our
o' bed, young <hi>Goodland</hi> and <hi>Philibella</hi> were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
marry'd; the Bills being all Accepted
and Paid in Two Days time. As ſoon as ever
the <hi>Phantaſtick Monarch</hi> cou'd find in his heart
to divorce himſelf from the dear and charming
Embraces of his Beautiful Bedfellow, he came
flying to Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> with all the haſte that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
Big with Pleaſure cou'd inſpire him
with, to diſcharge it ſelf to a ſuppos'd Friend.
The Knight told him, that he was really much
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:263"/>
troubl'd, to find that his Niece had yielded ſo
ſoon and eaſily to him; however, he wiſh'd
him Joy. To which t'other return'd, That
he cou'd never want it, whilſt he had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of ſo much Beauty, and that without the
ungrateful Obligations of Matrimony, which
certainly are the moſt Nauſeous, Hateful, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
and Deſtructive of Love imaginable.
Think you ſo, Sir? (ask'd the <hi>Knight;</hi>) We
ſhall hear what a Friend of mine will ſay on
ſuch an occaſion, to morrow about this time:
but I beſeech your Majeſty to conceal your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of it to him, leſt you make him as
uneaſie as you ſeem to be in that circumſtance.
Be aſſur'd I will, (return'd t'other;) But when
ſhall I ſee the Sweet, the Dear, the Blooming,
the Charming <hi>Philibella?</hi> She will be with us
at Dinner. Where's her Majeſty? (ask'd Sir
<hi>Philip.</hi>) Had you enquir'd before, ſhe had
been here; for, Look, ſhe comes. <hi>Friendly</hi>
ſeem'd to regard her with a kind of Diſpleaſure,
and whiſper'd <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that he ſhou'd expreſs
no particular Symptoms of Familiarity with
<hi>Lucy</hi> in his Houſe, at any time, eſpecially when
<hi>Goodland</hi> was there, as then he was above with
his Lady and <hi>Philibella,</hi> who came down pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after to Dinner.</p>
                  <p>About Four a clock, as his Majeſty had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigu'd
with her, <hi>Lucy</hi> took a Hackney-Coach
and went to her Lodgings; whither, about an
hour after, he follow'd her. Next Morning,
at Nine, he came to <hi>Friendly</hi>'s, who carry'd him
up to ſee his new marry'd Friends—But
(O Damnation to Thought!) what Torments
did he feel, when he ſaw young Goodland and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47213:263"/>
                     <hi>Philibella</hi> in bed together; the laſt of which
return'd him humble and hearty Thanks for
her Portion and Husband, as the firſt did for
his Wife. He ſhook his Head at Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>
and without ſpeaking one word, left 'em and
hurry'd to <hi>Lucy,</hi> to lament the ill treatment
he had met with from <hi>Friendly.</hi> They <hi>Coo'd</hi>
and <hi>Bill'd</hi> as long as <hi>He</hi> was able; ſhe (Sweet
Hypocrite) ſeeming to 'moan his Misfortunes:
which he took ſo kindly, that when he left her,
which was about Three in the Afternoon, he
caus'd a Scrivener to draw up an Inſtrument,
wherein he ſettl'd a Hundred Pounds a Year
on <hi>Lucy,</hi> for her Life, and gave her an Hundred
Guinea's more againſt her Lying-in: (For ſhe
told him (and indeed 'twas true) that ſhe was
with Child, and knew her ſelf to be ſo, from
a very good Reaſon—) And indeed ſhe
was ſo—by the <hi>Friendly</hi> Knight. When he
return'd to her, he threw the Obliging Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into her Lap; (it ſeems, he had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Kindneſs for that Place—) then call'd
for Wine, and ſomething to eat; for he had
not drank a Pint to his ſhare all the day, (tho'
he had ply'd it at the <hi>Chocolate-houſe</hi>—) The
Landlady, who was invited to Sup with 'em,
bid 'em Good-night, about Eleven; when they
went to bed, and, <hi>partly, ſlept</hi> till about Six;
when they were entertain'd by ſome Gentlemen
of their Acquaintance, who Play'd and Sung
very finely, by way of <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> theſe words
and more:
<q>
                        <l>Joy to Great <hi>Bantam!</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Live long Love and Wanton!</l>
                        <l>And thy Royal Conſort!</l>
                        <l>For, Both are of one ſort, &amp;c.</l>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47213:264"/>
The reſt I have forgot. He took ſome offence
at the Words; but more at the Viſit that
Sir <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Goodland</hi> made him, about an
hour after, who found him in Bed with his
<hi>Royal Conſort,</hi> and after having wiſh'd 'em Joy,
and thrown their <hi>Majeſties</hi> own Shooes and
Stockings at their Heads, retreated. This gave
<hi>Monarch in Fanſie</hi> ſo great a Caution, that he
took his <hi>Royal Conſort</hi> into the Countrey, (but
above Forty Miles off the Place where his own
Lady was,) where, in leſs than Eight Months,
ſhe was Deliver'd of a <hi>Princely Babe,</hi> who
was Chriſten'd by the Heatheniſh Name of
<hi>Hayoumorecake Bantam;</hi> while her <hi>Majeſty</hi>
Lay-in like a <hi>petty Queen.</hi>

                  <p>DOn <hi>Henrique</hi> was a Perſon of Great
Birth, of a Great Eſtate, of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
equal to either, of a moſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Education; but of more
Paſſion than Reaſon: He was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
of an Opener and Freer Temper than ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
his Countrey-men are; I mean, the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> always engag'd in ſome Love-Intrigue
or other.</p>
                  <p>One Night, as he was retreating from one
of thoſe Engagements, Don <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> whoſe
Siſter he had abus'd with a Promiſe of Marriage,
ſet upon him at the Corner of a Street, in
<hi>Madrid,</hi> and by the help of three of his Friends,
deſign'd to have diſpatcht him on a doubtful
Embaſſy to the Almighty Monarch: But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
their firſt Inſtructions with better Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
than they expected, and diſmiſs'd <hi>his</hi>
Envoy firſt, killing one of Don <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>'s Friends.

Which ſo enrag'd the Injur'd Brother, that his
Strength and Reſolution ſeem'd to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubl'd,
and ſo animated his two ſurviving
Companions, that (doubtleſs) they had gain'd
a diſhonourable Victory, had not Don <hi>Antonio</hi>

attack'd him only; whilſt Don <hi>Henrique</hi> with

Death, though not without bequeathing ſome
Bloody Legacies to Don <hi>Henrique. Antonio</hi> had

                  <p>As they were marching off, Don <hi>Antonio,</hi>
who all this while knew not whoſe Life he had
ſo happily preſerv'd, told his Companion in
Arms, that he thought it indiſpenſably neceſſary
that he ſhould quarter with him that Night,
for his further Preſervation. To which he
prudently conſented, and went, with no little
uneaſineſs, to his Lodgings; where he ſurpriz'd
<hi>Antonio</hi> with the ſight of his Deareſt Friend.
For they had certainly the neareſt Sympathy
in all their Thoughts, that ever made two
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:266"/>
Brave Men unhappy! And, undoubtedly, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>more Fatal Love,</hi> cou'd
have divided 'em. However, at preſent, they
were united and ſecure:</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, Don <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>'s Friend was
juſt going to call help to carry off the Bodies,
as the—came by; who ſeeing three
Men lie dead, ſeiz'd the fourth; who, as he
was about to juſtifie himſelf, by diſcovering one
of the Authors of ſo much Bloodſhed, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by a Groan from his ſuppos'd dead
Friend Don <hi>Sebaſtian;</hi> whom, after a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ſome part of the matter, and the
knowledge of his Quality, they took up, and
carry'd to his Houſe; where, within a few
days, he was recover'd paſt the fear of Death.
All this while, <hi>Henrique</hi> and <hi>Antonio</hi> durſt not
appear, ſo much as by Night; nor cou'd be
found, though diligent and daily ſearch was
made after the firſt: but upon Don <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>'s
Recovery, the Search ceaſing, they took the
advantage of the Night, and, in Diſguize, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to <hi>Sevil.</hi> 'Twas there they thought
themſelves moſt ſecure, where indeed they
were in the greateſt danger; for tho' (hap'ly)
they might there have eſcap'd the murtherous
Attempt of Don <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> and his Friends, yet
they cou'd not there avoid the malicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of their Stars.</p>
                  <p>This City gave Birth to <hi>Antonio,</hi> and to the
cauſe of his greateſt Misfortunes, as well as of
his Death. Donna <hi>Ardelia</hi> was born there, a
Miracle of Beauty and Falſhood. 'Twas more
than a Year ſince Don <hi>Antonio</hi> had firſt <hi>ſeen</hi> and
<hi>lov'd</hi> her. (For 'twas impoſſible any Man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:267"/>
ſhou'd do one without t'other.) He had had
the unkind opportunity of ſpeaking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
a Billette to her at Church; and to his
greater misfortune, the next time he found her
there, he met with too kind a return both
from her Eyes, and from her Hand, which
privately ſlipt a Paper into his; in which he
found abundantly more than he expected, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
him in that, how he ſhou'd proceed,
in order to carry her off from her Father with
the leaſt danger he cou'd look for in ſuch an
Attempt; ſince it wou'd have been vain and
fruitleſs to have ask'd her of her Father, becauſe
their Families had been at enmity for ſeveral
Years; though <hi>Antonio</hi> was as well deſcended
as ſhe, and had as ample a Fortune; nor was
his Perſon, according to his Sex, any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to her's; and certainly, the Beauties of
his Mind were more excellent, eſpecially if it be
an Excellence to be Conſtant.</p>
                  <p>He had made ſeveral Attempts to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of her, but all prov'd ineffectual; however,
he had the good fortune not to be known, tho'
once or twice he narrowly 'ſcap'd with Life,
bearing off his Wounds with difficulty.—(Alas,
that the Wounds of <hi>Love</hi> ſhou'd cauſe
thoſe of <hi>Hate!</hi>) Upon which ſhe was ſtrictly
confin'd to one Room, whoſe only Window
was towards the Garden, and that too was
Grated with Iron; and, once a Month, when
ſhe went to Church, ſhe was conſtantly and
carefully attended by her Father, and a Mother-in-Law,
worſe than a <hi>Duegna.</hi> Under this
miſerable Confinement <hi>Antonio</hi> underſtood ſhe
ſtill continu'd, at his return to <hi>Sevil</hi> with Don
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47213:267"/>
                     <hi>Henrique,</hi> whom he acquainted with his invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Paſſion for her; lamenting the ſeverity of
her preſent circumſtances, that admitted of no
proſpect of relief: which caus'd a generous
Concern in Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> both for the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his Friend, and of the Lady: He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
ſeveral ways to Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
of the Fair Priſoner; but none of 'em was
thought practicable, or, at leaſt, likely to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
But <hi>Antonio,</hi> who (you may believe)
was then more nearly engag'd, bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of an Expedient that wou'd undoubtedly
reward their Endeavours. 'Twas, That Don
<hi>Henrique,</hi> who was very well acquainted with
<hi>Ardelia's</hi> Father, ſhou'd make him a Viſit, with
pretence of begging his Conſent and Admiſſion
to make his Addreſſes to his Daughter; which,
in all probability, he cou'd not refuſe to
Don <hi>Henrique</hi>'s Quality and Eſtate: And then
this freedom of acceſs to her wou'd give him
the opportunity of delivering the Lady to his
Friend. This was thought ſo reaſonable, that
the very next day it was put in practice; and
with ſo good ſucceſs, that Don <hi>Henrique</hi> was
receiv'd by the Father of <hi>Ardelia</hi> with the
greateſt and moſt reſpectful Ceremony imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
And when he made the Propoſal to
him of Marrying his Daughter, it was embrac'd
with a viſible Satisfaction and Joy in the Air of
his Face. This their firſt Converſation ended
with all imaginable Content on both Sides;
Don <hi>Henrique</hi> being invited by the Father to
Dinner, the next day, when Donna <hi>Ardelia</hi>
was to be preſent; who, at that time, was
ſaid to be indiſpos'd, (as 'tis very probable ſhe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:268"/>
was, with ſo cloſe an Impriſonment.) <hi>Henrique</hi>
return'd to <hi>Antonio,</hi> and made him happy with
the Account of his Reception; which cou'd not
but have terminated in the perfect Felicity of
<hi>Antonio,</hi> had his Fate been juſt to the Merits of
his Love. The Day and Hour came which
brought <hi>Henrique</hi> with a private Commiſſion
from his Friend to <hi>Ardelia.</hi> He <hi>ſaw</hi> her;—(Ah!
wou'd he had only ſeen her Veil'd!)
and, with the firſt opportunity, gave her the
Letter, which held ſo much Love and ſo much
Truth, as ought to have preſerv'd him in the
Empire of her Heart. It contain'd, beſides, a
Diſcovery of his whole Deſign upon her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the compleating of their Happineſs;
which nothing then cou'd obſtruct but her ſelf.
But <hi>Henrique</hi> had <hi>ſeen</hi> her; he had <hi>gaz'd</hi> and
ſwallow'd all her Beauties at his Eyes. How
greedily his Soul drank the ſtrong Poyſon in!
But yet his Honour and his Friendſhip were
ſtrong as ever, and bravely fought againſt the
Uſurper <hi>Love,</hi> and got a noble Victory, at leaſt
he thought and wiſh'd ſo. With this, and a
ſhort Anſwer to his Letter, <hi>Henrique</hi> return'd
to the Longing <hi>Antonio;</hi> who receiving the
Paper with the greateſt Devotion, and kiſſing
it with the greateſt Zeal, open'd and read theſe
words to himſelf:</p>

to his Friend; who reading that part of it
which concern'd himſelf, ſtarted and bluſh'd:
Which <hi>Antonio</hi> obſerving, was curious to know
the cauſe of it. <hi>Henrique</hi> told him, That he
was ſurpriz'd to find her expreſs ſo little
Love, after ſo long an Abſence. To which
his Friend reply'd, for her, That, doubtleſs,
ſhe had not Time enough to attempt ſo great a
Matter as a perfect Account of her Love; and
added, That it was Confirmation enough to
him of its continuance, ſince ſhe Subſcrib'd
her ſelf His <hi>entirely,</hi> and <hi>only</hi> His.—How
Blind is Love! Don <hi>Henrique</hi> knew how to
make it bear another meaning; which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he had the Diſcretion to conceal. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio,</hi>
who was as Real in his Friendſhip, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in his Love, ask'd him what he thought
of her Beauty? To which t'other anſwer'd,
That he thought it irreſiſtible to any, but to
a Soul prepoſſeſs'd and nobly fortify'd with a
perfect Friendſhip:—Such as is Thine, my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:269"/>
                     <hi>Henrique,</hi> (added <hi>Antonio;</hi>) yet as ſincere
and perfect as <hi>that</hi> is, I know you <hi>must,</hi> nay,
I know you <hi>do</hi> Love her. As I ought, I do,
(reply'd <hi>Henrique.</hi>) Yes, Yes, (return'd his
Friend,) it muſt be ſo; otherwiſe the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
which unites our Souls wou'd be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and conſequently our Friendſhip were not
in a ſtate of Perfection. How induſtriouſly
you wou'd argue me into a Crime that wou'd
tear and deſtroy the very Foundation of the
ſtrongeſt Ties of Truth and Honour! (ſaid
<hi>Henrique.</hi>) But (he continu'd) I hope, within
a few Days, to put it out of my power to
be guilty of ſo great a <hi>Sacrilege.</hi> I can't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
(ſaid <hi>Antonio,</hi>) if I knew that you
Lov'd one another, whether I cou'd eaſier
part with my Friend, or my Miſtreſs. Tho'
what you ſay, is highly Generous, (reply'd
<hi>Henrique,</hi>) yet give me leave to urge, that
it looks like a Trial of your Friend, and
argues you inclinable to Jealouſie: But, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me, I know it to be ſincerely meant by
<hi>you;</hi> and muſt therefore own, that 'tis the
Beſt, becauſe 'tis the Nobleſt way of ſecuring
both your Friend and Miſtreſs. I need make
uſe of no Arts to ſecure me of either, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Antonio;</hi>) but expect to enjoy 'em both
in a little time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henrique,</hi> who was a little uneaſie with a
Diſcourſe of this nature, diverted it, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on what had paſs'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> between
them two and Don <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> and his Friends;
which caus'd <hi>Antonio</hi> to bethink himſelf of the
Danger to which he expos'd his Friend, by
appearing daily, tho' in Diſguiſe: For, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:269"/>
Don <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> wou'd purſue his Revenge
to the utmoſt Extremity. Theſe Thoughts put
him upon deſiring his Friend, for his own ſake,
to haſten the performance of his Attempt; and
accordingly, each day Don <hi>Henrique</hi> brought
<hi>Antonio</hi> the nearer hopes of Happineſs, while
he himſelf was hourly ſinking into the loweſt
ſtate of Miſery. The laſt Night before the
Day in which <hi>Antonio</hi> expected to be bleſs'd in
her Love, Don <hi>Henrique</hi> had a long and fatal
Conference with her, about his Liberty. Being
then with her alone in an Arbour of the Garden,
which Privilege he had had for ſome days: After
a long ſilence, and obſerving Don <hi>Henrique</hi> in
much diſorder, by the Motion of his Eyes,
which were ſometimes ſtedfaſtly fix'd on the
Ground, then lifted up to her or Heaven, (for
he cou'd ſee nothing more Beautiful on Earth,)
ſhe made uſe of the Privilege of her Sex, and
began the Diſcourſe firſt, to this effect;—Has
any thing happen'd, Sir, ſince our retreat hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to occaſion that Diſorder which is but
too viſible in your Face, and too dreadful in
your hitherto continu'd ſilence? Speak, I
beſeech you, Sir, and let me know if I have
any way unhappily contributed to it! No,
Madam, (reply'd he;) my Friendſhip is now
likely to be the only cauſe of my greateſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery;
for to morrow I muſt be guilty of an
unpardonable Crime, in betraying the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Confidence which your noble Father has
plac'd in me: To morrow (added he, with a
pitious Sigh) I muſt deliver you into the Hands
of one whom your Father hates even to death,
inſtead of doing my ſelf the Honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47213:270"/>
his Son-in-Law within a few Days
more:—But—I will conſider and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind
my ſelf, that I give you into the hands of
my Friend; of my Friend, that Loves you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than his Life which he has often expos'd
for your ſake; and what is more than All, to
my Friend, whom you Love more than any
Conſideration on Earth.—And <hi>must</hi> this be
done? (ſhe ask'd.) Is it inevitable as Fate?—Fix'd
as the Laws of Nature, Madam, (reply'd
he;) Don't you find the Neceſſity of it, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia?</hi>
(continu'd he, by way of Queſtion:)
Does not your Love require it? Think! you
are going to your Dear <hi>Antonio,</hi> who alone can
merit you, and whom only you can love.
Were your laſt words true, (return'd ſhe,) I
ſhou'd yet be unhappy in the Diſpleaſure of a
Dear and Tender Father, and infinitely more,
in being the cauſe of your Infidelity to him:
No, Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> (continu'd ſhe;) I cou'd
with greater Satisfaction return to my miſerable
Confinement, than by any means diſturb the
Peace of your Mind, or occaſion one moment's
interruption of your Quiet.—Wou'd
to Heaven you did not, (ſigh'd he to himſelf.)
Then addreſſing his words more diſtinctly to
her, cry'd he, Ah, Cruel! Ah, Unjuſt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia!</hi>
Theſe Words belong to none but <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio;</hi>
why then wou'd you endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
me, that I <hi>do,</hi> or ever <hi>can</hi> merit the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of ſuch an Expreſſion:—Have a
care! (purſu'd he,) Have a care, <hi>Ardelia!</hi>
your <hi>outward</hi> Beauties are too powerful to be
reſiſted; even your <hi>Frowns</hi> have ſuch a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that it attracts the very Soul that is not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47213:270"/>
ſtrongly prepoſſeſs'd with the nobleſt Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and the higheſt Principles of Honour:
Why then, alas! did you add ſuch Sweet and
Charming Accents? Why—Ah, Don
<hi>Henrique!</hi> (ſhe interrupted,) why did you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to me ſo Charming in your Perſon, ſo
great in your Friendſhip, and ſo Illuſtrious in
your Reputation? Why did my Father, e'er
ſince your firſt Viſit, continually fill my Ears
and Thoughts with Noble Characters and
Glorious Idea's, which yet but imperfectly and
faintly repreſent the Inimitable Original!—But—(what
is moſt ſevere and cruel) why,
Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> why will you defeat my Father
in his Ambition of your Alliance! and me of
thoſe glorious Hopes with which you had
bleſs'd my Soul, by caſting me away from you
to <hi>Antonio!</hi>—Ha! (cry'd he, ſtarting,)
What ſaid you, Madam! What did <hi>Ardelia</hi>
ſay! That I had bleſs'd your Soul with Hopes!
That I wou'd <hi>cast you away to Antonio!</hi>—Can
they who ſafely arrive in their wiſh'd for
Port, be ſaid to be Shipwrack'd! Or, Can an
Abject, Indigent Wretch make a King?—Theſe
are more than Riddles, Madam; and I
muſt not think to Expound 'em. No, (ſaid
ſhe;) Let it alone, Don <hi>Henrique;</hi> I'll eaſe
you of that trouble, and tell you plainly that
<hi>I Love you.</hi> Ah! (cry'd he,) now all my
Fears are come upon me!—How! (ask'd
ſhe,) Were you <hi>afraid</hi> I ſhou'd Love you? Is
my Love ſo dreadful then? Yes, when miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd,
(reply'd he;) but 'twas your <hi>Falſhood</hi>
that I fear'd: Your Love were what I wou'd
have ſought, with utmoſt hazard of my Life;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47213:271"/>
nay, even of my Future Happineſs, I fear, had
you not been Engag'd; ſtrongly oblig'd to Love
elſe where, both by your own Choice and Vows,
as well as by his dangerous Services, and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Conſtancy. For which (ſaid ſhe) I do
not <hi>Hate</hi> him; though his Father kill'd my
Uncle: Nay, perhaps (continu'd ſhe) I have
a Friendſhip for him, but no more. No <hi>more!</hi>
ſaid you, Madam? (cry'd he;)—But tell me,
Did you never Love him? Indeed, I did,
(reply'd ſhe;) but the Sight of You, has better
inſtructed me, both in my Duty to my Father,
and in cauſing my Paſſion for you, without
whom I ſhall be eternally miſerable: Ah, then!
purſue your honourable Propoſal, and make
my Father happy in my Marriage! It muſt
not be, (return'd Don <hi>Henrique;</hi>) my <hi>Honour,</hi>
my <hi>Friendſhip</hi> forbids it. No, (ſhe return'd,)
your Honour requires it; and if your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
oppoſes your Honour, it can have no ſure
nor ſolid Foundation. <hi>Female Sophiſtry!</hi> (cry'd
<hi>Henrique;</hi>) But you need no Art nor Artifice,
<hi>Ardelia,</hi> to make me Love you: <hi>Love you!</hi>
(purſu'd he;) By that bright <hi>Sun,</hi> the Light
and Heat of all the World, <hi>You</hi> are my only
Light and Heat.—Oh, <hi>Friendſhip! Sacred
Friendſhip,</hi> now aſſiſt me!—[Here for
a time he paus'd, and then afreſh proceeded,]
thus,—You told me, or my Ears deceiv'd
me, that you Lov'd me, <hi>Ardelia.</hi> I did, (ſhe
reply'd;) and that I do Love you, is as true
as that I told you ſo. 'Tis well;—But wou'd
it were not ſo! Did ever Man receive a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<hi>thus!</hi>—Why, I cou'd wiſh I did not
Love <hi>you, Ardelia!</hi> But that were impoſſible—
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47213:271"/>
At leaſt, <hi>unjuſt,</hi> (interrupted ſhe.) Well then,
(he went on) to ſhew you that I do ſincerely
conſult your particular Happineſs, without any
regard to my own, to morrow I will give you
to Don <hi>Antonio;</hi> and as a Proof of your Love
to me, I expect your ready Conſent to it. To
let you ſee, Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> how perfectly and
tenderly I Love you, I will be ſacrific'd to
morrow to Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> and to your Quiet.
Oh, Strangeſt, Deareſt Obligation! (cry'd
<hi>Henrique;</hi>) To morrow then, as I have told
your Father, I am to bring you to ſee the
Deareſt Friend I have on Earth, who dare not
appear within this City for ſome unhappy Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and therefore cannot be preſent at our
Nuptials; for which cauſe, I cou'd not but
think it my Duty to one ſo nearly related to
my Soul, to make him happy in the Sight of
my Beautiful Choice, e're yet ſhe be my Bride.
I hope (ſaid ſhe) my Loving Obedience may
merit your Compaſſion; and that at laſt, e're
the Fire is lighted that muſt conſume the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
I mean, the Marriage-Tapers, (alluding
to the old <hi>Roman</hi> Ceremony) that <hi>you,</hi> or ſome
other pitying Angel, will ſnatch me from the
Altar. Ah, No more, <hi>Ardelia!</hi> Say no more!
(cry'd he;) we muſt be <hi>Cruel,</hi> to be Juſt to
our ſelves. [Here their Diſcourſe ended, and
they walk'd into the Houſe, where they ſound
the Good Old Gentleman and his Lady, with
whom he ſtay'd till about an Hour after Supper,
when he return'd to his Friend with joyful News,
but a ſorrowful Heart.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antonio</hi> was all Rapture with the Thoughts
of the approaching Day; which though it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47213:272"/>
brought Don <hi>Henrique</hi> and his Dear <hi>Ardelia</hi> to
him, about Five a clock in the Evening, yet at
the ſame time brought his laſt and greateſt Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.
He ſaw her then at a She-Relations of
his, about three Miles from <hi>Sevil,</hi> which was
the Place aſſign'd for their fatal Interview. He
<hi>ſaw</hi> her, I ſay; but, Ah! how ſtrange, how
alter'd from the Dear, Kind <hi>Ardelia</hi> ſhe was
when laſt he left her! 'Tis true, he flew to
her with Arms expanded, and with ſo ſwift
and eager a motion, that ſhe cou'd not avoid
nor get looſe from his Embrace, till he had
<hi>kiſs'd,</hi> and <hi>ſigh'd,</hi> and <hi>dropt ſome Tears,</hi> which
all the ſtrength of his Mind cou'd not reſtrain;
whether they were the effects of Joy, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(which rather may be fear'd) they were
the Heat-drops which preceded and threaten'd
the Thunder and Tempeſt that ſhou'd fall on
his Head, I cannot poſitively ſay; yet all this
ſhe was then <hi>forc'd</hi> to endure, e're ſhe had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to ſpeak, or, indeed, to <hi>breathe.</hi> But
as ſoon as ſhe had freed her ſelf from the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Circle that ſhou'd have been the dear and
lov'd Confinement or Centre of a Faithful Heart,
ſhe began to dart whole ſhowers of Tortures
on him from her Eyes; which that Mouth that
he had but juſt before ſo tenderly and ſacredly
kiſs'd, ſeconded with whole volleys of Deaths
cramm'd in every Sentence, pointed with the
keeneſt Affliction that ever pierc'd a Soul!
<hi>Antonio,</hi> (ſhe began) you have treated me now,
as if you were never like to ſee me more; and
wou'd to Heav'n you were not!—Ha!
(cry'd he, ſtarting, and ſtaring wildly on her;)
What ſaid you, Madam? What ſaid you, <hi>my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47213:272"/>
Ardelia?</hi> If you like the Repetition, Take it!
(reply'd ſhe, unmov'd,) <hi>Wou'd to Heav'n you
were ne'er like to ſee me more!</hi> Good! Very
Good! (cry'd he, with a Sigh that threw him
trembling into a Chair behind him, and gave
her the opportunity of proceeding thus,)—Yet,
<hi>Antonio,</hi> I muſt not have my Wiſh; I muſt
continue with you, not out of Choice, but by
Command, by the ſtricteſt and ſevereſt Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
that ever bound Humanity; Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
your Friend, Commands it; Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
the Deareſt Object of my Soul, Enjoins
it; Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> whoſe only Averſion I am,
will have it ſo. Oh, Do not wrong me,
Madam! (cry'd Don <hi>Henrique.</hi>) Lead me,
Lead me a little more by the Light of your
Diſcourſe, I beſeech you, (ſaid Don <hi>Antonio,</hi>)
that I may ſee your Meaning! for hitherto 'tis
Darkneſs all to me. Attend therefore with
your beſt Faculties, (purſu'd <hi>Ardelia</hi>) and know,
That I do moſt ſincerely and moſt paſſionately
Love Don <hi>Henrique;</hi> and as a Proof of my
Love to him, I have this Day conſented to be
deliver'd up to you by Him; not for your ſake
in the leaſt, <hi>Antonio,</hi> but purely to ſacrifice all
the Quiet of my Life to his Satisfaction. And
now, Sir, (continu'd ſhe, addreſſing her ſelf
to Don <hi>Henrique,</hi>) Now, Sir, if you can be ſo
cruel; execute your own moſt dreaded Decree,
and join our Hands, though our Hearts ne'er
can meet. All this to Try me! It's too much,
<hi>Ardelia,</hi>—(ſaid <hi>Antonio:</hi>) And then turning
to Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> he went on, Speak <hi>Thou!</hi> if
yet thou'rt not Apoſtate to our Friendſhip!
Yet Speak, however! Speak, though the Devil
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47213:273"/>
has been Tampering with Thee too! Thou
art a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Man of Honour</hi> once. And
when I forfeit my juſt Title to <hi>that,</hi> (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> may I be made moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable!
—May I loſe the Bleſſings of thy
Friendſhip!—May I loſe <hi>Thee!</hi>—Say
on then, <hi>Henrique!</hi> (cry'd <hi>Antonio;</hi>) And
I charge thee, by all the Sacred Tyes of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
ſay, Is this a Trial of me? Is't Eluſion,
Sport? or ſhameful, murtherous Truth?—O!
my Soul burns within me, and I can bear
no longer!—Tell! Speak! Say on!—[Here,
with folded Arms, and Eyes fix'd ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly
on <hi>Henrique,</hi> he ſtood like a Statue,
without motion; unleſs ſometimes, when his
ſwelling Heart rais'd his o'er-charg'd Breaſt.]
After a little Pauſe, and a hearty Sigh or two,
<hi>Henrique</hi> began;—Oh, <hi>Antonio!</hi> O my
Friend! prepare thy ſelf to hear yet more
dreadful Accents!—I am (purſu'd he)
unhappily the Greateſt and moſt Innocent Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
that e'er, till now, offended:—I
Love her, <hi>Antonio,</hi>—I Love <hi>Ardelia,</hi> with
a Paſſion ſtrong and violent as Thine!—Oh,
ſummon all that us'd to be more than Man
about thee, to ſuffer to the end of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
which nothing but a Reſolution like
Thine can bear! I know it by my ſelf.—Though
there be Wounds, Horror and Death
in each Syllable, (interrupted <hi>Antonio,</hi>) yet
prithee, <hi>now,</hi> go on, but with all haſte. I will,
(return'd Don <hi>Henrique,</hi>) though I feel, my own
Words have the ſame cruel effects on me. I ſay
again, my <hi>Soul</hi> Loves <hi>Ardelia.</hi> And how can it
be otherwiſe? Have we not Both the ſelf-ſame
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47213:273"/>
Appetites? the ſame Diſguſts? How then cou'd
I avoid my Deſtiny, that has decreed that I
ſhou'd Love and Hate juſt as you do? Oh,
hard Neceſſity! that oblig'd you to uſe Me, in
the Recovery of this Lady! Alas, Can you
think that any Man of Senſe or Paſſion cou'd
have ſeen, and not have Lov'd her! Then
how ſhou'd I, whoſe Thoughts are Uniſons to
Yours, evade thoſe Charms that had prevail'd
on you?—And now, to let you know 'tis
no Eluſion, no Sport, but ſerious and amazing
woful Truth, <hi>Ardelia</hi> beſt can tell you whom
ſhe Loves. What I've already ſaid, is true,
by Heav'n, (cry'd ſhe;) 'Tis you, Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
whom I only Love, and who alone can
give me Happineſs: Ah, wou'd you wou'd!
—With you, <hi>Antonio,</hi> I muſt remain Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
Wretched, Curs'd: Thou art my Hell;
Don <hi>Henrique</hi> is my Heaven. And Thou art
mine, (return'd he,) which here I part with to
my Deareſt Friend. Then taking her Hand;
Pardon me, <hi>Antonio,</hi> (purſu'd he) that I thus take
my laſt Farewell of all the Taſts of Bliſs from
your <hi>Ardelia,</hi> at this moment. [At which words
he kiſs'd her Hand, and gave it to Don <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio;</hi>
who receiv'd it, and gently preſs'd it
cloſe to his Heart, as if he wou'd have her feel
the Diſorders ſhe had caus'd there.] Be Happy,
<hi>Antonio,</hi> (cry'd <hi>Henrique;</hi>) Be very Tender
of her; To morrow early I ſhall hope to ſee
thee.—<hi>Ardelia,</hi> (purſu'd he,) all Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
and Joy ſurround Thee! May'ſt thou
ne'er want thoſe Bleſſings thou canſt give <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio!</hi>
—Farewell to Both! (added he,
going out.) Ay, (cry'd ſhe,) Farewell to all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47213:274"/>
Joys, Bleſſings, Happineſs, if you forſake me
—Yet do not go!—Ah, Cruel! (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
ſhe, ſeeing him quit the Room;) But
you ſhall take my Soul with you. Here ſhe
ſwooned away in Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Arms; who,
though he was happy that he had her faſt there,
yet was oblig'd to call in his Couſin, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia</hi>'s
Attendants, e're ſhe cou'd be perfectly
recover'd. In the mean while, Don <hi>Henrique</hi>
had not the power to go out of ſight of the
Houſe, but wander'd to and fro about it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
in his Soul, and not being able longer
to refrain her ſight, her laſt Words ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounding
in her Ears, he came again into the
Room where he left her with Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> juſt
as ſhe reviv'd and call'd upon him, exclaiming
on his Cruelty, in leaving her ſo ſoon. But
when, turning her Eyes towards the Door, ſhe
ſaw him; Oh! with what eager haſte ſhe flew
to him! then claſp'd him round the Waſt,
obliging him, with all the tender Expreſſions
that the Soul of a Lover, and a Woman's too,
is capable of uttering, not to leave her in the
poſſeſſion of Don <hi>Antonio.</hi> This ſo amaz'd her
ſlighted Lover, that he knew not, at firſt, how
to proceed in this Tormenting Scene; but at
laſt, ſummoning all his wonted Reſolution,
and Strength of Mind, he told her, He wou'd
put her out of his power, if ſhe wou'd conſent
to retreat for ſome few hours to a Nunnery that
was not above half a Mile diſtant thence, till
he had diſcours'd his Friend, Don <hi>Henrique,</hi>
ſomething more particularly than hitherto,
about this Matter. To which ſhe readily
agreed, upon the Promiſe that Don <hi>Henrique</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47213:274"/>
made her, of ſeeing her with the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
They waited on her then to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
where ſhe was kindly and reſpectfully
receiv'd by the Lady Abbeſs; but it was not long
before that her Grief renewing with greater
violence, and more afflicting circumſtances,
had oblig'd 'em to ſtay with her till it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
dark, when they once more begg'd the
liberty of an hour's abſence; and the better to
palliate their Deſign, <hi>Henrique</hi> told her, that
he wou'd make uſe of her Father Don <hi>Richardo</hi>'s
Coach, in which they came to Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s,
for ſo ſmall a time: Which they did, leaving
only <hi>Eleanora</hi> her Attendant with her, without
whom ſhe had been at a loſs, among ſo many
Fair Strangers; Strangers, I mean, to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Circumſtances: whilſt they were carry'd
near a Mile farther, where, juſt as 'twas dark,
they 'lighted from the Coach, Don <hi>Henrique</hi>
ordering the Servants not to ſtir thence till
their return from their private Walk, which
was about a Furlong, in a Field that belong'd
to the Convent. Here Don <hi>Antonio</hi> told Don
<hi>Henrique,</hi> That he had not acted Honourably;
That he had Betray'd him and Robb'd him at
once both of a Friend and Miſtreſs. To which
t'other return'd, That he underſtood his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when he propos'd a <hi>particular Diſcourſe</hi>
about this Affair, which he now perceiv'd muſt
end in Blood: But you may remind your ſelf
(continu'd he) that I have kept my Promiſe,
in delivering her to you. Yes, (cry'd <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi>)
after you had practis'd foully and baſely
with her. By Heavens! not at all, (return'd
<hi>Henrique;</hi>) It was her Choice, or Fate, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47213:275"/>
brought this miſchief on her; for I urg'd the
Shame and Scandal of Inconſtancy, but all in
vain, to her. But don't you Love her, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique?</hi>
(t'other ask'd.) Too well; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live without her, though I fear I may feel
the curſed Effects of the ſame Inconſtancy:
However, I had quitted her All to you, but
you ſee how ſhe reſents it. And you ſhall ſee,
Sir, (cry'd <hi>Antonio,</hi> drawing his Sword in a
Rage) how I reſent it. Here, without more
Words, they fell to Action, to Bloody Action.
(Ah! how wretched is our Sex, in being the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Occaſion of ſo many fatal Miſchiefs ev'n
between the Deareſt Friends!) They fought on
each ſide with the greateſt Animoſity of Rivals,
forgetting all the Sacred Bonds of their former
Friendſhip; till Don <hi>Antonio</hi> fell, and ſaid,
dying, <hi>Forgive me,</hi> Henrique! <hi>I was to blame;
I cou'd not live without her:—I fear ſhe will
betray thy Life, which</hi> haſte <hi>and preſerve, for my
ſake!—Let me not die all at once!—Heav'n
pardon both of us!—Farewell! Oh, Haſte!
Farewell!</hi> (return'd Don <hi>Henrique,) Farewell,
thou Bravest, Truest Friend! Farewell, thou
Nobleſt Part of me!—And, Farewell all the
Quiet of my Soul.</hi> Then ſtooping, he kiſs'd his
Cheek; but, riſing, found he muſt retire in
time, or elſe muſt periſh through loſs of Blood,
for he had receiv'd two or three dangerous
Wounds, beſides others of leſs conſequence:
wherefore he made all the convenient haſte he
cou'd to the Coach, into which, by the help of
the Foot-men, he got, and order'd 'em to drive
directly to Don <hi>Richardo</hi>'s with all imaginable
ſpeed; where he arriv'd in little more than
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47213:275"/>
half an hour's time, and was receiv'd by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia</hi>'s
Father with the greateſt Confuſion and
Amazement that is expreſſible, ſeeing him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
without his Daughter, and ſo deſperately
wounded. Before he thought it convenient to
ask him any Queſtions more than to enquire of
his Daughter's ſafety, to which he receiv'd a
ſhort but ſatisfactory Anſwer, Don <hi>Richardo</hi> ſent
for an Eminent and Able Surgeon, who prob'd
and dreſs'd Don <hi>Henrique</hi>'s Wounds, who was
immediately put to Bed, not without ſome
deſpondency of his Recovery; but (Thanks
to his kind Stars, and kinder Conſtitution!)
he reſted pretty well for ſome hours that Night;
and early in the Morning, <hi>Ardelia</hi>'s Father,
who had ſcarce taken any Reſt all that Night,
came to viſit him, as ſoon as he underſtood
from the Servants who watch'd with him that
he was in a condition to ſuffer a ſhort Diſcourſe;
which, you may be ſure, was to learn the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the paſt Night's Adventure; of
which Don <hi>Henrique</hi> gave him a perfect and
pleaſant Account, ſince he heard that Don <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio,</hi>
his mortal Enemy, was kill'd; the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of whoſe Death was the more delightful
to him, ſince, by this Relation, he found that
<hi>Antonio</hi> was the Man whom his care of his
Daughter had ſo often fruſtrated. Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique</hi>
had hardly made an end of his Narration,
e're a Servant came haſtily to give <hi>Richardo</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the Officers were come to ſearch for
his Son-in-Law that ſhou'd have been; whom
the Old Gentleman's wiſe Precaution had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
in a Room ſo unſuſpected, that they might
as reaſonably have imagin'd the entire Walls
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47213:276"/>
of his Houſe had a Door made of Stones, as that
there ſhou'd have been one to that cloſe Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
He went therefore boldly to the Officers,
and gave 'em all the Keys of his Houſe, with
free liberty to examine every Room and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
Which they did, but to no purpoſe; and
Don <hi>Henrique</hi> lay there undiſcover'd till his
Cure was perfected.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ardelia,</hi> who, that fatal
Night, but too rightly gueſs'd that the Death
of one or both her Lovers was the cauſe that
they did not return to their Promiſe, the next
Day fell into a high Fever, in which her Father
found her, ſoon after he had clear'd himſelf
of thoſe who came to ſearch for her Lover.
The aſſurance which her Father gave her of
<hi>Henrique</hi>'s Life ſeem'd a little to revive her;
but the ſeverity of <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Fate was no way
obliging to her, ſince ſhe cou'd not but retain
the memory of his Love and Conſtancy; which
added to her Afflictions, and heightned her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
inſomuch that <hi>Richardo</hi> was conſtrain'd
to leave her under the care of the good Lady
Abbeſs, and to the diligent Attendance of
<hi>Eleanora,</hi> not daring to hazard her Life in a
removal to his own Houſe. All their Care and
Diligence was however ineffectual; for ſhe
languiſh'd even to the leaſt hope of Recovery,
till immediately after the firſt Viſit of Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
which was the firſt he made in a Month's
time, and that by Night, <hi>incognito,</hi> with her
Father, her Diſtemper viſibly retreated each
day: yet when at laſt ſhe enjoy'd a perfect
Health of Body, her Mind grew ſick, and ſhe
plung'd into a deep Melancholy; which made
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47213:276"/>
her entertain a poſitive Reſolution of taking
the Veil at the end of her Novitiate: which
accordingly ſhe did, notwithſtanding all the
Entreaties, Prayers and Tears both of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Lover. But ſhe ſoon repented her
Vow, and often wiſh'd that ſhe might by any
means ſee and ſpeak to Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> by
whoſe help ſhe promis'd to her ſelf a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
out of her voluntary Impriſonment:
Nor were his Wiſhes wanting to the ſame effect,
though he was forc'd to flie into <hi>Italy,</hi> to avoid
the Proſecution of <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Friends. Thither
ſhe purſu'd him; nor cou'd he any way ſhun
her, unleſs he cou'd have left his Heart at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from his Body: Which made him take a
fatal Reſolution of returning to <hi>Sevil</hi> in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe;
where he wander'd about the Convent
every Night like a Ghoſt, (for indeed his Soul
was within, while his Inanimate Trunk was
without,) till at laſt he found means to convey
a Letter to her, which both ſurpriz'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
her. The Meſſenger that brought it
her, was one of her Mother-in-Laws Maids,
whom he had known before, and met acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
one night as he was going his Rounds,
and ſhe coming out from <hi>Ardelia;</hi> with her he
prevail'd, and with Gold oblig'd her to Secrecy
and Aſſiſtance: which prov'd ſo ſucceſsful, that
he underſtood from <hi>Ardelia</hi> her ſtrong deſire
of Liberty, and the continuance of her Paſſion
for him, together with the Means and Time
moſt convenient and likely to ſucceed for her
Enlargement. The Time was the Fourteenth
Night following, at Twelve a clock, which
juſt compleated a Month ſince his return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47213:277"/>
at which time they Both promis'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the greateſt Happineſs on Earth. But
you may obſerve the juſtice of Heaven, in their
Diſappointment.</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> who ſtill purſu'd him with a
moſt implacable Hatred, had trac'd him even to
<hi>Italy,</hi> and there narrowly miſſing him, poſted
after him to <hi>Toledo;</hi> ſo ſure and ſecret was his
Intelligence! As ſoon as he arriv'd, he went
directly to the Convent where his Siſter <hi>Elvira</hi>
had been one of the Profeſs'd, ever ſince Don
<hi>Henrique</hi> had forſaken her, and where <hi>Ardelia</hi>
had taken her Repented Vow. <hi>Elvira</hi> had all
along conceal'd the Occaſion of her coming
thither from <hi>Ardelia;</hi> and though ſhe was her
only Confident, and knew the whole Story of
her Misfortunes, and heard the Name of Don
<hi>Henrique</hi> repeated an hundred times a day,
whom ſtill ſhe Lov'd moſt perfectly, yet never
gave her Beautiful Rival any cauſe of ſuſpicion
that ſhe Lov'd him, either by Words or Looks:
nay, more, when ſhe underſtood that Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique</hi>
came to the Convent with <hi>Ardelia</hi> and
<hi>Antonio,</hi> and at other times with her Father,
yet ſhe had ſo great a command of her ſelf, as
to refrain ſeeing him, or to be ſeen by him;
nor ever intended to have ſpoken or writ to
him, had not her Brother, Don <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> put
her upon the cruel neceſſity of doing the laſt;
who coming to viſit his Siſter (as I have ſaid
before) found her with Donna <hi>Ardelia,</hi> whom
he never remembred to have ſeen, nor who
ever had ſeen him but twice, and that was
about Six Years before, when ſhe was but Ten
Years of Age, when ſhe fell paſſionately in Love
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47213:277"/>
with him, and continu'd her Paſſion till about
the Fourteenth Year of her Empire, when the
unhappy <hi>Antonio</hi> firſt began his Court to her
Don <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was really a very deſirable Perſon,
being at that time very Beautiful, his Age not
exceeding Six and twenty, of a ſweet Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
very Brave, but Revengeful and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
(like moſt of his Countrey-men,)
and of an Honourable Family. At the ſight of
him, <hi>Ardelia</hi> felt her former Paſſion renew;
which proceeded and continu'd with ſuch Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that it utterly defac'd the Idea's of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi>
and <hi>Henrique.</hi> (No wonder that ſhe who
cou'd reſolve to forſake her God for Man,
ſhou'd quit one Lover for another.) In ſhort,
ſhe then only wiſh'd that he might Love her
equally, and then ſhe doubted not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
the means of their Happineſs betwixt
'em. She had her Wiſh, and more, if poſſible;
for he Lov'd her beyond the thought of any
other preſent or future Bleſſing, and fail'd not
to let her know it, at the ſecond Interview;
when he receiv'd the greateſt Pleaſure he cou'd
have wiſh'd, next to the Joys of a Bridal Bed:
For ſhe confeſs'd her Love to him, and preſently
put him upon thinking on the means of her
Eſcape; but not finding his Deſigns ſo likely to
ſucceed, as thoſe Meaſures ſhe had ſent to Don
<hi>Henrique,</hi> ſhe communicates the very ſame to
Don <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and agreed with him to make
uſe of 'em on that very Night wherein ſhe had
oblig'd Don <hi>Henrique</hi> to attempt her Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
the Hour indeed was different, being
determin'd to be at Eleven. <hi>Elvira,</hi> who was
preſent at the Conference, took the Hint; and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:278"/>
not being willing to diſoblige a Brother who had
ſo hazarded his Life in Vindication of her,
either durſt not or wou'd not ſeem to oppoſe his
Inclinations, at that time: However, when he
retir'd with her to talk more particularly of
his intended Revenge on Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> who, he
told her, he knew lay ſomewhere abſconded in
<hi>Toledo,</hi> and whom he had reſolv'd, as he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
her, to ſacrifice to her injur'd Honour,
and his Reſentments; ſhe oppos'd that his vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive
Reſolution with all the forcible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in a Virtuous and Pious Lady's Capacity,
but in vain; ſo that immediately, upon his
retreat from the Convent, ſhe took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of writing to Don <hi>Henrique</hi> as follows,
the fatal Hour not being then Seven Nights
diſtant.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">

Eſcape from the Convent, at the ſame Place
of it, and by the ſame Means on which ſhe
had agreed to give her ſelf entirely to you,
but the Hour is Eleven. I know, <hi>Henrique,</hi>
your <hi>Ardelia</hi> is dearer to you than your Life;
but your Life, your dear Life is more deſir'd
than any thing in this World, by</p>

This ſhe deliver'd to <hi>Richardo</hi>'s Servant,
whom <hi>Henrique</hi> had gain'd that Night, as
ſoon as ſhe came to viſit <hi>Ardelia,</hi> at her
uſual Hour, juſt as ſhe went out of the
Cloiſter.</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Henrique</hi> was not a little ſurpriz'd with
this <hi>Billette;</hi> however, he cou'd hardly reſolve
to forbear his accuſtom'd Viſits to <hi>Ardelia,</hi>
at firſt; but upon more mature Conſideration,
he only choſe to converſe with her by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which ſtill preſs'd her to be mindful of
her Promiſe, and of the Hour, not taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of any Caution that he had receiv'd of
her Treachery. To which ſhe ſtill return'd,
in Words that might aſſure him of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</p>
                  <p>The Dreadful Hour wanted not a Quarter
of being perfect when Don <hi>Henrique</hi> came;
and having fix'd his Rope-Ladder to that part
of the Garden-Wall where he was expected,
<hi>Ardelia,</hi> who had not ſtir'd from that very
Place for a quarter of an hour before, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to aſcend by it; which ſhe did, as ſoon
as his Servant had turn'd and fix'd it on the
inner ſide of the Wall; on the top of which,
at a little diſtance, ſhe found another faſten'd,
for her to deſcend on the out-ſide; whilſt
Don <hi>Henrique</hi> eagerly waited to receive her.
She came at laſt and flew into his Arms;
which made <hi>Henrique</hi> cry out in a Rapture,
<hi>Am I atlaſt once more happy, in having my</hi> Ardelia
<hi>in my poſſeſſion!</hi> She, who knew his Voice,
and now found ſhe was betray'd, but knew not
by whom, ſhriek'd out, <hi>I am Ruin'd! Help!

                     <hi>Looſe me!</hi> At that very moment, and at thoſe

one Servant, and hearing <hi>Henrique</hi> reply, <hi>Not
all the Powers of Hell ſhall ſnatch you from me;</hi>
drawing his Sword, without one word, made
a furious Paſs at him; but his Rage and Haſte
miſguided his Arm, for his Sword went quite
through <hi>Ardelia</hi>'s Body, who only ſaid, <hi>Ah,
wretched Maid!</hi> and dropt from <hi>Henrique</hi>'s
Arms, who then was oblig'd to quit her, to
preſerve his own Life, if poſſible; however, he

                  <head>THE
ADVENTURE
OF THE
Black Lady.</head>
                  <p>ABout the beginning of laſt <hi>June</hi> (as
near as I can remember) <hi>Bellamora</hi>
came to Town from <hi>Hampſhire;</hi> and
was oblig'd to lodge the firſt Night
at the ſame Inn where the Stage-Coach ſet up.
The next Day ſhe took Coach for <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi>
where ſhe thought to find Madam <hi>Brightly,</hi> a
Relation of her's; with whom ſhe deſign'd to
continue for about half a Year undiſcover'd, if
poſſible, by her Friends in the Country: And
order'd therefore her Trunk, with her Cloaths,
and moſt of her Money and Jewels, to be brought
after her to Madam <hi>Brightly</hi>'s, by a ſtrange Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whom ſhe ſpoke to in the Street as ſhe was
taking Coach; being utterly unacquainted with
the neat Practices of this fine City. When ſhe
came to <hi>Bridges-ſtreet,</hi> where indeed her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin
had lodged near three or four Years ſince;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47213:282"/>
ſhe was ſtrangely ſurpriz'd that ſhe cou'd not
learn any thing of her; no, nor ſo much as
meet with any one that had ever heard of her
Couſin's Name. Till, at laſt, deſcribing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Brightly</hi> to one of the Houſe-keepers in that
place, he told her, that there was ſuch a kind
of Lady, whom he had ſometimes ſeen there
about a Year and a half ago; but that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
ſhe was married and remov'd towards
<hi>So-ho.</hi> In this Perplexity ſhe quite forgot her
Trunk and Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and wander'd in her
Hackney-Coach all over St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Pariſh; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
for Madam <hi>Brightly,</hi> ſtill deſcribing her
Perſon, but in vain; for no Soul cou'd give
her any Tale or Tidings of ſuch a Lady. After
ſhe had thus fruitleſly rambled, till ſhe, the
Coachman, and the very Horſes were e'en tir'd,
by good Fortune for her, ſhe happen'd on a
private-Houſe, were lived a good, diſcreet,
ancient Gentlewoman, who was fallen a little
to decay, and was forc'd to let Lodgings for
the beſt part of her Livelihood: From whom
ſhe underſtood, that there was ſuch a kind of
a Lady who had lain there ſomewhat more
than a Twelve-month, being near three Months
after ſhe was married: But that ſhe was now
gone abroad with the Gentleman her Husband;
either to the Play, or to take the freſh Air;
and ſhe believ'd, wou'd not return till Night.
This Diſcourſe of the good Gentlewoman's ſo
elevated <hi>Bellamora</hi>'s drooping Spirits, that
after ſhe had begg'd the Liberty of ſtaying
there till they came home, ſhe diſcharg'd
the Coachman in all haſte, ſtill forgetting
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:282"/>
her Trunk, and the more valuable Furniture
of it.</p>
                  <p>When they were alone, <hi>Bellamora</hi> deſired ſhe
might be permitted the Freedom to ſend for a
Pint of Sack; which, with ſome little Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
was at laſt allow'd her. They began
then to chat for a matter of half an hour of
things indifferent: And, at length the ancient
Gentlewoman ask'd the Fair Innocent (I muſt
not ſay Fooliſh) one, of what Country, and
what her Name was: To both which ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
very <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>truly;</hi> tho' it might
have prov'd, not <hi>diſcreetly.</hi> She then inquir'd
of <hi>Bellamora</hi> if her Parents were living, and the
Occaſion of her coming to Town. The Fair
Unthinking Creature replied, That her Father
and Mother were both dead: And that ſhe had
eſcap'd from her Uncle, under pretence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Viſit to a young Lady, her Couſin who
was lately married, and liv'd above Twenty
Miles from her Uncle's in the Road to <hi>London;</hi>
and, that the Cauſe of her quitting the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
was to avoid the hated Importunities of a
Gentleman, whoſe pretended Love to her ſhe
fear'd had been her eternal Ruine. At which ſhe
wept and ſigh'd moſt extravagantly. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Gentlewoman endeavour'd to comfort
her by all the ſofteſt and moſt powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in her Capacity; promiſing her all the
friendly Aſſiſtance that ſhe cou'd expect from
her, during <hi>Bellamora</hi>'s ſtay in Town; which
ſhe did with ſo much Earneſtneſs and viſible
Integrity, that the pretty innocent Creature
was going to make her a full and real Diſcovery
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:283"/>
of her imaginary, inſupportable Misfortunes;
and (doubtleſs) had done it; had ſhe not been
prevented by the Return of the Lady, whom
ſhe hop'd to have found her Couſin <hi>Brightly.</hi>
The Gentleman her Husband juſt ſaw her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Doors, and order'd the Coach to drive to
ſome of his Bottle-Companions; which gave
the Women the better Opportunity of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
one another, which happen'd to be
with ſome Surprize on all ſides. As the Lady
was going up to her Apartment, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
of the Houſe told her there was a young
Lady in the Parlour, who came out o' the
Country that very Day on purpoſe to viſit her:
The Lady ſtept immediately to ſee who it was,
and <hi>Bellamora</hi> approaching to receive her hop'd
for Couſin, ſtopp'd on the the ſuddain juſt as ſhe
came to her; and ſigh'd out aloud, Ah, Madam
I am loſt.—It is not your Ladyſhip I ſeek.
No, Madam (return'd t'other) I am apt to
think you did not intend me this Honour. But
you are as welcome to me, as you could be to the
deareſt of your Acquaintance: Have you forgot
me, Madam <hi>Bellamora?</hi> (continued ſhe) that
Name ſtartled both the other: However, It
was with a kind of Joy. Alas! Madam, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the young one) I now remember that I
have been ſo happy to have ſeen you: But
where, and when, my Memory can't ſhew me.
'Tis indeed ſome Years ſince: (return'd the
Lady) But of that another time.—Mean
while, if you are unprovided of a Lodging, I dare
undertake, you ſhall be welcome to this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman.
The Fair Unfortunate return'd her
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47213:283"/>
Thanks; and whilſt a Chamber was preparing
for her, the Lady entertain'd her in her own.
About Ten a Clock they parted, <hi>Bellamora</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conducted to her new Lodging by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of the Houſe, who then left her to take
what Reſt ſhe cou'd amidſt her ſo many ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Misfortunes; returning to the other Lady,
who deſir'd her to ſearch into the Cauſe of
<hi>Bellamora</hi>'s Retreat to Town.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning the good Gentlewoman
of the Houſe coming up to her, found <hi>Bellamora</hi>
almoſt drown'd in Tears, which by many kind
and ſweet Words ſhe at laſt ſtopp'd; and asking
whence ſo great Signs of Sorrow ſhou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
vow'd a moſt profound Secrecy if ſhe
wou'd diſcover to her their Occaſion; which,
after ſome little Reluctancy, ſhe did, in this
manner:</p>
                  <p>I was courted (ſaid ſhe) above three Years
ago, when my Mother was yet living, by one
Mr. <hi>Fondlove,</hi> a Gentleman of a good Eſtate, and
true Worth; and one who, I dare believe, did
then really love me: He continu'd his Paſſion
for me, with all the earneſt and honeſt Sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
imaginable, till ſome Month's before my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Death; who at that time, was moſt deſirous
to ſee me diſpos'd of in Marriage to another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
of a much better Eſtate than Mr. <hi>Fond-love:</hi>
But one, whoſe Perſon and Humour did
by no means hit with my Inclinations: And this
gave <hi>Fondlove</hi> the unhappy Advantage over me.
For, finding me one Day all alone in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and lying on my Bed, in as mournful and
wretched a Condition, to my <hi>then</hi> fooliſh Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:284"/>
as <hi>now</hi> I am; He urg'd his Paſſion
with ſuch Violence and accurſed Succeſs for
me, with reiterated Promiſes of Marriage,
whenever I pleas'd to challenge 'em, which he
bound with the moſt ſacred Oaths and moſt
dreadful Execrations; that partly with my
Averſion to the other, and partly with my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to <hi>pity him,</hi> I <hi>ruin'd my ſelf.</hi>—Here
ſhe relaps'd into a greater Extravagance of
Grief than before; which was ſo extreme,
that it did not continue long. When therefore,
ſhe was pretty well come to her ſelf, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Gentlewoman ask'd her, why ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
her ſelf ruin'd? To which ſhe anſwer'd,
I am great with Child by him (Madam) and
wonder you did not perceive it laſt Night.
Alas! I have not a Month to go: I am ſham'd,
ruin'd, and damn'd, I fear, for ever loſt. O,
fie, Madam, think not ſo: (ſaid t'other) For
the Gentleman may yet prove true, and marry
you. Ay, Madam, (replied <hi>Bellamora</hi>) I doubt
not that he wou'd marry me; for, ſoon after
my Mother's Death, when I came to be at my
own Diſpoſal, which happen'd about two
Months after, he offer'd, nay, moſt earneſtly
ſollicited me to it, which ſtill he perſerveres to
do. This is ſtrange! (return'd 'tother) And
it appears to me to be your own Fault, that
you are yet miſerable. Why did you not, or
why will you not conſent to your own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
Alas! alas! (cry'd <hi>Bellamora</hi>) 'Tis the
only thing I <hi>dread</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World: For, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
he can never love me after: Beſides, ever
ſince, I have abhorr'd the Sight of him: And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47213:284"/>
this is the only Cauſe that obliges me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
my Uncle, and all my Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Country, hoping this <hi>populous</hi> and
<hi>publick</hi> Place to be moſt <hi>private,</hi> eſpecially, (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)
in your Houſe, and in your Fidelity and
Diſcretion. Of the laſt you may aſſure your
ſelf, Madam, (ſaid t'other:) But what Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
have you made for the Reception of the
young Stranger that you carry about you. Ah,
Madam! (cry'd <hi>Bellamora</hi>) you have brought
to mind another Misfortune: Then ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
her with the ſuppos'd Loſs of her
Money and Jewels, telling her withal, that ſhe
had but three Guinea's and ſome Silver left, and
the Rings ſhe wore, in her preſent Poſſeſſion.
The good Gentlewoman of the Houſe told her,
ſhe wou'd ſend to inquire at the Inn where ſhe
lay the firſt Night ſhe came to Town; for,
(happily) they might give ſome account of the
Porter to whom ſhe had intruſted her Trunk;
and withal repeated her Promiſe of all the
Help in her Power, and for that time left her
much more compos'd than ſhe found her. The
good Gentlewoman went directly to the other
Lady, her Lodger, to whom ſhe recounted
<hi>Bellamora</hi>'s mournful Confeſſion: At which the
Lady appear'd mightily concern'd: And at
laſt, ſhe told her Land-lady, that ſhe wou'd
take Care that <hi>Bellamora</hi> ſhould lie in according
to her Quality: For, (added ſhe) the Child (it
ſeems) is my own Brothers.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as ſhe had din'd, ſhe went to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
and bought Child-bed Linen; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
that <hi>Bellamora</hi> might not have the leaſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:285"/>
of it: And at her Return diſpatch'd a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to her Brother <hi>Fondlove</hi> in <hi>Hantſhire,</hi> with
an Account of every particular; which ſoon
brought him up to Town, without ſatisfying
any of his or her Friends with the Reaſon of
his ſudden Departure; mean while, the good
Gentlewoman of the Houſe had ſent to the <hi>Star-Inn</hi>
on <hi>Fiſh-ſtreet-hill,</hi> to demand the Trunk;
which ſhe rightly ſuppos'd to have been carried
back thither: For, by good Luck, it was a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that plyed thereabouts who brought it to
<hi>Bellamora</hi>'s Lodgings that very Night, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to her. <hi>Fondlove</hi> no ſooner got to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
but he poſts to his Siſter's Lodgings,
where he was advis'd not to be ſeen of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamora</hi>
till they had work'd farther upon her,
which the Land-Lady began in this manner;
ſhe told her that her things were miſcarried,
and ſhe fear'd loſt; that ſhe had but little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
her ſelf, and if the Overſeers of the poor
(juſtly ſo call'd from their over-looking 'em)
ſhou'd have the leaſt Suſpicion of a ſtrange and
unmarried Perſon, who was entertain'd in her
Houſe big with Child and ſo near her time as
<hi>Bellamora</hi> was, ſhe ſhou'd be troubled, if they
cou'd not give Security to the Pariſh of twenty
or thirty Pound that they ſhou'd not ſuffer by
her, which ſhe cou'd not; or otherwiſe, ſhe
muſt be ſent to the Houſe of Correction, and
her Child to a Pariſh-Nurſe. This Diſcourſe
one may imagine, was very dreadful to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of her Youth, Beauty, Education, Family
and Eſtate: However, ſhe reſolutely proteſted,
that ſhe had rather undergo all this, than be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:285"/>
expos'd to the Scorn of her Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Country. The other told her then,
that ſhe muſt write down to her Uncle a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
Letter, as if ſhe were juſt going aboard
to <hi>Pacquet-boat</hi> for <hi>Holland;</hi> that he might not
ſend to inquire for her in Town, when he ſhou'd
underſtand ſhe was not at her new-married
Couſin's in the Country, which accordingly ſhe
did, keeping her ſelf a cloſe Priſoner to her
Chamber; where ſhe was daily viſited by <hi>Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi>'s
Siſter and the Land-Lady, but by no Soul
elſe, the firſt diſſembling the Knowledge ſhe
had of her Misfortunes. Thus ſhe continued
for above three Weeks; not a Servant being
ſuffer'd to enter her Chamber, ſo much as to
make her Bed, leſt they ſhou'd take Notice of
her great Belly: But for all this Caution, the
Secret had taken Wind, by the means of an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
of the other Lady below, who had
over-heard her ſpeaking of it to her Husband.
This ſoon got out 'o Doors and ſpread abroad,
till it reach'd the long Ears of the Wolves
of the Pariſh; who next day deſign'd to give
her an ungrateful Viſit: But <hi>Fondlove,</hi> by good
Providence, prevented it; who, the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
was uſher'd into <hi>Bellamora</hi>'s Chamber by
his Siſter, his Brother-in-Law, and the Land-Lady.
At the ſight of him ſhe had like to have
ſwoon'd away: But he taking her in his Arms,
began again, as he was wont to do, with Tears in
his Eyes, to beg that ſhe wou'd marry him e'er
ſhe was delivered; if not for his, nor her own,
yet for the Child's ſake, which ſhe hourly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
that it might not be born out of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47213:286"/>
and ſo be made uncapable of inheriting
either of their Eſtates; with a great many more
preſſing Arguments on all ſides: To which at
laſt ſhe conſented; and an honeſt officious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
whom they had before provided, was
call'd up, who made an end of the Diſpute:
So to Bed they went together that Night; and
next Day to the Exchange, for ſeveral pretty
Buſineſſes that Ladies in her Condition want.
Whilſt they were abroad, came the Vermin
of the Pariſh, (I mean, the Overſeers of the
poor, who eat the Bread from 'em) to ſearch
for a young Black-hair'd Lady (for ſo was <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomora</hi>)
who was either brought to bed, or juſt
ready to lie down. The Land-Lady ſhew'd
'em all the Rooms in her Houſe, but no ſuch
Lady cou'd be found. At laſt ſhe bethought her
ſelf, and led 'em into her Parlour, where ſhe
open'd a little Cloſet-door, and ſhew'd 'em her
Black Cat that had juſt kitten'd; aſſuring 'em,
that <hi>ſhe</hi> ſhou'd never trouble the Pariſh as long
as ſhe had Rats or Mice in the Houſe, and ſo
diſmiſs'd 'em like Logger-heads as they came.</p>
