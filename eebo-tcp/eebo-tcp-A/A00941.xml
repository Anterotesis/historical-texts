         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As for my matters, I haue nothing newe whereof to giue you intelligence.

I, my studies, al my labour, care, trauell, diligence: for end, all my mynde haue I founded, fastened, and fired vpon <hi>Milo</hi> his Consulship, wherin I haue determined, not onely to séeke for the commoditie of the office in his behalfe, but also as I ought, for the due praise of pietie. And surely, I thinke no man at any time hath béene so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his health and wealth, as I haue béene of his renoune and honour: in the which I haue béene resolued, my self and all myne to consist. I knowe that you, being but one man, can, if you will, be to him such a furtheraunce and helpe, as ouer &amp; beside the same we néed demaund nothing. We haue al these adiuments and helpes: the loue of good men, obteined through his behauiour in the protectourship of the people, for our cause, as I hope you vnderstand: the desire of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons and multiude, by reason of his <note n="*" place="margin">Wherevpon Milo spent three whole patrimonies or inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> large giftes and presentes, and the liberal disposition of his nature: the fauour and good will of the honourable youth of this citie, and of diuers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who haue giuen him their consentes: finally, our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragation, or consenting voices, though lesse auailable, yet not disalowable, but iustly <note n="*" place="margin">For the friendly vsage which he hath shewed vnto me.</note> deserued, and therefore peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture worthy acceptation.

Wherefore, if you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this opinion of me, that I am not a man vnmindfull of my friende, that I am disposed to courtesie and goodnesse, if there were none other cause of such conceit, then that I lay to my helping hand so earnestly, for <hi>Milo</hi> his furtherance, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if you are of this iudgement, that such benefites as you

And as for my selfe, my worthinesse, honour, dignitie, and renowne, shall by your meanes so much be inlarged, as I must (perforce) acknowledge you to be the very same my benefactour, in the procurement of my praise, that wast sometime the pawne and protectour of <note n="*" place="margin">When you spared no pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me to my natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</note> my life. But that I am assured, that it is not vnknowne to you, how seriously and earnestly I labour in this petition of <hi>Milo,</hi> and that therein not only great paines, but also some resistance and striuing is required, I would haue written vnto you more at length: And now I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit to your patronage the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the cause, and mine own person I commend to your courteste.

With this <hi>Crassus</hi> sometime was <hi>Apollonius</hi> in seruice, of whome, whiles his maister liued, I made great account, and might in no wise disallow of his doings: for he was very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect &amp; studious in his masters businesse, &amp; a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous moete to serue his turne at al assayes: for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which cause <hi>Crassus</hi> loued him accordingly.

I doubt not but he is able to comprehend as much as he pretendeth, and that he can bring his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, in that case, to perfection. He lacketh no learning: he lackes not experience: it is not long, since he was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in the like kinde of knowledge and practise: very earnest is he, to satisfie the eternitie of your puisance, and by his pen to decypher your praises in perpetuall recordes: Now haue you a witnesse and testimonial of mine opinion touching <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius:</hi> of whom, I trust, you will according to the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie of your discretion, conceiue certaine iudgement: and therafter giue him a taste of your courtesie: And yet againe, I commend him vnto you, whereof I made a former denial, protesting, that in what respect soeuer it shall please you to be his fauourer and furtherer, I my self shal account it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy double acceptation.</p>

               <p>Neyther am I wide from wit, and voide of iudgement, or rather so madde and phantasticall, to desire his assistaunce for my preferment, to the purchasing of perpetuall honour, who, whiles he is so occupied, winneth not to him self, by the noblenesse of his learning, euerlasting renoune. For that great <hi>Alexander</hi> was not carried away with a blinde affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he would haue none paint out the portraiture of his bodie, but <hi>Apelles,</hi> and none to make his image in metal, saue <hi>Licippus:</hi> but reason and iudgement bred that conceit in his minde, bycause he thought, that they being most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and incomparable artificers, should not only in the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of their skill make him glorious, but them selues also passing famous. And those forenamed workmen of singular worthinesse, made such persons, by their pictures and sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures most liuely proportioned, so far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being strange, that they were well knowne to such as neuer sawe them: which thing, although they had not by cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning compassed: yet should

For that smal pamphlet of <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> penned in the prayse of the same king, is of such suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie, that it surpasseth all the pictures shadowed with the painters pencill, and all images of the caruer or grauer smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed and fined with his chosen instruments. And surely this shall séeme to me a thing of great excellencie, both to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation of my mynde, and also to the remembraunce of my dignitie, if I may be described by your pen, then portraied by their skil, or set out in the volumes of any other whatsoeuer: not only, for that you should in setting me out, giue a note of your rare wit and profound knowledge: as Timaeus did, in the behalfe of <hi>Timoleon:</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> for the aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Themistocles:</hi> but bycause you by your authoritie and countenaunce, being a man of great acceptation, and in causes of weight very well knowne to the common wealth, may procure me the more renoune: that I do not only heare that sound of puisance and dexteritie, that blast I say of honor &amp; high worship, which <hi>Alexander</hi> when he entred into <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> did say that <hi>Homer</hi> ascribed to <hi>Achilles:</hi> but that I may possesse and inioy that pension of prayse, which hath issue, not only from the testimonie of a man of<note n="*" place="margin">It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to doe notable feats, but an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent writer is requisite also to record the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> great knowledge, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and grauitie, but also of honour, noblenesse, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.

Now when they were frustrate of all confidence, &amp; readie to be (as it were) deuoured in despaire, it was manifest to all men, and maruelous apparant, that their minds were excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly molested, and tooke their repulse very vnpatiently.

And thus much I had to say, concerning the offence of foolishnesse and importunacie.

But, although you had not ben resolued in any of the aboue cited circumstances, neither yet had receiued into the libertie of their countrie, any person proscript and banished: yet notwithstanding, I would thinke it much for your commoditie, if, to them, of whome I write at this present, you shewe your selues so beneficiall, as to bouchsafe them restitution to their countrie.

               <p>AFter that the heauie and ruthfull newes of my sonnes death, had pearced into mine eares, I was so ful of grief, sorrowe, and anguish of heart, that I remembred myne own mortalitie, and considered also that his entraunce into this wretched worlde, was like the state of a soiourner in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Inne, that when so euer it pleased God, to call him out of this painful pilgrimage, he might passe into the paradise of heauenly pleasure, the ioyes whereof are not subiect to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but coupled with euerlastingnesse.

And, if I may speake what I thinke without offence, learning is the mother of vertue, bycause from her principally vertue doth procéede: Learning giueth vnderstanding of all thinges, as well of heauenly preceptes and Oracles, as also of all other sciences by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wit of man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, out of which, as out of a cleare and hoalesome spring, we can drawe nothing but that which is vertuous, but that whiche is honest, but that whiche in all respectes is allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Touching the order of his education, histories most plentifully make sundrie and straunge declarations: For, he was not onely trayned in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of actiuitie, but also in the knowledge of sciences li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, and specially in Khetorique and Philosophie: then which two necessarie stayes, the first seruing the bodie, the second seruing the mynde, nothing for a king or noble man more conuenient. In actiuitie he did excell (considering his person, and his descent): For it is sayde of him that in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he was singular, and in ryding not to be amended: and though his father <hi>Philippe,</hi> in this laste qualitie, did weare (as they say) the golden spurres, yet his sonne <hi>Alexander</hi> did better deserue them, sithence his knowledge in that Art, was (as it séemed) much more assured, and his cunning grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

As for other properties to the bodie belonging, it is no question to be asked, whether he had them or no: For, it is not an vnlike reason, that he, in whome the greatest and the best thinges were to be founde, shoulde want the lest and the baser. Concerning his person, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, his proportion, and suche like things requisite in a noble man, they did al concurre in him, and nothing did lacke y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> might make him amiable. He was ruddie coloured, much like the damaske rose, not only in his face, but throughout al

and euery part of his body: insomuch that whosoeuer looked vppon him, and beheld his countenance, they might wel mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile at the vniformitie that nature kept, in frameing so goodly a creature. His complexion was of the perfectest, and soundest, &amp; as for his proportion and making, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him that was out of square, but euery ioynte and limme, both in measure and in place, verie formall, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing hansome.

                  <hi>Alexander,</hi> as hée was furnished with externall giftes, beautifying and well beséeming his bodie: so his minde was garnished with all maner of vnderstanding. For, as hée was a Prince of rare renowne, so had hée to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him, a Philosopher without peere, (<hi>Aristotle</hi> I meane, of whose fame al places of learning doe ring at this day) who taught him not onely morall preceptes touching humanitie, but other secrete sciences, which hée did impart but to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fewe, the same being special persons, among whom <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> was one. O happie Prince whose lucke it was to haue such a maister: and O no lesse fortunate Philosopher, in whose lapp the lott fell to haue so noble a scholer.

might flourish throughout all posterities. This citie he called after his owne name, which he built in such a plott of land, as a better, neither for pleasauntnesse, nor commoditie, might be chosen in all that region. Thus procéeding from wor thinesse to worthinesse, from renowne to renowne, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as it were by steppes, he became so famous, that all the world heard of the déedes of <hi>Alexander,</hi> counting him rather a God, then a man.

Nowe, to ende with that, wherein I should haue begunne, namely, the ornamentes of his minde, which proued him a noble gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in déede: it is manifest in all that was written of him, how studious and painefull he was, to be seene in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the sciences liberall, and no lesse earnest and desirous to put that in experience, wherein he was instructed.

In the mysteries of nature he laboured so diligently, being taught of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that there was kindled in him such a meruailous delight, that he could not abide, others to be communicants and partakers of that which hee knewe, but himselfe to haue the vnderstanding of

that onely and alone, whereof others should be ignoraunt. In the art of Physick he did profite wonderfully, not in that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which consisteth in speculation, but in that also which is altogether occupied in practise &amp; experience: in so much that when he was but sixtéene yeares of age, he was able to doe such things, as men of greater age, and longer practise, could not compasse, neither by knowledge nor cunning.
