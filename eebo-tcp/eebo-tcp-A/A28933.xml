            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SIR,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE wonders that God has done by Your Ministry in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> makes me hope that the History of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> will not be unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and makes me take the liberty of presenting Your Majesty with it. You will in it, as in a fine mirror, clearly see the wonders God has done for the preservation the of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and the calm they enjoyed from the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles when they received the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel, till the year
<pb facs="tcp:62674:3"/>
1488, that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the VIII. caused the <hi>Croisade</hi> to be published against them. The number of those that took upon them the Badge of the Cross, were 18000 men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Troops, and 8000 Voluntiers of <hi>Piemont,</hi> which were all intirely defeated by a handful of <hi>Vaudois.</hi> Ever since that time they have been continually persecuted and disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with cruel wars: But as they fought the battel of God in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his truth, so it visibly appeared that the God of battel was with them, and fought for them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whose aid it had been impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to have performed such extraordinary exploits, and gained so many victories over their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who were often times twenty or thirty, sometimes a hundred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one. Your Majesty shall see the cruel persecutions that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Gospel have made them to undergo, and the constancy with which the Martyrs have sealed this
<pb facs="tcp:62674:3"/>
Celestial Verity with their Blood. If the Enemies had any advantage over them, it was only then in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Publick Faith, which should be inviolably sacred among men. In conclusion, Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty will be astonished, how so few have been able to subsist in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys of <hi>Piemont,</hi> till the year 1686, being surrounded with such puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Enemies, cruel, full of diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal artifices, without Faith, without Law; but if their subsisting be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, their return and re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment is no less: One may see every where that it's the work of God and not of men. I could not, Sir, address this my Little Work better to any than to Your Majesty, who has seen the God of Armies march before you, as anciently he marched before the Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> and as he marched, and yet marches before them who are the subject of this History. You maintain, as they, Sir, the Cause of God, and
<pb facs="tcp:62674:4"/>
you fight for his Truth, and there is no doubt but that he is with you, and fights for you, and with you; the happy success of Your Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes puts it beyond all doubt. I pray God with all my heart, that he may preserve Your Majestys Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Person, that he may give you a flourishing and happy Kingdom, and bless all Your Just Designs to his Honour and Glory; this is the Ardent Prayer of him, who with the most profound respect, is</p>

            <p>OF all the people that ever have been, from the Creation of the world till our times, there is none except the ancient people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whose History contains so many wonders as this of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont;</hi> for whether one consider their Perseverance in the profession of the holy doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, or one reflects upon the wars they have maintained these <hi>200</hi> years, to preserve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the Purity of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; one sees so many miracles of Wisdom, Goodness, and Power of God, that it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible not to confess, that God has declared himself plainly to be the God of this people, and that he is the Protector and Defender of their Persons, as well as Religion.</p>
            <p>We learn from the Holy Scripture, that the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom God had chosen above all the people of the Earth, to be his people, and in favour of whom he had done so many miracles in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62674:5"/>
and the Wilderness; often fell into Idolatry and polluted thimselves with the abominations of the Heathens, that dwelt round about them, but we do not find that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> did ever fall into Idolatry, after they were once planted in the field of the Church; we likewise see, that many Heresies were introduced into the Primitive Church by the craft of Satan, as those of the <hi>Eutichians, Nestorians,</hi> and above all that of the <hi>Arians;</hi> but we can never discover that any of these Heresies took footing in the Valleys of <hi>Piemont;</hi> and when all the world ran after the Beast of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse,</hi> after the great Harlot, with whom the Kings of the Earth have committed Whoredom, and who with her wine made all the Inhabitants of the Earth drunk; the Churches of <hi>Piemont</hi> only followed Iesus Christ, and inviolably adhered to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. So the Valleys had antiently for their arms, a Torch environed with thick Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with this Motto, <hi>Lux lucet in tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris,</hi> Light shines in darkness; and as all <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> was covered over with palpable Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, only in the Land of <hi>Goshen</hi> shined a clear bright Light, even so, as long as the Christian world was covered over with the Darkness of Idolatry and Errors, there were only the Churches of <hi>Piemont that were illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with the clear light of the Gospel.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62674:5"/>
Now how was it possible that this celestial verity should be preserved pure in these Valleys even to our times, if God, by his infinite power, and adorable wisdom, had not hindred Satan from sowing his Cockle in the mystical Field of his Church, to corrupt as he had done in other places, the good seed of his word, by the mixture of humane Traditions and Pagan Ceremonies, which have corrupted sound Doctrine; and that which is the greatest cause of admiration, is, that these Valleys are scituated in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the great Whore has her Seat, and the Princes of <hi>Piemont</hi> are subject to her Empire.</p>
            <p>As to the wars that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> have maintained against their Enemies, who rose against them to destroy them, and to extinguish the bright Lamp of the Gospel; they are all full of Miracles, where one may see a handful of men, conducted by Chieftains of no military experience, put to flight great Armies, commanded by the most valiant and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Captains of the Age; their Enemies were <hi>20</hi> and <hi>30</hi> and sometimes <hi>100</hi> against one. Now how was it possible they should have got so many signal victories, if the God of Battle had not fought for them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them? If God had not given them a most singular Courage, and had not confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Enemies, and struck them with a
<pb facs="tcp:62674:6"/>
pannick fear; but that which is the fullest of miracles, and the greatest cause of Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is, that neither so many wars raised, by their Enemies, during the space of <hi>200</hi> years, nor so many Battels they have fought during those long and bloody wars, nor the cruel Persecutions they have endured, nor the diabolical artifices of the Emissaries of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ have been able to destroy or to dissipate these poor Churches, till the year <hi>1686.</hi> when Perfidiousness and Treachery triumphed over their Innocence.</p>

               </gap> Valleys, during so long a space of time, and among so many obstacles be full of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, their return and re-establishment is not less miraculous.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who were leagued together to destroy them and drive them out of the Valleys, joyned together to oppose their return and re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nine hundred <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and some Refugees of <hi>France</hi> pass the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> enter into <hi>Savoy,</hi> cross an Enemies Country of <hi>14</hi> or <hi>15</hi> days journey, force many difficult passes and defiles guarded with a Force far greater than theirs, and in spight of all those rubs, they repossessed themselves of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and while that these two Princes, who are the bitterest and cruelest Enemies of the
<pb facs="tcp:62674:6"/>
               <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and breathed nothing but their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation and ruine, were joining their arms to execute their project, God blasts their designs, and reduces all into Smoak; he sows a great division betwixt those two great Friends, they become great Enemies, and turn their arms one against the other: In conclusion, in despight of their intrigues, God established the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> in their own Country, even by order of their Prince, who excused himself to them, for intreating them so ill, and imputed the cause of it to the King of <hi>France; </hi>and of those the Duke designed for destruction, he has made his principal Rampart against <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The surprising wonders that God has done for them, and the surprising changes and chances that have hapned to them, are in short, and truly represented in this Book, in which we speak first of all of their Original. Secondly, Of their Religion, which they have preserved pure from the time of the Apostles even to our times.

So we see the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of <hi>Bohemia</hi> were at first called <hi>Picards,</hi> because they came out of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi> the place of their ancient habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Taborites</hi> were likewise so called from the City <hi>Tabor,</hi> the place of their ordinary residence; and the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses</hi> were so called because they inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the City of <hi>Albi,</hi> which was full of Protestants, against which the Pope declared (as they most impiously phrased it) a holy War to destroy them. From the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont</hi> are descended the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Province,</hi> which is near <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi> Where some of them took up their habitation, and sow'd their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and from <hi>Province</hi> they spread themselves into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where they made a wonderful progress.</p>
            <p>This shows that the <hi>Vandois</hi> of <hi>Piemont</hi> did not derive themselves from <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi> for after that <hi>Valdo</hi> or <hi>Waldo</hi> was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62674:7"/>
driven out of <hi>Lyons</hi> by the Archbishop, according to the order he had received from the Pope, he did not retire into <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emont</hi> but into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he sow'd the doctrine of the Gospel, which spread it self into <hi>Picardy,</hi> which joyns to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> These poor People being persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King of <hi>France,</hi> retire into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and for that reason were called <hi>Picards,</hi> because they came out of <hi>Picardy;</hi> this we learn from <hi>D' Aubigni</hi> in his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal History, where he says that those of the remnant of <hi>Waldo</hi> who fled into <hi>Picardy</hi> did so increase and multiply that to root them out, or at least to weaken them, <hi>Philip Augustus</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> quite destroyed three hundred Gentlemens houses.</p>
            <p>And what is more, and makes the thing evident beyond any doubt, it's proved by authentical Records and Acts that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont,</hi> had protested against the errors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> seventy Years bofore <hi>Waldo</hi> appeared in the world. For <hi>Waldo</hi> did not begin to preach against the Roman Church till the Year 1175, but the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in their own Language, produce divers acts and monuments of affairs relating to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation done in the Year 1100, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62674:8"/>
others in the Year 1120. 70. or 75. Years before <hi>Waldo.</hi> These Acts were saved from the Flames and lamentable Massacre, committed upon these poor people, in the Year 1655. and the originals were put in the hands of Mr <hi>Moreland,</hi> the English Ambassador, and after sent to be kept in the University of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> One may find Copies of them in the general History of the Churches of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> written by <hi>J. Leger</hi> Minister of the <hi>Vallies,</hi> printed at <hi>Lcyden</hi> 1669, and it's not to be doubted but that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont,</hi> had more ancient Acts and Records of their doctrine, which were buried in the ruines of their Churches, by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. In this Book we will only speak of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and not of the descendants of <hi>Peter Waldo.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>Vaudois</hi> or the Inhabitants of the Vallies of <hi>Piemont,</hi> received the Doctrine of the Gospel, in the time of the Apostles, either from the Apostles
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62674:8"/>
themselves, or by those who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly succeeded them.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> being carried Prisoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> sojourned there two Years, during which space he had the Liberty to go round the City, from house to house dragging a Chain after him, which was the Badge of a criminal Prisoner, and there in the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal City, Mistress of the world, he preached the Gospel of Christ, and laid the Foundation of a flourishing Church, to which he writ from <hi>Corinth,</hi> after his departure that excellent Epistle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans:</hi> during his Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he writ many other learned Epistles to <hi>Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians</hi> and <hi>Colossians:</hi> His fame and doctrine sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed high in the Court of the Emperor, as it's clear from the Epistle that he then wrote from <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> where he says, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. that what hapned to him there, proved the great advancement of the Gospel, so that his Bonds in Christ were become famous through all the <hi>Pretorium</hi> (which as every body knows was the Court of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and all other places of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great Apostle having gained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Disciples in this famous City, God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62674:9"/>
made them instruments of planting the Christian Religion in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> which is a part of <hi>Italy.</hi> For the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Church tells us, that those whom God had illuminated with his holy doctrine, burnt with a desire of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting the saving grace, of which they did participate to others.</p>
               <p>It it be true also that St. <hi>Paul</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> as he designed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 24. he took <hi>Rome</hi> in his way, it's not to be doubted, but that if he went by Land he passed through <hi>Piemont,</hi> for it's in the direct way from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Spain.</hi> And if he went by Sea it was not necessary that in going from <hi>Corinth</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> he should pass by <hi>Italy;</hi> but he was at <hi>Corinth</hi> when he writ he had a desire to go into <hi>Spain.</hi> If he had passed through <hi>Piemont,</hi> as in all appearance he did, it's certain he preached there, for he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where where he came.</p>
               <p>Since the Valleys of <hi>Piemont</hi> were enlightned with the bright Rays of the Gospel, the Inhabitants of these Countries have conserved the purity of the Christian Religion without any mixture of humane traditions, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any Images or Altars in their Churches; they never invoked the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62674:9"/>
Angels or Saints, never believed in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, they never acknowledged other mediator than Jesus Christ, nor other merit than that of his Death; One never heard them speak of the Mass, of auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confession, of Abstinence from certain sorts of meat, of the Celibacy of Priests, of the Doctrine of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; they always held the H. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be the perpetual rule of Faith, and would never receive or believe any thing, but what they taught; and their Doctrine was always the same it is now. This is proved clearly from the Acts that were preserved from the Flames, that reduced their Churches and houses into Ashes, among the which, there is one writ in their vulgar tongue in the Year 1100. called the <hi>Lesson,</hi> because it gives the rules of holy living and good works, besides a Catechism of the same Year, where in question and answer are taught the principal mysteries of the Christian Religion, according to the word of God, without any mixture of Traditions; besides an explication of the Lords prayer; in the Year 1120. and an explication of the Apostles Creed, with several passages of the H. Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining ever article; to which is joyned
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62674:10"/>
an explication of the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in short; a little book entituled, <hi>A Treatise of Antichrist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These three Acts were made, in the Year 1120. the last of these Treatises shews, that all those are Antichrists that teach Doctrines contrary to the word of God. They confute the doctrine of Prayers for the dead, Purgatory, Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Confession, Abstinence from Flesh, and reject all traditions that are not in the word of God, and are not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it.</p>
               <p>When these acts were made, the Christian doctrine was not corrupted every where, there were then many persons in <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> who wrote against the errors which were by <hi>Rome</hi> and her Doctors introduced into the Church. If the purity of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion had not been conserved in tehse Valleys of <hi>Piemont,</hi> from the time of the Apostles, till the beginning of the Eleventh age, in which these Acts were made, how had it been possible for them to have made so many famous acts in which the purity of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is so clearly taught? If they had before received the errors of <hi>Rome,</hi> by whom, and when were these errors
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62674:10"/>
purg'd out of the Churches of <hi>Piemont?</hi> Who was the Reformer? Where are the Acts that speak of this Reformation, that they may be produced? If there be none, then there was never any reform, and by a clear consequence the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, has remained from the time that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> received it, such as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in those Acts, till the time that these Acts were made.</p>
               <p>In the ninth age, about two hundred years before these acts were made, lived <hi>Claudius</hi> of <hi>Turin,</hi> Bishop of that City and the Valleys, who writ sharply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the errors of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> this Bishop condemned the Invocation of the Saints, the worshipping of Images, of Reliques, and the Cross: he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the doctrine of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning grace, and by consequence he rejected the merit of good works; he taught that the Salvation of mankind doth wholly depend upon the merits and death of Christ; he condemned likewise Pilgrimages made to <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Monks brought into request. His whole Diocess, according to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of a learned man, followed exactly his Doctrine, the Sheep lovingly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Shepherd. The doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62674:11"/>
was not in his time recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>France,</hi> except in some few Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks; the greatest stream of writers did strongly oppose it; they did receive the Communion under both kinds, they did not adore the Sacrament, they read the Holy Scriptures, and taught it their children; they made no direct Prayers to Saints as they have done since; they attributed all to the grace and mercy of God.</p>
               <p>The Christian Religion being pure in <hi>Piemont</hi> in the ninth age, as it appears by the writings of <hi>Claudius</hi> of <hi>Turin;</hi> there is no doubt to be made of its conserving it self so till the eleventh age, in which those acts of which we have spoken were made. So we cannot learn from any Historian that those Valleys were either before or after the time of this great Bishop reformed; and we see clearly by indubitable acts, that two hundred years after the same Religion was in those Valleys in its purity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the allay of humane Traditions and Ceremonies; and the greatest enemies of the <hi>Vandois,</hi> for all their boasting, are not able to shew the contrary.</p>
               <p>But above all, the purity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion appeared by that excellent profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62674:11"/>
of their Faith, made in the year 1120, more than 50 years before <hi>Waldo</hi> of <hi>Lyons.</hi> The Articles are as follow.</p>

It's now 570 years since this confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith was made by the Churches of <hi>Piemont,</hi> at which time all other Churches were corrupted, by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of humane doctrine and Pagan Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; the world at that time being overspread with an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> darkness, and so the Authors of both Religions agree, in calling that age the dark age.</p>
               <p>This confession of Faith being drawn from the writings of the holy Apostles, and in every respect conformable to their Doctrine, it follows, by a necessary consequence that the Religion of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> is the true and pure Religion of the Apostles, and that they have always kept it pure from the first receiving of it till the beginning of the eleventh age, and from thence till these times, since, they now profess the same Faith, and teach the same Doctrine that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that famous confession. All other Churches, both of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> being infected with divers Heresies, Satan for to hinder the advancement of the Reign of Jesus Christ, has from time to time stirred up false Teachers, who have sown their cursed Seed in the field of our Lord, and by their false Doctrine, varnished over with a seeming

C.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied the same thing, there has been false Prophets among the people, as likewise there will be among you false Teachers, who shall privately introduce Sects of perdition, and shall deny the Lord who hath redeemed them, bringing upon them sudden perdition, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shall follow them, by which the ways of Truth shall be blasphemed: But O the wonderful works of God! who has conserved by his wise Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the purity of his Religion in the Valleys of <hi>Piemont,</hi> from the time of the Apostles to our time, by a singular effect of his Goodness towards these poor people of the Vallys, and has hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that Satan by his false Doctors and Teachers could not sow the Cockle of their poysonous Doctrine, in the mystical field of his Church.

out of their. Country, and when and how it was that they were re-established by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> their Soveraign Prince.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> in the second Article of their faith, hold the Holy Scripture for their rule of faith, and so do teach that nothing is to be believed as an Article of Faith that they do not prove by clear proofs of Scripture, and so in the tenth and eleventh Articles they reject all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane traditions as abominations, and they acknowledge only two Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptism and the Eucharist. In the thirteenth Article they give us a scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their doctrine, where they say thus, The Sacraments, according to St. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his City of God, is an invisible grace represented by a visible thing, and they say there is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Behold here also that which is found in the Book of Antichrist, relating to Baptism. This Book was made in the year 1120, as we have said before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:62674:15"/>
Those things which are not necessary in the administration of Baptism are exorcisms, insufflations; the sign of the Cross upon the Head and Breast of the Infant, Salt which is put in the Childs mouth, Spittle into the Ears and Nose, the Crysmatical unction upon the Head, and all such like things consecrated by the Bishops: They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise say it's unnecessary to put a lighted Torch in the Childs hand, and after Baptism to put on it a white garment, or to bless the Water, or to dip it thrice, or to have Godfathers and Godmothers. All these things done in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, they say are not of the substance of Baptism, and by consequence unnecessary.</p>
               <p>Behold likewise here what they say of the Supper of our Lord, in the same Book of Antichrist as Baptism, which is taken visibly, and visibly administred, is, as it were, an enrolling one in the company of the Faithful; and obliges them to follow Jesus Christ, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Commandments, and to live up to the rules of the Gospel; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Holy Supper and the Holy Communion of our Saviour, the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread and the giving of thanks is a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62674:16"/>
visible Communion performed by the members of Jesus Christ: For those that take and break the same bread, are one body and are members one of another, planted in him, to whom they protest and promise to persevere in his service even to the end, without leaving the Faith of the Gospel, or the Union that they have all promised to God, through and by Jesus Christ. And in the same Book of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>The eating of the Sacramental Bread is the eating of the Body of Christ in figure only, <hi>as often as you shall do this, do it in remembrance of me;</hi> for if it were not a Spiritual Eating, Christ would be obliged to be eaten continually, and he in truth eats Christ, who believes in him; and Christ says, That to eat him is to dwell in him.</p>
               <p>From whence it follows that the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> did not believe Transubstantiation, nor the Oral and Corporal Eating of the Body of Christ, but that the signs in the Supper of our Lord remained as they were before in substance, before they were employed to this holy use; and that as often as they received these visible signs by their mouth, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by faith, the vertue and efficacy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62674:16"/>
of the Body of Jesus Christ, broke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross, signified by the breaking of Bread, and of his Blood that was spilt, signified and represented by the pouring of the Wine into the Cup, and that by this action, they celebrated the memory of the death of Christ, and obeyed his Commandment, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> Words that St. <hi>Paul</hi> explains in this manner, <hi>As often as you shall eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, you declare and commemorate the death of the Lord, till he come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Vaudois</hi> have conserved the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Christian Religion, from the time of the Apostles, till the beginning of the Eleventh Age, as we have shewn by their Confession of Faith, which they made at the beginning of that Age, they have not kept it less pure from that time till our days, as we shall prove by another Confession of Faith, which they made in the year 1655.

               </argument>
               <p>BUT if they have succeeded the Apostles, as to their Doctrine, they likewise succeeded it as to the Order and Government of the Church. In the Primitive Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. The Apostles established for the government of it, Elders, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. and Deacons, as we may learn, as well from the book of the Acts of the Apostles, as from their Epistles, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5, 6. the Pastors are likewise called Bishops and Elders, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. they are called Pastors because they are to feed the Flock of Christ, which are his Sheep, with the good Word of God; they are called Bishops, which signifies Inspectors or Watchers, because they are to watch and take care of the Flock which is committed to their charge; they are called Elders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they ought to be Sage and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62674:22"/>
and edifie those that are committed to them by their good life and conduct; and so there were two sorts of Elders in the Primitive Church, the one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in the Government of the Church only, and the other, besides the care they had of the affairs of the Church, took also pains in Preaching and Explaining the Word, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. The Deacons had the care of the Poor, and Pastors, Elders, and Deacons altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the government of the Church. This is the Discipline that the Churches of <hi>Piemont</hi> have always kept, as one may see in their ancient Manuscripts, translated out of their Language into <hi>French,</hi> and treated of succinctly in the Cap. 31. of the First Part of the General History of the Churches of the <hi>Vaudois;</hi> in which writing it's said, the Churches there have always had Pastors, Elders and Deacons to govern them, as they had till the year 1686. when they were dispersed. The Pastors employed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to instruct and exhort the people to live well and holily, and the Pastors, Elders and Deacons altogether watched over their Flock, to banish all vice and scandal. It was requisite that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church should be of a good
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62674:22"/>
Life and holy Conversation, for to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie others by their good Example. There were Schools kept to breed up Youth in piety: There was likewise a particular School for to instruct those that aspired to the Ministry, where was taught Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. They made the young Scholars learn by heart all the Chapters of the Gospels according to St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and all the Canonical Epistles, and a good part of the Writings of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, David,</hi> and the Prophets. There came to this School, young men out of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and other places where the people of God dwelt and retained the profession of the ancient verity, to be instructed in the Ministry.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> were not only pure, as to their Doctrine, but likewise as to their Manners, even their Adversaries witness the same. <hi>Reynerus Sacco,</hi> who was one of the first Inquisitors, imployed by <hi>Rome</hi> against those of the Valleys, speaks thus of them in his Relation which he made of them to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had told that Court that the Sect of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> was the eldest that had ever been, it beginning in the time of the Apostles, or at least of <hi>Sylvester;</hi> he adds touching their Manners, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62674:23"/>
whereas all other Sects did strike the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with horror of their many Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against God, that this of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys made great demonstration of piety, for they live justly before the face of the World: and in Chap. 7. of his Book, he says the <hi>Vaudois</hi> are chast. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident <hi>Du, Thou,</hi> commonly called <hi>Tua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> in Chap 27. of his History, says, that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> observe the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Law, which gives the rule of living holily and piously, they give no entertainment to any sort of Vices in their Assemblies, they have in horror and detest all sorts of unlawful Oaths, Perjuries, Wicked Imprecations, Quarrels, Seditions, Debauches, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, Whoring, Inchantments, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crileges, Thest, Usury, Witchcraft, and the like.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Claudis de Seissel,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Turin,</hi> in the Book he wrote against the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> in the year 1500. confesses in formal terms, that as to their Life and Manners, they live in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproach, observing with all their power the Commandments of God.

               </argument>
               <p>WE cannot find in the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Histories the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> or Christians of the Valleys of <hi>Piemont</hi> were persecuted under the reigns of <hi>Nero, Domitian,</hi> or any other of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Emperors, who so cruelly persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Christians; it's therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that during those cruel persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, many faithful Christians retired unto these Valleys to escape persecution, and to save themselves from the bloody hands of those cruel Butchers, as we saw in <hi>France,</hi> during the last persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that many of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion fled into the Woods, Mountains, and hid themselves in Caverns and Rocks to save themselves from the hands of the cruel and pitiless Dragoons,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62674:24"/>
and to avoid, by their flight, the danger of renouncing their Religion: So the Church, which is represented by the Woman, is at the same time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. described flying into the Wilderness from the fury of the Dragon. And is there a more dreadful Wilderness than the Mountains of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which are covered with Snow eight or nine months of the year, amongst which are these Valleys. It's said, that in the Desart, the Woman had a place prepared of God for her, where she might be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished 1260 days. The Valleys, have they not been the place which God has prepared to keep his Church safe in? since the true Church has been always conserved here from the time of the Apostles, even to our days, without any interruption or want of successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that while the whole world ran after the Beast, only the Inhabitants of these Valleys followed Jesus Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> walked according to the truth of his Gospel. This was the true land of <hi>Goshen,</hi> which only was enlightned with Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial Light, while the New <hi>Aegypt</hi> was all covered over with the thick and palpable darkness of Ignorance and Errors; so they had for their Arms a Torch lighted,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62674:24"/>
surrounded with thick Darkness, with this Inscription, <hi>Lux lucet in Tenebris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which still more perswades us, that these Valleys of <hi>Piemont</hi> was the place which God had prepared to keep his Church in, is, that first of all, these Churches of the Valleys have enjoyed a continual peace and perfect repose, after the beginning of the first age that the Papal Empire began to erect its Throne, till towards the end of the fifteenth age, <hi>viz.</hi> till the year 1487. that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the eighth, made (as they called it) a Holy War against them to destroy them. <hi>Secondly</hi> It was then, when their Enemies would have destroyed them by force of Arms, which they endeavoured several times; but God gave them so great and signal Victories, that it was visible, that the God of Battle, and the Lord of Hosts covered their Heads and fought with them, and for them; and in conclusion, when under pretence of Treaties of Peace, and Solemn Parole that was given them, that they should fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they were lulled asleep and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, where cruel Massacres were made of these poor Innocents, deceived by the perfidiousness and treachery of their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62674:25"/>
Enemies, notwithstanding all these Massacres, Cruelties and Barbarities, which were exercised on their Persons, and ravaging of the Country, burning and spoiling their houses and goods, they could never destroy them, they have always persisted in their holy Religion, and continued firm in the Faith of Jesus Christ, from Father to Son, from Generation to Generation; and as they were faithful to God, God has always protected them and assisted them in their greatest miseries; God by his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power has confounded the designs of their Enemies, and rendred their strongest Efforts inefficacious.</p>
               <p>We have told you that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of of <hi>Piemont</hi> having lived in Peace and and Repose in their Valleys, till the year 1487. which is very true, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Inquisition of the Pope against them, for although the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops of <hi>Turin</hi> and <hi>Ambrun,</hi> to whom the Pope had given commission, to inform themselves of their State and Condition, and to proceed by any manner of way to their Extirpation; and went themselves into the Valleys, and cited divers times their Pastors, and the principal Inhabitants, and took
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62674:25"/>
Informations against them, proceeding against them even to Excommunication: These proceedings, notwithstanding, did them no great harm, nor troubled their repose, for they never appeared before the Inquisitors, and set light of their Excommunication, and rather took it for a mark of Gods blessing upon them, who had distinguished them from other people who followed the Beast, and adored his Image; since they themselves alone, when all the world was in a manner lost, followed and adored Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>And this is very remarkable, that they enjoyed a profound peace, while their Brethren, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>France, Germany, England, Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> were greatly persecuted by the Enemies of the truth of the Gospel; and while the other <hi>Vaudois</hi> were dispersed by Wars and Persecutions, which their Enemies raised against them, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> by a particular effect of the divine Goodness, always were safe in their Valleys, notwithstanding all Wars and Persecutions which were raised against them, till the year 1686. that the two witnesses of the eleventh Chapter of the Apocalypse were entirely vanquished and slain.</p>

                  <p>Of the first War against the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and of the Croisade, which was made against them by Pope <hi>Innocent VIII.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE first War that was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont,</hi> was in the Year 1487. that <hi>Albert de Capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Cremona</hi> and Nuntio of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> VIII. having received Commission from his Master to make a Croisade, or holy war for the utter Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of these poor people. This Papal Commissary excited by Vertue of his Bull, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> Prince of <hi>Piemont,</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> and all the Neighbouring Princes for to aid him, and to lend their Troops for their Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, he mustered an army of 18. thousand men, besides five or six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Voluntiers of <hi>Piemont,</hi> who came in great bodies to joyn this Army: for besides that, the Pope promised all those that should go to this War, a full and entire Indulgence and Remission of their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62674:26"/>
Sins; they were likewise made to hope, they should have the pillage of these Valleys, and the confiscation of all their Goods, who should be dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed.</p>
               <p>This great Army divided it self into several Bodies, to attacque the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in different places, which they did with great Fury: But though the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were but few in number in respect of their Enemies and not so well experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd in warlike Affairs, having lived many Ages in peace, notwithstanding they sustained with an invincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the dangerous Efforts of the inraged Enemy; and God who sought for them, who most ardently invoked him, struck their Enemies with a pannick Fear, in such a manner, that by the aid of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this formidable Army was repulsed, dispersed, and almost intirely defeated: The broken remains of this Army which stayed upon the Frontiers, durst attacque them no more among their Rocks, they contented themselves almost a whole year to make excursions into the open and plain Countries and to keep them always in an Alarm, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly prejudicial to these poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, because they were obliged to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62674:27"/>
always ready armed to keep themselves from surprize; so that they could not till the Earth, from which they drew the subsistence of themselves and their Families.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> VII. Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and Prince of <hi>Piemont,</hi> considering that this war was little honourable to him, seeing the bad success that did ensue, and that it was very prejudicial to his Subjects, and particularly those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, of which a great number perished in the war, and that others were very much exhausted by the Troops which they had entertained and given Subsistence to, was resolved to put an end to it, and to this purpose he ordered that twelve of them should come to <hi>Pignerol,</hi> the place where he then kept his abode, which they having done, he received them kindly, and passed an Act of oblivion of all that had passed during the War, and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them that he acknowledged he had been ill informed, not only of what related to their Persons, but also of their Religion, and declared publickly that he had none so good or so obedient Subjects as the <hi>Vaudois;</hi> he confirmed all their Priviledges and Immunities,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62674:27"/>
and promised them that for the future he would take those measures that they should live in peace.</p>
               <p>The Inquisitors established by the Pope being frustrated of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of prevailing against the <hi>Vaudois</hi> by an open war, take other measures to destroy them. If they went out of their Country, they made them be seized on and put in Prison, making use of the secular power to this end, and when they had them there, they either let them perish there, or else condemned them to Death.</p>
               <p>The Inquisitors likewise by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, forced <hi>Margarite de Foix,</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lady of the Marquesate of <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> to persecute the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that were in her Marquisate; the Persecution was so great and so cruel that these poor Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants were forced to leave house and home and to save themselves in the Valely of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> without carrying any thing off but their precious Souls, there they stayed five years in this miserable Condition, during which time they perpetually plyed the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> with humble Supplications, that he would be pleased to mediate for them, that they might berestored to their own
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62674:28"/>
Country, and that the unjust Usurpers of their Lands and Goods, might be forced to restore: But at last, seeing all Prayers and Submissions did serve to no purpose, because of the opposition of the Pope, the Clergy, and above all of the Inquisitors; they resolved to take up Arms, and to endeavour to repossess themselves of their Lands and Goods, and that which gave them the greater courage and boldness to do it, was because they were chased out by Force, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any order of their Soveraign Lady. This Enterprize was attended with a happy Success, on a sudden they invaded the Usurpers of their Goods, they chased them away and frighted them so, that they never attempted more a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and these poor <hi>Vaudois</hi> after this happy Exploit, for at least a hundred years after, enjoyed a profound Peace and Liberty of their Religion through all the Marquisate.</p>

                  <hi>PHilip</hi> VII. Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> being dead, <hi>Charles</hi> his Son succeeded him. This Prince was mightily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by the Archbishop and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor of <hi>Turin,</hi> to deliver over to the secular power his Subjects of the reformed Religion, he gave commission to <hi>Don Pentaleon Bressour</hi> Lord of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate</hi> to war against them, in the Year 1534.</p>
               <p>This Nobleman having chosen 1500. select men out of all the Troops of the Duke, when the <hi>Vaudois</hi> thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves most secure, having not the least Suspition of their Enemies Intention, he suddenly attacqued them, surprizing, killing, and massacring, all that came in his way, without sparing Age or Sex, which caused a great consternation in these Valleys; but at last these people resuming their innate courage, mustered
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62674:29"/>
together, and put themselves in so good order, that the day following, as their Enemies thought of marching on, and continuing their Butcheries all along the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> they charged them so couragiously in the Rear and in the Front, and in the Flank, that a great number of these Massacrers were killed upon the field, others saved themselves by flight, leaving behind them the booty, and the Prisoners they had taken from the <hi>Vaudois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> saw that the Skin of a <hi>Vaudois</hi> cost him twenty <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> he would not permit they should be any more persecuted by open force of Arms, but that more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret means should be taken, as less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; to bring this about, he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished certain Troops of Highway-men and Assassins, who laid in Ambuscado in places proper for their design, and when the <hi>Vaudois</hi> descended from the Mountains, or went out of the Valleys about their affairs, they were presently seized on; many for a long time fell into these Snares, and became the Prey of those Villains, who after they had ransomed them, notwithstanding took away their lives by most exquisite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

These poor people had recourse to the King, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting him an Humble Petition, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to obtain some favour from this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62674:30"/>
their new Lord and Master, and so much the more because it's the custom among Princes, to pretend a great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and tenderness for their new sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to engage them the more in their service. But this did but worsen their condition, for the King commanded them to live according to the Laws of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, telling them, that if they did not obey his Order, he would severely punish them as obstinate He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, telling them that he did not burn them in <hi>France,</hi> to suffer them in the <hi>Alpes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament of <hi>Turin</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by this severe Answer, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently enjoyned the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to put away from them their Ministers, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in their places Priests, who should come and say Mass to them: They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered it was impossible to obey Orders so contrary to the Word of God; that they were willing to give <hi>Caesar</hi> what appertained to <hi>Caesar,</hi> as they had always done, but that they would likewise give to God the things that belong to God, and that in this case they were resolved, according to the examples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, rather to obey God than man, and rather hold themselves to the Word of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62674:30"/>
God, than the traditions of man.</p>
               <p>The King then having many affairs upon his shoulders, the Parliament judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not proper to undertake an Open War against them, but they contented themselves to give Orders to the Judges and Magistrates to assist vigorously the Monks and Inquisitors, and to burn all the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that should fall into their hands; many laid down their lives this way, but with admirable constancy; above all, <hi>Bartholomew Hector,</hi> who was publickly burnt at <hi>Turin,</hi> in the year 1555. who by an edifying death, drew a flood of tears, even from the multitude of the Papists, and not content only with tears, they greatly murmured, and made sharp invectives against the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Monks and Inquisitors.</p>

               <p>These poor people, seeing themselves upon the brink of ruin and desolation, after their recourse to him who has the heart of Kings in his hand, by their Prayers, Fastings and Humiliations, they went and cast themselves at the feet of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> their Prince, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62674:31"/>
presented an Humble Petition to him, tending to this, that he would let them live, and enjoy a free exercise of their Religion; they presented another of the same tenure to the Dutchess his Wife, who had a great share in the knowledge of truth, and who always shewed a great tenderness for them.</p>
               <p>But it was all to no purpose, the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was extreamly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, because they had contributed their utmost endeavours to re-establish him in his Dominions, sollicited this Prince, very pressingly, to destroy the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who contrary to his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, was easily perswaded, at the desire of the Monks, who continually sollicited him to make War upon them.</p>
               <p>While in the interim, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to sweeten their Prince, and by their humble requests, to turn off the storm which threatned them; the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the neighbouring Towns surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the borough of St. <hi>German,</hi> by the assistance of the darkness of the night; the Protestants of this place, in so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a conjuncture, thought of nothing but saving their persons, the greatest part, in their Shirts, ran to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62674:32"/>
Mountains, except twenty five, who being in the houses that were far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest off, were by consequence the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest from this retreat. These seeing they had not time to fly, cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon their Knees, and making a short but ardent prayer to God in sight of their Enemies, went to attaque them with that courage and resolution, that they put them all to flight, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were killed upon the spot, and God striking the rest with a pannick fear, a great many through their hasty flight, fell into the River of <hi>Cluson,</hi> and there perished miserably.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> assisted by the Pope, <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> raised a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Army against the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and made General of it the Count <hi>De la Trinita,</hi> who seeing this People weakned and shaken with so many furious shocks of Wars and Persecution, did not doubt of bringing his designs speedily to his desired effect, and to extirpate the <hi>Vaudois</hi> root and branch: He had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to Politicks and Stratagems, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would make use of open force; in short, he sent for the Ministers and Guides of the Churches, he exhorted them to lay down their Arms, and to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62674:32"/>
bring them to him; on the one side he represented unto them the great dangers they were ready to be precipitated into, if they did not submit themselves to the will of their Prince, seeing the great forces which he had to compel them, which it was impossible for them to withstand: That the Pope, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> had engaged the Duke in this War, and did lend him their Troops, that the General Peace being made, they would employ all their forces to destroy them if they would not submit and obey. On the other hand he made them specious and advantagious propositions, giving them hopes, that if they would submit to the will of their Prince, they should enjoy peace, and live in liberty, with all their ancient priviledges: Many were shaken and frighted by the treacherous discourse of this Lord; who seeing them divided, some being willing to submit to save their lives and fortunes to the will of their Prince, others being of a different sentiment, because of the dangerous consequences they foresaw this submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion might draw after it. In this dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous estate of their affairs, he took his opportunity, he laid ambushes for them

in several places; and having surprized them in small parties, he made a cruel butchery without any resistance, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all sorts of cruelties against these innocent Lambs, who were betrayed by trusting to his sugared words.</p>
               <p>This barbarous treachery cast these people into an inexpressible consternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but three hundred of those that escaped from the massacre, being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together by the favour of the night, and being fortified by little and little by their brethren, who were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the Counts promises, and had saved themselves in the Mountains; with this little Troop of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> God did such wonders as almost seem incredible, if we had not seen what their Successors have done in the wars of the year 1655. and 1664. and the last year, when seven or 800 <hi>Vaudois</hi> crossed all <hi>Savoy,</hi> which was then all in Arms, and forced several Passes kept by the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Troops of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and in spight of their Enemies entred into their own Country, and there have endured fifteen or sixteen bloody fights, which fully perswades us that God is with this people, and fought for them, and with them; without whose wonderful help
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62674:33"/>
it was impossible they should have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed such extraordinary exploits.</p>
               <p>The day after this treachery, the Count <hi>Del a Trinita</hi> employed his Army from morning till night in spoyling and ransacking all the places in the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> of which he had made himself Master, after which he marched with seven or eight thousand select men as high as <hi>Angrogne,</hi> towards the place call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Meadow of the Tower,</hi> where the greatest part of the Families of these poor <hi>Vaudois</hi> were retired, as to the strongest Sanctuary or Azilum they could find in all the Valley of <hi>Lucerne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He attacqued them in this place by three several ways, and gave them no time of respite for four days, one assault was no sooner repulsed, but he gave another with fresh Troops, without gaining any advantage: In these assaults he lost two Collonels, eight Captains, and seven or eight hundred Soldiers.</p>
               <p>The fifth day, he being absolutely bent to carry the Post; and to this end he made use of <hi>Spanish</hi> Troops which were fresh, and as yet had never been engaged: The <hi>Spanish</hi> Soldiers seeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62674:34"/>
that were obstinate to continue the attacque. The <hi>Vaudois</hi> having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the confusion that their Enemies were in, fell upon them with so much courage and bravery, that they put the whole Army to the rout, and they were struck with so great a fear, that many of them threw themselves off the rocks into the river of <hi>Angrogne</hi> and were drowned in its whirlpools; they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued their Enemies the space of two leagues, and killed a great number of them.</p>
               <p>To shew that <hi>France</hi> aided the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the War he had begun against the <hi>Vaudois, D' Aubigni,</hi> reports in his General History, that this Prince having desired the King of <hi>France</hi> to lend him Monsieur <hi>de Maugiron</hi> with ten Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Foot, and Monsieur <hi>de la Motte Gondren,</hi> with other Troops, all compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of pickt and expert Soldiers, he says it was granted him, and that the Troops were joyned to the Army commanded by Count <hi>de la Trinita;</hi> the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> in sight of this Army, reinforced with the Troops of <hi>France,</hi> confiding in the aid Heaven, went to force the Fortress of the Borough of <hi>Villar,</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62674:34"/>
the Duke a while before had built to cut that Pass from the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>del a Trinita</hi> being strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Troops of <hi>France,</hi> and some fresh ones sent by the Duke, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted several times to attacque them, but in every one of them they were repulsed with considerable loss, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they lost 900. men, when the <hi>Vaudois</hi> lost not above 15. The Army of the Duke being extreamly weakned, what by continual losses, what by desertion of Soldiers, who seeing they got nothing but blows in this War, deserted in great numbers. The Duke sollicited by his Dutchess, whom as we have said, had some knowledge of the Truth, and had a great deal of tenderness for the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> gave them Peace with the free exercise of their Religion, by his Letters Patents, dated at <hi>Cavor</hi> the fifth of <hi>June</hi> 1561. their Goods being restored to them, the Prisoners released, and those that were condemned to Galleys (for their Religion) were set at liberty, and they were reestablished in all their Rights and Priviledges.</p>
               <p>In the year 1565. four years after this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was published, at the earnest desire of the Pope, a new Order was published
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62674:35"/>
through all these Valleys, That all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the D. of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who within ten days after the publication of the said or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der did not declare before some of their Magistrates that they would go to Mass should within two months be gone out of all the Estates of the said Duke; and at the same time the Magistrates recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an express order to make an exact list of all those that would not obey the said Order, and send it speedily to his Highness.</p>
               <p>The Protestant Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were extreamly sensible of this new Vexation, and made by their Letters a great Complaint to the Duke, of the bad entreatment of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> to the Prejudice, and contrary to the Tenour of his Letter, Patents, and desired him to remedy it for the future, that they might enjoy the Benefit of his generous Grant, the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> sent one of of his principal Counsellors in an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy to procure peace, to these poor People; <hi>Margerite</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> wife of the Duke, who was a pious and vertuous Princess, and who was very tender of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> sweetned as much as she could the anger of her Husband, who by false reports of the Enemies of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62674:35"/>
Gospel, was much irritated against them.</p>
               <p>The day of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> in the Year 1572. there was made a most cruel Massacre of the Protestants at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in several other places of the Kingdom of <hi>France, Castrocaro</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Valleys, threatned to do as much to the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont;</hi> But whether it was that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did not approve of the cruel Butchery which was made of the Protestants of <hi>France,</hi> or whether at the earnest Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations of his Dutchess, who as much as possible with her natural Sweetness gained, and wrought upon him to shew Mercy and Clemency to the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> he put forth a Manifesto, and declared to all his Subjects of the Valleys, who for Fear of the Governour were fled, that they might return without any Fear or Danger to their own habitations, he gave them likewise order that they might receive their Brethren of <hi>France;</hi> assuring them they might live very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely there, and he kept his word; for even to his Death, which hapned the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 1580. they were not molested but enjoyed a quiet Repose.</p>

                  <p>Of the fifth War against the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> under <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and chiefly of those of the Marquisate of <hi>Saluzzo.</hi>

                  <hi>CHarles Emanuel</hi> his Son succeeded him, who, a little time after the Decease of his Father, seized upon the Marquisate of <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Del' Esdiguiers</hi> by way of reprisal, seized upon the Valleys of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and forced the Inhabitants of these Valleys to take the Oath of Fidelity to the then King of <hi>France:</hi> The Enemies of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were not wanting under this pretence to irritate the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> against these poor People, to extirpate them when a fit opportunity should offer, without considering that they were forced by the powerful arms of the King to take the Oath, their Prince having given them no succor.</p>
               <p>War being begun between <hi>Henry</hi> VI. King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Charles E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:62674:36"/>
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> about the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisate of <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> the King made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Master of all <hi>Savoy</hi> in one Campaign, which the Emperor and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> seeing, they desired the Pope, who was about marrying his Neice to the King of <hi>France, viz.

               </p>
               <p>The Enemies of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> as soon as the Duke was at peace abroad, were not wanting to sollicite him to make War upon the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> but he consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Father had had but ill Success in the War he had made upon them, although he was assisted by the Forces of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> would not declare open War against them, but permitted them to be disturbed in their Affairs, and when the Inquisitors had put any of them in Prison, for their Religion, and that Application was made to him for their Enlargement, he would answer, that he did not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in those Affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:62674:37"/>
But he acted in another manner with the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> than with those of the Valleys, against those of the Valleys he was content to let their Enemies act, but against those of the Marquisate he declared himself an open Persecutor, from the time he was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute master of it, for about the end of the Month of <hi>Iune</hi> 1601. he made an Edict, by which he commanded, that every one must declare before the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Magistrate, that within the term of 15 days that he was resolved to renounce his Religion, and to go to Mass, with which, if he complyed, he might not only enjoy his House and Goods, but other great Priviledges, but for those that were obstinate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to continue in their Religion, they absolutely commanded to be gone out of all his Dominions in two Months time, and never to return again upon pain of Death and Confiscation of their Goods.</p>
               <p>There were 8 flourishing Churches inthis Marquisate, but this Edict being executed with a great deal of rigour, all these poor Churches were dissipated; for the Faithful seeing that the Duke would not revoke his Edict, though he

was most earnestly sollicited to do it, by the Protestant Princes, retired out of the Marquisate, with only what they could carry, and went to dwell in Places where they might enjoy a free exercise of there Religion.</p>
               <p>

                  <p>Of the abominable methods that the Dutchess of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Propagation, took to destroy the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFter the Death of <hi>Amadeus,</hi> the Dutchess his Lady was left Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of his Dominions, because his Son <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> II. was very young. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> having erected a Congregation, as it was called, for the Propagation of Faith, and Extirpation of Heresy; there were established such like Councils and Congregations in the Dominions of all Princes that professed the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Turin</hi> was established in the Year 1650. and was divided into two Bodies, the one was called the Council of men, and the other the Council of women; the Archbishop was President of the first, and the <hi>Marchionesse de Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of the second, the women made great enquiry, for all those that they called new Converts, and made very
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62674:38"/>
much of them; the men entertained Spies through all the Valleys, to give them an account of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that were poor, or of those that had Suits at Law, to the poor they offered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from Taxes, and to free them from the quartering of Souldiers for many Years: To those that had Suits at Law, at <hi>Turin</hi> or other places, they promised them good Success, provided they would turn <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, and by this traffick they gained several.</p>
               <p>But the Council of the Propagation seeing, that notwithstanding all the Care and Pains they and the religious Orders took, for to convert the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to the Romish Religion, that they could draw none but some poor or wicked people; they bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of an abominable Stratagem, to destroy them all at once, and make their Throats be cut by the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Army that was then in <hi>Italy,</hi> and was commanded by the Marshal <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Grance,</hi> in the Year 1653. the King having assign'd for the winter-quarters of his Army the Provinces of <hi>Delphinate, Province, Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Burgundy;</hi> these Provinces offered to the Marshal very considerable summs to exempt them
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62674:39"/>
from effectual quartering of Souldiers; and he was the more contented with it, because the Dutchess of <hi>Savoy</hi> proffered to quarter a part of the Army in <hi>Savoy</hi> for a share of the Money proffered. The bargain being struck, the Marshal marched his Army towards the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, which was the place that the Dutchess had assigned for their winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters: In the mean time, although the Council of the propagation knew full well of the bargain made between the Dutchess and the Marshal, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Capuchins</hi> and some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Valleys, and even some of the chief ministers of the Court to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it was not the intention of the Dutchess that those strangers should quarter there; and by their artificial dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, full of malice and fraud, they stirred up the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to take up Arms, and oppose the Army of the King, which was already entred into the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> and in a condition to force these poor people to receive them, threatning nothing but Fire and Sword; and this had been done, if a Minister of the Gospel had not gone and cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at the feet of the Marshal, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62674:39"/>
discovered to him the diabolical malice of their Enemies; and desired him to shew one billet for quartering, and as soon as the billet of the Dutchess should be shown about, he was certain that all the Inhabitents of the Valleys would submit without the least resistance: To which proposition the Marshal accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at the same time sent to <hi>Turin</hi> to have the billet for quartering of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as the Minister desired, and it coming in a short time, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without the least difficulty. We must consider that the Army of the King was very powerful, and made up of expert Troops, and that the Marshal was fully resolved to gain the great sum of Money that he was to draw from the foresaid Provinces, and to have his bargain to the full of the Dutchess; and that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that were in arms had let his army enter into the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> without any oppsition, and that they were not prepared for a long defence, neither had entrenched themselves in their usual Fastnesses, and so it's not to be doubted, but that they must have been conquered by the <hi>French,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enraged at their Boldness, and the at the Contempt of their great Army,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62674:40"/>
would have put all to the Sword with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinction of Sex or Age; if God had not made use of the Zeal and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this Minister to frustrate the Designs and crafty Contrivances of those Enemies of God, and his Church.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IN the year 1655. the Dutchess of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and her Son the Duke, being sollicited by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Council of Propagation to destroy the Protestants of the Valleys, and to establish in their places the <hi>Irish,</hi> who served the King of <hi>France</hi> in his Royal Army in <hi>Italy,</hi> and were driven out of their Country by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> these <hi>Irish</hi> were of the number of those
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62674:40"/>
that had plaid such pranks in <hi>Irelend,</hi> against the poor Protestants, in the year 1642. and the last that had laid down their Arms in that Kingdom, after the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. to give these Valleys to the <hi>Irish;</hi> the Protestants who were the true and natural Inhabitants of these Valleys were all to be extirpated, for so it was resolved in the Council of the Propagation, and after in the Duke's, which was for the greater part composed of the former.</p>
               <p>To bring this wicked design to effect, they must make use of some specious pretence, they could not make their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be the affair of the house of the Capuchins of <hi>Villar,</hi> which some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants privately pushed on by their Enemies the Papists, had burnt to the ground; this affair had been accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated many years and the Accomplices severely punished; they took therefore another way, they obtained from the Duke a Commission, by <hi>Gastaldo</hi> his Counseller in his Chamber of accounts, to drive out all the Protestants that were in the Valleys of <hi>Lucerne, Lucernette,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn, de la Tour, de Bubbian, de Fenil, de Campligon, de Briguieras,</hi> and of St. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus,</hi> the Commssion was dispatched
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62674:41"/>
the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1655. and the <hi>25th.</hi> day of the same Month <hi>Gastaldo</hi> gave Orders, and a strict command to all the Protestants of the foresaid places, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon them, and to retire with their Families, within three days after the publication, into places which his royal Highness did tollerate, which are, <hi>Bobbi, Villar, Angrogne, Roras,</hi> and the Country of the <hi>Bonnets,</hi> under the pain of Death, and confiscation of all their Goods, if they found them in the aforesaid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, if within twenty days they do not make it appear to us, that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, or that they have sold their Goods to Catholicks.</p>
               <p>Those that gave this pernicious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to the Duke, knew that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants were time out of mind, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished there even before the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> were Princes of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and the Predecessors of <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> II. who had given this commission to <hi>Gastaldo,</hi> had maintained them by divers decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and grants, but they belived that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> who were well established, in those places that they were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to quit, would not obey the unjust command of <hi>Gastaldo,</hi> and that so they would take their disobedience for a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62674:41"/>
pretence to destroy them, or if they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, and they could not be destroyed or chased out of the rest of the Valleys, the places they should quit would be enough to receive the <hi>Irish,</hi> who being a people, that had been long trained up in the wars, would be a bridle upon the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and put them upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of ever recovering their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer habitations.</p>
               <p>Although the Protestants well knew the injustice of this order, and that they had sufficient reason not to obey it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless to take away all pretence from their Enemies of rendring them odious to their Prince, and to make them pass for Rebels; they quitted the places named by <hi>Gastaldo,</hi> and retired into those assigned in the Proclamation, after which, they sent Deputies to the Duke, who should go and cast themselves at his Feet, and by a most humble petition, which they presented him, they suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated him with a most profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, to revoke the Orders given to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staldo,</hi> as being conrrary to their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and the Grants, but their request was without any answer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> seeing that they had no compassion of their miseries, had recourse
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62674:42"/>
to her royal Highness his Mother, to whom they presented a petition full of Respect and Submission, this Princess sent them back to the Council of the Propagation their sworn Enemies, and most cruel Persecutors; and this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil sent them back to the Marquess <hi>de Pianesse</hi> who long before had received ordets to go and massacre them, as the event made most evidently appear.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the abominable means that the Marquess of <hi>Pianesse</hi> made use of, to surprize the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and to enter into the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, and of the cruel Massacre he made of these poor Innocents, after his Entry, in the year 1655.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Marquess of <hi>Pianesse,</hi> seeing that he could not destroy the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> by force of arms, had recourse to a most strange and detestable piece of Perfidiousness, which Satan had sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested to him: He sent a Trumpeter to them, to tell them, that they should send their Deputies, and hear from his Mouth the will and pleasure of his royal Highness, that all was for their good and advantage, and that they might come with a full assurance; the <hi>Vaudois</hi> desiring nothing more than peace, were presently taken in this gin, the the Marquess had laid for them, they sent away their Deputies with the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62674:44"/>
Trumpet, and were received with all demonstrations of Kindness: Monsieur <hi>de Pianesse</hi> entertained them splendidly at Dinner, made a thousand protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Amity, and most endearing Caresses, but this was all to surprize them, and betray them them as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, with a kiss.</p>
               <p>After he had cast a mist before their Eyes, by his Peotestations and deceitful Caresses full of Snares, he told them he had nothing to do but with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of those places forbid by the order of <hi>Gastaldo,</hi> but as for other places, they had nothing to fear, if they would only in sign ofObedience and Fidelity, receive and quarter for 2 or 3 days in every one of their Communities, a Regiment of Foot, and two Troops of Horse; the Deputies who believed the protestations of the Marquess were sincere, and far from all Treachery and Perfidiousness; when they returned to those that had deputed them, they so strongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded them to do what the Marquess of <hi>Pianesse</hi> had counselled them, that there were none of the Communities that were not disposed to receive them, which they did without any opposition or resistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:62674:44"/>
The Regiments of Foot, and the Troops of Horse, which they had agreed to receive, were no sooner entred and quartered in the several Communities, but they seized on all the passes, and were followed by all the rest of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; they were desired to quarter in the Towns and Villages below, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more commodious for them, they being offered to be furnished with all things necessary, but they marched on as long as the day would permit, even to the highest places that were inhabited. One part of the Army mounted upon the common road to <hi>Angrogne,</hi> another part upon that of <hi>Villar</hi> and <hi>Bobbi,</hi> and the third part of the Army possessed themselves of the Meadow of <hi>Tour,</hi> which was the strongest place of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> which served as it were for a Fortress for the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and in marching they set fire on every place, and killed all they met in the way. This strange and barbarous proceeding discovered their Treachery, then every one fled to save their Lives, the greatest part of the men by the favour of the night got to the Mountains, and saved part of their Families from these cruelMassacrers; and sliding down the other side of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62674:45"/>
mountain, they gained the Valley of <hi>Perouse,</hi> a part of the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Territories. This Army, besprinkled with the blood of Saints, found the houses of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> and the Goods as well of the natural Inhabitants, as of those that were fled from other places, from which they had been chased by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of <hi>Gastaldo,</hi> but they found but few Inhabitants, except it was of Women, Children, Old and Sick people.</p>
               <p>The Enemies of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> having by this Treachery and Perfidiousness, made themselves masters of all the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, even of the strongest places, which would have served them as so many Fortresses against their Persecutors, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two days without exercising their Rage and projected Cruelty, feigning they would do nothing but refresh themselves in their Quarters, and in the mean time they strongly perswaded those that remained, to recall those that fled, assuring them they should have no harm done them, and there were some of them that through their too great Credulity, cast themselves into the Snares which they had happily escaped.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:62674:45"/>
The third day the signal being given from the Hill of the Town, which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Castelas,</hi> all the Innocent creatures that were found in their power were killed in the most cruel manner imaginable, they did not kill them as Sheep prepared for the Butchery, or as Enemies van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, that were to be cut off with, out quarter; but in a manner more cruel and more barbarous; the Infants were pulled violently from the Breasts of their Mothers, and dashed against the Rocks and Walls, by these most cruel Barbarians; upon which their Brains were plaistered, or else one Soldier took one of these Innocents by one Leg and another by the other, and so rent them most miserably asunder, and sometimes they dashed the Brains of one Child against the other and after killed their Mothers.</p>
               <p>The Sick, as well Women, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were either burnt in their Houses or cut in pieces, or tyed naked with their Heads betwixt their Legs, and thrown down the Rocks, or tumbled down the Mountains.</p>
               <p>The Women and their Daughters were violated and stuffed with Pibbles, and their Mouth and Ears with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62674:46"/>
and afterwards fire was given to the Train; and by these sort of Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical mines, they, were miserably blown up; others were empaled alive, and in this dismal posture planted upon the high ways, all naked, some of them had their Heads, Arms and Breasts cut off; which these barbarians fricassy'd and eat, Oh the brave Stomachs of the Papist Cannibals!</p>
               <p>The men which were neither old nor sick, which fell into the hands of these cruel Butchers, some of them were flead alive, others, after they had cut off their privy Members they cut off their heads, and put their Members in their mouths; some were cut all in pieces limb from limb, as you cut flesh in the Shambles; those that did signalize themselves most in this sort of Cruelty were the <hi>Irish,</hi> who had been used to such sort of Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres in their own Country in the year 1642.</p>
               <p>After this great Massacre of the poor <hi>Vaudois</hi> that fell into their power, the next day they went a hunting after those that had escaped them, of which a great number were wandring in the Woods, and among the high Mountains covered with Snow, or hid in the caverns and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62674:46"/>
holes of the Rocks, not being able to save themselves, partly because of the great quantity of Snow, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their weakness, being unable to make their escape, because the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had seized upon all the Passes.</p>
               <p>This murthering Army having finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Massacre of all the Protestants they could find in the Valleys, or that were wandring in the Woods and Mountains, or hid in the caverns and holes of the Rocks, they set fire on all combustible things, and quickly redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all their Houses and Churches into ashes; nothing was preserved but the Town and Church of <hi>Villar,</hi> which is in the centre of the Valley of <hi>Lucerne;</hi> and some houses in the Plain for quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Irish,</hi> to whom the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> gave this Country. You may see in the General History of <hi>Iohn Leger</hi> the names and number of the persons massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and the cruel manner in which they were martyred.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> some of them being cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly massacred, others made Prisoners, and the rest driven out of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the enemies being totally possessed of the Valleys; and being made masters of all, they established the <hi>Irish</hi> there,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62674:47"/>
which being a far greater number than the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that had escaped out of the Massacre, there was no appearance that those poor people could ever enter and establish themselves in their Country, but God, to whom nothing is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, took their cause in hand, and touched the hearts of the Protestant States and Princes, who gave them charitable assistance, gave them strength and courage, fought for them, and made them with a handful obtain great and miraculous victories over their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and by these signal victories, and the sollicitations of Protestant Princes, they were re-established in their lost Country, and continued there till the year 1686, in despight of all the artifices of their enemies.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Fourteenth War against the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont,</hi> after the Massacre, in the year 1655. in which one may see God fighting vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly for them, and with them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFter the cruel Massacre of which we have spoken, there was a bloody War between the <hi>Vaudois</hi> and the murtherers, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> driving them out of their Country; in which one may visibly see that the God of Battel sought for them and with them, by the glorious advantages they every day got upon their enemies. The first Battel they fought was at <hi>Roras,</hi> a little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity consisting of 25 families, and which was far distant from the rest; Count <hi>Christopher</hi> who was Lord of the place, and a member of the Council of <hi>Propagating the Faith,</hi> being very far from preserving his vassals, as his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and duty obliged him, violently carried on with a false zeal, did all he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62674:48"/>
could to destroy them, and employed to that end force and treachery; for contrary to the solemn Parole that he had given them on the Marquess of <hi>Pianesse</hi>'s behalf, that they should be left in quiet, the same day that was designed for the cruel Butchery of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> he sent four or five hundred Soldiers to <hi>Roras,</hi> for to treat the Inhabitants of that small place in the same manner that all the rest of the Valleys were treated; and to surprize them the better, he shewed them a secret way, that the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers might march with more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which shews that there is no crime, nor wickedness, of which a blind zeal is not capable of. Captain <hi>Ianavel</hi> who was fled into <hi>Roras</hi> with his Family, perceived a far off the Enemies, he had then not with him above five or six Country Peasants, with this little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he went to expect the Enemy at an advantagious pass, they killed six of the Enemies upon the Spot, and the other being sorely frighted fled in great Confusion, thinking the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were more in number than they were, and in flying they lost fifty four of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:62674:48"/>
The Marquess of <hi>Pianesse</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Enemies Army, hearing of the ill success of his affairs at <hi>Roras,</hi> the better to lull them in a secure sleep, and surprize them, he sent them word, that the Soldiers that went to attacque them, were only Rogues and Vagabonds, and none of his Troops, highly protesting that he knew nothing of the design, and that he would have been extreamly pleased if they had cut them in pieces, in the mean time, the day following, after he had sent them these specious protestations, he detached 600 select Soldiers, who should go and set upon <hi>Roras</hi> in three several places, and exactly follow the ordes he had given, Captain <hi>Ianavel</hi> having discovered them with his little company, which was now composed of about 18 men, of which 12 were armed with Fusees, and Pistols, and Faucheons, six other with Slings on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Stones, he divided them into three little Bands, and placed them in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscado, in an advantageous post, they charged so home their Enemies, that they seeing themselves attacqued with so much courage by those that they went to surprize, they betook themselves to their heels, leaving dead upon the spot 60 of their men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:62674:49"/>
This second bad success did not, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding make the General give over the Enterprize, but as Treachery and Perfidiousness had had success in other Valleys, so he was resolved to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the same; he sent to <hi>Roras</hi> Count <hi>Christopher</hi> who, as I told you before, was Lord of the place, to tell them that what was done was bottomed upon a false report, but being better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the said Count, and at his entreaty he would for the futurelet them live in perfect quiet, thinking thus to surprize them, by this cunning Artifice and Treachery of their own Lord and Master; for the day after he sent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of 900 pickt men to fall upon those of <hi>Roras,</hi> in several places at once, <hi>Ianavel</hi> with his seventeen Peasants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got before them to the Passes, when they came fell upon them with so much courage that he quite routed them, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a great number in the field and in the pursuit.</p>
               <p>The Marquess being ready to burst with despight and rage for this third ill success of his Troops, rallied together all the forces that he could convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that were in the Valleys for to go and cut the throats of those poor innocent
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62674:49"/>
Lambs that were in this little Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; the Army consisted of about 8000 effective men, which were at the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouze ordered by the General. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Mario,</hi> a valiant Souldier and a great Massacrer, led the Troops that came from <hi>Bagnols,</hi> and came first with a considerable body of men, and thought himself strong enough to make himself master of <hi>Roras,</hi> and without expecting the other Troops, he divided his into two parts, and fell upon the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in the front and the rear; but the <hi>Vaudois</hi> having gained the top of an eminency that was above the highest Troops of their enemies, so that they could not be attacked but in the front; from this place they made so vigorous a defence, that at last they disordered their enemies and put them to flight, having left sixty five of their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons dead upon the place, besides those that were wounded, drowned, and killed in the pursuit. Captain <hi>Mario</hi> in flying fell into a whirlpool, where without doubt he had been drowned, if two or three of his Souldiers that were expert in swimming had not drawn him out; he was brought back to <hi>Lucerne</hi> in his Shirt, without either
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62674:50"/>
Hat or Shoes, and was presently seized with a dreadful Malady, during which he suffered horrible Torments, which made him an hundred times cry out, that he felt the fire of hell in his bowels, for the Houses, Churches and Persons he had burnt in the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> he dyed in these torments and in this estate he went to give an account of his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness before the soveraign Judge of the world.</p>
               <p>After so long a fight and so glorious a Deliverance, <hi>Ianavel</hi> with his little Troop being retreated to the eminency of a little hill, that there they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh themselves, they had no sooner begun to eat, than they saw another body of the Army, which came by the way of <hi>Villar,</hi> and were climbing up the Mountains to surprize them in the Rear; as soon as they saw the Enemy, they presently quitted their Dinners, to put themselves in a posture of defence, in the most advantageous place; he that commanded in chief the Enemies, made a small Detachment to take a view of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who came very near them, thinking they might be some of their own Gang; the <hi>Vaudois</hi> discharged so home, and thick upon them, that every
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62674:50"/>
one killed one or more, which caused so great a terror and confusion among them that remained, that they fled in great disorder, and spread the terror and dread of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> so among the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of that great body, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately all betook themselves to their Heels, believing the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in number, whereas they were but 18, <hi>Ianavel</hi> with his little Troop pursued and killed a great many of them, after which he gave thanks to God for so glorious a deliverance, as he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accustomed to do, when he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any Victory over the Enemies.</p>
               <p>Three days after these two battels, the Marquess of <hi>Pianesse</hi> fuming and storming, biting his Nails for Anger and Madness at the pitiful suceess of all his Designs; he sent an express, by a Letter, to the people of <hi>Roras,</hi> by which he commanded them, on behalf of the Duke, they should all within 24 hours go to Mass under pain of Death, and seeing their houses reduced to Ashes, and their Trees cut down.</p>
               <p>To this Letter they answered, that they had rather suffer a thousand deaths than go to Mass, since it could never be clearly proved that either Christ or his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62674:51"/>
Apostles ever did celebrate it, that if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter burning of their houses, they were resolved to cut down their Wood, they had a Father in Heaven who would tenderly provide for them.</p>
               <p>After these Menaces the Marquess mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered his Army together, composed of 10000 men, of which eight Thousand were old Troops, and 2000 were of the Country Peasants of <hi>Piemont</hi> which he listed in the neighbouring Communities; he divided his Army into three Bodies, of which, one had orders to attacque the <hi>Vaudois</hi> on <hi>Villar</hi> side, another on the side of <hi>Bagnols,</hi> and the third on the side of <hi>Lucerne: Ianavel</hi> with his little Troop went before the body of the Army which first presented themselves, and fought valiantly, and with incredible success having killed many of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but when he saw the other two Bodies had gained the Post where several poor Families were fled for refuge, and that he could not succour them, he saved himself with his 17 Country Peasants and his Son of eight years of Age, whom he carried upon his Shoulders, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into the Valley of <hi>Queiras</hi> in the Territories of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
               <p>The obstinacy of the Enemies of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62674:51"/>
                  <hi>Vaudois,</hi> in their resolution of destroying the small Town of <hi>Roras</hi> after so many successless attacques, shews to all the world the violent passion that a false Zeal can produce, in the Heat of those that persecute the Truth of the Gospel: Those that are animated with a true Zeal never violate their promises nor oaths made to their enemies, but those that are pushed on by a false zeal keep neither their Promise nor Oath, they regard nothing but satiating their Malice, and contenting their brutal and blind passion to destroy 24 poor Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make use of Force, but they must add to it Treachery and Perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they Promise and Swear they would let them live in quiet, as well on behalf of the Duke, as of the General of the Army; and the day following they command their Troops to cut their Throats, and not being able with 500 men to destroy them, they sent six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and afterwards 9 hundred, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 8 thousand, and afterwards ten thousand; and that which is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is, that neither the shame of being repulsed so often, nor the loss of so many hundred of their companions made them give over their design.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62674:52"/>
The undaunted courage with which Captain <hi>Ianavel</hi> and his little company sustained the shock, and repulsed the violent attacks of his enemies, and the wonderful victories he gained, shews to the whole world that the God of Battel was on his side. For otherwise how was it possible? for in the first ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with 7 men only, to put to flight 500, and in the other Battels with 17 or 18 men, of which 6 were only armed with Slings and Stones, to rout sometimes 600, then 900, and after some thousands? if God had not been with them, and given them courage and strength? And on the contrary side, if he had not taken courage from their enemies, and put confusion and terror in their hearts, from whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their destruction and most shameful flight! In short, how was it possible that <hi>Ianavel</hi> and his little hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, after so many dangerous fights should save themselves, not one of them being killed, or as much as wounded, although they were attacked in the front and in the rear by their enemies, if God had not covered them with his Shield, and defended them from their enemies; so that Miracles are not yet ceased.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:62674:52"/>
The enemies Army having made themselves masters of <hi>Roras,</hi> executed the same cruelties towards the families of this little place as they had done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards those of the other Valleys, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all to Fire and Sword, without sparing age or sex; but the General was enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that with so puissant an Army he could only triumph over women and children, and old decrepit men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ianavel</hi> nor any of his company falling into his hands. The Wife and Daughters of <hi>Ianavel</hi> were carried Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, they were kept alive to make him lay down his Arms, threatning to burn his Wife and Daughters if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his Rebellion, for so they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his just defence.</p>
               <p>All the Valleys and their dependances being in the hands of their Enemies; it seem'd as if these poor people should for ever be exiled from their Country, but God who would preserve the light of his word, in these Mountains and Valleys, hastned to restore them: The Massacre of the Valleys was upon the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> but the taking and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre of <hi>Roras</hi> was not till the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> Captain <hi>Ianavel</hi> after having refreshed himself at <hi>Queiras</hi> some days,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62674:53"/>
mustering some of his Brethren in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who had made their escape, returned into the Valleys with some provisions, and came and posted himself upon the Mountain called <hi>Palea de Iaimet,</hi> from whence with his company he departed the <hi>22d.</hi> of the same month of <hi>May,</hi> with a design to go to <hi>Lucernette,</hi> which is a Village between the Towns of <hi>Lucerne</hi> and <hi>Bobiane,</hi> to surprize some Cattel to live upon, and to take some prisoners, to cause them to restore his Wife and Daughters by way of exchange: But his enterprize had not the success he desired, for that that place was full of Souldiers. He returned to his post, and having understood that Captain <hi>Iayer</hi> with all those he could muster that had escaped the Massacre, and were fled into the Valleys of <hi>Pierouse</hi> and <hi>Pragela,</hi> in the territories of <hi>France,</hi> had possessed himself of the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> on <hi>Angrogne</hi> side; he prayed him by Letters to assign him the time and place that he might joyn him, which they did the 27th of the foresaid month of <hi>May.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the conjunction of <hi>Jayer</hi> and <hi>Jana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> Captains of the <hi>Vaudois;</hi> and the wonderful exploits they did in the Valleys.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THese two Captains were no sooner joyned, but they undertook the enterprize of seizing upon the Town of <hi>Garsillane,</hi> which was garrisoned by their enemies; which they found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well fortified: The alarm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, the enemies, which were very numerous in the neighbouring places, as well Horse as Foot, having notice by the ringing of the Bell, run to the succour of the Town, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who fighting cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously, retreated from the middle of their enemies, and in their retreat they took from a Village that was near the Town six pair of Oxen, and a good quantity of other Cattel, and took some Prisoners, with the loss of only one man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:62674:54"/>
The 28th of <hi>May,</hi> they came very early in the morning, near the Town of St. <hi>Secundus</hi> to surprize it, after having spent some time in Prayer, according to their Custom, and encouraged one another, they attacked it with so much vigour and dexterity that they made themselves Masters of it.</p>
               <p>The Garrison, that was made up of <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Piemontes,</hi> they put all to the Sword, they burned the Town and the Churches in revenge of what had been done to their Houses and Temples, and having carried away seven Bells, and all the Cattel, they retreated; in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this Town they killed 800 <hi>Irish,</hi> and 650 <hi>Piemontesses,</hi> the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had only seven men killed, and six wounded ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry slightly, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were about 600 men, and their Enemies were at the least 1500 well entrenched and fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The second of <hi>Iune,</hi> the <hi>Vaudois</hi> went to burn the Forage and Houses upon the Plain of <hi>Briqueras,</hi> and retreating by the way of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> they were encountered by the Enemy, whom they charged so briskly in three several places, that they put them to flight, leaving 150 dead upon the spot, besides those that were
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62674:54"/>
Prisoners and wounded. In this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter there was but one <hi>Vaudois</hi> killed, and two wounded.</p>
               <p>Some days after the Battel of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the enemy sent a Convoy to the Fort of <hi>Mirebouc,</hi> conducted by 300 men; it's seituated above in the Valley of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne;</hi> Captain <hi>Ianavel</hi> met them by chance in a streight place upon the road, he having then only 8 Souldiers with him; he stopped them five or six hours, and killed and wounded a great number of them, without the loss of a man.</p>
               <p>After these glorious exploits, <hi>Ianavel</hi> having reinforced himself, retired again to the Mountain called <hi>Paleade Iaimet,</hi> and sent a message from thence to <hi>Tour</hi> and <hi>Bobbi,</hi> who had revolted to escape the cruelty and barbarity of the enemy, and were retired to the Town of <hi>Villar;</hi> that if within 24 hours they did not all joyn him, he would treat them as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and Traytors to their Country: They pesently came with a great deal of joy: seeing some hopes of their liberty, being very penitent for their former want of courage and confidence in God.</p>
               <p>The Captains <hi>Iayer</hi> and <hi>Ianavel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned the second time, resolved to fall upon the Town of <hi>Tour,</hi> where was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62674:55"/>
the strongest Garrison of the Enemy; who having some intelligence of their coming, put themselves betimes in a posture of defence, and killed the first <hi>Vaudois</hi> that appeared upon the Bridge before the Gate of the Town: Inshort, they made a great Sally upon the assail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who received their Enemies with so much courage that they covered the earth with their dead Bodies. The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel continued till night, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched themselves upon a little emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of a hill they had gained; from whence the enemy could not force them, though they were a far greater number, and were reinforced with some Troops that came from <hi>Lucerne</hi> to their assistance; about the beginning of the night the enemy retired into the Town, without being able to carry off their dead, which were more than 300. This happy success gave so much courage to the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> that the morrow follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they went and posted themselves before the Gates of the Town, and their enemies durst not sally out upon them.</p>
               <p>After the attack of <hi>Tour,</hi> the <hi>Vaudois</hi> retreated into a place of <hi>Angrogne</hi> called <hi>Verné,</hi> there in a Council of War, they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62674:55"/>
resolved to send 450 men which made up the three fourth parts of their little Army to assault the Community of <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sol,</hi> whose Inhabitants had done them much mischief in the time of the Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre. At the first noise of their approach, those of <hi>Crusol</hi> retired into a great Cave, which was in a neigbouring Mountain, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> being not able to force them out from thence, contented themselves to take away 400 Cows and Oxen, 600 Sheep and Goats, and whatsoever Booty they could meet with, among which they met with good store of their own Goods that had been taken from them in the Massacre.</p>
               <p>While the 450 <hi>Vaudois</hi> were on their march for the expedition of <hi>Crusol,</hi> the Papists of <hi>St. Sccundus, Lucerne, Tour</hi> and <hi>Briqueras,</hi> burned some houses that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in <hi>Rocheplatte,</hi> and from thence they went to <hi>Angrogne,</hi> to surprize the little Garrison that was left there to defend that post, under the command of the Captains <hi>Laurence</hi> and <hi>Benet.</hi> They discovered their enemies as they approached them with design to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in several places at once, this obliged the little Garrison to divide their small number into two little bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62674:56"/>
of which the one presently gained the top of a mountain, and the other kept a little below upon a small hill: In conclusion, they placed 17 men in ambuscade in an advantageous place where the enemies were to joyn; these men rushing out upon them on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and killing seven of them, so daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rest that they retreated without daring to attempt any thing further.</p>
               <p>After his return from <hi>Crusol,</hi> Captain <hi>Jayer</hi> went to the Valley of <hi>Pragelas,</hi> to sell a part of his booty, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning at the day appointed, Captain <hi>Janavel</hi> with 300 men that he had with him, undertook to force the Town of <hi>Lucerne;</hi> he came before it early in the morning the sixth of <hi>June,</hi> and as soon as he came there he turned out of its course the Channel that brought water to the Town, and broke their Bridge, which was but a Musket-shot off the Town, to hinder succours from coming in; after which he attacked it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated two <hi>Corps de Guard:</hi> But the night before, <hi>Maroles</hi> who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it, being entred into it with a new Regiment, it was not possible for him with so small a company to make himself master of it; so he contented
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62674:56"/>
himself with what he had done, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated without any loss.</p>
               <p>The 15th of <hi>June</hi> being in <hi>Angrogne</hi> with 300 men which he commanded, was sharply set upon by the enemies Army consisting of 3000 men, which was divided into four bodies, of which one was to gain the top of a Hill, the other was to attack him on the right, another on the left, and the fourth in the Front, the Trumpet which was to give the signal to the Enemies, to fall all at once upon the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> having sounded a little sooner than he should have done, gave time to Captain <hi>Jana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> to post himself upon an advantageous neighboring hill,, where with the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, whom he invoked, he resisted from Morning till two hours after Noon all the Attacks of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and after having killed a great number of them, they took their heels and fled in great confusion, <hi>Janavel</hi> pursued them even below <hi>Angrogne,</hi> and killed many of them in the flight, the Enemies confess that on this occasion they lost 500 men, and had a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more wounded; of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> there was but one killed, and two wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:62674:57"/>
Immediately after the Battel Captain <hi>Iayer</hi> came with his little Troop, which gave such courage to <hi>Ianavel</hi> and his, that although they were extreamly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued with fighting all the day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any refreshment, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked that the Enemies seem'd to doubt of nothing, and only thought of dividing themselves, that every one might retire to his own quarter, they unanimously resolved to attack them, and fell upon them with so much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, <hi>Iayer</hi> on the one side, and <hi>Ianavel</hi> on the other, that they quite routed them and killed above an hundred, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom were three Officers of note: But by a great misfortune, for the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> Captain <hi>Ianavel</hi> at the end of the Fight was shot with a Musket bullet, which entring in at his breast, went out at his back betwixt his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which put him into such a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it was thought he would have dyed immediately; he had notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Judgment to desire Captain <hi>Iayer</hi> to enterprize no more that night, because his Souldiers could do no more, and he himself gave advice in what he thought was necessary to be done, he made himself be carried to <hi>Pinache,</hi> and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62674:57"/>
about the end of <hi>Iuly</hi> he was perfectly cured of his Wounds.</p>
               <p>The Enemies of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to withstand the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in the Mountains, they made use of a Traytor, to draw Captain <hi>Iayer</hi> down to the plain; this perfidious wretch after the battel, of which we have spoke, came to seek out the Captain, and told him that there were no Troops on <hi>Orsacy</hi> side, where he might have a considerable Booty, and repay the Enemies in their own Coin without danger, in burning their Houses and Cabbins: He took with him an 150 Soldiers of this little Army, and set some Cabbins on fire, near <hi>Orsacy,</hi> and took some booty, but in such places where the Cavalry could have no advantage, the Traytor who led him out to slaughter told him that a little lower there were some Cabbins and good store of Cattle, which would cost him nothing but taking, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to go thither, he no sooner came to the place, where he led him, than he was surrounded with a Squadron of <hi>Savoyards,</hi> which defeated him with 40 Soldiers that had followed him; seeing himself betrayed, he killed the Tray tor with his own hand, and three Captains
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62674:58"/>
of Horse; his Son and his Souldiers sold their Lives dear, but having to do with so many Enemies, they were all cut in pieces, except one who saved himself in a Morass.</p>
               <p>The Death of Captain <hi>Iayer,</hi> and the wounding of Captain <hi>Ianavel,</hi> which was believed mortal, hapning the same day, caused a great consternation among the <hi>Vaudois:</hi> But notwithstanding they took fresh courage, and under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Captain <hi>Laurence,</hi> and a Brother of Captain <hi>Iayer</hi> who succeeded him, under his command they mustered upon the Mountain of <hi>Vachere,</hi> where they resolved to meet their Enemies that were coming to assault them, and they fell upon them with that Resolution, Courage and Dexterity, that they put them to flight in a very great Disorder, after having left more than 200 of their Companions dead upon the place, among whom was a Lieutenant Collonel of the Regiment of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and several Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of note, besides the wounded and Prisoners; the <hi>Vaudois</hi> lost in this fight, only Captain <hi>Bertin,</hi> and a common Soldier, and that which is most to be admired is, that they were but 550 men, and their Enemies 6000. according to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62674:58"/>
the report of the Prisoners, and this is particularly remarkable and full of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that as soon as Captain <hi>Bertin</hi> was killed, his Son and Heir out of his filial Piety, having carried off the body of his Father, presently placed himself at the head of his Fathers Company, and began his charge with these words, <hi>Take heart my Brethren, for though my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be dead, our celestial Father can give me the same Courage and Conduct, as by his Grace, he has filled me with the same Zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The day following the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were in continual Skirmishes with their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at <hi>Tour</hi> and <hi>Taileret,</hi> where many of their Enemies were killed and wounded, and the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had but one Soldier slightly wounded.</p>
               <p>Their Enemies knowing that all the Protestant Princes would interest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the affairs of the <hi>Vaudois<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> they reinforced their Army with new Troops, to do the utmost to destroy the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> before the Ambassadors of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> should arrive at the Court of <hi>Savoy:</hi> The <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> all the Army of the Enemies came to attack them upon the Mountain of <hi>Vachere,</hi> where the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were posted before. Colonel <hi>Andrion</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Leger</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62674:59"/>
were newly arrived in these Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, they observed the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had made their Lodgments too far asunder, that they might the better make use of the shelter of some Stables that were in that place, they exhorted them for the better avoiding of surprizes, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble altogether in one place of the Mountain, where they had made some Barricadoes, the better to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but it was impossible to oblige them to it: The day following, which was the day of the attack, they sent 4 Soldiers, 2 hours before day, to observe the Enemy, of which were two who made a halt near the Church of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> they spoke <hi>Piemontese,</hi> which was the reason that they took them to be some of their own, but a little after they steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, when with great precipitation they took the way of the Mountain, they shot after them, which served the <hi>Vaudois</hi> for an Alarm, and at the same time, they put themselves in a posture of defence. The Enemy divided themselves into 4 bodies, for to fall upon the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in 4 several places, as presently after they did, the battel was sharp and lasted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout six, hours, the Enemies being strong, refreshed themselves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62674:59"/>
one another; they had now made themselves Masters of the first Barricado, and cryed Victory: But the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that were retreated into their last Retrenchment, after a short but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Prayer to God, sallied out, and fell upon them with so much Fury, that they obliged them to retreat, which they did without any disorder. Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Andrion</hi> would not permit of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit for fear of the Enemies Horse that was below; in this Fight the Enemies lost about 400 men, among whom were many Officers of Note, and 180 Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Regiment of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had only some few Soldiers slightly wounded.</p>
               <p>After this battel, the Enemies having lost all hopes of reaping the Corn of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grogne,</hi> as they had done that of the Plain, enterprized the burning of it; but the <hi>Vaudois</hi> came in so quickly upon them that they obliged them to quit their design, for after having killed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a dozen of them, they fell upon the rest and put them to flight, of which a great number, to be the more nimble, threw away their arms to save their Lives. Captain <hi>Bertin</hi> pursued them to <hi>Tour,</hi> and killed and wounded a great many
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62674:60"/>
of them, he killed likewise the Centinel, and 4 Soldiers that appeared upon the Ramparts of the Fort, and struck the Enemies with so great a terror, that they vowed afterwards that if he had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his blow he might have made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Master of the place.</p>
               <p>Among all the Battels that we have spoke of, it appeared visibly that God had declared himself the protecter and defender of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> otherwise how was it possible that a handful of men of little or no experience in War, should have been able to resist, much less to gain so many Victories over their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which were expert and tryed Souldiers, as we have seen they have done to the 15th of <hi>July,</hi> when they fought alone, without the aid or assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any foreign help; and that which is considerable, they had to do with their Prince, whom the emissaries of the Pope had armed against them only in hatred of their Religion. Their Prince was assisted by the King of <hi>France</hi> and the D. of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> of which the one was his Brother-in-law and the other his Cousin-ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>man. The <hi>Vaudois</hi> were not the hundredth part of his Subjects and Estates: The Prince
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62674:60"/>
and all his other Subjects were armed against them, and notwithstanding they gained no advantage, but on the contrary they were foyled, and in most occasions most shamefully put to flight:</p>
               <p>The Protestants of <hi>France</hi> hearing of the cruel Massacre that was committed upon their Brethren of <hi>Piemont,</hi> made extraordinary prayers to God for them, and large Collections to assist those that had escaped: Some Provinces celebrated a Fast for them, and that of <hi>Cevenne</hi> celebrated one by order of the Synod, assembled at <hi>Sale,</hi> in the month of <hi>June</hi> 1655. Upon the News that was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, that those that had escaped the Massacre were re-entered into the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and defended themselves there couragiously; many Officers and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Cevenne</hi> and the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> went to the succour of their Brethren, who in little Companies, by several ways, got into the Valleys; and so the Army of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that had not been till the 14. or 15. of <hi>July,</hi> above 600. men, consisted of 1800. the 17th. or 18th. of <hi>July.</hi> The Lord of <hi>Combies,</hi> of the City of <hi>Anduse</hi> in <hi>Cevenne,</hi> was of the number of those, that went to succour their Brethren; and because he had
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62674:61"/>
had considerable imploys in the Armys of the King of <hi>France,</hi> he was by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral consent chosen General of the Army, after the example of those of the lower <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Cevenne,</hi> many Soldiers out of the <hi>Delphinate</hi> came and joined them in the Vallies.</p>
               <p>The Army being two thirds stronger than it was, it was resolved in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, to go and force the Town and Fort of <hi>Tour;</hi> they departed at night, the 18th. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> for this expedition; and they arrived the day following, before day, within a mile of <hi>Tour,</hi> where they halted till day break, and then Monsieur <hi>Combies</hi> sent some to view the Fortifications of the Fort, and those that were sent made a report to the General, that the place was impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble against a greater Army, upon which, Monsieur <hi>Combies</hi> ordered to sound a retreat, being apprehensive of ill success in his first design.</p>
               <p>But Captain <hi>Bertin</hi> who was of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, would not retreat with his Company, but desperately assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Town, he was soon followed by the rest of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and some two or three <hi>French</hi> men: this Captain who was a Townsman of <hi>Tour,</hi> knew all
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62674:61"/>
the weak places about it, and presently broke through the Wall, near the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of <hi>Capuchius,</hi> before the Enemy took the Alarm, made himself Master of the Borough, and of the Convent, which he burnt down to the Ground; and there is no doubt to be made, that if all the Army of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Captain <hi>Bertin,</hi> but that they had taken the Fort; notwithstanding the Succours that <hi>Maroles,</hi> Governour of <hi>Lucerne</hi> brought, as soon as he had News of the attempt. Monsieur <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> having seen what Captain <hi>Bertin</hi> had done, was much concerned that he had sounded a Retreat.</p>
               <p>And here ends the War of the year 1655. which was followed by a cruel Massacre that was made of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> in the month of <hi>April,</hi> in the same year, but before we speak of Peace, it's neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that we make some Reflections upon this War.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Reflections upon the War in the year 1655. and of the ensuing Peace made at <hi>Pignerol</hi> by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ambassador of <hi>France,</hi> and the Ambassadors of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant <hi>Cantons.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT's certain that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had no better nor more faithful Subjects than the <hi>Vuudois,</hi> who always followed their Prince as well in his wars abroad as at home. They never took up arms but when they would force their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and deprive them of the free exercise of their Religion: This appears in this, that every time that war was made upon them, they were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed first to renounce their Religion and go to Mass, and that they let alone in peace all those that obeyed, and gave them several priviledges and immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; all the crime the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> for which they were so severely handled, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not abandon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62674:62"/>
which they had received from Father to Son, from the time of the Apostles, and was in every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Those that escaped out of the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre, had just reason to take up Arms, the Enemies had unjustly murdered the Fathers and Mothers of some, the Wives and Children of others; some had lost their Brothers and Sisters, and they would have done the same to them, if they had fallen into the hands of these cruel Butchers: So much Blood unjustly spilt cryed to Heaven for vengeance, and God would make use of the hands of those that escaped to revenge it, as the event shewed by the victories they gained over their Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crers, and by the great slaughter they made of them, though they were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in number, and that which is more, they were driven from their own Houses, Goods and Country, against the Laws of Nature and Nations, which orders, that every one enjoy his own in quiet, if he have committed no crimes that make him unworthy of it: Now these poor people had committed no crime, they were of the Religion they professed, before the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:62674:63"/>
had any thing to do with <hi>Piemont,</hi> and besides it was confirmed to them by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers grants and priviledges.</p>
               <p>If God had not been willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish them in their Country, would he have given them courage to return without being recalled by their Prince after having been driven out by a cruel Massacre and a puissant Army. When Captain <hi>Ianavel</hi> returned home, which was about fifteen or twenty days after he was driven from <hi>Roras,</hi> he had but about 200 men, and they had establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Valleys 1200 <hi>Irish,</hi> all Soldiers; there were besides that 3000 men of the old Troops of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and all the Inhabitants were Papists, so that there were more than an hundred against one. But though their Enemies were in so great a number, and were Masters of the Country, <hi>Ianavel</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding returned, and not barely content to make excursions, but they carried away a good Booty from <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernette,</hi> which was a place full of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and scituate between the Towns of <hi>Lucerne</hi> and <hi>Bobiane,</hi> where the Duke had strong Garrisons. If God had not given the <hi>Vaudois</hi> courage, how would they have undertaken the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62674:63"/>
of St. <hi>Secundus,</hi> where there were 800 <hi>Irish</hi> and 650 <hi>Piemonteses</hi> in garrison strongly fortified and intrenched, and they were not above 500; so small a number, could they have forced the Town if God had not been with them, and fought for them, and delivered these Massacrers of their Brethren into their hands to revenge the blood they had so inhumanly and without cause spilt.</p>
               <p>Although this war continued but three months, it was nevertheless very bloody, for the enemies of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> lost in the several rencounters and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels we have spoke of, more than 4000 men, of which the greatest part were of the number of the Massacrers, who were sent to God in a short time to give an account of their barbarities and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties towards these poor Innocents. The <hi>Vaudois,</hi> during the whole war lost not above ninety five men, reckoning in this number the forty who were killed with Captain <hi>Iayer</hi> by a signal piece of treachery, of which we have spoke above.</p>
               <p>And this is very remarkable, that the enemies of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> never had any advantage over them, but by their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62674:64"/>
treachery and perfidiousness, in viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the publick Faith and Treaties; but when they were upon their guard and fought for the maintenance of their Religion, they were always victorious over their enemies; and as they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the celestial verity contained in the Holy Scriptures, so Heaven took them under its protection, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Cause; God covered them with his Buckler every where where they went, and fought for them, giving them courage, and striking their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with confusion and terror, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they had never gained so many victories, who, as I said before, were oftentimes more than an hundred to one.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> seeing that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Massacre he had made of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> nor the war that had followed the Massacre, had answered his designs, and the Consederates expectation, was desirous of a peace, and was very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be sollicited by the Protestant Princes and States to condescend to it; for it was probable, if he had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the war three months more, he would have been obliged to ask it of those he had been so unjust to. His Army was
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62674:64"/>
very much weakned, and that of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> was very well reinforced. Of the 1200 <hi>Irish,</hi> which in the beginning of the war were planted there 800 were cut off at St. <hi>Secundus,</hi> and the rest ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perished of Distempers, or in other battels that they fought in afterwards; the <hi>French</hi> Troops were retreated, and the Lieutenant Collonel of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Bararia,</hi> and many of his best Officers, and more than 200 common Soldiers were killed in this war, and besides all this he had lost more than 3000 of his own Troops: The Army of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> when the Peace was made, consisted of 1800 men, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased every day; many famous Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Protestant Soldiers out of <hi>France,</hi> joyning them in this Holy War; and if the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> when they were but between 500 and 600, always were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious over their Enemies, and in spight of all their opposition, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered all they had lost; it might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be hoped that in three months more they might have quite destroyed the Enemies Army, or at least have driven them out of the Valleys.</p>
               <p>The Ambassadors of the Protestant <hi>Cantons</hi> had been a good while at <hi>Turin</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:62674:65"/>
for to assist these poor people, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their mediation for a lasting peace, but the Duke excused himself, saying, That he had long ago reserred that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and that he durst not take it out of the hands of so great a King: That which obliged the Duke to speak so was, that he knew the King of <hi>France</hi> was perfectly linked to him by interest, and that he had lent him his Troops, and that he being the Umpire betwixt him and the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois,</hi> he would decide more for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage than for that of the <hi>Vaudois.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Servient</hi> the Ambassador of the King of <hi>France</hi> in that Court was the Mediator of peace, and Monsieur <hi>de Servient</hi> knowing that the Ambassadors from <hi>Cromwell</hi> and the States of <hi>Holland</hi> were upon their journey to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that affair, and that these two States had made great Collections for the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and that the Protector of <hi>England</hi> did very much interest himself in the business, the better to please the zealous Protestants of <hi>England,</hi> did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate the peace, and conclude it before their arrival at <hi>Turin.</hi> There is no doubt to be made, but that if these Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors had arrived before the conclusion
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62674:65"/>
of the peace, that it would have been much more advantagious to the <hi>Vaudois</hi> than it was, they would have obtained a restitution of all that had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly taken from them by the order of <hi>Gastaldo,</hi> and have forced them to demolish the Fort of <hi>Tour,</hi> without suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Duke to build another: 'Tis true, that by a private Article they were promised the Fort should be demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in effect it was done after the peace, but it was but to build another more strong in the place where the Old first was, which the Predecessors of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had caused to be pulled down; and even this was against the promise made to them, that they should not build another. The Duke gave them a Patent, signed at <hi>Pignerol</hi> the 9th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> 1655. by which he pardoned the <hi>Vaudois</hi> for taking up Arms against him; he established them in their Goods and Priviledges, and in a free exercise of their Religion, except in some places, excepted in the Patent. The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>France</hi> and the Ministers of the Duke drew the Patent so, for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send, as they said, the Honour of his Royal Highness, but to defend the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Prince, they made inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

and his Associates did all that was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to gain the poor and silly people of the Valleys, suggesting to them, that the sums, gathered out of Charity, were so considerable, that if they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed according to the intentions of those that had given them, every one at least would have for his share 14 or 1500 Livres, and by this seditious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course they designed to arm them one against the other, and so to destroy them by their own Swords; and not content with this, they writ to the foreign Countrys, <hi>France, Swizerland, Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> where their Charitable Collections were gathered, that the chief Inhabitants had divided it among themselves, and made merry with it, and let the Poor perish with hunger, giving them no part, and by these lies and shams they designed to hinder stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from being any more touched with compassion of their miseries.</p>
               <p>The second Artifice of their Enemies was, to build a Fort at <hi>Tour,</hi> against the secret Article of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> in which they placed a strong Garrison; as soon as it was built they committed all sorts of excesses and violences against the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois,</hi> taking away their Fruit and the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62674:71"/>
Wine out of their Cellars, pillaging likewise the moveables of their houses, beating and killing whom they pleased, violating their Wives and Daughters, committing all sorts of Villanies and Rogueries, without any remedy or the least offer of redress; and to crown the misfortunes of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Valleys was given to the Count of <hi>Bagnols,</hi> who had signalized himself so much in the Massacre in the year 1655.</p>
               <p>The third Artifice that was made use of to destroy them after the Treaty of <hi>Pignerol</hi> was, to make criminal Processes against the principal of them, upon false accusations, before the Court of <hi>Turin</hi> against their priviledges, which were, that all Causes should be tried in the Valleys before the ordinary Judges; if they remitted themselves to the Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> they were kept two or three years prisoners, sometimes without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard, where they either spent all their fortunes, or died of hunger; if they did not submit, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death or to the Gallies, and their Goods were confiscated: Those that were condemned for default, if they did not forsake their Goods and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62674:72"/>
Habitations, they were seized on by the Souldiers of the Garrison of the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, and brought into the Fortress, where they made them suffer a thousand ills worse than death.</p>
               <p>The fourth Artifice that the Enemies of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> made use of to destroy them was, that they hindred them from keeping Schools, and likewise the free use of their Religion in several places, permitted by the Patent of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and established time out of mind.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> seeing that the Treaty of <hi>Pignerol</hi> was broken, and violated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in every Article, had recourse to their Prince and his Ministers, to whom they made most humble remonstrances, reiterated several times, but finding that all was to no purpose, they addressed themselves to Monsieur <hi>de Servient,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador of <hi>France,</hi> who was also at <hi>Turin,</hi> and had been the Mediator of the Peace; they writ likewise to the Ambassadors of the Protestant <hi>Cantons</hi> that were at that Court, and most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly begged as well the Ambassador of <hi>France,</hi> as those of the <hi>Swisse</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed for them to his Royal Highness.</p>
               <p>But instead of doing justice to these poor oppressed people, they prepared
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62674:72"/>
fresh Forces to quite root them out; and when they were near executing their wicked design, Seignior <hi>Rica,</hi> Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer General of the Duke, came to <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol,</hi> a Town of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and near Neighbour of the Valleys; where he called before him the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Agents of all the Communities of the Valleys, told them with tears in his eyes (a true Popish Crocodile) that he was very sorry to see them fall into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable ruine, and that the only means to avoid it, was to send a large and full deputation to <hi>Turin,</hi> to his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, who was resolved to put an end to their miseries, and that by the means of an humble and cordial submission, which they could and ought to do, they would without any doubt obtain their desires.</p>
               <p>While the Treasurer General did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse, with fair words, the principal Agents of the Valleys, at <hi>Pignerol,</hi> the Generals of the Army that was in the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> called likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all the chief Conductors of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and told them, that if in sign of obedience and confidence, they would but guard a convey that was to be sent to the Fort of <hi>Mirebouc,</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:62674:73"/>
they might all return in peace to their Habitations.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who desired nothing but the peace and repose of their Families, did what those Generals commanded, believing what they said was true, but the consequence made them sensible, that it was only to entrap and destroy them; for while one part of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were employed in guarding the Convoy, and another in getting their Families together, following the Order of his Royal Highness, that every one should retire home and bring back his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and while the Principal Agents were amused and staid, some at <hi>Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol</hi> with the Treasurer, and others by the Generals of the Army, the Troops of the Duke, commanded by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses of <hi>Fleuri</hi> and <hi>Angrogne,</hi> and by the Count of <hi>Bagnols,</hi> in number more than 800 men, fell upon the Valleys about break of day, in four several places with great fury, for to surprize and massacre the <hi>Vaudois</hi> as they had done in the year 1655. and that which made them hope for good success in their design was, that they saw that these poor people were dispersed in several places, and as it were lull'd asleep upon the confidence they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62674:73"/>
had in the Orders of his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the fair promises made them by the Generals, and did not in the least suspect such a piece of treachery and perfidiousness: But if on the one side they separated them one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and took from them their Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that they might the more easily vanquish them: So on the other side they furnished with Men and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition the Fort of <hi>Mirebouc,</hi> which was in the highest part of the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> to stop their passage into the <hi>Delphinate,</hi> and hinder them from saving themselves in the territories of <hi>France,</hi> as they did in the Massacre in the year 1655. and employed them as guards for the Convey, which was a double piece of treachery.</p>

               <p>Those that were commanded by the Marquesses of <hi>Fleuri</hi> and <hi>Angrogne,</hi> who were at least 4000. seeing themselves stopped by the foresaid body, posted themselves upon the top of a little emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency they had gained, and with green Turf made themselves an Intrenchment, the height of a man; the <hi>Vaudois</hi> not being able to hinder them, and whiles some wrought to fortify this Post, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did their utmost to gain the streight pass kept by the sixty <hi>Vaudois.</hi>

               <p>The sixty <hi>Vaudois,</hi> that kept the pass of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> were weary, having fought above half the day; but when they saw that their Brethren came to their succor, they took fresh courage, two of them creeping upon their Bellies, being hid by a part of the Rock, came so near the Enemies Retrenchments that they killed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62674:75"/>
two of their Centinels, and with their Swords in their hands, fell upon their Camp, who being quickly followed by all the rest, they quickly made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves masters of it, killing and cutting to pieces all that opposed them, putting the rest to flight, who ran away in great Confusion, the two Marquesses were none of the hindermost in the Flight: The <hi>Vaudois</hi> pursued their Enemies to <hi>Briqueiras,</hi> and killed a great many of them; there were more than 600. of the Enemy killed, and a great many wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of which, the greatest part dyed of their Wounds: The <hi>Vaudois</hi> lost but five or six men and had but a dozen slightly wounded. So God did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully deliver the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and punish the Treachery of their Persecutors; and one may say that as in old times, <hi>the Sword of God was with that of Gideon,</hi> so in this Rencounter we may truly say, that it was with Captain <hi>Ianavel</hi> and his little Troop, otherwise how should 500 men, who were extreamly fatigued, having fought above half the day, have driven their Enemies out of their Camp, fortified the height of a man; the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> were not then above 500. for they had left one part of their little Army to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62674:76"/>
guard the place, from whence they had chased the Count of <hi>Bagnols,</hi> and they had not in all above 700. men. After they had beaten their Enemies, they gave thanks to God for their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the Victory he had given them, and gave him all the Glory.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> after having defeated their Enemies, went often out in parties to seek them out, in every place, where the Cavalry could not incommode them, nor surprize them; and by this means they diminished their Army, there scarce being a day that a good number of <hi>Savoyards</hi> and <hi>Piemonteses</hi> did not fall into the hands of the <hi>Vaudois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the 6th. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> till the 10th. of the Month of <hi>August,</hi> all that time, there were continual Skirmishes, where, every where, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over their Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Marquesses of <hi>Fleuri</hi> and <hi>Angrogne,</hi> who commanded the Army of the Duke, recruited their Army with all the Militia, of the States, of his Royal Highness, or with Troops drawn out of Garrisons; and with this great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my they undertook a memorable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, they attacqued <hi>Roras,</hi> where some <hi>Vaudois</hi> were retired. This Community
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62674:76"/>
as we have remarked before, was sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the rest of the Valleys, and by consequence could not be succoured before the Massacre and War of 1655. it consisted of but 25 Families, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that were an hundred against one, fell upon this little place by so many ways, that at last they made themselves Masters of it, they killed 23 <hi>Vaudois</hi> who defended it, but they lost above 200 men; this was the greatest loss that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> sustained in this war of 1663. and the greatest Exploit of the Generals of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that the Enemies had made themselves Masters of the Rocks and Desarts of <hi>Roras,.</hi> with so considerable loss, the day after they made an excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to St. <hi>Margarite,</hi> which is a little Village of the Community of <hi>Tour,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of 20 or 25 houses, which they burnt to Ashes; the <hi>Vaudois</hi> being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together in a small number, upon the Mountains of <hi>Tour,</hi> as soon as they saw the Town on a Flame, fell with that Swiftness and Resolution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these Incendiaries, that they put them to Flight, and covered the ground with their dead Carcasses, and killed more of them than they had burnt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62674:77"/>
beams of houses, of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> side there were none either killed or wounded, for it was remarked, that these Massacrers were struck with so great a fear, that they had neither Hands to fight, nor Legs to fly.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of the Month of <hi>August,</hi> Captain <hi>Janavel</hi> intirely defeated an Ambuscade that the Enemies had laid at the place of the Vines to surprize him, but they themselves were surprized and cut in pieces.</p>
               <p>The Council <hi>of the Propagation of the Faith</hi> seeing, that the Marquess of <hi>Fleuri</hi> had had ill Success in all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, thought it was requisite to change the General; and so the Mraquess was recalled to Court, and the Marquess of St. <hi>Damian</hi> was put in his place, who made a Levy of a greater Army than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but with worse Success; The Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers seeing, that in this War, nothing could be got but blows, the first having carried away all the Booty, went only by force to this War, and where they found any resistance, they turned their backs and fled from the <hi>Vaudois;</hi> their Officers being not able to stay their Flight.</p>

                  <p>The Second Peace, made betwizt <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> and the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois,</hi> by the mediation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant <hi>Cantons,</hi> in the month of <hi>February</hi> 1664. which has conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the year 1686. during which time, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> did sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Service to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THE War of the year 1663. having had as ill Success as that of the year 1655. the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would have been glad of Peace, but he durst not ask it of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> for fear it should shew his weakness, or at least he should be obliged to grant them more than he had done by his former Patent, granted at <hi>Pignerol;</hi> because of the Advantages they had gained over him: For this Prince had drained his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, ruined by these Wars a part of his Dukedom, lost more than 4000 men, and the <hi>Vaudois</hi> but sixty: They durst go no more into the Mountains to seek
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62674:78"/>
them, and the <hi>Vaudois</hi> often descended into the Plains to attack their Enemies, who being struck with a pannick Fear, because of the many Victories of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> fled before them, like a Flock of Sheep before a Troop of hungry en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Wolfs: The <hi>Suisse</hi> having private notice, that the Duke was weary of the War, sent an honourable Embassy to to sollicit a peace, between the <hi>Vaudois</hi> and their Prince, the Ambassadors came to <hi>Turin</hi> the 15th. of <hi>December</hi> 1663, and were very well received by the Duke, and the whole Court, which was not so in the year 1655. after the Massacre, nor in the year 1686. when the Duke was leagued with the King of <hi>France,</hi> for the destruction of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and to force them to go to Mass, as he in the precedent year had forced the Protestants of <hi>France.</hi> This good reception of the Ambassadors, made it clear that the Duke was weary of the War, and willing to make a Peace; after they had had Audience, they sent their Secretary to the Valleys, to tell the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> that they should send their Deputies to <hi>Turin,</hi> who being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, a solemn Promise was made them, that during the Treaty,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62674:78"/>
there should be no more Acts of Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity done against the <hi>Vaudois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The event made it apparent, that this promise was only made them to lull them asleep, that he might the better surprize them, while the Treaty was on foot, for by an unheard of Perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, even among the most barbarous Nations, notwithstanding this promise, made in the presence of the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, the <hi>21st.</hi> of the same Month, twelve hundred men of the lower <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> were sent to reinforce the Army, under the command of the Marquess of St. <hi>Damian,</hi> and on the <hi>25th.</hi> at break of day they attacked <hi>Tillaret, Angrogne, Rocheplate,</hi> and St. <hi>German,</hi> without giving any notice that they would do any thing to the prejudice of the solemn Promise. The first and strongest attack was at <hi>Tillaret,</hi> where the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had like to have been born down with numbers, but they of <hi>Angrogne</hi> sending them, in the nick of time, an hundred men, this seasonable succour did so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, that they broke the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Troops commanded by the Count of <hi>Bagnols,</hi> and put them to flight, and forced them to fly for safety to the Town and Cittadel of <hi>Tour,</hi> in great
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62674:79"/>
disorder; they pursued them with so much heat and vigour, that many of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> entred with them pell mell into the Town, and came out again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least damage, to the great asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of all the world, and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Euemies.</p>
               <p>On the side of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> the Enemies could not make the <hi>Vaudois</hi> give back one foot of ground, for all their furious Assaults, but after having done their utmost to make them quit their post, after having lost a great number of their men, they most shamefully fled, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> pursued them to the Plain, and killed a great number of them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped afterwards near them upon the Plain, where their Enemies durst not molest them.</p>
               <p>All the harm the <hi>Vaudois</hi> suffered was on St. <hi>Germans</hi> side, which was a very advantageous post, and of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by the means of which, they had till then kept clear the passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Vallies of <hi>Lucerne</hi> and those of <hi>Perouse,</hi> and St. <hi>Martin,</hi> the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unfortunately surprized this place, which was not guarded, because that Famine had obliged the Country people, who believed there was no danger, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62674:79"/>
the Treaty, to go and seek victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for themselves and their Families, they killed there a man, and two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the rest saved themselves mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously, they burnt likewise, greatest part of the houses, and cut down or pilled the Bark of all the Fruit Trees.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> had great cause of Joy that day, for that they happened to be dispersed in divers places, and were not upon their Guard, confiding in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn promise made at <hi>Turin,</hi> but God not only delivered them out of the hand of their Enemies, but gave them a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal victory: The Enemies Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of 18000 men, <hi>viz.</hi> 6000 that the Marquess of St <hi>Damian</hi> had in his Army, and 12000 <hi>Piemontese,</hi> that had newly joined him, and the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had but 700 men, and on this day the latter lost but 6 men, but the first according to their own relation, lost fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, among whom were the Counts of St. <hi>Front</hi> and <hi>de la Trinita,</hi> and many Officers of Note.</p>
               <p>The Deputies of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who were at <hi>Turin,</hi> having received Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of this perfidious dealing, against the solemn promise, desired the Lords Ambassadors from the <hi>Swisse Cantons,</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:62674:80"/>
to present their just complaints to the Duke, which they did with a great deal of heat and resentment, but that produced only a truce for twelve days, which was at several times prolonged and renewed, till the Lords Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors had ended and fully concluded a peace and agreement, contained in the Patent of the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1664. by which the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were established in a full enjoyment of all their Goods; and in the free exercise of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all places where it had been esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the treaty of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> in the year 1655.</p>
               <p>But this Patent was no better execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and observed than the former, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Duke had engaged himself by his Letter to the Protestant <hi>Cantons,</hi> the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1664. to observe it punctually. It's no easie matter to represent here all the tricks that the Councel <hi>of the Propagation</hi> made use of to make this peace ineffectual; as to the <hi>Vaudois</hi> it's enough to say, that it had been impossible for them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves against so many subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and crafty policies of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries <hi>of the Propagation,</hi> if God, who holds the hearts of Princes and Kings in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62674:80"/>
his hand, had not changed the heart of <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> the Second to favour the <hi>Vaudois.</hi> This Prince having exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the conduct of all their doings, began to know that it was without any good ground that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were made so odious; and calling to mind the great zeal they had testified on divers occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his service, and particularly in 1638 and 1640, when the greatest part of his Estate was revolted against him, and that the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his Unkle had made themselves Heads of the Revolt, being assisted by the Troops of <hi>Spain,</hi> had seized almost all <hi>Piemont,</hi> and even of the City of <hi>Turin</hi> it self, and besieged Madam Royal his Mother in the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, whither she had fled to save her self; and that without the succours of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. his Unkle by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers side, and the help of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> it was probable that this Prince had been deprived of all his Principality.</p>
               <p>In the year 1672. the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> made War upon the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> and the <hi>Vaudois</hi> served him with so much zeal and courage, that this Prince was not content only to praise their Conduct, Courage and Fidelity, by a Letter
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62674:81"/>
which he writ to them the fifth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> the same year, but he gave them many sensible marks of his esteem and good-will towards them, even to his death, which hapned towards the end of the year 1678. Madam Royal, his Widow, treated them likewise, not only with a great deal of sweetness and goodness, but she also engaged her self to the Protestant <hi>Cantons,</hi> by a Letter writ the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1679. to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in the free exercise of their Religion, and in all other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and immunities.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Ninth War against the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> by <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>XIV.</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Victor Amadeus II.</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> with the perfidious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries of their Enemies, which was the cause of the ruine and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spertion of these poor Churches.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE sweetness of peace, which the <hi>Vaudois</hi> enjoyed after the war against <hi>Genoua,</hi> till the death of <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> II. and after the death of this Prince, under the Regency of Madam Royal, his Widow, till the year 1685. made them hope to enjoy a durable tranquility, under the reign of <hi>Victor Amadeus</hi> II. who is at present Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and that which flattered them with this hopes was, the considerable services they had done him in the year 1684. in the war against those of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovi,</hi> in which they had signalized their courage and zeal for his service. This very Prince had given them authentical
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62674:82"/>
assurances of his great satisfaction, by a Letter that he writ to them on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion: But they quickly lost their hopes, when the Governour of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys made Proclamation, about the end of the year 1685, That no Stranger should come and stay in the Valleys above 3 days without his permission, and that any that should entertain them any longer should be most severely punished. The <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> had intelligence of the great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences that were made use of in <hi>France,</hi> to force the Protestants there to change their Religion; they had likewise news, that that King had cancelled the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> and they judged very well, that the prohibition that was made them of giving a safe retreat to their Brethren of <hi>France</hi> was of a dangerous consequence, but they did not foresee all the misery that hapned to them since, nor all the evils that were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them.</p>
               <p>They were strangely surprized when there was published in the Valleys an order of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> on the <hi>31st</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1686. which did gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally forbid the exercise of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, under pain of death and confiscation of all their Goods, and their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62674:82"/>
Churches to be demolished, and all their Ministers to be sent into banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all Infants born hereafter to be baptised and brought up in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion under penalty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning their Fathers to the Gallies: it's impossible to express the grief and fears of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> at the sight of so surprizing, vigorous and unjust order, so contrary to their rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, the for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>er orders only tended to the restraining them in narrower bounds, but the Ordinance of the <hi>31st</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> entirely deprived them of the exercise of their Religion and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conscience. In this sad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into which they were plunged, by the malice of their Enemies, they had recourse to submissions and supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; according to their custom they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> four times to revoke the Order, but they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing but some delay, that he might be the better prepared to execute the order; they saw their misfortune was without remedy, and of this they were the more certain when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that the King of <hi>France,</hi> who for reasons of state and interest, had always protected them, and had declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62674:83"/>
the Warrantee of the Patents of 1655 and 1664. had now not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Duke to pass this Order, but had also made his Troops advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Piemont</hi> for to see the execution of the Order performed.</p>
               <p>The Protestant <hi>Cantons</hi> being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Order, and of the measures that were taken for the execution of it, thought themselves obliged not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake a people persecute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> upon the score of Religion, and that they ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on their behalf on this occasion, as well as they had done on the former; therefore they resolved in an Assembly held at <hi>Basil,</hi> in the month of <hi>February</hi> 1686. to send a splendid Embassy to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to interceed for the <hi>Vaudois.</hi> These Ambassadors arrived at <hi>Turin</hi> the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and made to the Duke their Proposals for the revoking of the late Orders of the <hi>31st</hi> of <hi>January;</hi> they shewed the Duke that they were interested in this affair, not only as Brethren of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king profession of the same Religion, but because also the Patents of 1655 and 1664. which this last Order de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, was the fruits of their former Mediation; and they supported their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62674:83"/>
with many strong and solid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations. The Court of <hi>Turin</hi> did not impugn these reasons, but thought it was sufficient to tell the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, that the engagements that the Duke had entred into with the King of <hi>France,</hi> opposed the success of their negotiation. This Answer obliged the Ambassadors to give in a Memorial to the Duke to this purpose; That the Predecessors of his Royal Highness ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving engaged their Royal Word to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Soveraign Princes, and particularly to the Protestant <hi>Cantons,</hi> for the due observing of the Patents granted the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> such formal and authentical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements ought to stand good, for that the Patents were not meer tolleration for a time, but perpetual grants and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable Laws; and besides the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were granted at the intercession of many Soveraign Princes, and according to the Laws of Nations they are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal monuments of the publick faith, and the promises of Princes ought to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and inviolable: They demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted likewise by many strong arguments, drawn out of the Schools of Politicks, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> acted against his own interest in these proceedings, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62674:84"/>
that he ought to maintain the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in their ancient priviledges, and the rules of justice and clemency would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to bring Fire, and Sword and Desolation into his Estate; and that he destroyed a people which implored his Grace and Mercy, and that had done nothing to draw this Cruel Order up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Heads, which put them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair: But neither the excellent reasons of the Ambassadors, nor their pressing sollicitations, nor the Letters of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession that many Protestant Princes wrote in their behalf, produced the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired effect; they only confirmed the Ambassadors in the certainties of the engagements that the Duke was entred into with the King of <hi>France,</hi> for to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish the Protestant Religion in the Valleys, as it had been done in <hi>France;</hi> and that the same methods would be made use of to obtain their ends in this wicked design.</p>
               <p>In the interim the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were wholly ignorant of what passed at <hi>Turin,</hi> because their enemies had seized upon two men who were going into the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys to carry them the news; it's true, they knew at length by common fame, that the <hi>Swisse</hi> Ambassadors were at <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>

to demand a revocation of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>31st</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> but they knew nothing for certain of the subject of their negotiation, and could not go themselves to <hi>Turin</hi> to be informed without great danger, because the time was elapsed that was given them for conforming to the foresaid Order; and which is more, that Court had refused the Ambassadors to grant Letters of safe conduct for the Deputies of the <hi>Vaudois;</hi> to come and maintain their right, as it had been practised in former negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> returned the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors this Answer, by the Marquess of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> one of his Ministers of State, who had the direction of foreign affairs, that he could not revoke the Order he had given, because he was not Master of it, but in case the Order were executed, his Royal Highness would be willing to consider of some expedients; he likewise told them, that in respect to their Masters, his Royal Highness would not refuse to give the <hi>Vaudois</hi> leave to go out of his Estates, and to dispose of their Goods at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>The Ambassadors considering that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62674:85"/>
the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had no Head nor regular Troops, and that they could not be able to maintain a War against the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who were leagued together for their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they thought the best way to shelter the <hi>Vaudois</hi> from this storm that threatned them was, to procure a safe retreat, and the free disposal of their Goods. But before they entred into this negotiation, they thought it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, first to know the sentiments of the <hi>Vaudois:</hi> Upon this subject the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors concerted measures with the Court of <hi>Turin</hi> to make a Voyage into the Valleys, and the Duke himself gave them a Letter upon this subject, for the Governour of that Country; but the event has made clear beyond dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that the sentiment of the Court was not to let the <hi>Vaudois</hi> go out of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> but to force them to quit their Religion, in the same manner as they had forced the Protestants of <hi>France,</hi> and to destroy all those that would not conform to their Superstition. And the consent that was given to the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> of having liberty of quitting the Country, was only a trick to divide them; they knew well that there were
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62674:85"/>
a great many that would not abandon their Goods and Estates, and lead a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing and disconsolate life in foreign Countries; and that those would sooner quit their Religion than submit to so hard conditions: And as for those that would resolve to go out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they would find means to trick them, either in taking away their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and bringing them up in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion, or in hindring them of disposing of their Goods; or in impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning some, and massacring others, as they did in the year 1655. without the least regard to the most Solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises or Publick Faith.</p>
               <p>The Ambassadors arrived in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and the day after they caused all the Communities to be assembled by their Deputies, to whom they gave an account of what they had done; they told them in short, that considering the condition they were in, and that they could have no hopes of succour, they had no better way to take, than to retire; and in case that this could be obtained, with liberty of disposing of their Goods and Lands, and that if they were resolved upon it, they would present their Proposals to the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62674:86"/>
Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as coming from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The Deputies of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were extreamly surprized to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that they must hope for no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess upon such an occasion, that all the reformed part of <hi>Europe</hi> ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in: They told the Ambassadors, that they were perswaded that they could do no better than follow their advice, but to fully determine an affair of that importance, it was necessary first to have a general assembly.</p>
               <p>And the necessary orders being given for this Assembly, the Ambassadors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Turin,</hi> and informed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of the success of their negotiation; who told them that their endeavours would be very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Court. After which, they petitioned for a safe conduct for some of the Inhabitants of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys to come and bring the result of the deliberations of the Assembly; but this was refused upon two frivolous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, the one was, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would have none of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to appear and follow his Court, and the other was, that he pretended to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on this occasion, but only upon the account and respect to the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62674:86"/>
and this was the reason that they were constrained to send their Secretary into the Valleys, to go and bring back the deliberations of the Assembly. The Secretary found the Communities assembled at <hi>Angrogne,</hi> the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> unresolved what to do; for on the one side they foresaw the dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a Bloody War, on the other side they saw insuperable difficulties and dangers in quitting their Country, but at last they concluded to send to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors a memorial of the dangers and difficulties that opposed their retreat; and the same time they writ them a Letter, by which, after having humbly suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated them to make a reflection upon the foresaid difficulties, they notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing submitted all to their prudence and conduct.</p>
               <p>By vertue of these Letters, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors acted vigorously to obtain leave for the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to have peaceable egress out of the Dukes Dominions, and freedom of disposing of their Goods; but the Duke, to whom these propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions were carried, made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer be returned them, That before he would give them a Categorical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to their Proposals, he expected
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62674:87"/>
the Communities of the Valleys should send their Deputies with an ample power of making the submissions that were due to him, and to ask him leave of going out of his Dominions, as a particular favour that they implored of him. This change makes it clear, that he consented to the retiring of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> for no other end but to divide them, as it after hapned, to the great satisfaction of their Enemies. The Ambassadors thought this Answer very strange, and plainly saw that themselves were plaid upon, and the poor <hi>Vaudois</hi> only mocked. They had refused to grant at their intercession, a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct for the Deputies of the Valleys to come to <hi>Turin.</hi> They had been assured several times, that if the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to go out of the Country, that it should be only granted at the intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mediation of the Ambassadors, and now it must not be the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors that must obtain leave, but the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> themselves must come, and by their own humble supplications must obtain this cruel permission; and people that had done nothing, but serve God according to the purity of the Gospel, must come and ask it as a great favour to be banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62674:87"/>
from their Country, and to abandon their Houses and Lands, to go and beg in a Foreign Country; this ill treatment of the Ambassadors notwithstanding did not make them desist from assisting the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and to take away all pretences from their Enemies, they petitioned for a safe conduct for the Deputies, that the Duke demanded, and they sent it to the Valleys by their Secretary, who caused the Communities to be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that the Deputies might be nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>
               <p>But as on the one side, there were many who never had any design of quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Country, and on the other, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who suspected some new Tricks of their Enemies; the Communities were not all of the same Sentiment, nor were the Instructions they gave to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties conformable one to another, some of them asked leave to go out of their Country, and the free disposal of their Goods; others demanded by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, the continuance of the free Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their Religion, and all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rights and Priviledges. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties being come to <hi>Turin,</hi> the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors saw it was to no purpose for them to appear at Court so divided, therefore
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62674:88"/>
they sent them back again into the Valleys, to endeavour a union, and in the interim they would endeavour to put a stop to the execution of the order above mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Enemies of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who had people a purpose in the Valleys ingaged to divide them, were extreamly pleased to hear of their divisions, they saw that this was an assured means to destroy them; to foment their divisions, an Edict was made and signed the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> which permitted them a safe Egress, and free Disposal of their goods under certain Conditions, but we must observe that the Deputies of the Valleys did not ask leave to quit the Country, nor did the Ambassadors then insist upon it any more, at that time, but only they petitioned to gain some time for the better assembling of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and the freer Deliberation of what was expedient to be done in this affair.</p>
               <p>This Edict had an effect contrary to the Intentions and Sentiments of their Adversaries, it united the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> instead of dividing them, for having examined it, they saw it was a snare that had been laid for their more easy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62674:88"/>
First, This Edict did not revoke the order of the <hi>31st.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> which commanded them to demolish all their Churches in 8 days, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it: they were put upon this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma, that either they must demolish them themselves, during the delay, and at the same time prepare themselves for to quit their Houses and Lands for ever, and dispose of their Goods, which was impossible in so short a time, or else their Enemies must demolish them, during the delay; otherwise they would be uncapable of the oblivion promised in the Edict, and fallen from all hopes of future Favour; their Enemies would not dare to demolish the Churches of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> before the Army was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Valleys, and made it self Mistress of them. Secondly, The Edict that they should lay down their Arms, and retire to their Houses within 8 days, and not to assemble in any hostile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whatsoever; the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had not forgot what happened to them in 1655. for having then given entrance to the Army of the Duke into the Valleys, for to quarter there only 2 or 3 days, as it was pretended, for a mark of their Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Obedience, they committed
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62674:89"/>
that cruel Massacre of which we have spoke.</p>
               <p>And what followed made it apparent, that the Order commanding laying down of arms, and prohibiting any more Military Assemblys, only tended to this, to make them abandon their Religion and to massacre them with more ease, as they afterwards did in several places, after the Enemies Troops were entred into the Valleys. Thirdly, The <hi>Vaudois</hi> were by the Edict, obliged to go out of their Country in three separate Companies, and to appear in such places without arms, where the Troops of the Duke were encamped, and so expose themselves to the Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soldiers, and perchance to be massacred. Fourthly, They saw that the permission that the Edict gave of selling their Goods would serve them in no stead, for that the Sale could not be made till after their retreat, and that to <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks only, and by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholick Trustees; they were sure that in the first place, out of the price of them, would be deducted all damages pretended to be sustianed by the Fryars, Missionaries, and all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, as well ancient as modern;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62674:89"/>
which perchance they would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended came to more than the value of their Goods. Fifthly, If they would permit them to depart without any molestation, why did they not suspend the execution of the order of the 31st. of <hi>January?</hi> and why gave they them so little time to demolish their Churches in, and to prepare themselves for their departure? Sixthly, The Ambassadors were not named in the Edict, and the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had no security for the execution of what was contained in it; and had very great reason to be diffident; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what had formerly past. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had told the Ambassadors that he was not master of this affair, because of the engagements he had made with the King of <hi>France,</hi> it was therefore to be presumed, that this Monarch on whom this affair de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended would not have the <hi>Vaudois</hi> better treated, than he had treated his own Subjects of the reformed Religion in <hi>France;</hi> in conclusion, this Edict made the <hi>Vaudois</hi> pass for the most wicked and criminal people of the World, for not obeying the order of the 31st. of <hi>January,</hi> which was an order that destroyed all their Priviledges, and took from them
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62674:90"/>
Liberty of Conscience, and would have forced them to sacrifice their Children to Idols; and by consequence the D. of <hi>Savoy</hi> could not give out such an order without manifest Injustice, and invading the Empire of God, who alone is So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of the Consciences of men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> were established in the Valleys when this order was made, and possessed the same Estates, and made profession of the same Religion that they had professed many ages, before the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> were Princes of <hi>Piemont,</hi> for it was but in the year 1233. that <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Savoy</hi> made himself ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Town of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> under pretence that the race of the Princes of <hi>Piemont</hi> was extinct; but the <hi>Vaudois</hi> have possessed these Valleys ever since they were first inhabited, for it's from these Valleys that they borrow their name, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> from <hi>Greece,</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> from <hi>Italy;</hi> and as to their Religion we have shewed they have kept it from Father to Son, even from the time of the Apostles; if the people could not deprive their Soveraigns of their Rights and Priviledges, for what reason can the Soveraigns deprive Subjects of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, if they have not committed
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62674:90"/>
crimes that may justly forfeit them?</p>
               <p>Soveraign Princes are established to govern and guide their Subjects, and to hinder injustice, not to destroy and dispoil them of their Goods and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, but to defend and maintain all their Rights and Immunities.</p>
               <p>The Edict was published in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys the 11th. of <hi>April,</hi> and commanded that in 8 days they should demolish their Temples, banish their Ministers, baptize their Children after the <hi>Roman</hi> fashion, instruct others in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, lay down their arms, exercise no Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, receive the Fryars and Missionaries, and the old and new Catholicks, and all the whole Enemies army; they would give no assurance to the Ambassadors that their Troops should not enter the Valleys till the departure of the <hi>Vaudois:</hi> For the army was ready to enter even before the Edict was published, and some days after the publication of it was made, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> appeared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the Field, the more to dishearten the <hi>Vaudois</hi> by his presence, and the more easily oblige them to undergo their rigorous conditions imposed on them: the 19th. all that was commanded by the order of the 31st. of <hi>January</hi> was to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62674:91"/>
be put in execution, and those of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne</hi> were to depart the 21st. those of <hi>Angrogne</hi> the 22d. those of St. <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Perouse</hi> the 23d. of <hi>April,</hi> if they failed in the least tittle of the order, they were to be seized on, and deprived of the liberty of departing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as most enormous and criminal Rebels, for so says the Edict.</p>
               <p>The Communities which were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Rocheplate</hi> the 14th of the month, after having maturely weighed the words and conditions of the Edict, judged that their Enemies had nothing less in their intentions than to let them pass safe out of the Country, and this Edict was only a Trap laid the more easily to take them and destroy them, the result then was not to accept of the conditions, for the reasons we have already mentioned; which reasons they sent to the Ambassadors, who did their utmost to procure the <hi>Vaudois</hi> more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and more advantageous conditions, than those contained in the Edict, but neither their reasons nor sollicitations produced any Effect, they were always answered, that as long as the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were in arms nothing further should be granted them, nor positively promised them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:62674:91"/>
The <hi>Vaudois,</hi> being fully perswaded that they were not to be disarmed, but in order to be destroyed the more easily and without resistance, were resolved not to aid their own ruine, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore persisted in the resolution of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves if they were artacked.</p>
               <p>That which confirmed them in this resolution was, that two or three days after the publication of the Edict, 15 or 16 <hi>Vaudois</hi> went to the Judge of the Valleys, to tell him, they and their Families designed to depart, and desired him to give them a passport, which he refused them, under pretence that they must expect till others went, and he was not only contented to deny them a passport, which was necessary for them to obey the Edict; but he sollicited them to change their Religion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not do it, he put them in prison, where some of anguish of mind, and other evils, incident to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonments, dyed, and others were kept there 7 or 8 months, till they were delivered with other Prisoners, this shews that a plot was laid to destroy the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that would not confirm to the <hi>Romish</hi> superstition, and forsake the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Apostolical Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:62674:92"/>
And that which confirmed it the more was, that one of the Directors of the Church of <hi>Villa secca,</hi> in the Valley of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> writ to the Ambassadors, who were as yet at <hi>Turin</hi> just ready to depart, a Letter on the 20th. of <hi>April,</hi> by which, he declared in the name of himself and his Brethren of the Robe, that they would put in execution the Edict, and desired them to procure them a safe passport, and some more time to make their departure; and one of the Ambassadors took the pains to go to the Camp for to demand a passport, but it was refused him upon pretence that it was not asked in time; it was always too soon or too late, and they never could find a proper time to grant their passports.</p>
               <p>There were two armies that were to attack the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> that of the Dukes was commanded by <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Uncle to the Duke; and that of <hi>France</hi> was commanded by Monsieur <hi>Catinat,</hi> Governour of <hi>Casal:</hi> The Army of the Duke consisted of the Houshold, of all the Cavalry and Infantry, and of the Militia of <hi>Mondovi, Barjes, Bagnols,</hi> and other places of <hi>Piemont:</hi> That of <hi>France,</hi> consisted of many Regiments of Cavalry
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62674:92"/>
and Dragoons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of eight battalions of foot which had passed the Mountains, and of a part of the Garrison of <hi>Casal</hi> and <hi>Pignerol.</hi> The Duke before he left the Camp, took a review, as well of his own Troops, as of those of <hi>France,</hi> and put all things in order to attacque the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> as soon as that short time he had given should be elapsed; having designed one part of his Army to force the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> and the Army of <hi>France</hi> to force the Valleys of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> and <hi>Perouse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> had taken some measures to defend themselves; they had but one part of the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Community of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grogne,</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Perouse;</hi> they only had some advantageous Passes that were in places belonging to the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> there being a part of this Valley that depended on the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> but they were possessed of all the Valley of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> the strongest of all by scituation; they were fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every one of these Valleys with many retrenchments, made of Turf and Stone, and were about 2500 men in arms, two thirds more than they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62674:93"/>
were in the year 1655 and 1663. They had made their Commanders and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the most considerable persons among themselves, they had no strangers to assist them, and they waited the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies coming with a great deal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, but they wanted regular Troops and experienced Commanders; there were many that were corrupted and grew slack during the negotiation. The greatest fault they committed was, that they resolved to guard all the Posts, for if they had abandoned the Posts that were the nearest the enemy, and had retreated within the retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were within the Mountains and Rocks, it's probable they could not have been reduced to the extremity they after were.</p>
               <p>The <hi>22d</hi> the two Armies attacqued the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in several places; the Army of the Duke being advanced as far as the Plain of St <hi>John,</hi> divided it self into several bodys, who attacqued at the same time divers retrenchments that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had in the Valleys of <hi>Lucerne</hi> and <hi>Angrogne;</hi> the <hi>Vaudois</hi> not being able to stand the fury of the Enemies Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non in those open retrenchments, were constrained, after some resistance, to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62674:93"/>
abandon a part of their retrenchments and to put themselves into another stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger retrenchment above <hi>Angrogne,</hi> where were 500 men: The enemies after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving burned all their Houses, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so ever came in their way, came to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque the Fort, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> defended themselves so stoutly against the whole Army, that they kept that Post a whole day, with the loss of only five men, and the enemies lost above 300, although they were very well covered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments; the <hi>Vaudois</hi> fearing they could not longer keep this Post, desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it and put themselves into another, which was about 200 paces higher above the former, and far more advantagious; there they expected their enemies with a great deal of resolution and courage, who advanced to attacque them, when news was brought them that those of the Valley of St. <hi>Martin</hi> had yielded themselves up to the <hi>French,</hi> who came to fall upon them in the rear: This Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, as we have said, was the strongest of all the Valleys, and from thence they might easily enter into the Valleys of <hi>Lucerne</hi> and <hi>Angrogne:</hi> They did not know upon what Conditions they had surrendred, nor how their Brethren there
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62674:94"/>
had been treated by the <hi>French.</hi> This melancholy news obliged the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to enter into a treaty with Don <hi>Gabriel de Savoy,</hi> Uncle to the Duke, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Army, and with the other Generals, who after having known the sentiments of his Royal Highness, who was at <hi>Lucerne,</hi> promised positively on his behalf and their own, that all past should be pardoned, and that they should have the conditions promised in the Edict of the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> provided they would surrender themselves up to His Most Serene Royal Highness's Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency; but the <hi>Vaudois</hi> making some difficulty to trust this bare promise, Don <hi>Gabriel</hi> who was advertised of it, sent them a promise in writing, signed with his own hand, in the name of His Most Serene Royal Highness, in these words, <hi>Lay your Arms down speedily, and throw your selves upon His Royal Highness's Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and assure your selves he will extend his grace and favour to you, and none shall touch your persons, nor those of your Wives and Children:</hi> An anssurance of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, one would think, was security e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the lives and liberties of the <hi>Vaudois:</hi> This promise was made in the name of the Duke, but if it had but
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62674:94"/>
been in the name of Don <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and the General Officers, it ought not to be less inviolable, for we do not read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Turks, nor the most Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations that are, that ever such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises were violated. The <hi>Vaudois</hi> laid down their Arms upon confidence of this promise, and the most part surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themselves up to their enemies, but all those that came within their power were made Prisoners, and sent to the Town of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> under pretence that they should be conducted thither to make their submissions. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies presently seized on all the Posts that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had possessed in the Community of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have violated their faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise they had given, that they would not meddle with their persons, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them Prisoners, they sacked, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged and burnt the Houses of these people, and put a great many of them to the Edge of the Sword of all Ages and Sexes, and violated many Women and Maids, and committed such brutal actions, that may astonish all that have any sentiments of humanity.</p>
               <p>After this treaty, many of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> retreated afar off, and would not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62674:95"/>
themselves into the hand of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, till they knew what became of the first that had surrendred; and these seeing that the Army committed execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cruelties every where, where they went, and that they kept all those that surrendred prisoners, they hid themselves in the Woods, and sent by one of St. <hi>Johns</hi> a Petition to Don <hi>Gabriel</hi> to desire him to release their Brethren that were kept prisoners against his solemn promise, and to cease all acts of hostility, that the Army committed with such barbarity.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Gabriel</hi> returned them no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, but some Officers answered him that brought the Petition, they were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried to <hi>Lucerne</hi> to make their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions to His Royal Highness, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they should be released, which notwithstanding was not done. The treaty made with Don <hi>Gabriel</hi> in one of the Articles was, that the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> should enjoy the benefit of the Edict of the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> which promised them liberty of going out of the Duke's Dominions, and carrying with them their moveables, and what effects they pleased, and to sell their effects and goods that they should leave behind; all these conditions were violated, they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62674:95"/>
took and pillaged all their effects, and burned their Houses, and all they could not carry away.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> who were in the Post, of which we have spoke, having surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themselves to their enemies upon the terms we have mentioned, Don <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> made one part of his Army possess themselves of the high places of the Valley of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> who finding no more resistance, came to the Meadow of <hi>Tour,</hi> the most considerable Fort of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and in which was the greatest part of their Cattle; the Marquess of <hi>Parelle,</hi> who commanded this body of men, told the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that were in the Fort, that peace was made by the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> and that they had nothing to do but to enjoy the fruit of it: He assured them at the same time, upon the word of a person of honour, that if they would put themselves into his hands, he would neither meddle with their persons, nor the persons of their Wives and Children, and that they might carry with them what they would, without the least fear or danger of any thing being taken from them, and that they had nothing to do but to come to <hi>Lucerne,</hi> where His Most Serene
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62674:96"/>
Royal Highness was to make their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, and after that all those that would become Catholicks might return in all security, to their Houses and Estates, and that those that would go out of his Highnesses Dominions might have Liberty, according to the Edict of the 9th. of <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> who were in the Fort of <hi>Tour,</hi> surrendred themselves likewise, upon the promises of the Marquess of <hi>Parelle,</hi> which were no better observed than those of <hi>Don Gabriel;</hi> for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were no sooner entred into the Fort of <hi>Tour,</hi> than all that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had was given to the plunder of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didrs, and the Bandits of <hi>Mondovi,</hi> their most Capital Enemies, who enriched themselves with their Spoils, and those that were in the Fort, of which the greatest number were old men, and sick women, and children, were made Prisoners with some Ministers, and driven on with that Fury, that those whom Age or Sickness would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of march fast enough, were killed out to hand, or thrown off the Rocks and Precipices: Behold the Prowess and inviolable Faith of the Army of the Duke! Let us now see what the <hi>French</hi> Army did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:62674:96"/>
At the same time that the Dukes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my attacked the Valleys of <hi>Lucerne</hi> and <hi>Angrogne,</hi> that of <hi>France,</hi> commanded by Monsieur <hi>Catinat,</hi> fell upon those of <hi>Perouse</hi> and St. <hi>Martin,</hi> the 22d. of <hi>April,</hi> they marched two hours before day, by Torch-light, and followed for some time the Banks of the River of <hi>Cluson,</hi> which is in the Territories of <hi>France;</hi> this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral made a Detachment of Foot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Villevielle</hi> Lieutenant Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Regiment of <hi>Limosin,</hi> who having passed the River upon a Bridge, entred into the Valley of <hi>Perouse,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Duke, they seized upon St. <hi>German,</hi> a Village that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had abandoned, and came to force a Retrenchment which they had above, in which there was 200 men, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> after some resistance quitted that post, and intrenched themselves in another more advantageous; in the interim, a new Detachment of Horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, having past the River, came to support those who were engaged in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, they did their utmost both together to master the <hi>Vaudois</hi> retrenchments, and they thought to carry them, being ten against one, but they found so great resistance, that after having lost a great
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62674:97"/>
many men, they intrenched themselves about a Pistol shot off, and they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually fired one upon another more than ten hours, but at last the <hi>Vaudois</hi> came out of their Retrenchment, with their Swords in their hands, which much surprized the <hi>French</hi> who did not expect so daring an action, and chased them into the Plain, beyond <hi>Cluson,</hi> where by good Fortune they found a Bridge that saved them from drowning; in this action there were more than 500 <hi>French</hi> men killed and wounded, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had but 2 men killed, and some few wounded in this rout. <hi>Villevielle</hi> fortified himself in the Church of St. <hi>German,</hi> with 70 Soldiers and some Officers, he was summoned to surrender, and they proffered him good quarter, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused and gave many proofs of great Valour and Resolution, although a great part of his men were wounded and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the <hi>Vaudois</hi> without doubt had forced it, but the night coming on they found themselves so harrassed with the fatigue they had endured all day, that they were constrained, after having lost some Soldiers at the Church door, to go and seek some refreshment, <hi>Villevielle</hi> was disengaged the day following, early
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62674:97"/>
in the morning, by some Troops that the Governour of <hi>Pignerol</hi> made to march thither all night long; the <hi>Vaudois</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themselves to their Retrenchments, thinking that they came to attack them, but the Enemies being now a greater number than they were the day before, contented themselves to intrench out of Pistol shot, without firing for two days together on either side, only some ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom shot.</p>
               <p>While things went thus in <hi>Perouse,</hi> the body of the <hi>French</hi> army marched up by the River of <hi>Cluson</hi> to the Fort of <hi>Perouse,</hi> in the Territories of <hi>France; Catinat</hi> then made a Detachment of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry commanded by <hi>Melac,</hi> which having passed the River, over two Bridges, marched to gain the Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which separated the Valley of St. <hi>Martin</hi> from the <hi>Delphinate,</hi> the rest of the Army having passed the River went to incamp with <hi>Catinat</hi> at <hi>Clos de Bolards,</hi> one part of the night, and the morrow following being the 23d. he attacked the Valley of St. <hi>Martin</hi> at a Village called <hi>Rioclaret:</hi> But as those that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in this Valley, did not believe they should be attacked after the proffers they had made of submitting themselves
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62674:98"/>
to the Edict of the 9th. of <hi>April,</hi> and above all because the appointed day was not elapsed, for their departure out of the Valleys; so the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of this Valley had not put themselves in a posture of defence, and so made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance; they thought it best to lay down their arms, and implore the Mercy and Clemency of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; but the <hi>French</hi> being enraged at what hapned near St. <hi>German,</hi> did not content themselves to pillage and burn their houses, but they massacred, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinction of Age or Sex, with an incredible Fury, all that could not fly from their Barbarity.</p>
               <p>We are to observe, that the Valley of St. <hi>Martin</hi> had entred into all the engagements with the other Valleys by a general consent of that Community, by their Deputies, at the general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly held at <hi>Angrogne,</hi> the 14th. of <hi>April,</hi> and this Valley which was the strongest of all, having changed their sentiments some days after sent to the Court, that they accepted of the Edict of the 9th. of <hi>April:</hi> This unexpected change was very prejudicial to the others, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enemies were Masters of this Valley, from whence they might easily

pass into the rest, began to despair of defending themselves; this heart-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing news obliged the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to enter into Treaty, and make the best terms they could for themselves: If the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of these Valleys had defended themselves, as they might and ought, and that those of the other Valleys had contented themselves to guard the strongest passes of the Mountains, it had been hard for the Enemies to root them out. And two great Armies, as were those of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> could not have subsisted long there without perishing, either by Famine or by the Sword of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> as it had hapned to other Armies, in the precedent wars, that were sent to make war upon them, and destroy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catinat</hi> after having ravaged the whole Country of <hi>Rioclaret,</hi> in a strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; left some Troops in the Valley of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and with a part of his Army crossed over the Mountains, that divide this Valley from that of <hi>Perouse,</hi> and encamped himself without finding any Resistance in the Community of <hi>Parmol,</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Perouse;</hi> the Soldiers massacred all those that fell into their hands, having no pity of women; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62674:100"/>
to the General of the <hi>French</hi> army to compose all matters; this General who desired no better, told him, that the intention of his Royal Highness was to pardon them, and promised them posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as well on the behalf of the Duke, as of his own, life and liberty, with permission to return without any danger to their houses and estates, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they would speedily lay down their arms; and as to what the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties said, that they were afraid that the <hi>French</hi> being enraged at what happened at <hi>St. German,</hi> should revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the <hi>Vaudois</hi> when disarmed, he made great protestations, with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Oaths, That if all their Army went by their houses, they would not kill so much as a Chick. This agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being made, <hi>Catinat</hi> kept with him one of the Deputies, and sent the rest to tell the <hi>Vaudois</hi> what was done, and to oblige all those that were fled into the Mountains to surrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the day following, being the 25th. of <hi>April,</hi> at <hi>Peumian,</hi> that every one might return to his own home after they were informed of the peace: While the <hi>Vaudois</hi> gathered together at <hi>Peumian</hi> the dispersed Families, <hi>Catinat</hi> gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62674:100"/>
of this Capitulation to <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> who sent him the same day a Courier, which passed through <hi>Peumian,</hi> and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that were there that he was the Messenger of Peace, and the day after at his return he told them that Peace was concluded; they were so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded and secure of it, that the day before they laid down their arms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding entirely in the promises of <hi>Catinat,</hi> in this estate they expected news of the Confirmation of it at <hi>Peumian;</hi> but this <hi>French</hi> General observed no better the Treaty with the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> that were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled at <hi>Peumian,</hi> than the General of the Duke's army did with those of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grogne;</hi> for he sent thither a Captain of the Garrison of the Fort of <hi>Perouse,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by many Dragoons, he was well known to the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who afresh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated the assurances of Peace, but they were fraudulent assurances, as were those of the Generals; in conclusion, he put the men in one quarter, and the women and children in another, the <hi>French</hi> Troops being come the same time, told the men they had orders to carry them back to their own houses, and made them march four and four; these poor people being constrained to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62674:101"/>
leave their Wives and Children, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Discretion of the Soldiers, were conducted not to their houses, as it was promised, but to <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> who was encamped upon the Mountain of <hi>Vachere,</hi> who ordered them to be carried Prisoners to <hi>Lucerne;</hi> while they treated the men thus, they experienced all that Fury and Brutality is capable to inspire enraged and insolent Soldiers with; these Barbarians were not content to rob them of all their Money, but they likewise violated many women and maids, with circumstances that are an abomination to nature, and massaceed those that fled to save their honour. <hi>Catinat</hi> was not present at what was done at <hi>Peumian,</hi> he left the conduct of that affair to some Officers, that he might not be obliged to hear the just complaints of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> about their breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and more than barbarous perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; or else that he might not be spectator of the design that was upon these poor distressed people: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it was, it's certain, that except those women that were killed, and those that escaped by flight the persecution of these Monsters, and saved themselves in the neighbouring wood from the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62674:101"/>
danger of the shot, that was made after them to stop them, all the rest were dragged into divers Prisons, with mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Inhumanity.</p>
               <p>The Valley of <hi>Perouse</hi> being reduced by the Capitulation of <hi>Peumian,</hi> one part of the <hi>Fr.</hi> Army quitted that Valley, and marched to joyn the Army of the Duke, which was encamped upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Vachere;</hi> and then it was that from all sides they gathered together the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and dragged them into several Prisons and Castles, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that they carried them to his most serene Royal Highness to beg his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; but that which affected these poor people the more sensibly, and made them the greatest object of compassion was, that at their most earnest entreaty and tears they refused to put whole Families together, they separated the Father from his Son, and the Husband from the Wife, that they might not have the means to comfort and help one another; their Enemies were not content to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the publick Faith of the Treaty and Oaths, which always were counted sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred among men, but they violated the Bonds of Nature and Blood, to the end they might be less able to undergo the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62674:102"/>
evils intended them; there was a great number of Young Boys and Girls, which they did not imprison, but dispersed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several houses though <hi>Piemont;</hi> not through a motive of equity or compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but to make them change their Religion, and to bring them up in the <hi>Roman</hi> Superstition; and by this means to quite alienate their affections from their Fathers and Mothers.</p>
               <p>There was yet a great number of <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois,</hi> who had not surrendred, and had not been taken prisoners; those of <hi>Villar, Bobbi,</hi> and some other places of the Valley of <hi>Lucerne</hi> would not enter into a treaty as the rest had done, lest they should be served the same sauce: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those of <hi>Angrogne</hi> had joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with them, having seen the breach of treaty and solemn parole. A great many of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of the Valley of St. <hi>Martin</hi> had sought for themselves places to retreat in among the Woods and Rocks, to save themselves from the barbarity of the <hi>French,</hi> who gave no quarter. The enemies resolved either by force or policy to make themselves masters of these <hi>Vaudois,</hi> as well as of the other; and to this end, while the Duke's Army was employed against those that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62674:102"/>
as yet were in Arms in the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> returned into the Valley of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Parelle,</hi> a person well known to the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and very proper to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them; this Marquess knew by experience, that craft and wicked poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was a more sure method to gain their design than open force. Behold here the policy, or rather treachery which he made use of; there were some of the chief among the <hi>Vaudois</hi> who had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred themselves upon the Publick Faith of the treaty, and in whom the people had great confidence; he made these march in the Front of the Army, and clapping Pistols to their Heads, not only forced them to serve for guards to the <hi>French</hi> Army to discover the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in their most secret fastnesses, but also to write Letters to their Countrymen in the Valley of St. <hi>Martin</hi> to exhort them to surrender themselves to the Clemency of their Prince, whose grace and favour would be extended to all that would in due time make experience of it; and because the conduct hitherto made use of towards those that had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto surrendred, might make them diffident of this sollicitation, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62674:103"/>
to many of their Letters, that all prisoners speedily should be released. Upon the credit of these Letters, they knowing perfectly their Hands and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and upon the assurance that the Marquess of <hi>Parelle,</hi> and the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers gave them of peace, and the favour of their Prince, many of these poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple yielded themselves up into their hands; many of the rest were either ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or Massacred by the Soldiers; but those that yielded and those that were taken, had both the same destiny, and were equally dragged with great inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity into several Prisons.</p>
               <p>Whilst craft and cruelty despoiled the Valley of St. <hi>Martin</hi> of its Inhabitants, we must go see what passed in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Lucerne.</hi> The <hi>Vaudois,</hi> as yet, possessed two considerable Posts, the one called <hi>Iaimet,</hi> and the other <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rama</hi> above <hi>Tour,</hi> into which a part of those that had saved themselves from the Massacre of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> had put and fortified themselves; these two Posts covered <hi>Villars,</hi> where there were about a thousand Souls, Old Men, Women and Children: A detachment of the Army of the Duke, supported by the Bandit's of <hi>Mondovi,</hi> attacqued these two
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62674:103"/>
Posts, where the <hi>Vandois</hi> defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a whole day with a great deal of courage and extraordinary valour; they killed a great number of the Enemy, amongst whom were several Officers of Note; the Commander of the Bandit's there also lost his life; the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had but six men killed, and as many wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The Enemy being sore fatigued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to want Ammunition, and began to think of a retreat; but considering they might be easily pursued and defeated in their retreat, they made use of this stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem; many Officers having laid their Arms and Hats upon the ground, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached about the closing of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the retrenchment of <hi>Chamruma</hi> with a Handcherchief about the end of a stick, and demanded a parley, and made propositions of peace; they shewed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a Paper, and told the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that they had received Letters, which brought the news that peace was made all over the Valleys; that His Royal Highness had extended his grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to all his Subjects, and if they would not further provoke his Arms, they might be comprised in it; they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they had received orders to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62674:104"/>
shoot no more, and to retreat, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to do the same, and accept of the clemency and favour of their Prince, of which the <hi>Prodesta Prat;</hi> who was there present, could assure them; this <hi>Prodesta,</hi> who was well known to the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> having joyned his protestations to those of the Officers, and they having altogether promised them their lives and liberties, provided they would retreat: The <hi>Vaudois</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in these promises, did not only give over shooting, but they gave like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to their enemies, whom they might have defeated, liberty of retreating, and they themselves quitted the Post, being fully perswaded that peace was made. Many of the Communities, who sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred themselves at <hi>Tour,</hi> to enjoy the fruits of this peace, were presently sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on and put in Prison. The <hi>Vaudois</hi> had no sooner abandoned the Post of <hi>Chamruma,</hi> but the enemies possessed it, being of extraordinary importance.</p>
               <p>Those that were at <hi>Iaimet,</hi> and had not entred into the treaty, were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to quit their Post, because it was commanded by the other, and marched to another Post near <hi>Villar;</hi> the enemy followed them close, and encamped
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62674:104"/>
themselves at <hi>Bonnet,</hi> upon the avenues of <hi>Villars</hi> and <hi>Bobbi,</hi> and staid there two days, without giving the least distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who were joyned, and made up about four or five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men. The Officers of the Army in the interim made them several pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of peace, promising great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters if they would surrender, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly threatning them if they defended themselves. The <hi>Vaudois</hi> made answer, that they desired nothing more than peace; but that the peace that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented them was more dangerous than war, since it could not be bought, but at the price of their liberty; that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the peace they had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them of <hi>Chamruma,</hi> and upon confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of which the had quitted their advantagious Post, they had imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that surrendred; that the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Brethren taught them what they must expect from such proposals: This notwithstanding did not hinder many of these poor innocents from yielding themselves up to their enemies, grounding their confidence upon Oath that was made them, that all would quickly be set at liberty, and they were only carried before his Royal Highness
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62674:105"/>
to make their submission and beg his pardon; but these credulous innocents were likewise put in prison, and treated as the rest.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> being sore weakned, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned <hi>Villars,</hi> of which the enemy presently possessed themselves. The <hi>Vaudois</hi> were very quiet till the fourth of <hi>May,</hi> that the enemies Troops being reinforced, marched to attack <hi>Bobbi,</hi> where the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were retreated, but they were repulsed by 150 <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who were posted upon the Mountain of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jusque,</hi> and who, without the loss of a man, killed several Officers and a great number of Soldiers. The <hi>12th</hi> of the same month the two Armys being join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, resolved to force <hi>Bobbi,</hi> but the <hi>Vaudois</hi> defended it so well, that after a fight that lasted a whole day, their enemies were forced to retreat with great loss.</p>
               <p>The day following the Marquess of <hi>Parelle,</hi> who came from the Valley of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> passed St. <hi>Juliane,</hi> a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which was then believed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible, and he was in a condition to attack the <hi>Vaudois</hi> from above; this obliged them to quit <hi>Bobbi,</hi> and place themselves among the Woods and Rocks. The Marquess of <hi>Parelle,</hi> and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62674:105"/>
the Count of <hi>Brichanteau,</hi> having posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Posts that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, sent to them in their Fastnesses, divers persons to exhort them to yield, and offered them the pardon of their Prince. One part of these poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being sorely harrassed and pressed with famine and other miseries, laid hold on the proffer, but they lost their liberty as well as the rest; there were some also who surrendred themselves to the Governour of the Fort of <hi>Mirebouc,</hi> upon promise that he made them of life and liberty; but this Governour paid their confidence with a rigorous impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment. Those who had posted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Mountain of <hi>Vandelin,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having fought manfully for some time, suffered themselves at last to be seduced by the Count <hi>de la Roche,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Valleys; he did promise them positively, by a Writing under his Hand, that they should return to their Houses without the least molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but they had no sooner quitted their Post, than he made them be sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on and imprisoned, taking from them the Paper he had signed with his own hand.

there was a little party of <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who chose rather to suffer famine, and all sorts of miseries among the Woods and Rocks, where they had hid themselves, than to put themselves into the hands of their enemies. The General sent a part of his Troops after them, to seek them out, they found some who were massacred in the endeavouring to make their ascape, others were presently hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Trees, others were carried Prisoners to <hi>Lucerne,</hi> and afterwards cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly hanged; among whom was Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Leidet,</hi> a Minister in the Valley of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> who died a most Christian death.</p>

               <p>The enemies of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> having by their perfidiousness and treachery, killed more than three thousand of them, and deprived above ten thousand of their liberty; and taken and dispersed above two thousand Children, they

                  <p>Containing a just diffidence of a part of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> which was the cause of their preservation: Their courage and firm resolution to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, which procured them a safe retreat out of the Duke's Dominions, with Letters of safe Conduct.</p>

               <p>ABout the end of the month of <hi>Iune</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Army and the Bandit's of <hi>Mondovi</hi> retired, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that would not hearken to the fraudulent propositions of peace that were offered them, nor confide in the deceitful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of their enemies, being not so straitned by the Army of the Duke, which alone staid behind in the Valleys, came out of the places where they had hid themselves, to seek for Victuals, to sustain their languishing life, there
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62674:110"/>
were about fourscore in the Valley of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> and fifty in that of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> with some Women and Children. As soon as they were assembled together, they seized upon an advantagious Post, that their enemies had quitted, after that they made several excursions into the Plain, and allways carried off good store of booty and provisions: They beat upon several occasions, many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments of the enemy, killed a great number of the <hi>Savoyards</hi> that were come to inhabit in the Valleys, and did for some months such bold and couragious actions, that they put their enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Contribution, and forced them to furnish them with Victuals, to hinder their excursions into the Plain. The Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> having to no purpose employed force to chace them out of Valleys, made them under hand an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of safe conduct, and Hostages for the security of their safe retreat out of the Country. Those that brought this proposal to the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> did not avow that they acted by order of the Court of <hi>Turin;</hi> on the contrary, they told them, they spoke without any directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from thence, but on their own heads, and promised them that they did not
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62674:110"/>
doubt but to procure them passports and hostages by their own interest in that Court, but it's certain that this was not transacted without leave of the Court; for besides that no one particular person durst of his own head intermeddle in the affair, the safe conducts that were after expedited, shewed clearly that all was done by order of the Court; the <hi>Vaudois</hi> refused to hearken to these propositions, whether it was because they had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their promises, or because they were resolved to dye, or release their Brethren out of Captivity, Death being more sweet to them than life, as long as their Brethren groaned under the Chains of their Enemies, in Prison; to oblige the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to accept of these of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, they were told that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had declared, that as long as they were in arms he would not release the Prisoners; but they were positively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, that as soon as they were gone out of the Country, their Brethren should be set at Liberty. The <hi>Vaudois</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that their Resistance might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their Enemies with a pretence of detaining the Prisoners, thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obliged to retire out of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the D. of <hi>Savoy.</hi> It was at last
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62674:111"/>
agreed, that they should go out of the Valleys with their Wives and Children, Arms and Baggage in two Troops or Brigades, their charges to be born, and conducted safe into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> at two several times, by a Captain of his Royal Highnesses called <hi>Perret,</hi> with passports in due form; that for the security of of the first Troop, there should Hostages be left in the Valleys, in the hands of the second, who should keep them till they had certain intelligence of the safe arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the first at the place agreed on, and after that the first Troop should be safe arrived, that Captain <hi>Perret</hi> should give an Officer of his Kindred for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stage, till the second Troop should be arrived there in safety. If the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that treated with <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> and with <hi>Catinat,</hi> had had these precautions, and had not laid down their arms, but taken Hostages for the performance of the promises that were made them, they had not been imprisoned by thousands, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had their Children been taken away and their Wives and Daughters violated.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> that were in the Valley of St. <hi>Martin</hi> did almost the same, that those had done who were in the Valley of <hi>Lucerne;</hi> for though they were fewer

in number, they notwithstanding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themselves with so much courage and resolution, that they forced their Enemies to grant them safe conduct and security to pass into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> with their Wives and Children, Arms and Baggage; those that were in one of these Valleys, knew not what was done in the other, the Enemy having seized on all the passes, hindred all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; if they could have had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence one of another, they would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt have had more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous terms, and perchance might have procured the Liberty of their Brethren. For whether it was that the Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> was obliged to maintain an Army in the Valleys, to hinder the excursions of the <hi>Vaudois;</hi> or whether it was that there was a design to people this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with <hi>Savoyards,</hi> who had no mind to go and live there, as long as the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were there in arms; it's highly propable that to oblige them to go out, the Court would have consented to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the Prisoners.</p>

In which they resolved to demand of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> an enlargement of all the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to this end, they sent two Deputies to the Count <hi>de Govon</hi> Resident of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> at <hi>Lucerne</hi> in <hi>Switzerland;</hi> these Deputies having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62674:112"/>
the business to the Resident, and having shewed him the reasons that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Protestant <hi>Cantons</hi> to interest themselves in the affairs of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> they entred into a treaty with him, in the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> upon certain Articles to be ratified by their respective Superiours; the substance of it was, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> should give Liberty to all the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to come safe to <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that he should cloath them, conduct them, and defray their charges till they came to the Frontiers of <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> and there the <hi>Cantons</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and conduct them into their Country: The <hi>Swisse</hi> presently ratified this Treaty, but the Duke did not ratify it, till some time after; the Duke started some difficulties, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way these people should take, in going out of his Territories, he would have them go over the Mountains which thenwere inaccessible, by reason of the great Snow with which they were covered, by the Country of <hi>Velay,</hi> which neither belongs to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> nor the <hi>Swisse,</hi> but to the Bishop of <hi>Sion.</hi> The Protestant <hi>Cantons</hi> seeing unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry scruples raised, to hinder the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Treaty, made their complaint
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62674:113"/>
to the Count <hi>de Govon,</hi> who upon this wrote to the Duke his Master; the Duke at last gave them leave to pass through that part of <hi>Savoy</hi> that confines upon <hi>Bearne,</hi> and parts the Territory of <hi>Geneva</hi> from <hi>Savoy,</hi> he made the Prisons be opened, but this was not done till the heart of winter, and in such a rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous season, that according to all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability those that had escaped in Prison must perish by the way.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> who by their Valour had procured themselves safe conduct, arrived in <hi>Switzerland</hi> about the end of <hi>October,</hi> but those that had been Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did not arrive at <hi>Geneva</hi> till <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would be a hard matter to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent all the miseries and Calamities these Prisoners suffered during their Captivity, they were dispersed to the number of about 10000 men, women, and children in 14 Prisons, or Castles of the state of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and they were more or less ill treated according to the humours of those that had the command of those Prisons; but it's certain that they were in every Prison exposed to great inconveniencies and miseries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:62674:113"/>
They had nothing in the several Prisons, but Bread and Water for their ordinary Food, and not enough of that neither in some Prisons; they gave them course black bread, without any substance in it, which they did knead with dirty water, that they took out of the Channels of the streets, and in the bread they often found Lime, Glass, and other filth; in other places they gave them nothing but stinking corrupt water, that they could scarce drink off; in some places they were obliged to fetch it themselves, at places where the Cattle were watered, and where they washed their Dogs and other Nastiness; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places they would not permit them that they should take the water, as it came out of the Wells, but as it ran through pipes, exposed to the heat of the Sun, to the end they might drink nothing but hot water; in other places they gave them water only at certain set times, and if they were ready to be burnt up with thirst they would not give them a glass to save their Lives, and this was the occasion of the death of several; they had no Beds but the hard Bricks, with which the Chambers of <hi>Piemont</hi> are paved, and that without
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62674:114"/>
Straw, and if in some places they allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them Straw, it was rotten and full of Vermin.</p>
               <p>They were so thronged in the Prisons that they could scarce stir, and when some of them dyed, which hapned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every day, they put in more fresh Prisoners that they might be always equally thronged: The great heat of the Summer, and the corruption that the Chambers were infected with, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great number of the sick, had engendered a great quantity of Vermin, which would not let the Prisoners sleep, either night or day; there were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise great Worms which eat and made holes in their Skins, and many even alive became the food of these Vermin, which are wont only to prey upon the dead; they did not only endure all the Inconveniences of heat, which is exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive great in <hi>Piemont;</hi> but likewise of horrible cold, for in the very heart of winter they neither allowed Fire nor Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlets, although they were in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers above, of which the greatest part wanted glass in the windows, and so were exposed to the extream rigour of the season which is very sharp, being near those Mountains of eternal Snow;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62674:114"/>
they allowed them no Candles in the night, neither Summer nor Winter, although they were often submissively asked, that they might with the more convenience help the sick; a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of women in their Labour expired for want of help, and necessary women on those occasions, and the Children had the same fate their with distressed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, receiving their deaths-wound the first moment of Life; but as if what they suffered in their bodies was not enough alone, their Souls were persecuted in a most dangerous manner, for their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Regulars did their utmost by their sly insinuations, to make them change their Religion: but God gave them the Grace of Perfeverance, and there were but few that yielded to the strength of the Temptation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vaudois</hi> Prisoners were in this sad condition, when the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> made Proclamation they should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased, and have Liberty of retiring into <hi>Swtizerland;</hi> but this Proclamation was not made in the same manner, nor at the same time every where, but suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively, according to what number were permitted to go first together; it was made by an Auditor of the Dukes,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62674:115"/>
who first made all the Prisoners be brought before him, who told them, that all those that would retire out of the Dukes estate were at Liberty to do so, even those that had promised to change their Religion, for promises that were were made in Prison were looked upon as forced, and consequently null; that they were at Liberty to go or to change their Religion: All that the Auditor said was only to try them, for their Priests and Keepers of the Prisons did what was possible to hinder its effects; they told them that the rigour of the season, and the cruelty of the Soldiers would destroy a great many of them in the way, which hapned to the Prisoners that were at <hi>Mondovi,</hi> whom they made to begin their march at five of the Clock at night, the same day that the liberty of going was proclaimed; these distressed people were most of them distempered with divers Diseases, yet they made them march that bitter cold night upon Snow and Ice, four or five leagues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any rest, which was the cause that more than an hundred and fifty sunk under the burthen of their maladies and fatigues, and dyed, their Brethren not being able to assist them in the least; the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62674:115"/>
same thing happened to the Prisoners that were at <hi>Fossan,</hi> there was a company of them that lay all night, at the foot of Mount <hi>Sonis,</hi> who when they were ready to march the next morning, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that there was a terrible Tempest upon the Mountain, they told the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of it, and desired him, that they might have leave to stay till it were past, and to have pity of so many weak and sick people; but this Officer having less sence of pity than the very Rocks, had the Cruelty to make them march immediately, and so to sacrifice a part of them to his Barbarity, for fourscore and six of them dyed, and were buried by that horrible tempest of Snow; they were most of them old men, women and children, who had not strength to resist the rigour of the season, and the violence of the storm; their Relations were forced to leave them there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the food of wild Beasts, and take a sorrowful leave of them, not being able to pay them the last debt due to so near Relations. Some Merchants that afterwards passed over the Mountains saw the bodies of these miserable people, extended upon the Snow, the Mothers having their Children in their arms; in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62674:116"/>
other places they cruelly whipped the Prisoners that would not change their Religion, particularly at <hi>Ast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Officers that conducted the rest, used them more mercifully and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, whether it was their natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to do so, or that the complaints that the Deputies of the <hi>Cantons</hi> made, at the Court of <hi>Turin</hi> upon this subject, made them change the orders that they had given to those that conducted them, I am not able to determine.</p>
               <p>They violated likewise the Treaty that was made with the Count <hi>de Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von</hi> in several Articles, first of all, in the way they took from the Parents several Children. Secondly, They would not release the Ministers, but kept them close Prisoners. Thirdly, In that they were promised to be cloathed, before they went out of the Dukes dominions, which was very just it should be done, since they detained all their Goods, and sent them into perpetual Banishment, in a most rigorous season, and instead of cloathing them as they ought, they only gave them some old pitiful Coats, and little useless Breeches.</p>
               <p>These poor people came to <hi>Geneva</hi> about <hi>Christmas,</hi> at divers times, and in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62674:116"/>
several little Companies, which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all of about 2500 persons. One may judge from hence, how rigorous and severe their imprisonment was by the number of those that dyed in this miserable estate, since of 10000 Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners only 2500 escaped; they were all in such a miserable condition, that when they came to <hi>Geneva</hi> they dyed between the two gates of the City, finding the end of their Life in the beginning of their Liberty; some were so sick that their death was expected every moment, in the arms of those that had the charity to support them; others through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of cold, had lost the use of their tongues; some were scarce able to make a step further; others had lost the use of their hands, that they could not stretch them out to receive the charity that was proffered them; the greatest part of them were half naked, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Shooes or Stockins; in short every one of them had so many marks of their sufferings, that the most cruel and pitiless persons would have been touched with a sence of their miseries. After they had reposed themselves at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and had taken necessary refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before they went into <hi>Switzerland,</hi>

the first that came, went to meet those that came after, to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of their relations, of whom they had heard no news since the surrendring of the Valleys: The Father asked for his Children, the Children for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Husband sought for the Wife, and the Wife for her Husband; and every one endeavoured to hear some news of their friends and relations, but in vain, for the greatest part of them were dead in Prison. This made such a spectacle that the by standers melted into tears, while these miserable people oppressed with the excess of grief, had not power to weep or make their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
               <p>By this relation we have made of the sufferings of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> one may see that they had the simplicity of Doves, but they had not the prudence of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, since they let themselves so often and so easily be cheated by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were not so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and innocent in their conduct, as their Enemies were wicked, malicious, cruel and fraudulent; regarding neither Faith, nor solemn promises.</p>
               <p>The advantages that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had over their Enemies, in the year 1686.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62674:117"/>
in defending the most advantageous posts, shews evidently that if they had contented themselves in guarding those posts, they had without all doubt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed both the <hi>French</hi> and the Dukes army, and kept themselves in their Country; but their misfortune was, that they were for keeping more of the Country than they were able to defend: They likewise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> committed a second o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versight, in that, when they entred into any Treaty with the Enemy, having so often had experience of their frauds and breach of promise, they did not demand Hostages, for the due performance of the Treaty, as it is commonly done, but they confided in their words and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent promises, which were always vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as soon as their turn was served.</p>
               <p>Those who to excuse the Court of <hi>Turin</hi> say, that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Subjects, who had taken up arms against their Prince, are ridiculous and impertinent; for when the <hi>Vaudois</hi> took up arms they were forced to it, they saw before they offered to stir, great Armies raised for their Destruction; now the Law of Nature, as well as that of Nations, permits every one to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his life against those that would

unjustly take it, and Princes are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by God, not to destroy, but to defend and conserve their people. Now if God, who is absolute Soveraign, Lord, and Creator of the world, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding always keeps his promise to man, and never violates his word; how much more should Princes, who are but his Ministers and Servants, keep their word, and promises made to their Subjects, that are men as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and are subject to the Law of God, as well as the meanest of their Subjects.</p>

               <p>BUt the enemies of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were not so cruel, inhumane and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous towards them, as the Republick of <hi>Geneva</hi> was courteous and charitable;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62674:118"/>
for as soon as they heard of their coming they went to meet them, and every one strove who should bring the most to his house, that he might have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er occasion of exercising his Charity: They did not only treat them as dear and tender Children, but as persons that brought peace and blessings into their families: All those that were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked were cloathed, either at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of those that charitably had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them into their house, or by the purse of the <hi>Italian</hi> Church; the Directors of which, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end, gave extraordinary marks of a tender compassion, and most ardent Charity. It was not only at <hi>Geneva</hi> that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> found conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in their miseries, but they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved great comfort and assistance in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> where the Protestant Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons at the same time opened to them their Country, and the bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, in the most generous, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and charitable manner in the World. The Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> having news of their arrival in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> desired the Protestant Cantons to send a part of them into his Dominions, and he promised them a comfortable subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62674:119"/>
The <hi>United Provinces</hi> made for them a great and generous Collection, which was sent them from time to time, and destributed according to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities.</p>
               <p>Behold how the Valleys of <hi>Piemont</hi> were dispeopled of its ancient Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and how the Torch of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, that had shined bright here so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages, was extinguished; how at last perfidiousness and treachery triumphed over the innocency and Dove-like sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the <hi>Vaudois:</hi> How the <hi>Council of the Propagation</hi> and their enemies exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the wicked designs they had so long contrived for their utter extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and how the <hi>Vaudois</hi> have suffered unjustly, and only for the sake of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, this horrible persecution and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dissipation.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were driven out of their Country, the D. of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the <hi>Council of Propagation</hi> employed all their care and study to re-people these Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys with <hi>Savoyards</hi> and <hi>Piemonteses;</hi> to the end that the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who either for fear of death or imprisonment, had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured their Religion, might not assist those that were sent into exile to return into their Country again: They tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported

most of them into the Diocess of <hi>Verceil,</hi> to inhabit there, contrary to the promise made them of establishing them in their own houses.</p>
               <p>The Valleys being repeopled with new Inhabitants of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, the Protestant <hi>Vaudois</hi> banished or in prison, and those that had forsaken their Religion being transported a great way off, there was none that believed that ever they could establish themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or so much as enter into their Country; they must of necessity cross the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and all <hi>Savoy,</hi> pass many defiles, climb up high mountains, force several straight passes, where ten men might stop a whole army.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>Vaudois</hi> saw all these difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but this did not hinder, but that (after they had led a languishing kind of Life about three years, in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi> and <hi>Germany)</hi> thoughts came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their heads of returning into their Country, and of surmounting all Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles whatsoever; for they were, for the most part, a sort of people that lived by the good management of their Goods and Lands, and because they had neither of them in <hi>Switzerland</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> they could not employ themselves. Tho they wanted for nothing, they grew very weary, and thought every day a year till they were repossessed of their Lands and Habitations, out of which they had been so unjustly driven, as we have related; to this end they assembled together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

8 or 900 in the wood of <hi>Nion,</hi> 4 Leagues from <hi>Geneva,</hi> amongst whom there were more than 300 <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, who had quitted their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try likewise for their Religion; they did it so secretly, that neither the Lords of <hi>Bern,</hi> nor the <hi>Savoyards</hi> knew any thing of it, till they had passed the Lake, and that they were entred into <hi>Savoy.</hi> They crossed the Lake in the night, in twelve Barks that they had partly hired, and partly seized on at <hi>Nion,</hi> and the adjacent places; this was in the beginning of <hi>September</hi> 1689 that they entred into <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy;</hi> they had then no head, but they chose two to conduct and command them, one of them was a Minister called <hi>Arnold,</hi> the other was a Mason called <hi>Turel,</hi> both brave and couragious, but without experience in the affairs of war; they landed without any resistance, and had the prudence to invest two Villages which were near the place where they made their descent, the Inhabitants of which would have rung their Bell, and given the alarm to the whole Country, but they threatned to burn their houses if they did, and made them give them Victuals for their Money. They had likewise the precaution to send a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62674:121"/>
to seize upon the bridge of <hi>Trembliers</hi> before their Enemies perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and so they passed without any let or molestation the deep and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid river <hi>Arve?</hi> but if they found no difficulty in the beginning, it was not so in the conclusion: The Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and that of <hi>France,</hi> were presently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised of their march, and orders were given to the Governors of places, that were near their passage, to do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to stop them in the narrow passes, but they surmounted all these difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with their Swords in their hands. They had four or five dangerous Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters before they got into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but the most dangerous of all was, that they had with the Marquess of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ree,</hi> who would needs stop them at a straight pass near <hi>Salbetran;</hi> he had with him a Regiment of Dragoons, and la great body of Foot, but at last, after an obstinate and long fight they gained this pass as well as the rest, the Marquess was mortally wounded, many <hi>French</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers lost their lives, and more than 200 Soldiers. After having surmounted all these difficulties, they entred into their Country, chased out those that had seized upon their Lands and Houses, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62674:122"/>
of St. <hi>Martin</hi> which were most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, and out of which their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could not drive them, though they did the utmost after eight battels or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rencounters, that they had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained after their departure out of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> till the month of <hi>December.</hi> They had not as yet lost an hundred men, and the enemy had lost above a thousand; and in the places in which they were entrenched, they wanted neither victuals nor any sort of ammunition.

                  <p>Of the disunion and discord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Duke of Savoy, which caused the re-establishment of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in in their own Country, by order of their Prince, and of the wonders that God wrought for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> seeing that the Allies were in a condition to succour the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and King of <hi>Spain</hi> did sollicit him to take their parts, he thought that in declaring himself neuter, he might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the intended succours; but the Court of <hi>France,</hi> which till then was Mistress of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and his Estate, would not hear speak of neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, and would have the Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare wholly for <hi>France;</hi> and to oblige him to it, the King demanded of him, for the better assurance all his Troops, and that he would put into his hands the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62674:123"/>
Cittadel of <hi>Turin</hi> and <hi>Verceil,</hi> that he might in them lay up magazins, and all sorts of ammunition; hoping that the Duke would rather declare for <hi>France,</hi> than submit himself to so hard conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but seeing that the Duke demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and was dubious, he made <hi>Catinat</hi> march with sixteen thousand men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Piemont,</hi> with orders to enter into it, and constrain the Duke to do what was demanded.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> considering that if the King of <hi>France</hi> had Garrisons in the Cittadel of <hi>Turin</hi> and in <hi>Verceil,</hi> and that if all his Troops were in the service of <hi>France,</hi> that that King would not only be master of his Estate, but also of his Person, he desired time to give in his answer to the King: He offered him at the same time three thousand men of his best Troops, <hi>viz.</hi> a thousand Horse and two thousand Foot for an assurance of the neutrality, and in the interim he sent to the Allies to be secure of their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, in case he were attacked by the <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being his next Neighbours, by reason of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> offered him eight thousand men in case the <hi>French</hi> fell upon him. The haughtiness with which <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:62674:124"/>
treated him, caused him to embrace the part of the Allies, and he entred into divers treaties with them, especially with the Emperour and the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and being reinforced with the Troops of <hi>Spain,</hi> that were in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> he declared war against <hi>France,</hi> and commanded <hi>Catinat,</hi> who was Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>French</hi> Army, to be gone out of his Dominions.</p>
               <p>We are to consider that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> is a Prince of the Empire, that the Emperour and his Allies were power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and his Neighbours, above all <hi>Spain,</hi> and that they might do him great harm in succouring the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> as their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest obliged them, because they were neighbours of <hi>France,</hi> and that by their means they might make a great diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by making excursions into the <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinate,</hi> which is a Province of <hi>France</hi> near the Valleys, where there were great store of Protestants who would joyn with the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> or at least favour them. And to hinder these excursions, the <hi>French</hi> would be obliged to keep on foot a powerful army in the <hi>Delphinate:</hi> The Duke likewise knew that the Protestant <hi>Cantons</hi> kept a good correspondence with <hi>France;</hi> and above all, the <hi>Canton</hi> of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62674:124"/>
                  <hi>Berne,</hi> who had beheaded one of their Burghers, for making levys in that <hi>Canton,</hi> without their leave, for to aid the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and so there was no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that the <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Berne</hi> would give passage to those that should go to succour the <hi>Vaudois.</hi> As for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick <hi>Cantons,</hi> he was assured that neither the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> nor any that had a mind to succour them, would offer to pass through their Country, because they had seized of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that had attempted to pass that way, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them up into his hands: There were none but the <hi>Grisons</hi> that could favour their passage, but that was not enough for to go from the Country of the <hi>Grisons</hi> into <hi>Piemont,</hi> they must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily cross the whole Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> Now the Duke hoped, that in declaring himself neuter, he would hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from giving passage to the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> through the Dutchy, and that <hi>France</hi> would always assist him, as she had done for the time past, to chace out again the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that were entred Valleys: It's not to be doubted, but that if <hi>France</hi> had been contented to leave the Duke in the state of neutrality that he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that he would inviolably have
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62674:125"/>
kept it, for it was his interest not to break with <hi>France.</hi> This Prince had excellent Councellors, who saw that the King of <hi>France</hi> had his foot upon the Neck of their Duke, if I may so express my self. <hi>Savoy</hi> lay open to the Troops of <hi>France</hi> by the Fort of <hi>Barraue,</hi> which the King of <hi>France</hi> held, and by divers other places; and that there being but one strong place in <hi>Savoy,</hi> which is <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melian,</hi> it was easie for the King in a short time to make himself Master of all <hi>Savoy;</hi> and as to <hi>Piemont,</hi> the King had <hi>Pignerol,</hi> but eight leagues from <hi>Turin,</hi> and at the entrance of <hi>Piemont;</hi> and on the other side he had <hi>Cazal,</hi> and all <hi>Monferrat;</hi> and so the Dominions of this Prince were surrounded by the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories and strong places of <hi>France,</hi> and so by consequence he could not declare for the Allies, without running an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent risque of being ruined.</p>
               <p>If the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had entred into treaty with the Allies, before the <hi>French</hi> army had entred into <hi>Piemont,</hi> it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this Prince, who wants nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courage, nor conduct, nor good council, would have precautioned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against the attempts of <hi>France,</hi> would have recalled his Troops out of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62674:125"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> service, to employ them against the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> or the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in case they had enterprized any thing in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan;</hi> and their Arms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned against the <hi>Vaudois, France</hi> would not have had the least umbrage of this demand. But where are the treaties that the Duke made with the Emperour or with <hi>Spain?</hi> Have any been produced? All those that are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly seen are after the <hi>French</hi> army was entred into <hi>Piemont;</hi> and so all that is said to excuse <hi>France</hi> for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards His Most Serene Royal Highness, are impostures, and invented at leisure, without any foundation.</p>
               <p>That which has obliged, or rather forced the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to embrace the part of the Allies was, the ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not as a Soveraign Prince, but as a little Vassal. This haughtiness of <hi>France</hi> so irritated the Duke, that he chose rather to hazard all, than to do those mean things, and make those sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions that were exacted of him; and in this estate he had recourse to the Allies, and to his Neighbours, as it's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by the Letters that he wrote to them, which have since been made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>

The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> being forced to break with <hi>France,</hi> by reason of the hardships that were imposed upon him; this rupture was the cause of the liberty and deliverance of the <hi>Vaudois:</hi> For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving understood that <hi>France</hi> did sollicit them to embrace his part, with offers of re-establishing them in the Valleys, and giving them liberty of Conscience, with free and publick exercise of their Religion, which would have been very prejudicial to his interest, for instead of one enemy, he would have had two up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his back, and would have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the succours that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Princes promised the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and of the considerable service that they might do him, in keeping the Passes, and hindring the communication of the Troops that were in the <hi>Delphinate,</hi> with the Army commanded by Monsieur <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinat.</hi> This Prince resolved to draw them to his own party, and to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect he set at liberty all the <hi>Vaudois</hi> that were in Prison, as well Ministers as others; he sent an act of Oblivion to all those that were in arms in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, and gave to those that were in foreign Countries leave to return home, with necessary passports, with orders to

all to turn their arms against the <hi>French,</hi> whom they most look upon as their true persecutors, and the cause of all their miseries.

The return of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> into their Country, their entrance into the Valleys, and their subsisting there for eight months, are so many wonders and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Is it not a miracle that eight or nine hundred should undertake to cross an enemies Country of 14, or 15 days journey, where they must climb up high Mountains, force divers strait pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, where an hundred men might not only stop, but beat three thousand? and that which is most astonishing is, that these Passes were guarded with great numbers, and more expert Soldiers than the <hi>Vaudois;</hi> they notwithstanding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all those Passes with their Swords in their hands, and routed them that guarded them, killing a great number in gaining them, with very little loss on their side.</p>
               <p>It's likewise another miracle, that they got entrance into the Valleys, the entrances being so difficult, being peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, who might have hindred their entrance, being more in number than they, or at least they might have possessed themselves of the most advantagious Posts which were in the Mountains, and defend themselves easily, till the succours of <hi>France</hi> and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62674:127"/>
                  <hi>Savoy,</hi> which were in readiness, could come and second them; but a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fright from God fell upon them, so that they had neither courage nor conduct to defend themselves against the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who without any trouble or resistance chased them out of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys: Is it not likewise a great miracle, that a handful of people without any Commanders experienced in warlike affairs, should subsist eight months in the Valleys, and fight nine or ten bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels against the Army of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> who were sometimes twenty, but oftner thirty against one, without being able to drive them out of their fastnesses, having killed more than two thousand of their enemies? So many happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses makes it clear, that the God of battel inspired them with the generous courage of returning into their own Country, to kindle again the Candle of his Word, that the Emissaries of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had extinguished there, that he marched before them, and fought for them, without which it had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to have forced so many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Passes, and gained such signal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.</p>

The King of <hi>England</hi> being informed of their design of returning unto their country, blamed their enterprize, as rash and ill grounded, and looked upon those 900 <hi>Vaudois</hi> as lost men: The States of <hi>Holland</hi> were of the same opinion, and refused to assist them, looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as to no purpose; but when they saw, that contrary to the hopes of all the world, that they subsisted in the Country, last <hi>May</hi> 1690. they sent them Money, and procured some of the <hi>French</hi> Protestants that were in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> Territories, to go and assist them.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had not been entred into their Country, and had not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously defended themselves against their Enemies, the D. of <hi>Savoy</hi> when he broke with <hi>France</hi> had not thought of setting at liberty those that were unjustly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, nor of recalling those that were dispersed in Foreign Countries, and the Allies would have contented themselves with the Dukes declaration for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and embracing their party, without troubling their heads about establishing the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> though driven out against all right and justice.</p>

The conduct of God in the Re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> is admirable, and makes it evident that his divine providence has Judgment, and ways incomprehensible, surpassing all human understanding. The King of <hi>France,</hi> in the year 1686. pushed on the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to compel the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to forsake their Religion, and to take the same measures he had taken against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of <hi>France;</hi> they joined their arms together to force them, and to compass their design; they violated not only the treaty made with the Predecessors of the Duke, but likewise all Treaties, Oaths, and Promises made by their Generals; took them Prisoners, killed and massacred them, violated their Wives and Daughters, killed their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children, and made use of all sorts of Cruelty against these innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, after they had laid down their arms; and in the year 1690 God sent a Spirit of Division between the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they strove who should first gain the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to their party; and by this division the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was forced to re-establish the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in their Rights and Priviledges, and to set all at
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62674:129"/>
liberty that had been imprisoned, and to recall all those that were dispersed in Foreign Countries: And so the King of <hi>France,</hi> who had been the principal cause of their ruine, became against his will the cause of their Re-establishment, by forcing the D. of <hi>Savoy</hi> by his Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness, to join with the Allies; this shews that God mocks, and derides the designs and councils of Princes, when they are levelled against Jesus Christ and his Church; and with the breath of his mouth makes all their enterprizes vanish in Smoak. Oftentimes he makes use of the Enemies of his Church to protect and defend it. <hi>Henry</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. King of <hi>France,</hi> while he persecuted the Protestants of his own Kingdom, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured the Protestant Princes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> against the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. did the same against the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> while he did his best to ruine the Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> succoured the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of <hi>Hungary,</hi> against the Emperor <hi>Leopold.

King of <hi>France;</hi> when he was but Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> gave advice in an Assembly that was held at St. <hi>Clou,</hi> to commit the Massacre of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> and when he was King of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62674:129"/>
                  <hi>France,</hi> he emoloyed all his Forces to finish the destruction of those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained after the Massacre; but while he busied himself wholly, and took the most probable measures to put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his wicked designs, God stirred up the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> against him, who under the specious pretence of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Protestants of <hi>France,</hi> made a League against <hi>Henry,</hi> and drove him out of <hi>Paris,</hi> seized upon his Guards, and constrained him to throw himself upon the Protestants, and implore their aid and assistance, without which he had been lost; the Duke would have put him in a Cloister, as <hi>Charles Martel</hi> did <hi>Chilperick</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and seized upon his Crown. <hi>Henry</hi> in acknowledgment of the Services that he had received of the Protestants began to be very favorable to them, gave them places of security, and many other Priviledges, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Henry de Borbon,</hi> who was a Protestant, his lawful Successor to the Crown.</p>
               <p>And so God by a secret and unhop'd for way, of a cruel and implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Protestants, made him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will their Defender and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector. King <hi>Henry</hi> and the Duke of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62674:130"/>
                  <hi>Guise</hi> were both in arms against the Protestants, they jointly made war upon them, and had equally sworn their ruin: God permits they should be divided, and by their division the one to destroy, the other to deliver the Protestants, who were sore oppressed and persecuted; almost the same thing hapned in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> God sent the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of division between the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to punish them for the cruel persecution they had raised against the Protestants; these two Princes were equally their Enemies, and had resolved and vowed their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and when their malice was at the highest pitch against these poor innocent Creatures, and all things seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed desperate, God Almighty blasted their design, and made them turn their arms the one against the other, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the one by the other; as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> whom he caused to be assassinated at <hi>Blois,</hi> in the sight of all <hi>France,</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the persons of those that compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the States general, and after God had punished the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> for the evils he had done to the Protestants, he likewise punished <hi>Henry,</hi> who was

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the two Prophesies of the Scripture, accomplished in the History of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont,</hi> the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the 11th. Chapter, and the other in the 12th. of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE History of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> shews us clearly the accomplishment of two Prophesies of Scripture, the one contained in the 11th. and the other in the 12th. Chapter of the <hi>Revelation of St. John.</hi> We have made mention of the last, when we shewed that the Churches of <hi>Piemont</hi> have conserved the Doctrine of the Apostles, in its purity, from the time of the Apostles even to our days, and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was corrupted in adopting and receiving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Doctrine and Ceremonies, and communicated her Corruptions to the other Churches of the <hi>West,</hi> only the Churches of <hi>Piemont</hi> were preserved pure and undefiled; from whence it follows, by a necessary consequence,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62674:131"/>
that these Mountains and Valleys were the places assigned by God Almighty for his Church, when she fled before the Dragon; and this corruption began to infect the Church about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fifth Age (for about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Age, Popery began to triumph over Truth) without staining or defiling the Churches of <hi>Piemont,</hi> who after this corruption were publickly nourished with the bread of the word of God, without any mixture of humane Traditions, or Pagan Ceremonies. Now from the time that this corruption began in the Church, till the year 1686. that these poor Churches were dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are past 1260 years, which are the 1260 prophetical days that the Church was to be nourished in the desart, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil nor his Imps being able in so long a tract of time by all their craft and subtilty, to introduce their errors into the Church; and that which is the greatest proof of this verity, and confirms us the most in this sentiment, that this was the place that God prepared to preserve his Church in, is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Inquisition that the Popes have established, in <hi>Italy,</hi> so many ages ago, nor the Croisade that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62674:132"/>
8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. made to destroy them, nor so many wars that <hi>Antichrist</hi> and his Emissaries raised against them; nor so many bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Battles they have sustained, nor so many Persecutions and Massacres that have been made of them, that professed the truth in these Churches, could force them to forsake their Faith, or dissipate them, till the year 1686. For it was then that the time of the Prophecy was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, in respect of these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. If God had not prepared this place to preserve his Church in, why would he have done such wonders, to make them subsist in spight of the Devil and all his works? How should she have been preserved pure and immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late among these Mountains, if God had not declared himself her Protector and Defender, and had not fought for her, and with her; and brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion all the plots and frauds of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, who raged like a roaring Lyon seeking to devour her?</p>
               <p>The two witnesses of the Eleventh Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> are the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who after that the Church was corrupted, taught either by word of mouth, or by writings, the pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel; and confuted the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62674:132"/>
errors that the false Doctors introduced into the Church, by their fraudulent Dealings, and false Interpretations of the Scriptures; and it is apparent, by the writings of many Protestant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that there has no age passed, in which God has not raised up some holy and learned men, who writ and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against these errors from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fifth Age, till our times. These holy persons are represented to us by the two witnesses, for they borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Testimony from the old and new Testaments, which are the true witnesses and the true treasuries of Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial verity; and with the doctrine drawn out of the old and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they confuted all errors, and confounded the false Doctors.</p>
               <p>It's said of these two witnesses, that they shall prophesy 1260 days, which are prophetical days, as is apparent by the event, for that false doctrines were introduced into the Church in the fifth age; it was then that <hi>Innocent</hi> the 1st. Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> elevated himself above the other Bishops, which they tamely submitted to, he performing the Office of universal Bishop, in receiving appeals, from the sentences of the Bishops of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62674:133"/>
                  <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and in excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Arcadius</hi> the Emperor of the <hi>East,</hi> who was not under his jurisdiction, but under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> who likewise declared by a Bull, that none should presume to judge the Pope: It was in the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of this Pope, that the Eucharist, or Supper of our Lord, began to be called Mass, and that <hi>Pelagius</hi> began in <hi>England</hi> to sow his Doctrine of Merits, from whence sprung the Doctrines of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, Pilgrimages, Celibacy of the Clergy, and Abstinence from certain sorts of meat; it was about this time that the doctrine, as well as manners of the Church began to be corrupted. And if we reckon from the Death of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 1st. till the year 1686. we shall find that 1260 years, the time that these two witnesses were to prophesy are past. Now the Holy Ghost says, that when they shall have finished their Prophesy, and the time that God has allotted to preach and cry out against the errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to leave her inexcusable, before he pour out upon her the Vials of his just wrath and indignation; it's said, that the Beast that rises out of the deep, shall
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62674:133"/>
make war against the two Witnesses, and shall vanquish them and kill them; now this was fulfilled, first of all in <hi>France,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>Piemont;</hi> in <hi>France</hi> the Witnesses were vanquished and killed by the cruel war, that was made against them; all the Ministers were banished, and others that would not abjure their Religion, either dyed under the heavy burthen of their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or were imprisoned, or condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Gallies, or driven into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Banishment; those that have abjured are dead to heaven, if they do not rise by a serious and true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Perpetual Banishments, and Imprisonments, according to all the Lawyers, are civil deaths; those whom God gave the grace to rise after their fall, and dyed in <hi>France;</hi> their bodies were dragged through the streets, and after they had been publickly exposed, thrown upon the Dunghills; in <hi>Piemont,</hi> the witnesses were vanquished and killed as well as in <hi>France,</hi> the Ministers some were hanged, some imprisoned, others massacred, and those that remained after in the Country, were condemned to the Gallies, or else to perpetual Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; some were killed in cold
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62674:134"/>
blood, others in endeavouring their escape, lest they should fall into the hands of their Enemies, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies left without burial to be devoured by wild beasts: A great number pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in Prison, and the remainder were driven into perpetual exile; the True Religion was then totally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in the Valleys, and in the sad estate that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were then, one may say they were killed.</p>
               <p>The Prophecy says in the second place, that the dead bodys of the Witnesses shall lie exposed in the most publick place of the City, and that those of the Tribes, Languages, and Nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not permit them to be buried. Those of <hi>France,</hi> as well as the <hi>Vaudois</hi> of <hi>Piemont,</hi> who escaped the hands of their Persecutors, were banished and dispersed in foreign Countries, amongst divers Nations, People and Languages, and those that kindly received them, hindred their bodies, condemned to death by a perpetual banishment, from being buried and put in the Sepulchre, which is a state of corruption and total dissolution of the body, by the great charity they bestowed upon these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62674:134"/>
people; and these Nations have seen them in this sad estate of which we have spoke, three days and an half, which are prophetical days, every day being counted a year, according to the twelve hundred and sixty days of the Prophecy.</p>
               <p>It's said in the same Prophecy, that after these three days and an half, the spirit of life coming from God, shall enter into them, and they shall live again; and that great fear shall seize upon them that shall see them, and that they shall hear a great voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, saying to them, ascend hither, and they shall ascend up to Heaven in a Cloud, and their Enemies, to their great confusion, shall see them; this was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fulfilled in respect of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who after three years and an half, were as it were revived again, and freed from the miserable estate and condition into which they were reduced by the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous malice of their Enemies; for the Prisoners were set at liberty, the Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were recalled home, and all by order of their Prince, re-established in their Country in a better condition than ever. In the year 1686, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> at the earnest entreaty of the Protestant
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62674:135"/>
                  <hi>Cantons,</hi> freed out of Prison the greatest part of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> but it was only to send them into banishment in a strange Country; but those whom he set at liberty the last <hi>Iune,</hi> were sent home in peace, and had greater priviledges and advantages given them than ever: He promised to Cloath those that he set at liberty in the year 1686, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he did not; but those that he freed after three years and an half he cloathed very well; he excused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to them, was sorry for what had passed, imputed the cause of all their suffering to the King of <hi>France.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and his Predecessors, these two hundred years past, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themselves with all their power to dispeople these Valleys of Protestants, as we have sufficiently related above: But after the three years and an half there has been an extraordinary care taken to people them again with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants; for the Duke has not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>established the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> as well Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as Exiles, but he has given free leave and encouragement to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Refugees of <hi>France,</hi> to come and inhabit the Valleys. The Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> and his Councel, made use of the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62674:135"/>
wickedest methods imaginable, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Protestant Religion in these Valleys; but after the death of the Witnesses, <hi>viz.</hi> after the three years and an half, he did not only give free exercise of Religion in the Valleys, but even in <hi>Turin</hi> it self, the Capital City of his Dominions: And this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous change happened almost in an instant, to the great confusion of their Enemies, who looked upon them as lost men. This shews evidently, that the re-establishment of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> was the work of Heaven, and not of men; for so the Prophecy says, <hi>that the spirit of life shall enter into them, and they shall live again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author of the Fifth Empire, Printed at the <hi>Hague,</hi> by <hi>Meyndert Vyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wert,</hi> closes with our Opinion, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses excellently to our purpose, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the three years and an half, of the death of the two Witnesses. I hope it will not be troublesome to give them his own words, out of the 13th Chapter of his Book.</p>
               <p>The time, says this excellent Author, that the two Witnesses should remain in the state we have represent them in the precedent Chapter, is limited to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62674:136"/>
three days and an half, after which they shall be revived: These three days and an half are prophetical days, as 1260 days are, and every day must be taken for a year; it's not easie to determine whether the three years and an half, after the death of the Witnesses, should commence after that the Edict of <hi>Nants</hi> was cancelled and revoked, and the Ministers of <hi>France</hi> condemned to perpetual banishment, or when the Faithful of the Valleys of <hi>Piemont,</hi> who from the time of the Apostles have maintained and concerted the truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, were driven out of their Country, after which the Author gives his sentiment in these words, It's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that these three years and an half should commence when the Churches of <hi>Piemont</hi> were destroyed, which were the visible conservers of the Truth, that was always preached and professed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; and after three years and an half were most gloriously re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were not totally driven out of the Valleys, till about the end of <hi>October</hi> 1686. Then those that were hid in the Caverns, and Rocks, and Woods, coming out of their safe and hidden retreats, after that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62674:136"/>
of <hi>France</hi> was retreated, and that the Troops of <hi>Mondovy,</hi> and other places of <hi>Piemont</hi> were returned into their own Country, seized upon some advantagious Posts in the Valleys of <hi>Lucerne</hi> and St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions upon their Enemies, and forced them to furnish them with Provisions, and all things necessary; and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies not being able to chace them out of those advantagious Posts, granted them Letters of safe conduct to go into <hi>Switzerland.</hi> Before the banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these, we cannot say that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were killed and dead, for that they made their Enemies pay contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now they were established by order of their Prince in the beginning of <hi>Iune</hi> 1690. three years and an half after their total dissipation; for this was only one month after the three years and an half that were past; so the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy speaks not of their re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till this time be compleated; and that which is to be considered more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly is, that in the month of <hi>May</hi> the <hi>Vaudois</hi> began to revive, the spirit of God then entring into them; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this month received succours from the Allies, as well of Men as Mony,

instead of their Enemies chasing them, they chaced their Enemies out of their strong holds; and so we see in them the Prophecy fulfilled of the <hi>11th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> in the time set down by the Penman of that Holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Book.</p>
               <p>The Churches of <hi>Piemont,</hi> being the root of the Protestant Churches, they have been the first established; the Churches of <hi>France, Hungary</hi> and other places, being but the branches, shall be established in due time. God will not stay to do his own work to the shame and confusion of his Enemies; the thing will come to pass in the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the Protestant Churches, that hath been done in the re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches of <hi>Israel,</hi> those of <hi>Judah</hi> returned first out of Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though they were the last that were transported; but God did not stay long to deliver the rest, though at different times and on different occasions: The same thing without doubt will come to pass in respect of the Christian Churches that groan under the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Antichrist. God will deliver them speedily, he has already delivered the Mother, and he will not long leave the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:62674:137"/>
Daughter behind, he will finish what he has gloriously begun, and not leave his work imperfect, he will gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the dispersed Churches, and bring back to the Fold the Sheep that have gone astray; then <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> shall dwell together in peace, none shall be able to give them the least disturbance.</p>
               <p>Since the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the Valleys, by order of their Prince, they have chaced the <hi>French</hi> out of them, have beaten the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Feuquiers,</hi> and slain 1500 men of his Army, among whom were two Colonels, forty Captains, and a great number of subalterne Officers.</p>
               <p>They have sometimes defeated two hundred, sometimes one hundred &amp; fifty Dragoons of the King of <hi>France,</hi> taken several Conveys that were going to the Army commanded by Monsieur <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi> have made many excursions into the <hi>Delphinate,</hi> and have carried away a good booty and several Prisoners; one may say without any hyperbole, that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in one Campaign have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged the <hi>French</hi> more than all the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies with their great Armies: The great services that they have done the Duke
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:62674:138"/>
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> without doubt will oblige him to augment their priviledges, and all the Allied Princes to make a firm and lasting treaty between the Duke and the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> in case that peace be made between <hi>France</hi> and the Allies, of which the Protestant Princes will be guarantee. I have only extended the History of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> till the beginning of <hi>October</hi> 1690. If they perform any considerable action hereafter, I will continue their History if God give me life and health; to whom be all honour and glory, world without end, Amen.</p>
