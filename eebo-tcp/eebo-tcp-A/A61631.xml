            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is but a very little time since you met together in this place to lament the remainders of a <hi>raging pestilence,</hi> which the last year destroyed so many thousand Inhabitants of the late great and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101601:5"/>
famous City: and now <hi>God</hi> hath given us another sad occasion for our <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>humiliation,</hi> by suffering a <hi>devouring fire</hi> to break forth and consume so many of her habitations. As though the infected air had been too kind and partial, and like <hi>Saul</hi> to the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> had only destroyed <hi>the vile and refuse,</hi> and spared <hi>the greatest of the people</hi>; as though the grave had surfeited with the bodies of the dead, and were loth to go in the execution of <hi>God's</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spleasure; he hath imployed a more furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Element, which by its merciless and devouring flames might in a more lively manner represent unto us the <hi>kindling</hi> of his <hi>wrath</hi> against us. And that by a <hi>Fire,</hi> which began with that violence, and spread with that horror, and raged with that fury, and continued for so long a time with that irre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>For whatever arguments or reasons we can imagine that should compose the minds of men to a sense of their own or others calamities, or excite them to an

apprehension of the <hi>wrath of God</hi> as the cause of them, or quicken them to an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest supplication to him for mercy, they do all eminently concurr in the sad oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this days solemnity. For if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compassion would move, or fear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken, or interest engage us to any of these, it is hard to conceive there should be an instance of a more efficacious nature, than that is which we this day bewail: For who can behold the ruins of so great a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not have his bowels of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moved towards it? Who can have any sence of the anger of God discovered in it, and not have his fear awakened by it? Who can (as we ought all) look upon it as a judgment of universal influence on the whole Nation, and not think himself concerned to implo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For certainly, howsoever we may vainly flatter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our selves, these are no common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of the frowns of Heaven; nor are they meerly intended as the expressions of <hi>God's</hi> severity towards that City which hath suffered so much by them; but the stroaks which fall upon the head (though they light upon that only) are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for the punishment of the whole body.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>The nature and kind of it:</hi> We can imagine nothing more severe when we consider what it is set forth by, the most unparrallel'd Judgment we read of, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah</hi> by a fire from Heaven. Although in all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances the instance might not come up to the parallel, yet in several respects there might be so sad a desolation, that any other example but that might fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the greatness and severity of it. And we may better understand of how sad and dreadful a nature such a Judgment must be, if we consider it with relation to the <hi>suddenness and unexpectedness</hi> of it, to the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> of it, and to all that <hi>sad train of circumstances</hi> which attend and follow it.</p>

               <hi>they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that</hi> Lot <hi>went out of</hi> Sodom, <hi>it rained fire and brimstone from Heaven, and destroyed them all.</hi> They were all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed either in their pleasures or in their business, they little thought of destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being so near them as it proved to be: Thus it was with the <hi>Iews</hi> in their first and latter destruction both of their City and Country, they were as high and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the contrary, as might be to the very last; nothing could perswade them that their Temple or their City should be burnt with <hi>Fire;</hi> till they saw them fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before their eyes.

               <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, that Judgment should begin at the house of <hi>God,</hi> that they who had loved to be called by his Name, should be made examples to all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; this seemed so harsh and incredible that by no means could they entertain it. But <hi>God</hi> and wise men too thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of them than they did of themselves: they could not but see an outward shew of Religion joyned with a deep and subtil hypocrisie; there being among them an heap of pride and luxury, of fraud and injustice, of sedition and faction gilded over with a fair shew of greater zeal for <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Glory</hi>: which that impartial Historian (as one who knew them well) hath described at large: and although they could not believe that such heavy Judgments should befall them, yet others did not only <hi>believe,</hi> but <hi>tremble</hi> at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of them.</p>
            <p>Who among all the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> could have been perswaded, but the day before the <hi>Fire</hi> brake out, nay when they saw the <hi>Flames</hi> for near a day together, that ever in four days time, not a fourth part of the City should be left standing? For when were they ever more secure and inapprehensive of their danger than at this time? they had not been long returned

to their Houses, which the <hi>Plague</hi> had driven them from, and now they hoped to make some amends for the loss of their Trade before; but they returned home with the same sins they carried away with them; like new <hi>Moons,</hi> they had a new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Like Beasts of prey that had been chained up so long till they were hunger-bitten, when they once got loose they ran with that violence and greediness to their ways of gain, as though nothing could ever satisfie them. But that which betrayed them to so much security, was their late deliverance from so sweeping a Judgment as the <hi>Plague</hi> had been to the City and Suburbs of it: they could by no means think, when they had all so lately escaped the <hi>Grave,</hi> that the City it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> should be so near being buried in its own ruines; that the <hi>Fire</hi> which had missed their blood, should seize upon their houses; that there should be no other way to purge the infected air, but by the <hi>Flames</hi> of the whole City. Thus when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners have newly escaped a wreck at Sea, the fears of which have a long time
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101601:10"/>
deprived them of their wonted rest, they think they may securely lye down and sleep, till it may be another storm o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake and sink them. We see then there is neither piety nor wisdom in so much security when a great danger is over, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or for we know not but that very security it self may provoke <hi>God</hi> to send a greater. And no kind of Judgments are so dreadful and amazing, as those which come most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly upon men; for these betray the succours which reason offers, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuate mens councils, weaken their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and deprive them of that presence of mind which is necessary at such a time for their own and the publick interest. And there needs no more to let us know how severe such a Judgment must be, when it comes upon men in so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unexpected a manner; but that is not all, for the severiry of it lies further,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In the force and violence of it:</hi> and surely that was very great which consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med four Cities to nothing in so short a time, when <hi>God</hi> did <hi>pluere Gehennam de Coelo,</hi> as one expresses it, rained down <hi>Hell-fire upon</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah.

But O the sighs and tears, the frights and amazements, the miscarriages, nay the deaths of some of the weaker Sex at the terror and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of it! O the hurry and useless pains, the alarms and tumults, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual hinderances of each other that were among men at the beholding the rage and fury of it! There we might have seen Women weeping for their Children, for fear of their being trod down in the press, or lost in the crowd of people, or exposed to the violence of the flames; Husbands more solicitous for the safety of their Wives and Children, than their own; the Soldiers running to their Swords, when there was more need of Buckets; the Tradesmen loading their backs with that which had gotten posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their hearts before. Then we might have heard some complaining thus of themselves: O that I had been as carefull of laying up treasures in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as I have been upon Earth, I had
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101601:13"/>
not been under such fears of losing them as now I am! If I had served <hi>God</hi> as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as I have done the world, he would never have left me as now that is like to do. What a fool have I been which have spent all my precious time for the gaining of that which may now be lost in an hours time! If these flames be so dreadful, what are those which we reserved for them who love the world more than <hi>God!</hi> If none can come near the <hi>heat</hi> of this <hi>Fire,</hi> who can dwell with <hi>everlasting burnings!</hi> O what madness then will it be to sin any more wilfully against that <hi>God</hi> who is <hi>a consuming fire,</hi> infinitely more dreadful than this can be! Farewel then all ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful vanities: now I understand thee and my self better, O bewitching world, than to fix my happiness in thee any more. I will henceforth learn so much wisdom to lay up my treasures there where neither moths can corrupt them, not Thieves steal them, nor fire consume them. O how happy would <hi>London</hi> be, if this were the effect other flames on the minds of all her Inhabitants!

If that City were able to speak out of its ruines, what sad complaints would it make of all those impieties which have made her so miserable. If it had not been (might she say) for the pride and luxury, the ease and delicacy of some of my Inhabitants, the covetousness, the fraud, the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of others, the debaucheries of the prophane, the open factions and secret hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie of too many pretending to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sanctity, my <hi>beauty</hi> had not been thus <hi>turned into ashes,</hi> nor my glory into those ruines which make my enemies rejoyce, my friends to mourn, and all stand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the beholding of them. Look now upon me, you who so lately admired the greatness of my Trade, the riches of my Merchants, the number of my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the conveniency of my Churches, the multitude of my Streets, and see what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations sin hath made in the earth. Look upon me, and then tell me whether it be nothing to dally with Heaven, to make a mock at sin, to slight the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>God,</hi> and abuse his mercies, and after all the attempts of Heaven to reclaim

a people from their sins, to remain still the same that ever they were? Was there no way to expiate your guilt but by my misery? Had the <hi>Leprosie</hi> of your sins so fretted in my Walls, that there was no cleansing them, but by the flames which consume them? Must I mourn in <hi>my dust and ashes</hi> for your iniquities, while you are so ready to return to the practice of them? Have I suffered so much by reason of <hi>them,</hi> and do you think to escape your selves? Can you then look upon my ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines with hearts as hard and unconcerned as the <hi>stones</hi> which lye in them? If you have any kindness for me, or for your selves; if you ever hope to see my brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches repaired, my beauty restored, my glory advanced, look on <hi>Londons</hi> ruines and <hi>repent.</hi> Thus would she bid her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants not weep for her miseries, but for their own sins; for if <hi>never any sorrow was like to her sorrow,</hi> it is because never any sins were like to their sins. Not as though they were only the sins of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which have brought this evil upon her, no, but as far as the judgment reaches, so great hath the compass of the sins been, which have provoked <hi>God</hi> to make her an example of his justice.

When all this would not do, those whom they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101601:15"/>
trusted most to, betrayed them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled against them, by whose means, not only <hi>the Cities were burnt with Fire,</hi> but the whole <hi>Island</hi> was turned almost into <hi>one continued flame.</hi> The issue of all which at last was, that their <hi>Country</hi> was turned to a desolation, the ancient <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants</hi> driven out, or destroyed, and their former servants, but now their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemies, <hi>possessing</hi> their <hi>habitations.</hi> May <hi>God</hi> avert the <hi>Omen</hi> from us at this day. We have smarted by <hi>Civil wars,</hi> and the dreadful <hi>effects</hi> of them; we yet complain of <hi>great discontents</hi> and <hi>poverty</hi> as great as them, we have <hi>inveterate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> combined abroad against us, we have very lately suffered under a <hi>Pestilence</hi> as great almost as any we read of, and now the <hi>great City</hi> of our <hi>Nation burnt down by a dreadful Fire.</hi> And what do all these things mean? and what will the issue of them be? though that be lockt up in the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet we have just cause to fear, if it be not our speedy amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it may be our ruine. And they who think that incredible, let them tell me whether two years since, they did not think it altogether as improbable, that in the compass of the two succeeding years, above <hi>a hundred thousand persons</hi> should be destroyed by the <hi>Plague</hi> in <hi>London</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101601:16"/>
other places, and the City it self should be burnt to the <hi>Ground</hi>? And if our <hi>fears</hi> do not, I am sure our <hi>sins</hi> may tell us, that these are but the fore-runners of greater calamities, in case there be not a timely reformation of our selves. And although <hi>God</hi> may give us some intermissions of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, yet at last he may, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Consul</hi> expressed it, pay us <hi>intercalatoe poenoe usuram,</hi> that which may make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for all his abatements, and give us full measure according to that of our sins, <hi>pressed down, shaken together, and running over.</hi> Which leads to the third particular.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Causes moving God to so much se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity in his Iudgements,</hi> which are the greatness of the <hi>sins</hi> committed against him. So this <hi>Prophet</hi> tells us, that the true account of all <hi>Gods</hi> punishments is to be fetched from the <hi>sins</hi> of the <hi>people,</hi> Amos 1.3. <hi>For three transgressions of</hi> Damascus, <hi>and for four I will not turn away the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof:</hi> so it is said of <hi>Gaza, v.</hi> 6. of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> v. 9. of <hi>Edom, v.</hi> 11. of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, v.</hi> 13. <hi>Moab,</hi> ch. 2. 1. <hi>Iudah, v.</hi> 4. and at last <hi>Israel, v.</hi> 6. And it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of every one of these, that when <hi>God</hi> threatens to punish them for the <hi>greatness</hi> of their <hi>iniquities,</hi> and the <hi>multitude</hi> of their <hi>transgression,</hi> (which is generally supposed to be meant by the <hi>three trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101601:16"/>
and the four</hi>) he doth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly threaten to send a <hi>fire</hi> among them to consume the Houses and the Palaces of their Cities. So to <hi>Damascus,</hi> chap. 1.4. to <hi>Gaza,</hi> v. 7. to <hi>Tyrus,</hi> v. 10. to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> v. 12. to <hi>Ammon,</hi> v. 14. to <hi>Moab,</hi> ch. 2. v. 2. to <hi>Iudah,</hi> v. 5. <hi>I will send a fire upon</hi> Judah, <hi>and it shall devour the Palaces of</hi> Jerusalem: and <hi>Israel</hi> in the words of the text. This is a Judgment then, which when it comes in its <hi>fury,</hi> gives us notice to how great a height our sins are risen: especially when it hath so many dreadful forerunners, as it had in <hi>Israel,</hi> and hath had among our selves. When the <hi>red horse</hi> hath marched furiously before it all <hi>bloody</hi> with the <hi>effects</hi> of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> and the <hi>pale horse</hi> hath followed after the other with <hi>Death</hi> upon his back, and the <hi>Grave</hi> at his heels, and after both these, those come, <hi>out of whose mouth issues fire, and smoak, and brimstone,</hi> it is then time for the inhabitants of the earth, <hi>to repent of the work of their hands.</hi> But it is our great unhappiness, that we are apt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute these great calamities to any thing rather than to our <hi>sins;</hi> and thereby we hinder our selves from the true remedy, because we will not understand the cause of our distemper. Though <hi>God</hi> hath not sent <hi>Prophets</hi> among us, to tell us for such
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101601:17"/>
and such sins, I will send such and such judgments upon you, yet where we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the parallel between the <hi>sins</hi> and the <hi>punishments</hi> agreeable with what we find recorded in <hi>Scripture,</hi> we have reason to say, that those sins were not only the <hi>antecedents,</hi> but the <hi>causes</hi> of those punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which followed after them. And that because the reason of punishment was not built upon any particular relation between <hi>God</hi> and the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> but upon reasons common to all mankind: yet with this difference, that the greater the mercies were which any people enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the sooner was the measure of their iniquities filled up, and the severer were the judgements when they came upon them. This our <hi>Prophet</hi> gives an account of, Chap. 3.2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Nations of the earth, therefore will I punish you for your iniquities.</hi> So did <hi>God</hi> punish <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Damascus,</hi> as well as <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah;</hi> but his meaning is, he would punish them sooner, he would punish them more severely. I wish we could be brought once to consider what influence <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> hath upon the good of a Nation, if we did, we should not only live better our selves, but our <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> might flourish more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101601:17"/>
than otherwise we are like to see it do. Which is a truth hath been so universally received among the wise Men of all ages, that one of the <hi>Roman Historians,</hi> though of no very severe life himself, yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes the decay of the <hi>Roman State,</hi> not to Chance or Fortune, or some unhidden causes (which the <hi>Atheism</hi> of our Age would presently do) but to the general looseness of mens lives, and corruption of their manners. And it was the grave Observation of one of the bravest <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Scipio apud Aug de Civ. D. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 33.</note> 
               <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> ever the <hi>Roman State</hi> had, <hi>that it was impossible for any State to be happy, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus moenibus, ruentibus moribus, though their walls were firm, if their manners were decayed.</hi> But it is our misery, that our walls and our manners are fallen together, or rather the latter undermined the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. They are our <hi>sins</hi> which have drawn so much of our blood, and infected our air, and added the greatest fuel to our flames.</p>
            <p>But it is not enough in general to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim against our <hi>sins,</hi> but we must search out particularly those predominant vices, which by their <hi>boldness</hi> and <hi>frequency</hi> have provoked <hi>God</hi> thus to punish us; and as we have hitherto observed a parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Iudgments</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> in this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101601:18"/>
Chapter, and our <hi>own</hi>: So I am afraid we shall find too sad a parallel between <hi>their sins</hi> and <hi>ours</hi> too. Three sorts of <hi>sins</hi> are here spoken of in a peculiar manner, as the causes of their severe punishments: Their <hi>luxury and intemperance,</hi> their <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness and oppression,</hi> and <hi>their contempt of God and his Laws,</hi> and I doubt we need not make a very exact <hi>scrutiny</hi> to find out these in a high degree among our selves: and I wish it were as easie to reform them, as to find them out.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Luxury and intemperance</hi>; that we meet with in the first verse, both in the compellation, <hi>Ye Kine of</hi> Bashan, and in their behaviour, <hi>which say to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, bring and let us drink. Ye Kine of</hi> Bashan, <hi>Loquitur ad Principes</hi> Israel <hi>&amp; Optimates quosque decem Tribuum,</hi> saith St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> he speaks to the <hi>Princes of</hi> Israel, <hi>and the chief of all the ten Tribes;</hi> Those which are sed in the richest pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, such as those of <hi>Bashan</hi> were. Who are more fully described by the <hi>Prophet</hi> in this sixth chapter. They are the men <hi>who are at ease in Sion,</hi> v. 1. <hi>they put far away from them the evil day,</hi> v. 3. <hi>they lye upon beds of Ivory, and stretch themselves upon their Couches, and eat the Lambs out of the stock, and the Calves out of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101601:18"/>
midst of the stall,</hi> v. 4. <hi>they chaunt to the sound of the Viol, and invent to themselves instruments of Musick like</hi> David, v. 5. <hi>they drink Wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief oyntments, but they are not grieved for the affliction of</hi> Joseph. The meaning of all which is, they minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ease, softness, and pleasure, but could not endure to hear of the calamities which were so near them. Nothing but mirth, and jollity, and riot, and feasting, and evil consequences of these were to be seen or heard among them. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate souls were presently rufled and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed at the discourse of any thing but matters of courtship, address and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. Any thing that was grave and serious, though never so necessary, and of the greatest importance, was put off, as <hi>Felix</hi> put off St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to a more convenient time: especially if it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned miseries to them, and appeared with a countenance sadder than their own. These were the <hi>Kine of Bashan,</hi> who were full of ease and wantonness, and never thought of the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>slaughter,</hi> which the other were the certain fore-runner of. <hi>Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> renders it, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101601:19"/>
sense without a <hi>Soloecism. Bring and let us drink,</hi> which as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> goes on, <hi>Ebrietatem significat in vino &amp; luxuria quoe statum mentis evertunt, it implies the height of their luxury and intemperance.</hi> It is observed by some, that our <hi>Prophet</hi> retains still the language of his education in the bluntness of his expressions, <hi>the great men</hi> that lived <hi>wholly</hi> at their <hi>ease,</hi> in wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and luxury, he styles like <hi>the heards<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of</hi> Tekoa, <hi>the Kine of</hi> Bashan. That he thought was title good enough for such who seemed to have <hi>souls</hi> for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, than the other had. And hath not that <hi>delicata insania,</hi> as St <hi>Austin</hi> calls it, that soft and effeminate kind of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness taken possession of too many among us, whose birth and education designed them for more manly imployments? Yea, what an age of <hi>Luxury</hi> do we live in, when instead of those noble characters of men from their vertue, and wisdom, and courage, it is looked on among some as a mighty character of a person, that <hi>he eats and drinks well:</hi> a <hi>character</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes none so much as the <hi>Kine</hi> of <hi>Bashan</hi> in the literal sense, for surely they did so, or else they had never been in so great esteem among the <hi>heardsmen</hi> of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koa.</hi> A <hi>character</hi> which those <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher;</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:101601:19"/>
would have been ashamed of, who looked upon no other end of humane life but <hi>pleasure;</hi> But in order to that, they thought nothing more necessary than <hi>temperance</hi> and <hi>sobriety</hi>; but whatever esteem they had then, they have lost all their reputation among our modern <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures,</hi> who know of no such things as <hi>pleasures</hi> of <hi>the mind,</hi> and would not much value whether they had any <hi>faculties</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi> or no, unless it were for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of new Oaths and Debaucheries. But if this were only among some few persons, we hope the whole Nation would not suffer for their madness: for scarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Age hath been so happy, but it hath had some <hi>Monsters</hi> in <hi>Morality</hi> as well as <hi>Nature.</hi> But I am afraid these vices are grown too <hi>Epidemical;</hi> not only in the <hi>City,</hi> but the <hi>Countries</hi> too; what mean else those frequent complaints (and I hope more general than the causes of them) that the houses of <hi>great men</hi> in too many places are so near being <hi>publick schools</hi> of <hi>debauchery,</hi> rather than of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> where men shall not want instructers to teach them to <hi>forget</hi> both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi> wherein <hi>sobriety</hi> is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted a matter of <hi>honour,</hi> that the rules of the <hi>Persian</hi> civility are quite
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101601:20"/>
forgotten, and <hi>men</hi> are <hi>forced</hi> to <hi>unman</hi> themselves. I know nothing would tend more to the honour of our Nation, or the advantage of it, than if once these publick excesses were severely restrained, I do not mean so much by making new <hi>Laws,</hi> (for those generally do but exercise peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Wits by finding out new evasions) but by excecuting old ones.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Covetousness and oppression.</hi> You see what these great men in <hi>Samaria</hi> did when they had any respite from their excesses and intemperance, then woe be to the poor who come in their way; <hi>Which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the poor, and crush the needy</hi>: v. 1. either by the hands of violence, or by those arts and devices which either their honesty or poverty have kept them from the knowledge of. And if there be not so much of open violence in our daies, the thanks are due to the care of our <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi> and the severity of our <hi>Laws,</hi> but it is hard to say whether ever any Age produced more studious and skilful to pervert the design of <hi>Laws,</hi> without breaking the letter of them, than this of ours hath done.

It is not many years since <hi>God</hi> blessed us with great and undeserved blessings, which we then thought our selves very thankful for; but if we had been really so, we should never have provoked him who bestowed those favours upon us in so great a degree as we have done since.

us: and I pray <hi>God</hi> this may be the last <hi>Act</hi> of it. Let us not then provoke <hi>God</hi> to find out new methods of vengeance, and make experiments upon us of what other unheard of severities may do for our cure.

            <p>WHEN <hi>God</hi> by his infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had contrived, and by a Power and Goodness, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite as his Wisdom, had perfected the the creation of the visible world, there seemed to be nothing wanting to the glory of it, but a creature endued with reason and understanding, which might comprehend the design of his wisdom, enjoy the benefits of his goodness, and employ it self in the celebration of his power. The Beings purely intellectual
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101601:28"/>
were too highly raised by their own order and creation, to be the <hi>Lords</hi> of this inferiour world: and those whose natures could reach no higher than the objects of sense, were not capable of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the glorious perfections of the great Creator: and therefore could not be the fit <hi>Instruments</hi> of his praise and service. But a conjunction of both these together was thought necessary to make up such a sort of Being, which might at once command this lower world, and be the servants of him who made it. Not as though this great fabrick of the world were merely raised for man to to please his fancy in the contemplation of it, or to exercise his dominion over the creatures designed for his use and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: but that by frequent reflections on the Author of his being, and the effects of his power and goodness he might be brought to the greatest love and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him. So that the most natural part of <hi>Religion</hi> lies in the grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements we owe to that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and supream Being, who hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so particular a kindness to man in the Creation and Government of the world. Which was so great and unexpressible, that some have thought, it was not so
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101601:29"/>
much pride and affectation of a greater height, as envy at the felicity and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of mankind, which was the occasion of the fall of the <hi>Apostate spirits.</hi> But whether or no the state of man were occasion enough for the envy of the <hi>Spirits</hi> above; we are sure the kindness of Heaven was so great in it, as could not but lay an indispensable obligation on all mankind to perpetual gratitude and obedience. For it is as easie to suppose, that affronts and injuries are the most sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table returns for the most obliging fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that the first duty of a <hi>Child</hi> should be to destroy his Parents; that to be thankful for kindnesses received, were to commit the unpardonable sin; as that man should receive his being and all the the blessings which attend it from <hi>God,</hi> and not be bound to the most universal obedience to him.</p>
            <p>And as the reflection on the Author of his being, leads him to the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his duty towards <hi>God,</hi> so the consideration of the design of it, will more easily acquaint him with the nature of that duty which is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from him. Had man been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed only to act a short part here in the world, all that had been required of him,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101601:29"/>
had been only to express his thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to <hi>God</hi> for his being, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of it: the using all means for the due preservation of himself; the doing nothing beneath the dignity of humane nature, nothing injurious to those who were of the same nature with himself; but since he is designed for greater and nobler ends, and his present state, is but a state of tryal, in order to future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and misery; the reason of good and evil is not to be taken merely from his present, but from the respect, which things have to that eternal state he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for. From whence it follows, that the differences of good and evil are rooted in the nature of our beings, and are the necessary consequents of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>God,</hi> and each other, and our expectations of a future life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to these measures, the estimation of men in the world hath been while they did preserve any veneration for <hi>God</hi> or <hi>themselves.</hi> Wisdom and folly was not measured so much by the subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and and curiosity of mens speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the fineness of their thoughts, or the depth of their designs, as by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to hold up the dignity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; by their piety and devotion towards
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101601:30"/>
               <hi>God</hi>; by their sobriety and due Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their actions; by the equality and justice, the charity and kindness of their dealings to one another. Wisdom was but another name for goodness, and folly for sin; then it was a mans glory to be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and to be prophane and vitious, was to be base and mean: then there were no <hi>Gods</hi> worshipped because they were bad, nor any men disgraced because they were good. Then there were no <hi>Temples</hi> ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the meanest passions of humane nature, nor men became <hi>Idolaters</hi> to their own infirmities. Then to be betrayed into sin, was accounted weakness; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive it, dishonour and baseness; to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and defend it, infamy and reproach; to make a mock at it, a mark of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est folly and incorrigibleness. So the Wise man in the words of the Text assures us, that they are <hi>Fools,</hi> and those of the highest rank and degree of folly, <hi>who make a mock at sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well for us in the Age we live in, that we have the judgment of former ages to appeal to, and of those persons in them whose reputation for wisdom is yet unquestionable. For otherwise we might be born down by that spightful enemy to all vertue and goodness, the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101601:30"/>
of such, who it is hard to say, whether they shew it more in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sin, or in defending it. Men whose manners are so bad, that scarce any thing can be imagined worse, unless it be the wit they use to excuse them with. Such who take the measure of mans perfections downwards, and the nearer they approach to beasts, the more they think themselves to act like men. No wonder then, if among such as these the differences of good and evil be laughed at, and no sin be thought so unpardonable, as the think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is any at all. Nay, the utmost they will allow in the description of Sin, is, that it is a thing that some live by declaiming against, and others cannot live without the practice of.</p>
            <p>But is the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Scorners</hi> at last pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the only chair of Infallibility? Must those be the standard of mankind, who seem to have little left of humane nature, but laughter and the shape of men? Do they think that we are all become such fools to take scoffs for arguments, and raillery for demonstrations? He knows nothing at all of goodness, that knows not that it is much more easie to laugh at it, than to practise it; and it were worth the while <hi>to make a mock at sin,</hi> if the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so would make nothing of it. But the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101601:31"/>
nature of things does not vary with the humours of men; sin becomes not at all the less dangerous because men have so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wit to think it so; nor <hi>Religion</hi> the less excellent and adantagious to the world, because the greatest enemies of that are so much to themselves too, that they have learnt to despise it. But although that scorns to be defended by such wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons whereby her enemies assault her, (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more unbecoming the <hi>Majesty</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> than to make it self cheap, by making others laugh) yet if they can but obtain so much of themselves to attend with patience to what is serious, there may be yet a possibility of perswading them, that no <hi>fools</hi> are so great as those who laugh themselves into misery, and none so certainly do so, as those <hi>who make a mock at sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if our authority be too mean and contemptible to be relied on, in a matter wherein they think us so much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and so I hope we are to prevent the ruine of mens souls) we dare with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence appeal to the general sense of mankind in the matter of our present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Let them name but any one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in all the monuments of former ages, to whom but the bare suspicion of Vice was not a diminution to an esteem that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101601:31"/>
might otherwise have been great in the world. And if the bare suspicion would do so much among even the more rude and barbarous Nations, what would open and professed wickedness do among the more knowing and civil? Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture retains an abhorrency of sin, so far that it is impossible for men to have the same esteem of those who are given over to all manner of wickedness, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise of great sharpness of wit, and of such whose natural abilities may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the other, but yet do govern their actions according to the strict rules of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> And the general sense of mankind cannot be by any thing better known, than by an universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of men, as to the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s whereby they express their value and esteem of others. What they all agree on as the best character of a person worthy to be loved and honoured, we may well think is the most agreeable to humane nature; and what is universally thought a dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the highest accomplishments, ought to be looked on as the disgrace and imperfection of it. Did ever any yet, though never so wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane themselves, seriously commend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person for his rudeness and debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries? Was any mans lust or intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101601:32"/>
ever reckoned among the Titles of his honour? Who ever yet raised <hi>Trophies</hi> to his vices, or thought to perpetuate his memory by the glory of them? Where was it ever known, that sobriety and temperance, justice and charity were thought the marks of reproach and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? Who ever suffered in their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by being thought to be really good? Nay, it is so far from it, that the most wicked persons do inwardly esteem them whether they will or no. By which we see, that even in this lapsed and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition of mankind, it is only goodness which gains true honour and esteem, and nothing doth so effectually blast a growing reputation, as wickedness and vice.</p>
            <p>But if it be thus with the generality of men, who were never yet thought to have too much partiality towards good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we may much more easily find it among those, who have had a better ground for the reputation of their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than the meer vogue of the people. He who was pronounced by the <hi>Heathen Oracle,</hi> to be the wisest among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was the person who brought down Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy from the obscure and uncertain speculations of Nature, and in all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses recommended Vertue as the truest
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101601:32"/>
Wisdom. And he among the <hi>Iews,</hi> whose <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Kin. 4.29, 30, 31.</note> 
               <hi>soul was as large as the sand on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore, whose wisdom out-went that of all the persons of his own or future Ages,</hi> writes a Book on purpose to perswade men, that there is no real wisdom, but to fear God and keep his Commandments: that sin is the greatest folly, and the meaner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions men have of it, the more they are infatuated by the temptations to it. But as there are degrees of sinning, so there are of folly in it. Some sin with a blushing Countenance, and a trembling Conscience; they sin, but yet they are afraid to sin, but in the act of it they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themselves for what they do; they sin, but with confusion in their faces, with horror in their minds, and an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in their Consciences: though the condition of such persons be dangerous, and their unquietness shews the greatness of their folly, yet because these twitches of Conscience argue there are some quick touches left of the sence of good and evil, their case is not desperate, nor their condition incurable: But there are others who despise these as the reproach of the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Wickedness,</hi> because they are not yet attained to those heights of impiety which they glory in: such who
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101601:33"/>
have subdued their Consciences much easier than others do their sins; who have almost worn out all the impressions of the <hi>work of the Law written in their hearts</hi>; who not only make a practice, but a boast of sin, and defend it with as much greediness as they commit it: these are the men, whose folly is manifest to all men but themselves; and surely, since these are the men, whom <hi>Solomon</hi> in the words of the <hi>Text</hi> describes,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) By their character, as <hi>Fools,</hi> and,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) By the instance of their folly, <hi>in making a mock at sin;</hi> We may have not only the liberty to use, but (1.) To prove, that Name of reproach to be due unto them; and (2.) To shew the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of fastning it upon them, because they <hi>make a mock at sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I come more closely to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue that, it will be necessary to consider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother sence of these words caused by the ambiguity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verb, which sometimes signifies to deride and scorn, sometimes to plead for, and excuse a thing with all the arts of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> (thence the word for <hi>Rhetorick</hi> is derived from the Verb here used) according to which sense, it notes all the plausible
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101601:33"/>
pretences and subtle extenuations which wicked men use in defence of their evil actions. For as if men intended to make some recompence for the folly they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray in the acts of sin, by the wit they employ in the pleading for them, there is nothing they shew more industry and care in, than in endeavouring to baffle their own Consciences, and please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their folly, till death and eternal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lames awaken them. That we may not therefore seem to beg all wicked men for <hi>Fools,</hi> till we have heard what they have to say for themselves, we shall first examine the reasonableness of their fairest Pleas for their evil actions, before we make good the particular impeachment of <hi>folly</hi> against them. There are three ways especially whereby they seek to jus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifie themselves; by laying the blame of all their evil actions, either upon the fatal necessity of all events, the unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able frailty of humane nature, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of keeping the Laws of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: But that none of these will serve to excuse them from the just imputation of <hi>folly,</hi> is our present business to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The fatal necessity of all humane actions.</hi> Those who upon any other terms are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101601:34"/>
willing enough to own either <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> yet if they can but make these serve their turn to justifie their sins by, their quarrel against them then ceaseth, as being much more willing that <hi>God</hi> should bear the blame of their sins, than themselves. But yet the very fears of a <hi>Deity</hi> suggest so many dreadful thoughts of his <hi>Majesty, Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> that they are very well contented to have him wholly left out: and then to suppose Man to be a meer Engine, that is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily moved by such a train and series of causes, that there is no action how bad soever that is done by him, which it was any more possible for him not to have done, than for the fire not to burn when it pleases. If this be true, farewel all the differences of good and evil in mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; farewel all expectations of future rewards and punishments; <hi>Religion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes but a meer name, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness but an art to live by. But it is with this, as it is with the other arguments they use against <hi>Religion</hi>; there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within, which checks and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolls them in what they say: and that inward remorse of Conscience, which such men sometimes feel in their evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (when conscience is forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101601:34"/>
by the foulness of them) doth effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally confute their own <hi>hypothesis;</hi> and makes them not believe those actions to be necessary, for which they suffer so much in themselves because they knew they did them freely. Or it is as fatal for man to believe himself free when he is not so, as it is for him to act when his choice is determined? but what <hi>series</hi> of causes is there that doth so necessarily impose upon the common sense of all mankind; It seems very strange, that man should have so little sense of his own interest to be still necessitated to the worst of actions, and yet torment himself with the thoughts that he did them freely. Or is it only the <hi>freedom of action,</hi> and not of <hi>choice,</hi> that men have an experience of within themselves? But surely, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men may subtilly dispute of the difference between these two, no man would ever believe himself to be free in what he does, unless he first thought himself to be so, in what he determines? And if we suppose man to have as great a <hi>freedom of choice</hi> in all his evil actions (which is the liberty we are now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of) as any persons assert or contend for, we cannot suppose that he should have a greater experience of it, than now he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101601:35"/>
hath. So that either it is impossible for man to know when his choice is free; or if it may be known, the constant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all evil men in the world will testifie, that it is so now. Is it possible for the most intemperate person to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, when the most pleasing temptations to lust or gluttony are presented to him, that no consideration whatever could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain his appetite, or keep him from the satisfaction of his brutish inclinations? Will not the sudden, though groundless apprehension of poyson in the Cup, make the Drunkards heart to ake, and hand to tremble, and to let fall the supposed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal mixture in the midst of all his jollity and excess? How often have persons who have designed the greatest mischief to the lives and fortunes of others, when all opportunities have fallen out beyond their expectation for accomplishing their ends, through some sudden thoughts which have surprized them, almost in the very act, been diverted from their intended purposes? Did ever any yet imagine that the charms of beauty and allurements of lust were so irresistible, that if men knew before-hand they should surely dye in the embraces of an adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bed, they could not yet withstand
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101601:35"/>
the temptations to it? If then some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, which are quite of another nature from all the objects which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him, may quite hinder the force and efficacy of them upon the mind of man (as we see in <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s resisting the importunate Caresses of his Mistress) what reason can there be to imagine that man is a meer <hi>machine</hi> moved only as outward objects determine him? And if the considerations of present fear and danger may divert men from the practice of evil actions, shall not the far more weighty considerations of eternity have at least an equal, if not a far greater power and efficacy upon mens minds, to keep them from everlasting misery? Is an immortal soul and the eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it so mean a thing in our esteem and value, that we will not deny our selves those sensual pleasures for the sake of that which we would renounce for some present danger? Are the flames of another world such painted fires, that they deserve only to be laughed at, and not seriously considered by us? Fond man! art thou only free to ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy thy self? a strange fatality indeed, when nothing but what is mean and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial shall determine thy choice! when
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101601:36"/>
matters of the highest moment are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore less regarded, because they are such. Hast thou no other plea for thy self, but that thy sins were fatal? thou hast no reason then to believe but that thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery shall be so too. But if thou ownest a <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> assure thy self that justice and righteousness are not meer <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi> of <hi>his Honour,</hi> but the real proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his nature. And he who hath appointed the rewards and punishments of the great day, will then call the sinner to account, not only for all his other sins, but for offering to lay the imputation of them upon himself. For if the greater abhorrency of mens evil ways, the rigour of his laws, the severity of his judgments, the exactness of his justice, the greatest care used to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim men from their sins, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est assurance, that he is not the cause of their ruine, may be any vindication of the holiness of <hi>God</hi> now, and his justice in the life to come; we have the greatest reason to lay the blame of all our evil actions upon our selves, as to attribute the glory of all our good unto himself alone.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The frailty of humane Nature</hi>: those who find themselves to be free enough
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101601:36"/>
to do their souls mischief, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue still in the doing of it, find nothing more ready to plead for themselves, than the unhappiness of mans composition, and the degenerate state of the world. If <hi>God</hi> had designed (they are ready to say) that man should lead a life free from sin, why did he confine the soul of man to a body so apt to taint and pollute it? But who art thou O man, that thus find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est fault with thy Maker? Was not his kindness the greater, in not only giving thee a soul capable of enjoying himself, but such an habitation for it here, which by the curiosity of its contrivance, the number and usefulness of its parts, might be a perpetual and domestick testimony of the wisdom of its <hi>Maker?</hi> Was not such a conjunction of soul and body ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the exercise of that dominion wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch <hi>God</hi> designed man for, over the creatures endued only with sense and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And if we suppose this life to be a state of tryal in order to a better, (as in all reason we ought to do) what can be imagined more proper to such a state, than to have the soul constantly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Government of those sensual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations which arise from the body? In the doing of which, the proper exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101601:37"/>
of that vertue consists, which is made the condition of future happiness. Had it not been for such a composition, the differenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> could never have been seen between good and bad men; <hi>i. e.</hi> between those who maintain the Empire of reason, assisted by the motives of <hi>Religion,</hi> over all the inferiour faculties, and such who dethrone their souls and make them slaves to every lust that will command them. And if men willingly subject themselves to that which they were born to rule, they have none to blame but themselves for it. Neither is it any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse at all, that this, through the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy of mankind, is grown the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon custom of the world; unless that be in it self so great a Tyrant, that there is no resisting the power of it. If <hi>God</hi> had commanded us to comply with all the customs of the world, and at the same time to be <hi>sober, righteous,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> we must have lived in another age than we live in, to have excused these two commands from a palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.

               </gap>e are very few among us but will say they do all these things already, and therefore surely they do not think them impossible. The like answer I might give to all the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the <hi>Gospel</hi> till we come to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ungodliness and worldly lusts,</hi> and as to these too, if we charge men with them, they either deny their committing them, and then say they have kept the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: or if they confess it, they promise amendment for the future; but in neither respect can they be said to think the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand impossible. Thus we see their own mouths will condemn them when they charge <hi>God</hi> with laying impossible <hi>Laws</hi> on mankind. But if we enquire further than into the judgments of those (who it may be never concerned themselves so much about the precepts of <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> as to try whether they had any power to observe them or not); nay, if we yield them more (than, it may be, they are willing to enquire after, though they ought to do it) <hi>viz.</hi> that without the <hi>assistance of divine grace,</hi> they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               </gap>s to the practice of what he requires by the infinite discovery of his own love, the death of his Son, and the promise of his Spirit? And what then is wanting, but only setting our selves to the serious obedience of them, to make his commands not only not impossible, but easie to us? But our grand fault is, we make impossibilities our selves where we find none, and then we complain of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101601:40"/>
them: we are first resolved not to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the commands, and then nothing more easie than to find fault with them: we first pass sentence, and then examine evidences; first condemn, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the merits of the Cause. Yet surely none of these things can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted impossible, which have been done by all those who have been sincere and hearty Christians; and <hi>God</hi> forbid we should think all guilty of hypocrisie, who have professed the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> from the beginning of it to this day. Nay more than so, they have not only done them, but professed to have that joy and satisfaction of mind in the doing of them, which they would not exchange for all the pleasures and delights of the world. These were the men, who not only were patient, but rejoyced in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; who accounted it their honour and glory to endure any thing for the sake of so excellent a Religion; who were so assured of a future happiness by it, that they valued Martyrdoms above Crowns and Scepters. But God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we may hope to come to Heaven on easier terms than these, or else many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might never come thither, besides those who think to make this a pretence
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101601:41"/>
for their sin, that now when with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and honour we may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise our Religion, the commands of it are thought impossible by them. Thus we have made good the general Charge here implyed against wicked men in that they are called <hi>Fools,</hi> by examining the most plausible pretences they bring for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>I now come to the particular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of their folly, because <hi>they make a mock at sin.</hi> And that I shall prove especially by two things: 1. Because this argues <hi>the highest degree of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</hi> 2. Because it betrays the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est weakness of judgment and want of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Because it argues <hi>the highest degree of wickedness.</hi> If to sin be folly, to make a mock at it is little short of madness. It is such a height of impiety that few but those who are of very proffigate consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences can attain to, without a long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom in sinning. For Conscience is at first modest, and starts and boggles at the appearance of a great wickedness, till it be used to it and grown familiar with it. It is no such easie matter for a man to get the mastery of his conscience; a great deal of force and violence must be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101601:41"/>
used to ones self before he does it. The natural impressions of good and evil, the fears of a <hi>Deity,</hi> and the apprehensions of a future state are such curbs and checks in a sinners way, that he must first sin himself beyond all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeling of these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can attain to the <hi>seat</hi> of the <hi>scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> And we may justly wonder how any should ever come thither, when they must break through all that is ingenuous and modest, all that is vertuous and good, all that is tender and apprehensive in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, before they can arrive at it. They must first deny a <hi>God,</hi> and despise an immortal soul, they must conquer their own reason, and cancel the <hi>Law written in their hearts,</hi> they must hate all that is serious, and yet soberly believe themselves to be no better <hi>than the beasts that perish,</hi> before men can come to make a <hi>scoff at religion,</hi> and a <hi>mock at sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And who now could ever imagine that in a Nation professing <hi>Christianity,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a people whose <hi>genius</hi> enclines them to civility and religion, yea among those who have the greatest advantages of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and education, and who are to give the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>civility</hi> to the rest of the Nation, there should any be found who should deride religion, make sport with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101601:42"/>
their own profaneness, and make so light of nothing, as being damned? I come not here to accuse any, and least of all those who shew so much regard of <hi>religion</hi> as to be present in the places devoted to sacred purposes; but if there be any such here, whose consciences accuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for any degrees of so great impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I beseech them by all that is dear and precious to them, by all that is sacred and serious, by the <hi>vows</hi> of their <hi>Baptism,</hi> and their <hi>participation</hi> of the <hi>Holy Eucharist,</hi> by all the kindness of Heaven which they either enjoy or hope for, by the death and sufferings of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that they would now consider how great folly and wickedness they betray in it, and what the dreadful consequence of it will be, if they do not timely repent of it. If it were a doubt (as I hope it is not among any here) whether the matters of <hi>Religion</hi> be true or no, they are surely things which ought to be seriously thought and spoken of. It is certainly no jesting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to affront a <hi>God</hi> of infinite <hi>Maiesty</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> (and he judges every wilful sinner to do so) nor can any one in his wits think it a thing not to be regarded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be eternally happy or miserable. Methinks then among persons of civility
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101601:42"/>
and honour, above all others, <hi>Religion</hi> might at least be treated with the respect and reverence due to the concernments of it; that it be not made the sport of Entertainments, nor the common subject of <hi>Plays</hi> and <hi>Comedies.</hi> For is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to trifle with, but <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>? Is wit grown so <hi>schismatical</hi> and <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious,</hi> that it can please it self with nothing but <hi>holy ground</hi>? Are prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and wit grown such inseparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, that none shall be allowed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the one, but such as dare be highly guilty of the other? Far be it from those who have but the name of <hi>Christians,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do these things themselves, or to be pleased with them that do them: es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in such times as ours of late have been, when <hi>God</hi> hath used to many ways to make us serious if any thing would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do it. If men had only slighted <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>made a mock at sin,</hi> when they had grown wanton through the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of peace and plenty, and saw no severities of <hi>God's justice</hi> used upon such who did it; yet the fault had been so great, as might have done enough to have interrupted their peace and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>plenty,</hi> which made them out of the greatness of their pride and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now that those who <hi>make a mock at sin</hi> are guilty of all these, will appear, if we consider whom they provoke by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, whom they most injure, and upon what reasonable consideration they are moved to what they do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whom they provoke by their making a mock at sin;</hi> Supposing that there is a <hi>Governour</hi> of the world, who hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished <hi>Laws</hi> for us to be guided by, we may easily understand, whose honour and authority is reflected on, when the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of his <hi>Laws</hi> are made nothing of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For surely if they had a just esteem of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> they never durst make so bold with him, as all those do who not only commit sin themselves, but laugh at the scrupulosity of those who dare not.

greater conveniency of a cheaper garment to the other: it was a sign he stood not much in awe of the severity of their looks, nor had any dread at all of the greatness of their power. But although there be so infinite a disproportion between the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial <hi>Deities</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> of him who made and governs the whole world; yet as little reverence to his power and authority is shewed by all such who dare affront him with such a mighty confidence, and bid the greatest defiance to his <hi>Laws</hi> by scoffing at them. What is there the <hi>Soveraigns</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the earth do more justly resent, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the highest indignation against, than to have their Laws despised, their Persons affronted, and there Authority contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? And can we then imagine, that a <hi>God</hi> of infinite <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> the honour of whose <hi>Laws</hi> is as dear to him as his own is, should sit still unconcerned, when so many indignities are continually offered them, and never take any notice at all of them? It is true, his patience is not to be measured by our fretful and peevish natures, (and it is happy for us all that it is not) he knows the sinner can never escape his power, and therefore bears the longer with him: but yet his lenity is always joyned with his wisdom
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101601:45"/>
and justice, and the time is coming when patience it self shall be no more. Is it not then the highest madness and folly to provoke one whose power is infinitely greater than our own is, and from the severity of whose wrath we cannot secure our selves one minute of an hour? How knowest thou, O vain man, but that in the midst of all thy mirth and jollity, while thou art boasting of thy sins, and thinkest thou canst never fill up fast e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough the measure of thy iniquities, a sudden fit of an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> or the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an <hi>Aposteme,</hi> or any of the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable instruments of death, may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch thee hence, and consign thee into the hands of divine Justice? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall then wilt thou be able to dispute with <hi>God?</hi> Wilt thou then charge his Providence with folly, and his Laws with unreasonableness? when his <hi>greatness</hi> shall affright thee, his <hi>Maiesty</hi> astonish thee, his <hi>Power</hi> disarm thee, and his <hi>Iustice</hi> proceed against thee: when notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thy <hi>bravado's</hi> here, they own Conscience shall be not only thy accuser and witness, but thy judge and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner too: when it shall <hi>revenge</hi> it self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee for all the rapes and violences thou hast committed upon it here: when hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and confusion shall be thy portion,

and the unspeakable anguish of a racked and tormented mind shall too late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee of thy folly in <hi>making a mock</hi> at that which stings with an everlasting venom. Art thou then resolved to put all these things to the adventure, and live as securely as if the <hi>terrours</hi> of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> were but the dreams of men awake, or the fancies of weak and distempered brains? But I had rather believe that in the heat and fury of thy lusts thou wouldst seem to others to think so, than thou either doest or canst perswade thy self to such unreasonable folly. Is it not then far better to consult the tranquillity of thy mind here, and the eternal happiness of it hereafter, by a serious repentance and speedy amendment of thy life, than to expose thy self for the sake of thy sensual pleasures to the fury of that <hi>God</hi> whose justice is infinite, and power irresistible? Shall not <hi>the apprehension of his excellency make thee</hi> now <hi>afraid of him?</hi> Never then <hi>make</hi> any <hi>mock at sin</hi> more, unless thou art able <hi>to contend with the Almighty,</hi> or <hi>to dwell with everlasting burnings.</hi>

or by standing at the greatest defiance, to make him willing to come to terms of composition with them?

To see with what greediness they catch at every bait that is offered them, and when they are swallowing the most deadly <hi>poyson,</hi> what arts they use to perswade themselves that it is a healthful potion. No doubt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more gratifie them than to see

But if there were any present felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or any considerable advantage to be gained by this <hi>mocking at sin,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing Religion, there would seem to be some kind of pretence, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of true reason for it. Yet that which heightens this folly to the highest degree in the last place is, that there can be no imaginable consideration thought on which might look like a <hi>plausible temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> to it. The covetous man, when he hath defrauded his neighbour, and used all kinds of arts to compass an Estate, hath the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101601:47"/>
this. The voluptuous man hath the strong propensities of his Nature, the force of temptation which lies in the charms of beauty, to excuse his unlawful pleasures by. The ambitious man, hath the greatness of his mind, the advantage of authority, the examples of those who have been great before him, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of those who condemn him, to plead for the heights he aims at. But what is it which the persons who despises Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and laughs at every thing that is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, proposes to himself as the reason of what he does? But alas! this were to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to be much more serious than he is, if he did propound any thing to himself as the ground of his actions. But it may be a great kindness to others, though none to himself; I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any unless it may be, to make them thankful they are not arrived to that height of folly; or out of perfect good nature, lest they should take him to be wiser than he is. The <hi>Psalmists fool</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spises him as much as he does Religion: for he only <hi>saith it in his heart, there is no God</hi>; but this though he dares not think there is none, yet shews him not near so much outward respect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as the other does. Even the <hi>Atheist</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:101601:47"/>
himself thinks him a <hi>Fool,</hi> and the greatest of all other, who believes a <hi>God,</hi> and yet affronts him and trifles with him. And although the <hi>Athiests folly</hi> be unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in resisting the clearest evidence of reason, yet so far he is to be commended for what he says, that if there be such a thing as <hi>Religion,</hi> men ought to be seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in it. So that of all hands the <hi>scoffer at Religion</hi> is looked on as one forsaken of that little reason, which might serve to uphold a slender reputation of being above <hi>the beasts that perish:</hi> nay, therein his condition is worse than theirs, that as they understand not <hi>Religion,</hi> they shall never be punished for despising it: which such a person can never secure himself from, considering the <hi>power,</hi> the <hi>justice,</hi> the <hi>severity</hi> of that <hi>God,</hi> whom he hath so highly provoked. <hi>God</hi> grant that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of this danger may make us so serious in the profession and practice of our Religion, that we may not by slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, and <hi>mocking at sin,</hi> provoke him <hi>to laugh at our calamities, and mock when our fear comes</hi>; but that by beholding the sincerity of our repentance, and the heartiness of our devotion to him, he may <hi>turn his anger away from us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over us to do us good.</hi>

            <p>OF all the Circumstances of our Blessed Saviours appearance and preaching in the World, there is none which to our first view and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of things, seems more strange and unaccountable, than that those persons who were then thought of all others to be most conversant in the Law and the Prophets, should be the most obstinate opposers of him. For since he came to fulfil all the Prophesies which had gone before concerning him, and was himself the great Prophet foretold by all the rest, none might in humane probability have been judged more likely to have received
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101601:48"/>
and honoured him, than those to whom the judgment of those things did peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong; and who were as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the truth of them as any else could be. Thus indeed it might have been reasonably expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed; and doubtless it had been so, if interest and prejudice had not had a far more absolute power and dominion over them, than they had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the rest of the people. If Miracles, and Prophesies, if Reason and Religion; nay, if the interest of another World could have prevailed over the interest of this among them; the <hi>Iewish Sanhedrin</hi> might have been some of the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to Christianity, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> had been all Proselytes to Christ, and the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had been the first Christian Church. But to let us see with what a jealous eye Power and Interest looks on every thing that seems to of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds of men than true Reason and Religion; and how hard a matter it is to convince those who have no mind to be convinced; we find none more furious in their opposition to the person of Christ, none more obstinate in their infidelity as to this Doctrine,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101601:49"/>
than those who were at that time in the greatest reputation among them for their authority, wisdom, and knowledge. These are they, whom our Saviour, as often as he meets with, either checks for their ignorance, or rebukes for their pride, or denounces woes against for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and hypocrisie: These are they who instead of believing in Christ persecute him; instead of following him seek to destroy him: and that they might the better compass it, they reproach and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame him, as if he had been really as bad as themselves. And although the people might not presently believe what they said concerning him, yet that they might at least be kept in suspence by it, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to fasten the blackest calumnies upon him? and suit them with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable arts to the tempers of those they had to deal with.</p>
            <p>If any appeared zealous for the present peace and prosperity of the Nation; and for paying the duty and obedience they owed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, which then governed them: to them he is represented as a factious and seditious person, as an enemy to <hi>Caesar,</hi> as one that intended to set up a Kingdom of his own, though to the ruine of his Country: That it was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101601:49"/>
nothing but ambition and vain-glory, which made him gather Disciples, and preach to multitudes; that none could foretel what the dangerous consequences of such new Doctrines might be, if not timely suppressed, and the Author of them severely punished. Thus to the prudent and cautious, reason of State is pretended as the ground of their enmity to Christ. But to those who are impatient of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> yoke, and watched for any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to cast it off; they suggest the mighty improbabilities of ever obtaining any deliverance by a person so mean and inconsiderable as our Saviour appeared among them: and that surely God who delivered their Forefathers of old from a bondage not greater than theirs, by a mighty hand and out-stretched arm, did never intend the redemption of his people by one of obscure Parentage, mean Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and of no interest in the world. To the great men, they need no more than bid them, behold the train of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, who being generally poor, the more numerous they were, the more mouths they might see open, and ready to devour the Estates of those who were above them. The Priests and Levites they bid consider what would become of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101601:50"/>
them all, if the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, by which their interest was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held? for if the Temple fell, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for them to stand. But the grand difficulty was among the people, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be possessed with so high an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him by the greatness of his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the excellency of his Doctrine, and the innocency of his Conversation, that unless they could insinuate into their minds some effectual prejudices against these, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acles, as well as ravished by his Doctrine; when they saw him raise the dead, restore sight to the blind, cure the deaf and the lame, and cast out Devils out of possessed persons, they tell them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently that these were the common arts of Impostors, and the practice of those who go about to deceive the people; that such things were easily done by the power of Magick, and assistance of the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. If any were admirers of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical rigours and austerities (as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally were) when mens Religion was measured by the sowerness of their Countenances, the length of their Prayers, and the distance they kept from other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101601:50"/>
these they bid especially beware of our Saviours Doctrine; for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all zeal and devotion, all morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and strictness of life, under the pretence of Pharisaical hypocrisie; that he sunk all Religion into short Prayers and dull Morality; that his conversation was not among the persons of any reputation for piety, but among Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that nothing extraordinary appeared in his Life; that his actions were like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens, and his company none of the best, and his behaviour among them with too great a freedom for a person who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to so high a degree o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> holiness.</p>
            <p>Thus we see the most perfect innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy could not escape the venom of malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tongues; but the less it enter'd, the more they were enraged, and made up what wanted in the truth of their calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, by their diligence in spreading them. As though their mouths indeed had been open Sepulchres by the noysom vapours which came out of them; and we may well think no less a poyson than that of Asps could be under their lips, which so secretly and yet so mischievously convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it self into the hearts of the people. The only advantage which malice hath against the greatest Virtue, is, that the greater it is, the less it takes notice of all
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101601:51"/>
the petty arts which are used against it; and will not bring its own innocency so much into suspicion as to make any long Apologies for it self. For, to a noble and generous spirit, assaulted rather by noise and clamour, than any solid reason or force of argument, neglect and disdain are the most proper weapons of defence: for where malice is only impertinent and troublesome, a punctual answer seems next to a confession. But although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency needs no defence as to it self, yet it is necessary for all the advantages it hath of doing good to mankind, that it appear to be what it really is; which cannot be done, unless its reputation be cleared from the malicious aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are cast upon it. And from hence it was that our blessed Saviour, though he thought it not worth the while to use the same diligence in the vindication of himself, which his enemies did in the defamation of him; yet when he saw it necessary in order to the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Doctrine among the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and tractable part of his auditors, he sometimes by the quickness of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, sometimes by the suddenness and sharpness of his questions, and sometimes by the plain force of argument and reason, baffles his adversaries, so that though they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101601:51"/>
were resolved not to be convinced, they thought it best for the time to be quiet. This was to let them see how easy it was for him to throw off their reproaches as fast as their malice could invent them; and that it was as impossible for them by such weak attempts to obscure the reputation of his innocency, as for the spots which Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers descern near the body of the Sun, ever to eclipse the light of it. So that all those thinner mists which envy and detraction raised at his first appearance, and those grosser vapours which arose from their open enmity when he came to a greater height, did but add a brighter lustre to his glory, when it was seen that notwithstanding all the machinations of his enemies, his innocency brake forth like the light, which shineth more and more to the perfect day.</p>
            <p>But it pleased God, for the tryal of mens minds so to order the matters of our Religion, that as they are never so clear, but men of obstinate and perverse spirits will find something to cavil at; so they were never so dark and obscure in the most difficult circumstances of them, but men of unprejudiced and ingenuous minds might find enough to satisfie themselves about them. Which is the main scope of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101601:52"/>
our Saviour in the words of the Text, (and shall be of our present discourse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them) <hi>but wisdom is justified of all her Children.</hi> Where without any further Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, by <hi>Wisdom</hi> we understand the method which God useth in order to the salvation of mankind; by the <hi>Children of Wisdom,</hi> all those who were willing to attain the end by the means which God affordeth, and by <hi>justifying</hi> not only the bare approving it, but the declaring of that approbation to the World by a just vindication of it from the cavils and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of men. Although the words are capable of various senses, yet this is the most natural, and agreeable to the scope of what goes before. For there our Saviour speaks of the different ways wherein <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> and himself appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the <hi>Iews,</hi> in order to the same end, <hi>v.</hi> 32. For <hi>Iohn Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, he hath a Devil.</hi> A very severe Devil surely, and one of the strictest order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that was so far from being cast out by fasting and prayer, that these were his continual imployment! But what could we have sooner thought than that those persons who made the Devil the author of so much mortification and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101601:52"/>
severity of life, should presently have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained Religion in a more free and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing humour; but this would not take neither, for <hi>the Son of Man comes eating and drinking</hi>; i. e. was remarkable for none of those rigours and austerities which they condemned in <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded in the <hi>Pharisees</hi>; and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently they censure him, <hi>as a gluttonous man, and a Wine-bibber, a friend of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Sinners,</hi> v. 34. i. e. the utmost excess that any course of life was capable of they presently apply to those who had no other design in all their actions, than to recommend true piety and goodness to them. So impossible it was by any means which the wisdom of Heaven thought fit to use, to perswade them into any good opinion of the persons who brought the glad tidings of Salvation to them: and therefore our Saviour, when he sees how refractory and perverse they were, in interpreting every thing to the worse, and censuring the ways which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom thought fittest to reclaim them by, he tells them that it was nothing but malice and obstinacy which was the cause of it; but if they were men of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able spirits (who by an usual Hebraism are called the Children of Wisdom) they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101601:53"/>
would see reason enough to admire, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and justifie all the methods of divine Providence for the good of Mankind. <hi>For Wisdom is justified of all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which I mainly design to speak to from hence is, <hi>That although the wisest Contrivances of Heaven for the good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are liable to the unjust cavils and excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of unreasonable men, yet there is enough to satisfie any teachable and ingenuous Minds concerning the wisdom of them.</hi> Before I come more particularly to examine those which concern our present subject, <hi>viz.</hi> the life and appearance of our Lord and Saviour, it will take very much off from the force of them, if we consider, that thus it hath always been, and supposing humane nature to be as it is, it is scarce conceivable that it should be otherwise. Not that it is necessary or reasonable it should be so at all, any more than it is necessary that men should act foolishly or inconsiderately; but as long as we must never expect to see all men either wise or pious, either to have a true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things, or a love of Religion; so long we shall always find there will be some, who will be quarrelling with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion when they have no mind to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101601:53"/>
it. I speak not now of those who make a meer jest and scoff at Religion (of which our Age hath so many Instances) but of a sort of men who are of a degree above the other, though far enough short of any true and solid wisdom; who yet are the more to be considered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they seem to make a slender offer at reason in what they say. Some pretend they are not only unsatisfied with the particular ways of instituted Religion, any further than they are subservient to their present interest (which is the only God they worship) but to make all sure, the foundations even of Natural Religion it self cannot escape their cavils and excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They have found out an <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> for those impressions of a Deity which are in the hearts of men; and use their utmost arts to obscure, since they cannot extinguish, those lively char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of the power, wisdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, which are every where to be seen in the large volume of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Religion is no more to them but an unaccountable fear; and the very notion of a spiritual substance (even of that without which we could never know what a contradiction meant) is said to imply one. But if for quietness sake,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101601:54"/>
and it may be to content their own minds as well as the World, they are willing to admit of a Deity, (which is a mighty concession from those who have so much cause to be afraid of him) then to ease their minds of such troublesom companions as their fears are, they seek by all means to dispossess him of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, by denying his Providence, and care of humane affairs. They are contented he should be called an excellent Being, that should do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and therefore signifie nothing in the World; or rather, then he might be styled an Almighty <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> that is so fond of ease and pleasure, that the least thought of business would quite spoil his happiness. Or if the activity of their own spirits may make them think that such an excellent Being may sometimes draw the Curtains and look abroad into the World, then every advantage which another hath got above them, and every cross accident which befalls themselves (which by the power of self-flattery most men have learnt to call the Prosperity of the wicked, and the Sufferings of good men) serve them for mighty charges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the justice of Divine Providence. Thus either God shall not govern the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101601:54"/>
World at all, or if he do, it must be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such terms as they please and approve of, or else they will erect an High Court of Justice upon him, and condemn the Sovereign of the World, because he could not please his discontented Subjects. And as if he were indeed arraigned at such a bar, every weak and peevish exception shall be cryed up for evidence; when the fullest and clearest vindications of him shall be scorned and contemned. But this doth not in the least argue the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiousness of him who is so accused, but the great injustice of those who dare pass sentence; where it is neither in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to understand the reason of his actions, nor if it were, to call him in question for his proceedings with men. But so great is the pride and arrogance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, that it loves to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what it cannot comprehend; and there needs be no greater reason given concerning the many disputes in the world about Divine Providence, than that God is wise, and we are not but would fain seem to be so. While men are in the dark they will be always quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling; and those who contend the most, do it that they might seem to others to see, when they know themselves they do
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101601:55"/>
not. Nay, there is nothing so plain and evident, but the reason of some men is more apt to be imposed upon in it, than their senses are; as it appeared in him who could not otherwise confute the Philosophers argument against motion, but by moving before him. So that we see the most certain things in the world are liable to the cavils of men who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their wits to do it; and certainly those ought not to stagger mens faith in matters of the highe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t nature and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which would not at all move them in other things.</p>
            <p>But at last it is acknowledged by the men who love to be called the men of wit in this Age of ours, that there is a God and Providence, a future state, and the differences of good and evil, but the Christian Religion they will see no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason to embrace than as it is the Religion of the State they live in. But if we demand what mighty reasons they are able to bring forth against a Religion so holy and innocent in its design, so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Nature of God and Man, so well contrived for the advantages of this and another life, so fully atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to come from God by the Miracles wrought in confirmation of it, by the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101601:55"/>
death of the Son of God, and of such mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Martyrs, so certainly convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, by the unquestionable Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Ages since the first delivery of it; the utmost they can pretend against it is, that it is built upon such an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Son of God which was too mean and contemptible, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of it is inconsistent with the Civil Interests of men, and the design ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for the Reformation of the World. For the removal therefore of these cavils against our Religion, I shall shew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there were no circumstances in our Saviours appearance or course of life, which were unbecoming the Son of God, and the design he came upon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Doctrine delivered by him is so far from being contrary to the Civil Interests of the World, that it tends highly to the preservation of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the design he came upon was very agreeable to the Infinite Wisdom of God, and most effectual for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind.</p>
            <p>For clearing the first of these, I shall consider, (1.) The Manner of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours

appearance. (2.) The Course of his Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e; and what it was which his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies did most object against him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The manner of our Saviours Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; which hath been always the great offence to the admirers of the pomp and greatness of this World. For when they heard of the Son of God coming down from Heaven, and making his Progress into this lower world, they could imagin nothing less, than that an innumerable company of Angels must have been dispatched before, to have prepared a place for his reception; that all the Soveraigns and Princes of the World must have been summoned to give their attendance and pay their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to him: that their Scepters must have been immediately laid at his feet, and all the Kingdoms of the earth been united into one universal Monarchy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Empire of the Son of God: That the Heavens should bow down at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to shew their obeysance to him, the Earth tremble and shake for fear at the near approaches of his Majesty; that all the Clouds should clap together in one universal Thunder, to welcome his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and tell the Inhabitants of the World what cause they had to fear him
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101601:56"/>
whom the Powers of the Heavens obey: that the Sea should run out of its wonted course with amazement and horror; and if it were possible, hide it self in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low places of the earth: that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains should shrink in their heads, to fill up the vast places of the deep; so that all that should be fulfilled in a literal sense, which was foretold of the coming of the <hi>Messias,</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Luke 3.5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>That every Valley should be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and every Mountain and Hill brought low; the crooked made straight, and the rough ways smooth, and all flesh see the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God.</hi> Yea, that the Son for a time should be darkned, and the Moon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw her light, to let the Nations of the Earth understand that a Glory infinitely greater than theirs did now appear to the World. In a word, they could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Son of God could be born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the pangs and throws of the whole Creation; that it was as impossible for him to appear, as for the Son in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament to disappear, without the notice of the whole World. But when instead of all his pomp and grandeur he comes <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito</hi> into the World, instead of giving notice of his appearance to the Potentates of the Earth, he is only discovered to a few silly Shepherds and three Wise men
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101601:57"/>
of the East; instead of choosing either <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Hierusalem</hi> for the place of his Nativity, he is born at <hi>Bethleem,</hi> a mean and obscure Village: instead of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and magnificent Palaces of the East or West, which were at that time so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; he is brought forth in a Stable, where the Manger was his Cradle, and his Mother the only attendant about him: who was her self none of the great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Court, nor of any same in the Country; but was only rich in her Genealogy, and honourable in her Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. And according to the obscurity of his Birth was his Education too: his Youth was not spent in the Imperial Court at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor in the Schools of Philosophers at <hi>Athens,</hi> nor at the feet of the great Rabbies at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: but at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a place of mean esteem among the <hi>Iews,</hi> where he was remarkable for nothing so much as the Vertues proper to his Age, Modesty, Humility and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. All which he exercises to so high a degree, that his greatest kindred and acquaintance were mightily surprized when at 30 years of age, he began to discover himself by the Miracles which he wrought, and the Authority which he spake with. And although the rayes of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101601:57"/>
his Divinity began to break forth through the Clouds he had hitherto disguised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in, yet he persisted still in the same course of humility and self-denial: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care of others to the neg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; feeding others by a Miracle, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting himself, to one: shewing his power in working miraculous Cures, and his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in concealing them: Conversing with the meanest of the people, and choosing such for his Apostles, who brought nothing to recommend them but innocency and simplicity. Who by their heats and ignorance were continual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of his patience in bearing with them, and of his care and tenderness in instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them. And after a life thus led with such unparallel'd humility, when he could add nothing more to it by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he doth it by his sufferings; and compleats the sad Tragedy of his Life by a most shameful and ignominious Death. This is the short and true account of all those things which the admirers of the greatness of this world think mean and contemptible in our Saviours appearance here on earth. But we are now to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether so great humility were not more agreeable with the design of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the World, than all that pomp
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101601:58"/>
and state would have been which the Son of God might have more easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded than we can imagine. He came not upon so mean an errand, as to dazle the eyes of Mankind with the brightness of his Glory, to amaze them by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleness of his Majesty, much less to make a shew of the riches and gallantry of the World to them: But he came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on far more noble and excellent designs, to bring life and immortality to light, to give men the highest assurance of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happiness and misery in the World to come, and the most certain directions for obtaining the one, and avoiding the other: and in order to that, nothing was judged more necessary by him, than to bring the vanities of this World out of that credit and reputation they had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among foolish men. Which he could never have done, if he had declaimed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much against the vanity of worldly greatness, riches and honours, if in the mean time himself had lived in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est splendour and bravery. For the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning then the contempt of this world to his Disciples in hopes of a better, would have looked like the commendation of the excellency of fasting at a full meal, and of the conveniencies of poverty by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101601:58"/>
one who makes the greatest hast to be rich. That he might not therefore seem to offer so great a contradiction to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by his own example, he makes choice of a life so remote from all suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of designs upon this world, that <hi>though the foxes had holes, and the birds of the air had nests, yet the Son of Man,</hi> who was the Lord and Heir of all things, <hi>had not whereon to lay his head.</hi> And as he shewed by his life how little he valued the great things of the World, so he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by his death how little he feared the evil things of it: all which he did with a purpose and intention to rectifie the great mistakes of men as to these things: That they might no longer ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture an eternal happiness for the splendid and glorious vanities of this present life; nor expose themselves to the utmost mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of another world, to avoid the frowns of this. From hence proceeded that generous contempt of the World, which not only our Saviour himself, but all his true Disciples of the first Ages of Christianity were so remarkable for; to let others see they had greater things in their eye than any here, the hopes of which they would not part with for all that this world thinks great or desirable.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101601:59"/>
So that considering the great danger most men are in, by too passionate a love of these things, and that universal and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite kindness which our Saviour had to the Souls of men; there was nothing he could discover it more in as to his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the world, than by putting such an affront upon the greatness and honour of it, as he did by so open a neglect of it in his life, and despising it in his death and sufferings. And who now upon any pretence of reason dare entertain the meaner apprehensions of our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour because he appeared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the pomp and greatness of the world, when the reason of his doing so was, that by his own humility and self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal he might shew us the way to an eternal happiness? Which he well knew how very hard it would be for men to attain to, who measure things not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their inward worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, but the splendour and appearance which they make to the world: who think nothing great but what makes them gazed upon; nothing desireable but what makes them flattered. But if they could be once perswaded how incomparably valuable the glories of the life to come are above all the gayeties and shews of this;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101601:59"/>
they would think no condition mean or contemptible, which led to so great an end; none happy or honourable which must so soon end in the grave, or be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to eternal misery. And that we might entertain such thoughts as these are, not as the melancholy effects of discontent and disappointments, but as the serious result of our most deliberate enquiry into the value of things, was the design of our Saviour in the humility of his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and of that excellent Doctrine which he recommended to the World by it. Were I to argue the case with Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, I might then at large shew from the free acknowledgments of the best and most experienced of them, that nothing becomes so much one who designs to recommend Vertue to the World, as a real and hearty contempt of all the pomp of it, and that the meanest condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeding from such a principle is truly and in it self more honourable, than living in the greatest splendour ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. Were I to deal with the <hi>Iews,</hi> I might then prove, that as the Prophecies concerning the <hi>Messias</hi> speak of great and wonderful effects of his coming, so that they should be accomplished in a way of suffering and humility. But since I
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101601:60"/>
speak to Christians, and therefore to those who were perswaded of the great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and love of our Saviour in coming into the World, to reform it, and that by convincing men of the truth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a future state, no more need to be said to vindicate the appearance of him from that meanness and contempt, which the pride and ambition of vain men is apt to cast upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But not only our Saviours manner of Appearance, but the manner of his Conversation gave great offence to his enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was too free and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar among persons who had the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est reputation, <hi>the Publicans and Sinners</hi>; and in the mean time declaimed against the strictest observers of the greatest ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours and austerities of life. And this no doubt was one great cause of the mortal hatred of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> against him, though least pretended, that even thereby they might make good that charge of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie which our Saviour so often draws up against them. And no wonder, if such severe rebukes did highly provoke them, since they found this so gainful and withall so easie a trade among the people, when with a demure look and a sower countenance they could cheat and defraud
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101601:60"/>
their Brethren; and under a specious shew of devotion could break their fasts by devouring Widows houses, and end their long Prayers to God with acts of the highest injustice to their Neighbours. As though all that while, they had been only begging leave of God to do all the mischief they could to their Brethren. It is true, such as these were, our Saviour upon all occasions speaks against with the greatest sharpness, as being the most dangerous enemies to true Religion: and that which made men whose passion was too strong for their reason abhor the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry name of Religion, when such baseness was practised under the profession of it. When they saw men offer to compound with Heaven for all their injustice and oppression, with not a twentieth part of what God challenges as his due; they either thought Religion to be a meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of men, or that these mens hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie ought to be discovered to the World. And therefore our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who came with a design to retrieve a true spirit of Religion among men, finds it first of all necessary to unmask those notorious hypocrites, that their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities being discovered, their ways as well as their persons might be the better
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101601:61"/>
understood and avoided. And when he saw by the mighty opinion they had of themselves, and their uncharitableness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all others, how little good was to be done upon them, he seldom vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes them his presence; but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses with those who being more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked were more easily convinced of their wickedness, and perswaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. For which end alone it was that he so freely conversed with them, to let them see there were none so bad, but his kindness was so great to them, that he was willing to do them all the good he could: And therefore this could be no more a just reproach to Christ, that he kept company sometimes with these, than it is to a Chyrurgion to visit Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, or to a Physician to converse with the sick.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But when they saw that his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness did appear in another way, by the authority of his Doctrine, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Miracles, then these wise and subtile men apprehend a further reach and design in all his actions: <hi>Viz.</hi> That his low condition was a piece of Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and a meer disguise to ensnare the people, the better to make them in love with his Doctrine, and so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101601:61"/>
to season them with Principles of Rebellion and Disobedience: Hence came all the clamours of his being <hi>an Enemy to Caesar,</hi> and calling himself <hi>the King of the Iews,</hi> and of his design to erect a Kingdom of his own, all which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret in the most malicious though most unreasonable sense. For nothing is so politick as malice and ill-will, for that finds designs in every thing; and the more contrary they are to all the Protestations of the persons concerned, the deeper that suggests presently they are laid, and that there is the more cause to be afraid of them. Thus it was in our Blessed Saviour's case; it was not the greatest care used by him to shew his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Authority he lived under, it was not his most solemn disavowing having any thing to do with their civil Interests, not the severe checks he gave his own Disciples for any ambitious thoughts among them, not the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the doctrine of Obedience to them, nor the rebuke he gave one of his most forward Disciples for offering to draw his sword in the rescue of himself, could abate the fury and rage of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but at last they condemn the greatest Teacher of the duty of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101601:62"/>
as a Traytor, and the most unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd example of innocency as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. But though there could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing objected against the life and actions of our Blessed Saviour, as tending to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and disturbance of the Civil Peace, yet that, these men (who were inspir'd by malice, and prophesied according to their own interest) would say, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was taken away in time, before his designs could be ripe for action, but if his doctrine tended that way, it was enough to justifie their proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. So then, it was not what he did, but what he might have done: not Treason but Convenience which made them take away the life of the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent person: but if there had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in his doctrine that way, there had been reason enough in such an Age of faction and sedition to have used the utmost care to prevent the spreading it. But so far is this from the least ground of probability that it is not possible to imagine a Religion which aims less at the present particular interests of the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of it, and more at the publick inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of Princes than Christianity doth, as it was both preached and practised by our Saviour and his Apostles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:101601:62"/>And here we have cause to lament the unhappy fate of Religion when it falls under the censure of such who think themselves the Masters of all the little arts whereby this world is governed. If it teaches the duty of Subjects, and the authority of Princes, if it requires obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Laws, and makes mens happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or misery in another life in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to depend upon it; then Religion is suspected to be a meer trick of Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this is to take it for granted that there is no such thing as Religion in the World; for if there be, there must be some invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Rights of Divine Soveraignty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, which must not vary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversity of the Edicts
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101601:63"/>
and Laws of men. But supposing the profession and practice of the Christian Religion to be allowed inviolable, there was never any Religion, nay, never any inventions of the greatest Politicians, which might compare with that for the preservation of civil Societies.

But when the reason of obedience is derived from the concernments of another life, no hopes of interest in this world can be thought to ballance the loss which may come by such a breach of duty in that to come. So that no persons do so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously undermine the foundations of civil Government, as those who magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that to the contempt of Religion;

none so effectually secure them as those <hi>who give to God the things that are Gods,</hi> and by doing so, are obliged <hi>to give to Caesar the things that are Caesars.</hi> This was the Doctrine of Christianity as it was delivered by the first author of it; and the practice was agreeable, as long as Christianity preserved its primitive honour in the world. For, so far were men then from making their zeal for Religion a pretence to Rebellion, that though Christianity were directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Religions then in vogue in the world, yet they knew of no other way of promoting it, but by patience, humility, meekness, prayers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or their persecutors, and tears when they saw them obstinate. So far were they then from fomenting suspicions and jealousies concerning the Princes and Governours they lived under, that though they were generally known to be some of the worst of men as well as of Princes, yet they charge all Christians in the strictest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as they lov'd their Religion and the honour of it, as they valued their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ouls and the salvation of them, that they should be subject to them. So far were they then from giving the least encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the usurpations of the rights
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101601:64"/>
of Princes under the pretence of any power given to a Head of the Church: that there is no way for any to think they meant it, unless we suppose the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles such mighty Politicians, that it is because they say nothing at all of it; but on the contrary, <hi>bid every soul be subject to the higher powers</hi>; though an Apostle, Evangelist, Prophet, whatever he be, as the Fathers interpret it. Yea so constant and uniform was the doctrine and practice of Obedience in all the first and purest ages of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, that no one instance can be produced of any usurpation of the rights of Princes under the pretence of any title from Christ, or any disobedience to their authority, under the pretence of promoting Christianity, through all those times wherein Christianity the most flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, or the Christians were the most persecuted. And happy had it been for us in these last ages of the World, if we had been Christians on the same terms which they were in the Primitive times; then there had been no such scandals raised by the degeneracy of men upon the most excellent and peaceable Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World, as though that were unquiet and troublesom, because so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

For he shewed his great wisdom in contriving such a method of saving mens souls in another World, as tended most to the preservation of the peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness of this; and though this wisdom may be evil spoken of by men of restless and unpeaceable minds, yet it will be still justified by all who have heartily embraced the Wisdom which is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, who are pure and peaceable as that Wisdom is, and such, and only s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. That the design it self was very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the infinite Wisdom of God. What could we imagine more becoming the Wisdom of God, than to contrive a way for the recovery of lapsed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate

Mankind? who more fit to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy upon such a message as this, than the Son of God? for his coming gives the greatest assurance to the minds of men, that God was serious in the management of this design, than which nothing could be of greater importance in order to the success of it. And how was it possible he should give a greater testimony of himself, and withal of the purpose he came about, than he did when he was in the world? The accomplishment of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, and power of Miracles shewed who he was; the nature of his Doctrine, the manner of his Conversation, the greatness of his Sufferings, shewed what his design was in appearing among men: for they were all managed with a peculiar respect to the convincing mankind, that God was upon terms of mercy with them, and had therefore sent his Son into the world, that he might not only obtain the pardon of sin for those who repent, but eternal life for all them that obey him. And what is there now we can imagine so great and desirable as this, for God to manifest his wisdom in? It is true, we see a great discovery of it in the works of Nature, and might do in the methods of Divine Providence if partiality and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101601:65"/>
did not blind our eyes; but both these, though great in themselves, yet fall short of the contrivance of bringing to an eternal happiness man who had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from his Maker, and was perishing in his own folly. Yet this is that which men in the pride and vanity of their own imaginations either think not worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, or consider as little as if they thought so; and in the mean time think themselves very wise too. The <hi>Iews</hi> had the wisdom of their Traditions which they gloried in, and despised the Son of God himself when he came to alter them. The <hi>Greeks</hi> had the wisdom of their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy which they so passionately admir'd, that whatever did not agree with that, though infinitely more certain and useful, was on that account rejected by them. The <hi>Romans,</hi> after the conquest of so great a part of the World, were grown all such Politicians and Statesmen, that few of them could have leisure to think of another world, who were so busie in the management of this. And some of all these sorts do yet remain in the World, which makes so many so little think of, or admire this infinite discovery of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom: nay, there are some who can mix all these together, joyning a

               <hi>Iewish</hi> obstinacy, with the pride and self-opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to a <hi>Roman</hi> uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedness about the matters of another life. And yet upon a true and just en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry never any Religion could be found, which could more fully satisfie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> the reason of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or the wisdom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> than that which was made known by Christ, <hi>who was the Wisdom of God, and the Power of God.</hi> Here the <hi>Iew</hi> might find his <hi>Messias</hi> come, and the Promises fulfilled which related to him; here the <hi>Greek</hi> might find his long and vainly look'd for certainty of a life to come, and the way which leads to it; here the <hi>Roman</hi> might see a Religion serviceable to another world and this together. Here are Precepts more holy, Promises more certain, Rewards more desirable than ever the Wit or Invention of Men could have attained to.

Here is no making Religion a

meer trick of State, and a thing only useful for governing the people, which <hi>Numa</hi> and the great men at <hi>Rome</hi> are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the suspicion of. Here is no wrapping up Religion in strange figures and mysterious non-sense, which the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> were so much given to. Here is no inhumanity and cruelty in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offer'd, no looseness and profaneness allowed in the most solemn mysteries, no worshipping of such for Gods who had not been fit to live if they had been Men, which were all things so commonly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in the Idolatries of the Heathens. but the nature of the Worship is such as the minds of those who come to it ought to be, and as becomes that God whom we profess to serve, pure and holy, grave and serious, solemn and devout, without the mixtures of superstition, vanity or ostentation. The precepts of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are plain and easie to be known, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry suitable to the nature of Mankind, and highly tending to the advantage of those who practise them, both in this and a better life. The arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men are the most weighty and powerful, and of as great importance as the love of God, the death of his Son, the hopes of happiness, and the fears of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101601:67"/>
eternal misery, can be to men. And wherein is the contrivance of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on defective, when the end is so desirable, the means so effectual for the obtaining of it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Which is the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. There are two things which in this degenerate estate of man are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in order to the recovery of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; and those are Repentance for sins past, and sincere Obedience for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: now both these the Gospel gives men the greatest encouragements to, and therefore is the most likely to effect the design it was intended for.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Repentance for sins past. What more powerful motives can there be to perswade men to repent, than for God to let men know that he is willing to pardon their sins upon the sincerity of their Repentance, but without that, there remains nothing but a fearful expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of judgment, and fiery indignation? that their sins are their follies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to repent is to grow wise: that he requires no more from men, but what every considerative man knows is fitting to be done whenever he reflects upon his actions: that there can be no greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude or disingenuity towards the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101601:67"/>
Son of God than to stand at defiance with God when he hath shed his blood to reconcile God and Man to each other: that every step of his humiliation, every part of the Tragedy of his life, every wound at his death, every groan and sigh which he uttered upon the Cross, were designed by him as the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Rhetorick, to perswade men to forsake their sins, and be happy: that there cannot be a more unaccountable folly, than by impenitency to lose the hopes of a certain and eternal happiness for the sake of those pleasures which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wise man is ashamed to think of: that to continue in sin with the hopes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let us then reflect upon the whole design of the Gospel, and see how admirably it is suited to the end it was intended for, to the condition of those whose good was design'd by it, and to the whole honour of the great contriver and manager of it. And let not us by our impenitency and the unholiness of our lives, dishonour God and our Saviour,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101601:68"/>
reproach our Religion, and condemn that by our lives which we justifie by our words. For when we have said all we can, the best and most effectual vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Christian Religion is to live according to it: But oh then how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy are we that live in such an Age wherein it were hard to know that men were Christians, unless we are bound to believe their words against the tenour and course of their actions! What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the purity, the innocency, the candor, the peaceableness, the sincerity and devotion of the Primitive Christians! What is become of their zeal for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Christ and Christian Religion! If it were the design of men, to make our Religion a dishonour and reproach to the <hi>Iews, Mahumetans,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> could they do it by more effectual means than they have done? Who is there that looks into the present state of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World, could ever think that the Christian Religion was so incomparably beyond all others in the world? Is the now <hi>Christian Rome</hi> so much beyond what it was while it was <hi>Heathen?</hi> Nay, was it not then remarkable in its first times for justice, sincerity, contempt of riches, and a kind of generous hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,

and who does not (though of the same Religion, if he hath any ingenuity left) lament the want of all those things there now?

If we have then any tenderness for the honour of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any kindness for our own Souls, let us not only have the Name, but let us lead the lives of Christians; let us make amends for all the reproaches which our Religion hath suffered by the faction and disobedience of some, by the Oaths and Blasphemies, the impieties and profaneness of others, by the too great negligence and carelesness of all that if it be possible, Christianity may appear in its true glory, which will thee only be, when those <hi>who name the Nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THese words are uttered by one who was himself a remarkable instance of the truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contained in them, <hi>viz.</hi> of that divine Power which did accompany the Gospel of Christ. For what can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine else should make him now <hi>not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Gospel of Christ,</hi> who not long before was not ashamed to persecute all those who professed it? One, whose spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was fermented with the leaven of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101601:70"/>
               <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and inraged with fury against all who owned the name of Christ, is of a sudden turned quite into another temper, to the confusion of those who employed him, and the amazement of them whom he designed to persecute. Nay, so great was the change which was wrought in him, that from a Bigot of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion he becomes an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the <hi>Christian,</hi> and from breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flames against the Christians, none more ready than he to undergo them for Christ. If he had only given over his persecution, it might have been thought, that he had meerly run himself out of breath, and grown weary of his former fury, (as greater persons than he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards) but to retain the same fervor of spirit in preaching Christ, which he had before in opposing him, to have as great zeal for making Christians, as he had for destroying them, must needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from some great and unusual cause. Whilst the <hi>Iews</hi> thought he had too much learning and interest to become their enemy, and the Christians found he had too much rage and fury to be their friend, even then when they least expected it, instead of continuing an Instrument of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> for punishing the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101601:70"/>
he declared himself an Apostle and Servant of Jesus Christ. And that no ordinary one neither: for such was the efficacy of those divine words, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me,</hi> that they not only presently allay his former heat, but quicken and animate him to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er zeal for the honour of him whom he had persecuted before. And the faster he had run when he was out of his way, the greater diligence he used when he found it, there being none of all the followers of Christ who out-strip him in his constant endeavours to advance the Christian Religion in the World. And if an unwearied diligence to promote it, an uncessant care for preserving it, an universal concern for all who owned it, and an undaunted spirit in bearing the affronts and injuries he underwent for it, be any perswasive arguments of the love a man bears to his Religion, there was never any person who made a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er demonstration than St. <hi>Paul</hi> did of the truth of his Religion, and his since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in embracing it. For his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were suitable to the greatness of his spirit, his care as large as the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon of the Sun of righteousness, his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as great as the malice of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101601:71"/>
For he was neither afraid of the Malice of the <hi>Iews,</hi> or of the Wisdom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or of the Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but he goes up and down preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel in a sphere as large as his mind was, and with a zeal only parallel with his former fury. He encountred the <hi>Iews</hi> in their Synagogues, he dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Greeks</hi> in their most famous Cities, at <hi>Athens, Corinth, Ephesus,</hi> and elsewhere, and every-where raising some Trophies to the honour of the Gospel: nothing now remained but that he should do the same at <hi>Rome</hi> also. And for this he wants not spirit and resolution, for <hi>he even longed to be there,</hi> vers. 11. nay, <hi>he had often purposed to go thither,</hi> but waited for a convenient opportunity, <hi>v.</hi> 13. But while God was pleased o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to dispose of him, he could not conceal the joy which he had for the ready entertainment of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by those to whom he writes, and that their faith was grown as famous as the City wherein they dwelt, v. 8. <hi>First, I thank my God through Iesus Christ, for you all, that your Faith is spoken of through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world:</hi> and he further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifests the greatness of his affection to them, <hi>that without ceasing he made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101601:71"/>
of them always in his Prayers,</hi> v. 9. And among the rest of the blessings he prayed for, for himself and them; he was sure not to forget <hi>his coming to them,</hi> v. 10. Not out of an ambitious and vain-glorious humour that he might be taken notice of in that great and imperial Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that he might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nstrumental in doing them service as he had done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>v.</hi> 11.13. And to this end he tells them, what an obligation lay upon him to spread the Doctrine of Christ in all places and to all persons, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, to the wise and to the unwise.</hi> So that neither the wisdom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor the ignorance of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> could hinder St. <hi>Paul</hi> from discovering to them the contrivances of infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and the excellent methods of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodness in order to mens eternal welfare. And although <hi>Rome</hi> now thought it self to be the seat of Wisdom, as well as Empire and Power, yet our Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares <hi>his readiness to preach the Gospel there too,</hi> v. 15. for which he gives a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reason in the words of the Text; <hi>for I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein we have considerable these two
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101601:72"/>
things, 1. The Apostle's boldness and freeness in declaring the Doctrine of Christ, <hi>For I am not ashamed,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The ground of it in the following words, <hi>for it is the power of God to Salvation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Apostles boldness and freeness in declaring the Doctrine of Christ. It was neither the gallantry of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, nor the splendor of the City, not the greatness of her Power, or wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of her Statesmen could make St. <hi>Paul</hi> entertain the meaner opinion of the doctrine he hoped to preach among them. Had Christ come <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with a great deal of pomp and state into the World, subduing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Nations under him; had St. <hi>Paul</hi> been a General for the Gospel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being an Apostle of it, the great men of the World would then allow he had no cause to be ashamed either of his Master, or of his employment. But to preach a crucified Saviour among the glories and triumphs of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a Doctrine of so much simplicity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world among those who were the Masters of it, and managed it with so much art and cunning; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to be followers of Christ in a holy life, who could not be like the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101601:72"/>
gods they worshipped, unless they were guilty of the greatest debaucheries, seems to be an employment so liable to the greatest scorn and contempt, that none but a great and resolved spirit would ever undertake it. For when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider after so many hundred years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christianity, how apt the greatness of the world is to make men ashamed of the practice of it; and that men aim at a reputation for wit by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to abuse the Religion they own; what entertainment might we then think our Religion met with among the great men of the Age it was first preached in, when it not only encountered those weaker weapons of scoffs and raillery, but the strong holds of interest and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? If our Religion now can hardly escape the bitter scoffs, and profane jests of men who pawn their souls to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted witty, what may we think it suffered then, when it was accounted a part of their own Religion to despise and reproach ours? If in the Age we live in, a man may be reproached for his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and virtue, that is, for being really a Christian, when all profess themselves to be so, what contempt did they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go in the first Ages of the Christian
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101601:73"/>
World, when the very name of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an was thought a sufficient brand of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy? And yet such was the courage and magnanimity of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that what was accounted most mean and contemptible in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> their believing in a crucified Saviour, was by them accounted the matter of their greatest honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For though St. <hi>Paul</hi> only saith here that <hi>he was not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ,</hi> yet elsewhere he explains that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is contained in these words, when he saith, <hi>God forbid that I should glory in any thing, save in the Cross of Christ, by whom the World is crucified to me, and I unto the World,</hi> Gal. 6.14. <hi>i. e.</hi> Although he could not but be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how much the world despised him, and his Religion together, yet that was the great satisfaction of his mind, that his Religion had enabled him to despise the World as much. For neither the pomp and grandeur of the World, nor the smiles and flatteries of it, no nor its frowns and severities could abate any thing of that mighty esteem and value which he had for the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For in his own expression, <hi>he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted all things else but loss for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101601:73"/>
of the knowledge of Christ Iesus his Lord,</hi> Phil. 3.8. Which words are not spoken by one who was in despair of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken notice of for any thing else, and therefore magnifies the Profession he was engaged in; but by a person as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable as most of the Time and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he lived in both for his birth and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. So that his contempt of the World was no sullen and affected severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the issue of a sober and impartial judgment; and the high esteem he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed of Christianity was no fanatick whimsey, but the effect of a diligent enquiry, and the most serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And that will appear,</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the grounds and reasons which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here gives why he was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of the Gospel of Christ, 1. From the excellent end it was designed for, and that is no less than <hi>salvation.</hi> 2 From the effectualness of it in order to that end, <hi>it is the power of God to Salvation.</hi> 3. From the necessity of believing the Gospel by all who would attain that end; <hi>to every one that believes, the Iew first, and also to the Greek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. From the excellent End it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for, the recovery and happiness of the souls of men, both which are
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101601:74"/>
implyed in the term <hi>salvation.</hi> For, considering the present condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, as it is so far sunk beneath it self, and kept under the power of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly passions; whatever tends to make it happy, must do it by delivering it from all those things which are the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of its misery. So that whatever Religion should promise to make men happy, without first making them ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and good, might on that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be justly suspected of imposture. For the same reasons which make the the acts of any Religion necessary, <hi>viz.</hi> that we may please that God, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and governs the World, must make it necessary for men to do it, in those things which are far more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him than all our sacrifices of what kind soever, which are the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of true vertue and goodness. If then that accusation had been true, which <hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> charged Christianity with, <hi>viz. that it indulged men in the practice of vice, with the promise of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happiness notwithstanding;</hi> I know nothing could have rendred it more sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious to be a design to deceive Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But so far is it from having the least foundation of truth in it, that as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:101601:74"/>
there never was any Religion which gave men such certain hopes of a future felicity, and consequently more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to be good, so there was none ever required it on those strict and severe terms which Christianity doth. For there being two grand duties of men in this world, either towards God in the holiness of their hearts and lives, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Brethren, in a peaceable car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage among men (which cannot be without justice and sobriety) both these are enforced upon all Christians, upon no meaner terms than the unavoidable loss of all the happiness our Religion promises. <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. This is then the grand design of Christianity, to make men happy in another world, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them good and vertuous in this: It came to reform this world, that it might people another; so to purifie the souls of men, as to make them meet to enjoy the happiness designed for them. This is that <hi>great Salvation</hi> which the Gospel brings to the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. and thence it is called <hi>the Word of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Acts 13.26. <hi>the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Acts 16.17. <hi>the Gospel of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:101601:75"/>
Ephes. 1.13. So that though Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity be of unspeakable advantage to this world, there being no Religion that tends so much to the peace of mens minds, and the preservation of civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties as this doth; yet all this it doth by way of subordination to the great end of it, which is the promoting mens eternal happiness. And the more we consider the vast consequence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this end to Mankind, the greater reason we shall find that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had, why <hi>he should not be ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.</hi> For can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any end more noble that any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine can aim at than this? Supposing the common principles of all Religion to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> the Being of God, and Immortality of our Souls, there can be nothing more becoming that God to discover, or those Souls to be imployed about, than the way to a blessed immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. And if we admire those discourses of the Heathen Philosophers, wherein they speak more darkly and obscurely concerning those things, what admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth the Gospel deserve, which hath brought life and immortality to light? If we commend the vertuous Heathens, who according to those short and obscure
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101601:75"/>
notices which they had of God and themselves, sought to make the world any thing the better for their being in it, what infinitely greater esteem do those blessed Apostles deserve, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted not their own lives dear to them that they might make even their enemies happy? If those mens memories be dear to us who sacrifice their lives and fortunes for the sake of the Country they belong to, shall not those be much more so who have done it for the good of the whole world? Such who chearfully suffered death while they were teaching men the way to an eternal life, and who patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the flames, if they might but give the greater light to the world by them. Such who did as far out-go any of the admired <hi>Heroes</hi> of the Heathens, as the purging the World from sin is of greater consequence than cleansing an <hi>Augoean</hi> Stable from the filth of it, and rescuing men from eternal flames is a more noble design than clearing a Country from Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats and Robbers. Nay, most of the Heathen Gods who were so solemnly worshipped in <hi>Greece</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> owed their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to such slender benefits to Mankind; that sure the world was very barbarous or hugely gratefull, when
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101601:76"/>
they could think them no less than Gods who found out such things for men: If a Smith's forge, and a Woman's distaffe, if teaching men the noble arts of figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and cheating one another were such rare inventions, that they only became some of the most celebrated Deities, which the grave and demure <hi>Romans</hi> thought fit to worship; sure St. <hi>Paul</hi> had no cause to be ashamed of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion among them, who had so much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be ashamed of their own; since his design was to persuade them out of all the vanities and fooleries of their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Worship, and to bring them to the service of the true and ever-living God, who had discovered so much goodness to the world in making his Son a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for the sins of it. And was not this a discovery infinitely greater and more suitable to the nature of God, than any which the subtilty of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or wisdom of the <hi>Romans</hi> could ever pretend to concerning any of their Deities? Thus we see the excellent end of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was that which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> so far from being ashamed of it; and so it would do all us too, if we did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and value it as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did. But it is the great dishonour of too many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101601:76"/>
us, that they are more ashamed of their Religion than they are of their sins. If to talk boldly against Heaven, to affront God in calling him to witness their great impieties by frequent oaths, to sin brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with the highest confidence, to mock at such who are yet more modest in their debaucheries, were not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of the Gospel of Christ, we might find St. <hi>Pauls</hi> enough in the Age we live in, and it would be a piece of gallantry to be Apostles. But this is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the utmost endeavour to put Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of countenance, and make the Gospel it self blush and be ashamed, that ever such boldfaced impieties should be committed by men under the profession of it, as though they believed nothing so damnable as Repentance and a Holy life, and no sin so unpardonable as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty in committing it. But to use St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s language when he had been descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing such persons himself, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. <hi>We are perswaded better things of you, and things that accompany that salvation the Gospel was designed for, though we thus speak.</hi> For certainly nothing can argue a greater meanness of spirit, than whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e wicked and profane persons are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of that which unavoidably tends
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101601:77"/>
to their ruine, and should be shy of the profession and practice of that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to their eternal happiness. What is become of all that magnanimity and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous spirit which the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were so remarkable for, if while some are impudent in sinning, others are ashamed of being or doing good? If we have that value for our immortal souls, and a future life, which we ought to have, we shall not trouble our selves much with the Atheistical scoffs and drollery of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane persons, who while they deride and despise Religion, do but laugh themselves into eternal misery. And thus much for the first ground of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s confidence, <hi>viz.</hi> The excellent end the Gospel was design'd for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The effectualness of it in order to that end. <hi>It is the Power of God to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Wherein two things are imply'd.

                  <item>2. The effectualness of the Gospel in order to it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The inefficacy of any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for this end of promoting the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal salvation of Mankind. If the world had been acquainted with any doctrine before which had been sufficient for the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101601:77"/>
purposes the Gospel was designed for, there would have been no such necessity of propagating it among men; nor had there been reason enough to have justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Apostles in exposing themselves to so great hazards for the preaching of it. If the notion of an eternal God and Providence, without the knowledge of a <hi>Saviour,</hi> had been sufficient to reform the World, and make men happy; it had not been consistent with the wisdom or goodness of God to have imploy'd so many persons, with the loss of their lives, to declare the doctrine of Christ to the World. So that if Christianity be true, it must be thought necessary to salvation, for the necessity of it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by those who were the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of confirming the truth of it. I meddle not with the case of those particular persons who had no means or opportunity to know God's reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will, and yet from the Principles of Natural Religion did reform their lives, in hopes of a future felicity (if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such there were) but whether there were not a necessity of such a Doctrine as the Gospel is to be discover'd to the world, in order to the reformation of it? For some very few persons either through
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101601:78"/>
the goodness of their natures, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their education, or some cause of a higher nature, may have led more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous lives than others did; but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that what aims at the general good of Mankind, must be suited to the capacities of all, and enforced with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which may prevail on any but the most obstinate and wilful persons. But when we consider the state of the World at that time when Christianity was first made known to it, we may easily see how insufficient the common Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion were from working a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in it, when notwithstanding them mankind was so generally lapsed into Idolatry and Vice, that hardly any can be instanced in in the Heathen World, who had escaped both of them. And there was so near an affinity between both these, that they who were ingaged in the rites of their Idolatry, could hardly keep themselves free from the intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vice; not only because many of their villanies were practised as part of their Religion, (and there was little hopes certainly of their being good, who could not be Religious without being bad but because the very Gods they worship were represented to be as bad as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101601:78"/>
themselves. And could they take any better measure of Vertue, than from the actions of those whom they supposed to have so divine an excellency in them, as to deserve their adoration? So that if there were a design of planting wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the world (which need not be, for it grows fast enough without it) it could not be done more successfully than by worshipping those for Gods, who did such things which good men would abhorr to think of. And yet this was the state of the world then, when the Gospel was preached, and not only of the more rude and barbarous Nations, but of the most civiliz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and knowing people, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> themselves; as our Apostle at large proves in the remainder of this chap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, wherein he shews, that though they had means enough of knowing the Eternal God and Providence, yet they were so fallen into Idolatry, and the most vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices, that there was no means of recovering them, but by a fuller dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery both of the justice and goodness of God.</p>
            <p>I know it will be here objected, that though the generality of men were bad then (as when were they otherwise) yet the Heathens had a kind of Apostles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101601:79"/>
them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Philosophers, who sought to amend the manners of men by the moral instructions they gave them; so that if men were bad, it was not for want of good counsel, but for not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, which is all (they say) we have to say for our selves, when we are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the great debaucheries of the Christian world.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, That our business is not now to enquire whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her there hath not been an incomparably greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the world by Christianity, in the reforming mens lives, than ever was by any of the <hi>Heathen Morals</hi>; but whether these, taking them in the fairest dress, were so sufficient for the bringing men to eternal happiness, that there needed not any such Doctrine as Christianity, be published for that end? And there are two great things we may charge the best of their discourses with an insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in, for the accomplishment of this end, which are Certainty, and Motives, or the want of Arguments to believe, and Encouragements to practise.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were destitute of sufficient certainty; for what a man ventures his eternal state upon, he ought to be well assured of the truth of it. But how was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101601:79"/>
it possible for the World to be reform'd by such wise Apostles (if they must be called so) who are perpetually disputing among themselves about those things which were the most necessary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all Vertue and Religion? As though the best Arguments they had to prove their Souls immortal, was because their Disputes about them were so. And those seemed among them to gain the greatest reputation for Wit, who were best able to dispute against common Principles; and they managed their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness with greatest advantage, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed the weakness of others princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but established none of their own; which was an unavoidable consequence of the way they proceeded in, for offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at no such way of proof as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity doth, they rather taught Men to dispute, than to live eternally. Besides, their discourses were too subtile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate for the common capacities of Men; how long might a Man live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an <hi>Entelechia</hi> would make him know the nature of his soul the better, or an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> perswade him to believe its immortality? Insomuch that it is hard to determine, whether the arguments used by them, did not rather hinder as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101601:80"/>
than perswade to it? and it seems probable that the honest minded illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Heathens believed those things more firmly than the greatest Philosophers. For plain truths lose much of their weight, when they are rarify'd into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties, and their strength is impaired when they are spun into too fine a thread. The arguments which must prevail with Mankind, must be plain and evident, easie and yet powerful. The natural sense of good and evil in Men is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dulled by disputes, and only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned by a powerful representation of an infinite Being, and a future Judgment: and that by such a way of proof as all persons are equal Judges of the truth and validity of it; such as the Resurrection of Christ is in the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But let us suppose the arguments cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and suitable, yet what sufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives or encouragements could they give to lead a holy and vertuous life, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all their endeavours to perswade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, remain'd so uncertain themselves as to a future happiness? So <hi>Tully</hi> tells us of <hi>Socrates</hi> himself when he was just dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That he told his friends, that only the Gods knew whether it was fitter for men to live or die, but he thought no man did.</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:101601:80"/>
And although some would excuse this as his usual way of disputing, yet of all times one would think it was fittest for him then to declare his mind in the most express terms, not only for the full vindication of himself, but for the comfort and encouragement of his friends. We are sure, Christianity proceeds on those terms, that if a future happiness be supposed uncertain, it declares expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there can be no sufficient reason given for men to part with the conveniencies of this present life; nay, it supposes <hi>the best men to be the most miserable of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if there be not a future reward,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.19. — 32. Again, what probability was there they should ever perswade the World to vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, when the severest of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, made it lie in things so repugnant to humane nature, as goodness is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it. As when they made it an equal fault for a man to be angry, and to murder his Sovereign; and that all passions are to be destroy'd, that pain and grief are nothing, that vertue in all conditions is a sufficient reward to it self: Which are so contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense of Mankind, that the only way to perswade men to believe them,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101601:81"/>
is first to perswade them they are not men. So that he was certainly the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest man among the Heathens, who concluded, <hi>that we ought to expect a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Master to teach us these things,</hi> and to acquaint us with the happiness of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life. And hereby an answer may be given to <hi>Porphyries</hi> grand objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christian Religion, <hi>viz. If it were so necessary for the good of Mankind, why was it so long before it was discovered</hi>? Because God would thereby discover the insufficiency of all the means the wit of man could find out to reform the world, without this. That not only the <hi>Iews</hi> might see the weakness of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation they were under, but the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> world might groan with an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of some more powerfull means to goodness than were yet among them. For when Philosophy had been so long in its height, and had so little influence upon Mankind, it was time for the Son of righteousness to arise, and with the softning and healing influence of his beams to bring the World to a more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous temper.</p>
            <p>And that leads to the Second thing implyed, which is the peculiar efficacy of the Gospel for promoting mens salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101601:81"/>
               <hi>for it is the power of God to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and that will appear, by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how many ways <hi>the power of God</hi> is engaged in it. These three especially. 1. In confirmation of the Truth of it. 2. In the admirable Effects of it in the World. 3. In the divine Assistance which is promised to those who embrace it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In confirmation of the Truth of it. For the World was grown so uncertain, as to the grand foundations of Religion, that the same power was requisite now to settle the World, which was at first for the framing of it. For though the Precepts of Christian Religion be pure and easie, holy and suitable to the sense of Mankind, though the Promises be great and excellent, proportionable to our wants and the weight of our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, though the reward be such that it is easier to desire than comprehend it, yet all these would but seem to baffle the more the expectations of men, unless they were built on some extraordinary evidence of divine power. And such we assert there was in the confirmation of these things to us, not only in the miraculous birth of our Saviour, and that continual series of unparallel'd mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101601:82"/>
in his life, not only in the most obliging circumstances of his death; not only in the large effusion of divine gifts upon his Apostles, and the strange propagation of Christian Religion by them against all humane power; but that which I shall particularly instance in, as the great effect of divine power, and confirmation of our Religion, was his Resurrection from the dead. For, as our Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Christ was declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of Holiness, by the Resurrection from the dead.</hi> No way of evidence could be more suitable to the capacities of all, than this, it being a plain matter of fact; none ever better attested than this was, not only by the unanimous consent of all the witnesses, but by their constant adhering to the truth of it, though it cost almost all of them their lives; and no greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could be given to the World of a divine power, since both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> agreed in this, that such a thing could not be effected but by an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate hand of God. So far were they then from thinking a resurrection possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the juice of herbs, or an infusion of warm blood into the veins, or by the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101601:82"/>
breath of living Creatures, as the great Martyr for <hi>Atheism</hi> would seem from <hi>Pliny</hi> to perswade us; when yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing can be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> higher concernment to those who believe not another life, than to have tried this experiment long ere now; and since nothing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ever happened since our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's resurrection, it only lets us know what credulous men in other things the greatest infidels as to Religion are. But so far were they at that time from so fond an imagination, that they readily yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that none but God could do it, tho' they seem'd to question whether God himself could do it or no. As appears by the Apostle's Interrogation, <hi>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</hi> Act. 26.8. This was therefore judged on both sides to be a matter of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that all the disputes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christian Religion were resolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this. Whether Christ were risen from the dead? And this the Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tles urge and insist on, upon all occasions, as the great evidence of the truth of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and this was the main part of their Commission, for they were sent abroad to be <hi>witnesses of his Resurrection.</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:101601:83"/>
Which was not designed by God as a thing strange and incredible to puzzle Mankind with, but to give the highest assurance imaginable to the World of the truth and importance of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Since God was pleased to imploy his power in so high a manner to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the certainty of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God's power was seen in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects of Christian Religion upon the minds of men: which was most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable by the strange alteration it soon made in the state of the world. In <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doea</hi> soon after the death of Christ, some of his Crucifiers become Christians, 3000 Converts made at one Sermon of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s, and great accessions made after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards both in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and other places. Yea in all parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, where the Christians came, they so increased and multiplied, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeared that God had given a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction to his new Creation suitable to what he gave to the first. So that within the compass of not a hundred years after our Saviour's death, the World might admire to see it self so strangely changed from what it was. The Temple at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> destroy'd, and the <hi>Iews</hi> under a sadder dispersion
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101601:83"/>
than ever, and rendred uncapable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their former Worship of God there: the Heathen Temples unfrequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Gods derided, the Oracles ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Philosophers puzzled, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates disheartned by their fruitless cruelties, and all this done by a few Christians who came and preached to the World <hi>Righteousness, Temperance, and a Iudgment to come,</hi> whereof God had given assurance to the World, by raising one <hi>Iesus</hi> from the dead. And all this effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted not by the power of Wit and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, not by the force and violence of rebellious subjects, not by men of hot and giddy brains, but by men sober, just, humble and meek in all their carriages, but withal such as might never have been heard of in the world, had not this Doctrine made them famous. What could this then be imputed to less than a Divine Power, which by effectual and secret ways carries on its own design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the force and wit of men. So that the wise <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> at whose feet St. <hi>Paul</hi> was bred, seem'd to have the truest apprehensions of these things at that time, when he told the <hi>Sanhedrin, If this counsel, or this work be of men, it will come to nought, but if it be of God, ye
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101601:84"/>
cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found to fight against God.</hi> Act. 5.38, 39.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the Divine Assistance which is promised to those who embrace it: in which respect it is properly <hi>the power of God to salvation;</hi> and therein far beyond what the Philosophers could promise to any who embraced their opinions. For, the Gospel doth not only discover the necessity of a Principle superiour to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which we call <hi>Grace,</hi> in order to the fitting our souls for their future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, but likewise shews on what terms God is pleased to bestow it on men, <hi>viz.</hi> on the consideration of the death and passion of our Lord and Saviour. <hi>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Christ our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> Titus 3.5. There being nothing in humane nature which could oblige God, to give to Mankind that assistance of his grace whereby they are enabled to work out this salvation the Gospel is designed for, with fear and trembling. The whole tenor of the Gospel importing a divine power which doth accompany the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:101601:84"/>
preaching of it, which is designed on purpose to heal the wounds, and help the weakness of our depraved and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate nature. Through which we may be <hi>kept to salvation:</hi> but it must be <hi>through Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Which is the last particular of the words; the necessity of <hi>believing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> in order to the partaking of the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation promised in it; <hi>it is the power of God to salvation to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, to the Iew first, and also to the Greek.</hi> An easie way of salvation, if no more were required to mens happiness but a fancy and strong opinion which they will easily call Believing. So there were some in St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s time, I could wish there were none in ours, who thought nothing necessary to salvation but a strong Faith, let their lives be what they pleased. But this is so repugnant to the main design of Christian Religion, that they who think themselves the strongest Believers, are certainly the weakest, and most ungrounded. For they believe scarce any other propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the new Testament, but that <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever believeth shall be saved.</hi> If they did believe that Christ came into the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:101601:85"/>
world to reform it, and make it better, that <hi>the wrath of God is now revealed from Heaven against all unrighteousness,</hi> as well as <hi>that the just by Faith shall live,</hi> that the design of all that love of Christ, which is shewn to the World, is <hi>to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from the hand of their enemies, that they might serve him in righteousness and holiness all the days of their lives,</hi> they could never imagine, that salvation is entailed by the Gospel on a mighty confidence or vehement perswasion of what Christ hath done and suffer'd for them. And so far is St. <hi>Paul</hi> from asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this, that as far as I can see, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meddles with a matter of that nicety, whether a single act of Faith be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our justification as it is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from Evangelical obedience, but his discourse runs upon this subject; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will pardon the sins of men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other terms than those which are declared in the Christian Religion, the former he calls <hi>Works,</hi> and the latter <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know, the subtilty of later times hath made St. <hi>Paul</hi> dispute in the matter of justification, not as one bred up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> but of the <hi>Master</hi> of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101601:85"/>
               <hi>Sentences;</hi> but men did not then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their Religion at all the worse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was plain and easie; and, it may be, if others since had understood their Religion better, there would never have needed so much subtilty to explain it, nor so many distinctions to defend it. The Apostle makes the same terms of justification and of salvation, for as he saith elsewhere, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> 
               <hi>We are justified by Faith,</hi> he saith here, <hi>the Gospel is the power of God to Salvation to every one that believes</hi>; if therefore a single act of Faith be sufficient for one, why not for the other also? But if believing here be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a more large and comprehensive sense, as a complex act relating to our undertaking the conditions of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; why should it not be taken so in the subsequent discourse of the Apostle? For we are to observe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epistle is not disputing against any sort of Christians that thought to be saved by their obedience to the Gospel from the assistance of divine grace; but against those who thought the Grace and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Gospel by no means neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in order to the pardon of their sins, and their eternal happiness. Two things
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101601:86"/>
therefore the Apostle mainly designs to prove in the beginning of it: First, the insufficiency of any other way of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion besides that offer'd by the Gospel; whether it were the light of Nature which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> contended for, but were far from living according to it; or that imaginary <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> which the <hi>Iews</hi> fancied to themselves (for it will be a very hard matter to prove that ever God entred into a Covenant of Works with fallen Man, which he knew it was impossible for him to observe) but they were so highly opinionated of themselves, and of those legal observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were among them, that they thought by vertue of them they could merit so much favour at God's hands, that there was no need of any other sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but what was among themselves to expiate the guilt of all their sins. And on that account they rejected the Gospel, as the Apostle tells us, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 10.3.</note> 
               <hi>that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.</hi> Against these there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle proves, that if they hoped for happiness upon such strict
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:101601:86"/>
terms, they laid only a foundation of <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 3.27.</note> 
               <hi>boasting</hi> if they did all which God required, but of misery if they did not; for then <note n="(b)" place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>Cursed is every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues not in every thing written in the Law to do it, i. e.</hi> if they failed in any one thing, then they must fail of all their hopes; but such a state of perfection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible to humane Nature, he shews, that either all Mankind must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably perish, or they must be saved by the Grace and Favour of God, which he proves to be discovered by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: and that God will now accept of a hearty and sincere obedience to his will declared by his Son; so that all those who perform that, though they live not in the nice observance of the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> shall not need to fear the penalty of their sins in another life. Which is the second thing he designs to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That those who obeyed the Gospel, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> were equally capable of salvation by it. <note n="(c)" place="margin">Rom. 3.29.</note> 
               <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>is God the God of the Iews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also</hi>: because both <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> were to be justified upon the same terms, as he proves afterwards. So that Gods justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101601:87"/>
of us by the Gospel, is the solemn declaration of himself upon what terms he will pardon the sins of men; that is, deliver them from the penalties they have deserved by them. For the actual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the person is reserved to the great day; all the justification we have here is only declarative from God, but so as to give a right to us, by vertue whereof we are assured, that God will not only not exercise his utmost rigour, but shew all favour and kindness to those, who by belief of the Gospel do repent and obey. God doth now remit sin as he forbears to punish it; he remits the sinner as he assures him by the death of Christ he will not punish upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentance; but he fully remits both, when he delivers the person upon the tryal of the great day, from all the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties which he hath deserved by his sins. So that our compleat justification and salvation go both upon the same terms, and the same Faith which is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for one, must be sufficient for the other also.</p>
            <p>What care then ought men to take, lest by mis-understanding the notion of Believing, so much spoken of as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101601:87"/>
of our salvation, they live in a neglect of that holy obedience which the Gospel requires, and so believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into eternal misery. But as long as men make their obedience necessary, though but as the fruit and effect of Faith, it shall not want its reward: for those, <hi>whose hearts are purified by Faith</hi> shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be condemned for mistaking the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; and they who live as those that are to be judged according to <hi>their works,</hi> shall not miss their reward, though they do not think they shall receive it <hi>for them.</hi> But such who make no other condition of the Gospel but Believing, and will scarce allow that to be called a Condition, ought to have a great care to keep their hearts sounder than their heads, for their only security will lie in this, that they are good though they see no necessity of being so. And such of all others, I grant, have reason to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the irresistable power of Divine Grace, which enables them to obey the will of God against the dictates of their own judgments. But thanks be to God, who hath so abundantly provided for all the infirmities of humane Nature, by the large offers of his Grace, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101601:88"/>
of his Spirit, that though we meet with so much opposition without, and so much weakness within, and so many discouragements on every side of us; yet if we sincerely apply our selves to do the will of God, we have as great assurance as may be, that <hi>we shall be kept by the power of God through Faith unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>

            <p>WHen the wise and eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of Heaven concerning the salvation of Mankind by the death of the Son of God, were first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the World by his own appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and preaching in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing could be more reasonably expected, than that the dignity of his Person, the authority of his Doctrine, and the excellency of his Life, should have perswaded those whom he appeared among, to such an admiration of his Person, and belief of his Doctrine, as might have led them to an imitation of him in the holiness of his life and conversation. For if either the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101601:89"/>
worth of the Person, or the Importance of the Message might prevail any thing towards a kind and honourable reception among men; there was never any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son appeared in any degree comparable to him, never any Message declared which might challenge so welcome an entertainment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom men, as that was which he came upon. If to give Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind the highest assurance of a state of life and immortality, if to offer the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin, and reconciliation with God upon the most easie and reasonable terms, if to purge the degenerate World from all its impurities by a Doctrine as holy as the Author of it; were things as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Son of God to reveal, as the Sons of men to receive: nothing can be more unaccountable than that his Person should be despised, his Authority sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his Doctrine contemned. And that by those whose interest was more concerned in the consequence of these things, than himself could be in all the affronts and injuries he underwent from men: For the more the indignities, the greater the shame, the sharper the su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings which he did undergo, the higher was the honour and glory which he was advanced to: but the more obliging
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101601:89"/>
the instances of his kindness were, the greater the salvation that was tendred by him, the more prevailing the motives were for the entertainment of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the more exemplary and severe will the punishment be of all those who reject it. For it is very agreeable to those eternal Laws of Justice by which God governs the world, that the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should arise proportionably to the greatness of the mercies despised: and therefore although the Scripture be very sparing in telling us what the state of those persons shall be in another life who never heard of the Gospel; yet for those who do, and despise it, it tells us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that an eternal misery is the just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of those to whom an eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was offered, and yet neglected by them. And we are the rather told of it, that men may not think it a surprize in the life to come; or that if they had known the danger, they would have escaped it; and therefore our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who never mention'd punishment but with a design to keep men from it, declares it frequently, that the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those persons and places would be most intolerable, who have received, but not improved the light of the Gospel:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101601:90"/>
and that it would be more <note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1.23.</note> tolerable for the persons who had offered violence to Nature, and had Hell-fire burning in their hearts by their horrid impurities, than for those who heard the Doctrine, and saw the Miracles of Christ, and were much the worse, rather than any thing the better for it. But lest we should think that all this black scene of misery was only designed for those who were the Actors in that dolefull Tragedy of our Saviour's sufferings: we are told by those who were best able to assure us of it, that the same dismal consequences will attend all the affronts of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as if they had been offered to his own person. For it is nothing but the common flattery and self-deceit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, which makes any imagine, that though they do not now either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or obey the Gospel; they should have done both, if they had heard our Saviour speak as never man spake, and seen him do what never man did: For the same disposition of mind which makes them now slight that Doctrine <hi>which is delivered to them by them that heard him,</hi> would have made them slight the Person as well as the Doctrine, if they had heard it from himself. And
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101601:90"/>
therefore it is but reasonable that the same punishment should belong to both; especially since God hath provided so abundantly for the assurance of our Faith, by the miraculous and <hi>powerfull demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of that divine spirit</hi> which did accompany those who were the first pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishers of this Doctrine to the world. And therefore the Author of this Epistle, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath in the words of the Text de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that it is impossible to escape, if we <hi>neglect the great salvation</hi> offered us by the Gospel; in the following words he gives us that account of it, <hi>that at first it began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him: God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders, and divers mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own will.</hi> So that the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gifts of the Holy Ghost, falling upon the Apostles, and the many signs and wonders which were wrought by them, were the great testimony of God to the world, that these were the persons imployed by himself to decla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine whereon the eternal salvation of Mankind did depend. And since we have so lately acknowledged the truth of this testimony which God gave to the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101601:91"/>
Apostles, by the solemn celebration of that glorious descent of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> upon them on the day of Pentecost, that which naturally follows from it is, the great care we ought to take, lest we be found guilty of <hi>neglecting that great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> which is offered to us in that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which was attested in so eminent a manner <hi>by God himself;</hi> and that from the consideration of our own danger; <hi>for how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation</hi>? wherein are three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The care God hath taken to make us happy, by offering <hi>so great salvation</hi> to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The care we ought to take in order to our own happiness, <hi>not to neglect</hi> the offers which God hath made us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The unavoidable punishment which those do incur who are guilty of this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. <hi>How shall we escape?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not tell this Auditory how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible the Negative is, which is expressed by such an interrogation which appeals to the judgment of all who hear it, and so relies not upon the bare authority of the speaker, but upon the plain evidence of the thing, which others were judges of as well as himself. As though he had
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:101601:91"/>
said, if you slight and disesteem the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Christ, upon whatever grounds ye do it, if either through too great an opinion of the wisdom of this world you despise it as vain and useless, if through too mean an opinion of the excellency of Christianity, you reject it either as uncertain in its Theory, or impossible in its Practice; or if through too great a love of the pleasures of sin, or a secure and careless temper of mind, you regard not the doing what Christianity requires to make you happy; think with your selves, what way you can find to escape the wrath of God; for my part, I know of none; for if God were so severe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the violation of a far meaner insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much <hi>that every contempt and disobedience did receive a just recompence of reward, how shall we escape who neglect so great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi> or as the Apostle elsewhere ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues to the same purpose. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb. 10.28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>He that despised Moses Law, died without mercy under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101601:92"/>
the Spirit of Grace?</hi> This is a sad sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but I am afraid too necessary to be spoken to in the Age we live in; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men seem to be in apprehensive of the danger of inwardly despising the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they profess to own, and the negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of that which they hope to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by. It is strange that it should be so, but much more strange that men should think to do so, and not be called to an account for it. It is not only the gross and open sinner, that defies Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and by his oaths and blasphemies dares God to shew his Power and Justice upon him; but the slie and self-deceiving hypocrite, that hates Religion while he thinks he loves it; that in his heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns it, but is afraid to know that he does so, that ought to be possessed with a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sense of Religion, and a greater dread of the issue of the contempt or neglect of it. There is some appearance of ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in an open enmity; but none so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as that which hides it self under the disguise of friendship. In our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours time there were several <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orts of those who shewed their dis-esteem of him, some that were so enraged against him, that they contrive all ways for his disgrace and punishment, others could hear him
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:101601:92"/>
with patience, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mark 4.19.</note> 
               <hi>but the cares of this World, the deceitfulness of Riches, and the lust of other things choaked and stifled all good apprehensions of him,</hi> that they became weak and ineffectual. And those were guilty <hi>of making light of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-feast</hi> because of other business which they had to mind, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.5. as well as those who offered all the injuries and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts to his servants that invited them, <hi>v.</hi> 6. And as it was in the days of our Saviour, so it is now; <hi>some were eating and drinking,</hi> minding nothing but the vain and sensual pleasures of the world; <hi>some were buying and selling,</hi> so busie in this world, that they had no leasure to think of being happy in another; some were deriding and blaspheming; but all these too wise, or too vain, or too profane to mind the offers of eternal salvation. I wish we could say it were otherwise now, that a sensual and voluptuous, an easie and a careless life in some, that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and the restless pursuit after the honour and riches of the world in others, that a profane wit, and a contempt of all that is serious in those that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too great to be Religious, did not enervate the force of Christianity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their minds, and make them all,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101601:93"/>
though upon different grounds, agree in the neglect of their own salvation. But is the case of such men grown so desperate that no remedy can work upon them? hath the love of sin and the world so far intoxicated them, that no reason or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration whatever can awaken them? have they hardned themselves against all the power of divine Truths with a resolution as strong as death, and as cruel as the grave whither they are going? Will neither the love of happiness, nor the fear of misery, their own interest, and the wisdom of avoiding so great a danger, the dread of the Majesty and Power of God, and the horror of the great day, prevail at least so far on men to consider, whether these things be true or no; and if they be, what unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble folly it is to neglect them? And the better to make that appear, I shall prove these following things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God by the Gospel hath taken so great care of mens happiness, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a gross neglect can make them miserable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That nothing can be more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, than when God hath taken so much care of it, men should neglect it themselves.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:101601:93"/>3. That it is very just for God to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himself against so gross a neglect, by the severe punishments of the life to come.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God by the Gospel hath taken so great care of mens salvation, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a gross neglect can make them miserable. For, whatever the mind of man can imagine necessary in order to its own happiness, in its present fallen and degenerate condition, is abundantly provided for by the Gospel of Christ. For, man was so wholly lost as to his own felicity, that among the ruins and decays of his Nature, he could not pick up so much as the perfect Image and Idea of his own happiness; when he reflects upon himself, he finds himself such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused mass of folly and weakness, that he can never imagine that so noble a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign should have its ground-work laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so course a Being. And rather than believe the foundation of his happiness to be within himself, there is nothing so vain and trifling without him, but he is ready to fall down before it, and cry out, Here I place my felicity. Sometimes he admires the brave shews, and the Pomp and Gallantry of the World, and thinks nothing comparable to a glorious out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,

It is he only that can make them capable of the Joys of another life, by purging them from the stains and the pollutions of this. And therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his grace and favour ever to hope for the happiness of Heaven, must be by fancying a Heaven to be there, where there is no God. So that it is necessary, that the Proposals of this salvation must come from the Author of it, and that with such arguments as may perswade men of the truth of it, and with such motives as may encourage men to accept of them. Now the Gospel of Christ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us all these things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to our happiness; there we have the most agreeable and setled notion and Idea of it, the most large and free offers of divine goodness in order to it, the greatest assurance that these things did immediately proceed from God, and the most encouraging motives to accept of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101601:95"/>
these offers in order to that great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is tendred to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have the most agreeable and setled notion of true happiness: not such a mean and uncertain thing which lies at the mercy of the continual vicissitudes and contingencies of this present state, but that which is able to bear up the mind of man against all the troubles of this life, and to carry him to a Region beyond them all, where there is a fulness of joy without an allay of sadness after it, and ever-flowing rivers of pleasures that need no dams to make them rise higher, nor falls to make their motion perceived. Our Blessed Saviour never flatters his followers with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a felicity in this life; Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the most he hath promised them, and that they may enjoy, if they follow his directions, let this world be what it will, and do what it pleases with them. He never tells his Disciples they may have satisfaction here if they lie upon their beds of Down with their heads full of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting cares, that the pleasure of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life lies in the gratifications of the senses, and in making what use they can of the world; he never deceives them
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101601:95"/>
with the promise of so poor a happiness as that which depends upon health, friends, prosperity, and having our own wills. No, but he tells them of a more noble and generous felicity, that will preserve its own state and grandeur in spight of the world; a happiness consistent with loss of Estate, loss of Friends, with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and injuries, with persecutions, and death it self. For when our Saviour begins to discourse of happiness, what another kind of strain doth he speak of it in, than any of those <hi>Philosophers</hi> who have so much ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ructed the happiness of mans life by their voluminous wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and contentions about it. Here we meet with no <hi>Epicurean</hi> softness, which the sense of true Vertue carried the minds of the more noble Heathens above; no rigid and incredible <hi>Stoical</hi> Paradoxes, that make men only happy by the change of names; no <hi>Aristotelian</hi> supposition of a prosperous life for Vertue to shew its power in; but here the only supposition made, is that which lies in a mans own breast, <hi>viz</hi> true goodness; and then let his condition be what it will, his happiness is consistent with it.

Thus we see what kind of happiness it is, which the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel promises; not such a one as rises out of the dust, or is tost up and down with the motion of it; but such whose ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-failing fountain is above, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those small rivulets return, which fall down upon Earth to refresh the minds of men in their passage thither; but while they continue here, as the <hi>Iews</hi> say of the water that came out of the <hi>rock,</hi> it follows them while they travel through this wilderness below. So that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101601:97"/>
of a Christians happiness is the expectation of a life to come, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation having so firm a bottom, as the assurance which Christ hath given us by his death and sufferings, it hath power and influence sufficient to bear up the minds of men, against all the vicissitudes of this present state.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have the most large and free offers of divine Goodness in order to it. Were it as easie for Man to govern his own passions, as to know that he ought to do it; were the impressions of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Religion as powerful with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as those of Folly and Wickedness are, we should never need complain much of the misery of our present state, or have any cause to fear a worse to come. There would then be no condition here but what might be born with satisfaction to ones own mind; and the life one day led according to the principles of vertue and goodness would be preferred before a sinning Immortality. But we have lost the command of our selves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our passions govern us; and as long as such furies drive us, no wonder if our ease be little. When men began first to leave the uncertain speculations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and found themselves so out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101601:98"/>
that they thought the great care ought to be to regulate their own actions; how soon did their passions discover themselves about the way to govern them! And they all agreed in this, that there was great need to do it, and that it was impossible to do it without the principles of Vertue; <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>V. Lud. Viv. ad S. Aug de</hi> Civit. Dei, l. 19. c. 1.</note> for never was there any Philosopher so bad, as to think any man could be happy without Vertue; even the <hi>Epicureans</hi> themselves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it for one of their established Maxims, <hi>that no man could live a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant life without being good:</hi> and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the multiplication of <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi> about these things as far as <hi>Varro</hi> thought it possible to 288. (although there never were so many, nor really could be upon his own grounds) yet not one of all these but made it necessary to be vertuous, in order to being happy; and those who did not think vertue to be desired for it self, yet made it a necessary means for the true pleasure and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our lives. But when they were agreed in this, that it was impossible for a vitious man to enjoy any true content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mind; they fell into nice and subtle disputes about the names and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things to be chosen; and so lost
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101601:98"/>
the great effect of all their common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. They pretended great cures for the disorders of mens lives, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedies against the common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers of humane nature, but still the disease grew under the remedy, and their applications were too weak to allay the fury of their passions. It was neither the order and good of the Universe, nor the necessity of events, nor the things being out of our power, nor the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of humanity, no nor that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ill natured men, as <hi>Carneades</hi> call'd it, the many companions we have in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, that could keep their passions from breaking out when a great occasion was presented them. For he who had read all their discourses carefully, and was a great man himself, I mean <hi>Cicero,</hi> upon the death of his beloved daughter, was so far from being comforted by them, that he was fain to write a consolation for himself, in which the greatest cure (it may be) was the diversion he found in writing it. But supposing these things had gone much farther, and that all wise men could have governed their passions as to the troubles of this life (and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the truest wisdom lies in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t) yet what had all this been to a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:101601:99"/>
for an eternal state, which they knew little of, and minded less? All their discourses about a happy life here, were vain, and contradicted by themselves; when, after all their rants about their <hi>wise man being happy in the bull of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris,</hi> &amp;c. they yet allow'd him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch himself if he saw cause, which a wise man would never do, if he thought himself happy when he did it. So that unless <hi>God</hi> himself had given assurance of a life to come, by the greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of it in the death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of his Son; all the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatever could never have made mankind happy. But by the Gospel he hath taken away all suspicions and doubts concerning another state, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his own readiness to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us upon our repentance, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don what hath been done amiss, and to give that divine assistance whereby our wills may be governed, and our passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons subdued, and upon a submission of our selves to his wise Providence, and a sincere obedience to his Laws, he hath promised eternal salvation in the life to come.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hath given us the greatest <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance</hi> that these offers came from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101601:99"/>
which the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives an account of here, saying, that <hi>this salvation began at first to be spoken by our Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him, God also bearing them witness by signs and wonders,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein we have all the satisfaction which the minds of reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men could desire as to these things: It might be justly expected, that the messenger of so great news to the World should be no mean and ordinary person; neither was he, for the honour was as great in the person who brought it, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance was in the thing it self: No less than the Eternal Son of God came down from the Bosom of his Father, to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the mistakes of Mankind, and not only to shew them the way to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but by the most powerful argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perswade them to be so. Nay, we find all the three persons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity here engaged in the great work of mans salvation; <hi>it was first spoken by our Lord, God also bearing them witness,</hi> and that <hi>with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> So that not only the first revelation was from God, but the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to confirm that it was so, was from him too; there being never so clear an attestation of any divine truths as was of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101601:100"/>
the Gospel. From whence it follows, that the foundation whereon our Faith stands, is nothing short of a <hi>divine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,</hi> which God gave to the truth of that revelation of his will; so vain are the cavils of those who say, we have nothing but meer <hi>probabilities</hi> for our <hi>Faith,</hi> and do interpret that manner of proof which matters of fact are capable of, in a sense derogatory to the firmness of our Christian Faith. As tho' we made the Spirit of God a <hi>Paraclete</hi> or <hi>Advocate</hi> in the worst sense, which might as well plead a bad as a good cause. No, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that <hi>God himself did bear witness</hi> to that doctrine <hi>deliver'd by our Lord,</hi> and that in a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rations of a divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which accompanied the first Preachers of salvation by the Gospel of Christ.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101601:100"/>
               <hi>of those who constantly heard him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with him.</hi> But if you ask again, <hi>how can we know, that their testimony was infallible, since they were but men?</hi> he then resolves all into that, <hi>that God bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to them by signs and wonders, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> And those persons whom these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will not convince, none other will. Who are we, that should not think that sufficient which God himself thought so! who are we, that dare que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the certainty of that which hath had the <hi>Broad Seal</hi> of Heaven to attest it! Can any thing make it surer than God himself hath done? and can there be any other way more effectual for that end, than those demonstrations of a divine power and presence which the Apostles were acted by? Those that cavil at this way of proof, would have done so at any other, if God had made choice of it: and those who will cavil at any thing, are resolved to be convinced by nothing; and such are not fit to be discoursed with.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Here are the most prevailing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to perswade them to accept of these offers of salvation. There are two pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which are the great hinges of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>viz.</hi> mens Hopes and Fears,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101601:101"/>
and therefore all Laws have had their sanctions suitable to these two in Rewards and Punishments: now there was never any reward which gave greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to hope, never any punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which made fear more reasonable than those are which the Gospel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. Will ever that man be good, whom the hopes of Heaven will not make so? or will ever that man leave his sins whom the fears of Hell will not make to do it? What other arguments can we imagine should ever have that power and influence on mankind, which these may be reasonably supposed to have? Would you have God alter the methods of his Providence, and give his rewards and punishments in this life? but if so, what exercise would there be of the patience, forbearance and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God towards wicked men? must he do it as soon as ever men sin? then he would never try whether they would repent and grow better: or must he stay till they have come to such a height of sin? then no persons would have cause to fear him, but such who are arrived at that pitch of wickedness: but how then should he punish them? must it be by continuing their lives, and making them
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101601:101"/>
miserable? but let them live, and they will sin yet further: must it be by utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroying them? that to persons, who might have time to sin the mean while, (supposing annihilation were all to be fear'd) would never have power enough to deter men from the height of their wickedness. So that nothing but the misery of a life to come, can be of force enough to make men fear God, and regard themselves; and this is that which the Gospel threatens to those that neglect their salvation, which it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times calls <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 25.41.</note> 
               <hi>everlasting fire,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note n="(b)" place="margin">Mark 9.44.</note>

               <hi>everlasting destruction,</hi> all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to fill the minds of men with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror at the apprehension; and what then will the undergoing it do? Thence our Saviour reasonably bids men, <note n="(e)" place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note> 
               <hi>not fear them that can only kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both body and soul in hell.</hi> Thus the Gospel suggests the most proper object of fear, to keep men from sin, and as it doth that, so it presents likewise the most desireable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of hope to encourage men to be good; which is no less than a happiness
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101601:102"/>
that is easier to hope to enjoy than to comprehend; a happiness infinitely above the most ambitious hopes and glories of this world; wherein greatness is added to glory, weight to greatness, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to them all; therefore call'd <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.17.</note>

Where there shall be no fears to disquiet, no enemies to allarm, no dangers to conquer, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall then be, but an uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted peace, an unexpressible Joy, and pleasures for evermore. And what could be ever imagined more satisfactory to minds tired out with the vanities of this world, than such a repose as that is? What more agreeable to the minds and desires of good men, than to be eased of this clog of flesh, and to spend eternity with the fountain of all goodness, and <hi>the spirits of just men made perfect</hi>? What more ravishing delight to the souls that are purged, and <note n="(b)" place="margin">Rev. 7.14.</note>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101601:102"/>
hope for in this world, compared with that great salvation, which the Gospel makes so free a tender of? What a mean thing is it to be great in this world, to be honourable and rich, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be made the object of the envy of some, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of others, and at last it may be, an instance of this world's vanity; and after all this to be for ever miserable? But O the wisdom of a well-chosen happiness, that carries a man with contentment and peace through this life, and at last rewards him with a Crown of everlasting felicity. Thus we see the Gospel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the most excellent means to make men happy, if they be not guilty of a gross neglect of it; and if they be, that is their own act, and they must thank none but themselves if they be miserable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But I pray, what reason can be given, since God is so tender of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, that we should neglect it our selves? which is the next thing to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to. There are three sorts of things we think we have reason to neglect: Such as are too <hi>mean,</hi> and unworthy our care, such as are so <hi>uncertain,</hi> that they will not recompence it, such as our own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> is not at all concerned in; but I hope there are none who have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101601:103"/>
soul, and the use of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, can ever reckon their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under one of these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is it too <hi>mean</hi> an employment for you to mind the matters of your eternal welfare? Is Religion a beggarly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible thing, that it doth not become the greatness of your minds to stoop to take any notice of it? Hath God lost his honour so much with you, that his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice should be the object of mens scorn and contempt? But what is it which these brave spirits think a fit emplo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ment for themselves, while they despise God and his Worship? Is it to be curiously dressed, and make a fine shew, to think the time better spent at the Glass than at their Devotions? These indeed are weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty imployments, and fit in the first place to be minded, if we were made only to be gazed upon. Is it meerly to see Plays, and read Romances, and to be great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of that vain and frothy discourse which all persons account wit but those which have it? This is such an end of man's life which no <hi>Philosopher</hi> ever thought of. Or is it to spend time in excesses and debaucheries, and to be slaves to as many lusts as will command them? This were something indeed, if
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101601:103"/>
we had any other name given us but that of <hi>Men.</hi> Or lastly, is it to have their minds taken up with the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the World, to be wise in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, carefull in managing the publick interest of a Nation? This is an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I grant, fit for the greatest minds, but not such which need at all to take them off from minding their eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For the greatest wisdom is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with that, else Religion would be accounted folly, and I take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it is never the truly wise man but the pretender that entertains any mean thoughts of Religion. And such a one uses the publick Interest no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he doth Religion, only for a shew to the world, that he may carry on his own designs the better. And is this really such a valuable thing for a man to be contented to cheat himself of his eternal happiness, that he may be able to cheat the world, and abuse his trust? I appeal then to the Consciences of all such who have any sense of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the common interest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, setting aside the considerations of a life to come, whether to be just and sober, vertuous and good, be not more suitable to the design of humane Nature,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:101601:104"/>
than all the vanities and excesses, all the little arts and designs which men art apt to please themselves with? And if so, shall the eternal happiness which follows upon being good, make it less desirable to be so? No surely, but if God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired any thing to make us happy, which had been as contrary to our present Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest as the Precepts of Christianity are agreeable to it; yet the end would have made the severest commands easie, and those things pleasant which tend to make us happy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are these things so <hi>uncertain,</hi> that they are not fit for a wise man to be solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about them? <hi>if they will come with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

certainty, you would look more after them.</hi> What hinders you from being so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced? Is it not a bad disposition of mind which makes you unwilling to enquire into them? examine things with a mind as free as you would have it, judge seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously according to the reason of things, and you will easily find the interests of a life to come are far more certain, as well as more desirable than those of this present life. And yet the great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all the honours and riches of this world, never hinder the covetous or ambitious person from their great earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in pursuit of them. And shall not then all the mighty arguments which God himself hath made use of to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to us the certainty of a life to come, prevail upon us to look more seriously after it? Shall the unexpressible love of the Father, the unconceivable sufferings of the Son of God, and the miraculous descent and powerful assistance of the Holy Ghost have no more impression on our minds, than to leave us uncertain of a future state? What mighty doubts and suspicions of God, what distrusts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, what unspeakable ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and unaccountable folly lies at the bottom of all this uncertainty? <hi>O fools,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101601:105"/>
and slow of heart to believe,</hi> not only <hi>what the Prophets have spoken, but what our Lord hath declared, God himself hath given testimony to, and the Holy Ghost hath confirmed!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But is not your <hi>Interest</hi> concerned in these things? Is it all one to you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your souls be immortal or no? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they live in eternal felicity, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable misery? Is it no more to you than to know what kind of Baubles are in request at the <hi>Indies,</hi> or whether the Customs of <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Iapan</hi> are the wiser, <hi>i. e.</hi> than the most trifling things, and the remotest from our knowledge. But this is to absurd and unreasonable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that men should not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves concerned in their own eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and misery, that I shall not shew so much distrust of their understandings to speak any longer to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if notwithstanding all these things our neglect still continues, then <note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb. 10.27.</note> 
               <hi>there remains nothing but a fearful look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for of judgement, and the fiery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God.</hi> For there is no possibility of escaping if we continue to neglect so great salvation. All hopes of escaping are taken away, which are only in that, which men neglect; and those who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:101601:105"/>
their only way to salvation, must needs be miserable. How can that man ever hope to be saved by him whose <hi>blood</hi> he <hi>despises</hi> and <hi>tramples under foot?</hi> What grace and favour can he expect from God, who hath <hi>done despight unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi> That hath cast away with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and contempt the greatest kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and offers of Heaven. What can save him that resolves to be damned, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one does so, who knows he shall be damned, if he lives in his sins, and yet continues to do so? God himself, in whose only pity our hopes are, hath irreversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly decreed that he will have no pity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those, who despise his goodness, slight his threatnings, abuse his patience, and sin the more because he offers to pardon. It is not any delight that God takes in the miseries of his Creatures, which makes him punish them; but shall not God vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his own honour against obstinate and impenitent sinners? He declares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, that he is far from delighting in their ruine, and that is the reason he hath made such large offers, and used so many means to make them happy; but if men resolve to despise his offers, and slight the means of their salvation, shall not <hi>God</hi> be <hi>just</hi> without being thought to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:101601:106"/>
be <hi>cruel?</hi> And we may assure our selves, none shall ever suffer beyond the just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of their sins, for <hi>punishment,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us in the words before the Text, is nothing <hi>but a just recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> And if there were such a one proportionable to the <hi>violation of the Law delivered by Angels;</hi> how shall we think <hi>to escape</hi> who <hi>neglect</hi> a more excellent means of happiness, which was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>by our Lord himself</hi>? If God did not hate sin, and there were not a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonging to it, why did the Son of God die for the expiation of it? and if his death were the only means of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, how is it possible that those who neglect that, should escape the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not only of their other sins, but of that great contempt of the means of our salvation by him? Let us not then think to trifle with <hi>God,</hi> as though it were impossible a Being so merciful and kind, should ever punish his Creatures with the miseries of another life: For, however we may deceive our selves, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Gal. 6.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>God will not be mocked, for whatsoever a man sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that shall he reap; for he that sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:101601:106"/>I shall only propound some few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, to prevent so great a neglect as that of your salvation is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Consider what it is you neglect, the <hi>offer</hi> of Eternal Happiness, the greatest kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that ever was expressed to the World, the foundation of your present peace, the end of your beings, the stay of your minds, the great desire of your Souls, the utmost felicity that humane Nature is capable of. Is it nothing to neglect the favour of a Prince, the kindness of Great Men, the offers of a large and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Estate; but these are nothing to the neglect of the favour of God, the love of his Son, and that salvation which he hath purchased for you. Nay, it is not a bare neglect, but it implies in it a mighty contempt not only of the things offered, but of the kindness of him who offers them. If men had any due regard for God or themselves, if they had any esteem for his love, or their own welfare, they would be much more serious in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than they are. When I see a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son wholly immersed in affairs of the World, or spending his time in luxury and vanity, can I possibly think that man hath any esteem of God or of his own Soul? When I find one very serious in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101601:107"/>
the pursuit of his Designs in the World, thoughtful and busie, subtle in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, careful in managing them; but very formal, remiss and negligent in all affairs of Religion, neither inquisitive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, nor serious in minding them; what can we otherwise think, but that such a one doth really think the things of the World better worth looking after, than those which concern his eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But consider, before it be too late, and repent of so great folly. Value an immortal Soul as you ought to do, think what Reconciliation with God, and the Pardon of sin is worth, slight not the dear Purchase which was bought at no meaner a rate than the Blood of the Son of God, and then you cannot but mind the great salvation which God hath ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider on what terms you neglect it, or what the things are for whose sake you are so great enemies to your own salvation. Have you ever found that contentment in sin or the vanities of the World, that for the sake of them, you are willing to be for ever miserable? What will you think of all your debaucheries, and your neglects of God and your selves, when you come
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:101601:107"/>
to die? what would you then (if it were in your power to redeem your lost time) that you had spent your time less to the satisfaction of your sensual desires, and more in seeking to please God? How uncomfortable will the remembrance be of all your excesses, oaths, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and profaneness, when death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and judgement follows it? What peace of mind will there then be to those who have served God with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and have endeavoured to <hi>work out their salvation,</hi> though it hath been <hi>with fear and trembling?</hi> But <hi>what would it</hi> then <hi>profit a man to have gained the whole World, and to lose his own Soul?</hi> Nay, what unspeakable losers must they then be, that lose their Souls for that which hath no value at all, if compared with the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Consider what follows upon this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, not only the loss of great salvation, but the incurring as great damnation for it. The Scripture describes the miseries of the life to come, not meerly by negatives, but by the most sensible and painful things. If destruction be dreadful, what is <hi>everlasting destruction?</hi> if the anguish of the soul, and the pains of the body be so troublesome, what will <hi>the destruction be
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101601:108"/>
both of Body and Soul in Hell?</hi> If a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent gnawing in our bowels be a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of an insupportable misery here, what will that be of <hi>the Worm that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies</hi>? if a raging and devouring fire, which can last but till it hath consumed a fading substance, be in its appearance so amazing, and in its pain so violent, what then will the enduring be of that wrath of God, which shall burn like fire, and yet be everlasting? Consider then of these things, while God gives you time to consider of them; and think it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable mercy that you have yet time to repent of your sins, to beg mercy at the hands of God, to redeem your time, to depart from iniquity, to be frequent in Prayer, careful of your Actions, and in all things obedient to the will of God, and so God will pardon your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer neglects, and grant you this great salvation.</p>

            <p>IT hath never yet been so well with the World, and we have no great reason to hope it ever will be so; that the best of things, or of men, should meet with entertainment in it, suitable to their own worth and excellency. If it were once to be hoped, that all Mankind would be wise and sober, that their judgments
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101601:109"/>
would be according to the truth of things, and their actions suitable to their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; we might then reasonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that nothing would be valued so much as true goodness, nothing so much in contempt and disgrace as impiety and profaneness. But if we find it much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise in the Age we live in, we have so much the less cause to wonder at it; because it hath been thus, in those times we might have thought would have been far better than our own. I mean those times and ages, wherein there were not only great things first spoken and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Mankind, but examples as great as the things themselves; but these did so little prevail on the stupid and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful world, that they among whom the <hi>Son of God</hi> did first manifest himself, seem'd only solicitous to make good one Prophesie concerning him, <hi>viz. That he should be despised and rejected of men.</hi> And they who suffer'd their malice to live as long he did, were not contented to let it dye with him; but their fury increases as the Gospel does: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it had spread it self, they pursue it with all the rude clamours, and violent persecutions which themselves or their factors could raise against it. This we
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:101601:109"/>
have a large testimony of, in those <hi>Iewish</hi> Christians to whom this Epistle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; who had no sooner embraced the Christian Religion, but they were set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a whole army of persecutors, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32. <hi>But call to remembrance the former days, in which after ye were illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, ye endured a great fight of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</hi> As though the great enemy of souls, and therefore of Christians, had watched the first opportunity to make the strongest impression upon them, while they were yet young and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced; and therefore less able to resist so sharp an encounte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. He had found how unsuccessful the offer of the good things of this World had been with their Lord and Master; and therefore was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to try what a severer course would do with all his followers. But the same spirit by which he despised <hi>all the Glories of the World,</hi> which the Tempter would have made him believe he was the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of, enabled them with a mighty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and strange transports of joy, not only to bear their own share of reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and afflictions, but a part of theirs who suffer'd with them, <hi>v.</hi> 33, 34. But lest through continual duty, occasion'd by the hatred of their persecutors, and the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:101601:110"/>
multitude of their afflictions; their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage should abate, and their spirits faint; the Apostle finds it necessary, not only to put them in mind of their former magnanimity; but to make use of all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that might be powerful with them, to keep up the same vigour and constancy of mind in bearing their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, which they had at first. For he well knew, how much it would tend to the dishonour of the Gospel, as well as to their own discomfort; if after such an early proof of a great and undaunted spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it should be said of them, as was once of a great <hi>Roman</hi> Captain, <hi>Vltima Primis cedebant</hi>; that they should decline in their reputation as they did in their years; and at last sink under that weight of duty which they had born with so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour before. Therefore, as a General in the Field, after a sharp and fierce encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at first, with a mighty resolution by his Souldiers; when he finds by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and fresh recruits of the enemy, that his smaller forces are like to be born down before them; and through mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:101601:110"/>
courage they had already expressed, by their own interest, and the example of their Leaders, by the hopes of glory, and the fears of punishment, that they would bear the last shock of their enemies force, and rather be the Trophies of their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage than of their Triumphs: so does our Apostle, when he finds some among them begin to debate, whether they had best to stand it out or no; he conjures them, 1. By the remembrance of their own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courage, whereby they did bear as sharp tryals as these could be, with the greatest chearfulness and constancy; and what could they gain by yielding at last, but great dishonour to themselves, that they had suffer'd so long to no purpose, unless it were to discover their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and inconstancy. 2. By the hopes of a reward which would surely follow their faithfulness; <hi>v.</hi> 35, 36. <hi>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:</hi> and the <hi>time will not be long</hi> ere ye come to enjoy it, <hi>v.</hi> 37. but <hi>if ye draw back,</hi> you lose all your former labours, for he who alone is able to recompence you, hath said, <hi>that if any man draw back, my

soul shall have no pleasure in him,</hi> v. 38. and then from the example of himself, and all the genuine followers of Christ, <hi>but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul,</hi> v. 39. But lest these examples should not be enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them; he conjures them by the name of all those who were as eminent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And could there be a greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to the clearness of that light we enjoy above them, if we only grew fainter by it? And therefore in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter he encourages them by that army of Martyrs which had gone before them, <hi>by that Cloud of witnesses</hi> which did both direct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh them, that they would <hi>lay aside e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing which was apt to oppress or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten them, but especially their sinful fears, which they were so easily betray'd by, and so run with patience the race that was

But, saith he, if none of these will prevail with you, there is an example yet behind, that ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others to heighten your courage, and that is, of the <hi>Captain of your salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the author and finisher of your faith,</hi> under whom you serve, and from whom you expect your reward; and as <hi>Caesar</hi> once said to his Souldiers, when he saw them ready to retreat out of the field, <hi>Videte quem, &amp; quo loco Imperatorem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serturi estis.</hi> Remember what kind of General you forsake, and in what place you leave him: one whom you have vow'd your lives and your service to, one who hath thought nothing too dear, which was to be done for your good, one that will be ready to reward the least ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you can do for him, one that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to assist you to the utmost in what you undertake, one that hath already un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone far more for your sakes, than ever you can do for his; therefore, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary, and faint in your minds.</hi>

            <p>In which words we have represented to us, the unparallel'd example of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and patience under sufferings, in our Lord and Saviour; and the great
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:101601:112"/>
influence that it ought to have on all those who are call'd by his Name, that they would not dishonour so excellent a pattern of enduring sufferings, by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or dejection of mind. Christianity is a Religion which above all others does arm men against all the contingencies and miseries of the life of man: yea, it makes them serviceable to the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous purposes that the greatest blessings can be designed for. It raises the minds of men higher than barely to consider the common condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, the unavoidableness of such things which are out of our own power, and the unreasonableness of tormenting our selves about the things which are so, and that most mens conditions in the world as to their contentment, depends more upon their minds, than their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumstances; though these are things very fit for us as men to consider and make use of; yet they dot not reach to that height, which the consideration of a life to come, and the tendency of all our sufferings here to the inhance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our future glory may raise us to. Especially considering not only the weight of the arguments in themselves, but the force they receive from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:101601:112"/>
of him, <hi>who for the joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> By which mighty instance we find, that the sufferings of this life are so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconsistent with the joys of another, that he who is <note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb. 2.10.</note> 
               <hi>the Captain of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was made perfect through sufferings,</hi> and therefore none of his followers have cause to be dejected under them. But that we may the better understand the force of this argument, we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What those things were which he endured.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From whom he suffer'd them; <hi>it was the contradiction of sinners against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In what way and manner he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For what ends he did it. And when we have considered these, we shall see the influence this example of Christ's suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings ought to have upon our constancy and patience: which will be the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful improvement of it to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What those things were</hi> which Christ endured; which are here comprehended under those words, <hi>the contradiction of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101601:113"/>
sinners.</hi> It is agreed by the best Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> that under this phrase of <hi>the contradictio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of sinners,</hi> the whole History of our Saviour's suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings is comprehended. All the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, reproaches, false accusations, all the cruelties, indignities, and violence, which were offer'd him, from the time of his publick appearance to his expiring upon the Cross, being undergone by him, by the malice of unreasonable men, may be call'd <hi>the contradiction of sinners.</hi> For the sense of this word extends as well to actions as words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the sum of all that which our Saviour suffer'd from them, may be reduced under these heads. 1. The ill entertainment of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. 2. The disparagement of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. 3. The violence offer'd to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ill entertainment of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; which must needs seem very strange to those who do not consider what a difficult access the clearest reason hath to the minds of such who are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by interest and prejudice. Though all the the Prophesies concerning the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> were fulfilled in him; though the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of the people were great at that time concerning the appearance of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:101601:113"/>
him that was to redeem his people; tho' all the characters of time, place, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, did fully agree to what was foretold by the Prophets; though his Doctrine were as becoming the Son of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, as the sons of men to receive; though the unspotted innocency of his life was so great, as made him weary of his own that betray'd him: yet because he came not with the pomp and splendor which they expected, they despise his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, revile his Doctrine, persecute his Followers, and contrive his ruin. What could have been imagined more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, which had waited long in expectation of the <hi>Messias</hi> coming, should have welcom'd his approach with the greatest joy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Message he brought with a kindness only short of that which he shewed in coming among them? Was it nothing to be eased of that heavy burden of the Ceremonial Law, which neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear? and that God was willing to exchange the chargeable and troublesome service of the Temple, for the more reasonable and spiritual Worship of himself? Was it nothing to have the Promises of a Land which now groaned under the weight of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:101601:114"/>
its oppressions, turned into those of an eternal state of bliss and immortality? and to change the Lamps of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the glorious appearance of the Son of Righteousness? Was it nothing to have an offer of Peace and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God made them, after they had suffer'd so much under the fury of his displeasure? Was a meer temporal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance by some mighty Conquerour from the subjection they were in to the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, so much more valuable a thing, than an eternal redemption from the powers of Hell and the Grave? Are the pomps and vanities of this present life, such great things in God's account, that it was not possible for his Son to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear without them? Nay, how unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble had it been for one who came to preach humility, patience, self-denyal, and contempt of the world, to have made ostentation of the State and Grandeur of it? So that either he must have changed his Doctrine, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himself lyable to the suspicion of seeking to get this world by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of another. And if his Doctrine had been of another kind, he might have been esteemed a great person among the <hi>Iews,</hi> but not the Son of God, or the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:101601:114"/>
               <hi>Messias, in whom all Nations of the Earth should be blessed.</hi> Which surely they would never have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to have been, in one, who must have subdued the neighbour Nations to advance the honour of his own. But since the Son of God thought fit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in another manner than they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him, they thought themselves too great to be saved by so mean a Saviour. If he had made all the Kingdoms of the Earth to have bowed under him, and the Nations about them to have been all tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries to them; if <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had been made the Seat of an Empire as great as the World it self, they would then have gloried in his Name, and entertained whatever he had said, whether true or false, with a wonderful Veneration. But Truth in an humble dress meets with few admirers; they could not imagine so much Power and Majesty could ever shroud it self under so plain a disguise. Thus Christ <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 John 11.</note> 
               <hi>came to his own, and his own received him not.</hi> Yea, those that should have known him the best of all others; those who frequently conversed with him, and heard him <hi>speak as never man spake,</hi> and saw him do what never man did, were yet so blinded by the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

of his Parentage and Education, that they baffle their own Reason, and persist in their Infidelity, because they knew the place and manner of his breeding; the names of his Mother and his Brethren and Sisters; <note n="(a)" place="margin">Matt. 3.55, 56.</note>

            <p n="2">2. The disparagement of his Miracles. Since the bare proposal of his Doctrine, though never so reasonable, could not prevail with them to believe him to be the Son of God, he offers them a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof of it by the mighty works which were wrought by him. And though the more ingenuous among them were ready to acknowledge, <note n="(b)" place="margin">John 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>that no man could do the things which he did, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less God were with him:</hi> yet they who were resolved to hear and see, and not understand; when they found it not for their credit, to deny matters of fact so universally known attested, they seek all the means to blast the reputation of them that may be. Sometimes raising popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar insinuations against him, that he was a man of no austere life, a friend of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Sinners, one that could choose

no other day to do his works on, but that very day wherein God himself did rest from his; and therefore no great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard was to be had to what such a one did. When these arts would not take, but the people found the benefit of his Miracles, in healing the sick, curing the blind and the lame, feeding the hungry; then they undervalue all these in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison with the wonders that were wrought by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wilderness. If he would have made the Earth to open her mouth, and swallow up the City and the power of <hi>Rome;</hi> if he would have fed a mighty Army with bread from Heaven, in stead of feeding some few thousands with very small Provisions; if in stead of raising one <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Grave, he would have raised up their <hi>Sampson's,</hi> and their <hi>David's,</hi> their men of spirit and conduct, whose very presence would have put a new life into the hearts of the people; if in stead of casting out <hi>Devils,</hi> he would have cast out the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> whom they hated the worse of the two: if he would have set himself to the cure of a distempered State, instead of healing the maladies of some few incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable persons: if instead of being at the expense of a Miracle to pay tribute,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:101601:116"/>
he would have hinder'd them from paying any at all; then a <hi>Second Moses</hi> would have been too mean a title for him, he could have been no less than the promised <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> the <hi>Son of God.</hi> But while he imploy'd his power another way, the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it made them hate him the more; since they thought with themselves what strange things they would have done with it for the benefit of their Country; and therefore express the greatest malice against him, because he would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it as they would have him. From thence, they condemn his Miracles as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some effects of a Magical skill; and say, he dispossessed the lesser <hi>Devils</hi> by the power of him that was the <hi>Prince</hi> among them. So unworthy a requital did they make for all the mighty works which had been done among them; <hi>Which,</hi> as our Saviour saith,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 11.21.</note> 
               <hi>if they had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</hi>

This <hi>Iudas</hi> undertakes, knowing the place and season of his Masters retirements, not far from the City, where they might with the greatest secrecy and safety seize upon his person. Which contrivance of theirs our Saviour was not at all ignorant of; but prepares himself and his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for this great encounter. He insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes his solemn Supper, to be perpetually observed in remembrance of his death and sufferings, after which he discourses admirably with his Disciples, to arm them against their future sufferings; and prays that most divine Prayer, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. which he had no sooner finished, but he goes with his Disciples to the usual place of his retirement in a <hi>Garden</hi> at the foot of the <hi>Mount of Olives.</hi> And now begins the blackest Scene of sufferings that ever was acted upon humane Nature.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:101601:117"/>
Which was so great, that the Son of God himself expresseth a more than usual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of it; which he discovered by the <hi>Agony</hi> he was in, in which he sweat <note n="(a)" place="margin">Luk. 22.44.</note> 
               <hi>drops of blood</hi>; by the earnestness of his Prayer, falling upon his knees, and praying thrice, saying, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Mat. 26.39.</note> 
               <hi>O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Surely, this Cup must needs have a great deal of bitterness in it, which the Son of God was so earnest to be freed from. If there had been nothing in it but what is commonly incident to humane Nature, as to the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of death or pain, it seems strange, that he who had the greatest innocency, the most perfect charity, the freest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation of himself, the fullest assurance of the reward to come, should express a greater sense of the horror of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, than thousands did, who suffer'd for his sake.

To accuse the <hi>Son of God</hi> for Blasphemy, in saying, he was so, is as unjust as to condemn a <hi>King</hi> for treason, because he saith he is a <hi>King:</hi> they ought to have examined the grounds on which he call'd himself so; and if he had not given pregnant evidences of it, then to have passed sentence upon him as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor and Blasphemer.

more inquisitive into what he had affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but they allow him not the liberty of a fair tryal, they hasten and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the sentence, that they might do so the execution. If he were condemned as a false Prophet; (for that seems to be the occasion of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> meeting to do it, to whom the cognisance of that did particularly belong) why do they not mention what it was he had foretold, which had not come to pass; or what reason do they give why he had usurped such an Office to himself? If no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty were allowed under pain of death for any to say, that they were sent from God, how was it possible for the <hi>Messias</hi> ever to appear, and not be condemned? for the expectation of him was, that he should be a great person immediately sent from God, for the delivery of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

he comes, he discourses about these things, takes every oportunity that might be improved for that end, refuses no company he might do good upon, and converses not with them with the pride and arrogance of either the <hi>Pharisees</hi> or <hi>Philosophers,</hi> but with the greatest meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, humility and patience.

For it is not only who, or what, but in what manner he endured the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of sinners, that we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, to prevent sainting and dejection of mind. So another Apostle tells us, <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.21, 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>That Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow his steps; who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth; who when he was reviled, reviled not again: when he suffered, he threatned not, but committed himself to him that judged righteously.</hi> He uses none of those ranting expressions which none of the patientest persons in the world were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to; of bidding them <hi>laugh in Phalaris his Bull</hi>; and when they were racked with pains, to cry out, <hi>Nil agis dolor:</hi> he tells them not, that it is their duty to have no sense of torments, and to be jocund and pleasant when their flesh is torn from them, or nailed to a Cross; if this be any kind of fortitude, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that of a <hi>Gladiator</hi> than of a wise man or a Christian.

for himself to them, yet he pleads for them to God; <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> How much more divine was this, than the admired <hi>Theramenes</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who being condemned to die by the thirty <hi>Tyrants,</hi> when he was drinking off his cup of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, said, <hi>he drank that to Critias,</hi> one of his most bitter enemies, and hoped he would pledge it shortly. <hi>Socrates</hi> seemed not to express seriousness enough at least, when he bid one of his friends, when he was dying, offer up a Cock to <hi>Aesculapius</hi> for his deliverance. <hi>Aristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and <hi>Phocion</hi> among the <hi>Greeks</hi> came the nearest to our Saviour's tempe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which though as far as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments were concerned in it, we have given an account of already; yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the particular management of this grand affair by the care of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a higher account must be given of it, why so divine and excellent a Person should be exposed to all the contempt and reproach imaginable, and after being made a Sacrifice to the tongues and rods of the people, then to dye a painfull and ignominious death? So that allowing but that common care of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which all sober <hi>Heathens</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, so transcendent Sufferings as these were, of so holy and innocent a person, ought to be accounted for, in a more than ordinary manner; when they thought themselves concerned to vindicate the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:101601:126"/>
of God's Providence in the common calamities of those who are reputed to be better than the generality of Mankind. But the reasons assigned in that common case will not hold here, since this was a person immediately sent from God upon a particular message to the World, and therefore might plead an exemption by virtue of his Ambassage from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon arrests and troubles of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But it was so far otherwise, as tho' God had designed him on purpose to let us see how much mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ery humane nature can undergo. Some think themselves to go as far as their reason will permit them; when they tell us, that he suffer'd all these things <hi>to confirm the truth of what he had said,</hi> and particularly <hi>the Promise of Remission of sins,</hi> and that <hi>he might be an example to others, who should go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by suffering afterwards,</hi> and that <hi>he might, being touched with the feeling of our infirmities here, have the greater pity upon us now he is in Heaven.</hi> All these I grant to have been true and weighty reasons of the Sufferings of Christ, in subordination to greater ends; but if there had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond all this, I can neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand why he should suffer so deeply as he did, nor why the Scripture should
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:101601:127"/>
insist upon a far greater reason more than upon any of these? I grant, the death of Christ did confirm the truth of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as far as it is unreasonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that any one who knew his Doctrine to be false, would make himself misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make others believe it; but if this had been all intended, why would not an easier and less ignominious death have served? since he who would be willing to dye to confirm a falshood, would not be thought to confirm a truth by his death, because it was painful and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Why, if all his Sufferings were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as a testimony to others, of the truth of what he spake, were the greatest of his Sufferings, such as none could know the anguish of them but himself, I mean his <hi>Agony</hi> in the Garden, and that which made him cry out upon the Cross; <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Why were not his Miracles enough to confirm the truth of his Doctrine? since the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> was received without his death, by the evidence his Miracles gave that he was sent from God; since the Doctrine of remission of sins had been already deliver'd by the Prophets, and received by the People of the <hi>Iews</hi>; since those who would not believe for his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles

sake, neither would they believe though they should have seen him ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e from the Grave, and therefore not surely because they saw him put into it. But of all things, the manner of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s sufferings seems least designed to bring the World to the belief of his Doctrine, which was the main obstacle to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of it among the men of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est reputation for wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For it was <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.23.</note> 
               <hi>Christ crucified, which was to the Iews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness.</hi> Had the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles only preached that the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> had appeared from Heaven, and discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the only way to bring men thither, that he assumed our Nature for a time to render himself capable of conversing with us, and therein had wrought many strange and stupendious miracles; but after he had sufficiently acquainted the World with the nature of his Doctrine, he was again assumed up into Heaven; in all probability, the Doctrine might have been so easily received by the World, as might have saved the lives of many thousand persons, who dyed as <hi>Martyrs</hi> for it. And if it had been neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that some must have dyed to confirm it, why must the Son of God himself do
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:101601:128"/>
it? when he had so many Disciples who willingly sacrificed their lives for him, and whose death would on that account have been as great a confirmation of the truth of it as his own. But if it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged further, <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Quod caetera eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am foedera c. so ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mali ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo sanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, &amp; san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine ejus confirmari solerent.</hi> Crell. c. Grot. ad Cap. 1. p. 29.</note> 
               <hi>that God now entring into a Covenant with man for the pardon of sin, the shedding of the blood of Christ was necessary as a federal rite to confirm it.</hi> I answer, if only as a federal rite, why no cheaper blood would serve to confirm it but that of the Son God? We never read that any Covenant was confirmed by the death of one of the contracting parties; and we cannot think that God was so prodigal of the blood of his Son, to have it shed only in allusion to some ancient customs. But if there were such a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of alluding to them, why might not the blood of any other person have done it? when yet all that custom was no more, but that a sacrifice should be offer'd, and upon the parts of the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice divided, they did solemnly swear and and ratifie their Covenant. <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                  <hi>V. Heins. not. ad Sil.</hi> p. 9, 10.</note> And if this be yielded them, it then follows from this custom, that Christ must be consider'd as a <hi>sacrifice</hi> in his death; and so the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Covenant must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to that oblation which he made
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:101601:128"/>
of himself upon the Cross. Besides, how incongruous must this needs be, that the death of Christ the most innocent person in the World, without any respect to the guilt of sin, should suffer so much on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to assure us, that God will pardon those who are guilty of it? May we not much rather infer the contrary, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the holiness and justice of God's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if he dealt so severely <hi>with the green tree, how much more will he with the dry</hi>? If one so innocent suffer'd so much, what then may the guilty expect? If a Prince should suffer the best subject he hath to be severely punished, could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any imagine that it was with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to assure them that he would pardon the most rebellious? No; but would it not rather make men afraid of being too innocent, for fear of suffering too much for it? And those who seem very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preserve the honour of God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, in not punishing one for another's faults, ought likewise to maintain it in the punishing of one who had no fault at all to answer for. And to think to escape this by saying, <hi>That to such a person such things are calamities, but no punishments,</hi> is to revive the ancient exploded Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism, which thought to reform the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:101601:129"/>
of Mankind by meer changing the names of things, though never so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common sense of humane nature: which judges of the nature of punishments by the evils men undergo, and the ends they are designed for. And by the very same reason that God might exercise his dominion on so innocent a person as our Saviour was, without any respect to sin <hi>as the moving cause to it,</hi> he might lay eternal torments on a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Creature (for degrees and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance do not alter the reason of things) and then escape with the same evasion, that this was no act of injustice in God, because it was a meer exercise of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And when once a sinner comes to be perswaded by this that God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, it must be by the hopes that God will shew kindness to the guilty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he shews so little to the innocent; and if this be agreeable to the Justice and Holiness of God's nature, it is hard to say what is repugnant to it. If to this it be said, <hi>That Christ's consent made it no unjust exercise of Dominion in God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him:</hi> it is easily answered, that the same consent will make it less injustice in God to lay the punishment of our sins upon Christ, upon his undertaking to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:101601:129"/>
for us; for then the consent suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses a meritorious cause of punishment; but in this case the consent implyeth none at all. And we are now enquiring into the reasons of such sufferings, and consequently of such a consent; which cannot be imagined but upon very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty motives, such as might make it just in him to consent, as well as in God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be thought that all the design of the sufferings of Christ, was <hi>to give us an example</hi> and an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to suffer our selves; though it does so in a very great measure, as appears by the Text it self. For the hopes of an eternal reward for these short and light afflictions, ought to be encouragement enough, to go through the miseries of of this life in expectation of a better to come. And the <hi>Cloud of Witnesses</hi> both under the Law and the Gospel, of those who have suffer'd for righteousness sake, ought to make no one think it strange, if he must endure that, which so many have done before him, and been crowned for it. And lastly, to question whether <hi>Christ could have pity enough upon us in our sufferings,</hi> unless he had suffer'd so deeply himself; will lead men to distrust
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:101601:130"/>
the pity and compassion of Almighty God, because he was never capable of suffering, as we do. But the <hi>Scripture</hi> is very plain and full (to all those who rack not their minds to pervert it) in assigning a higher reason than all these of the <hi>sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ, viz.</hi> That <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18.</note>

Not as though Christ did suffer the very same which we should have suffer'd, for that was eternal death as the consequent of guilt in the person of the Offender, and then the discharge must have been immediately consequent upon the payment, and no room had been left for the freeness of remission, or for the conditions required on our parts; But that God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to accept of the death of his Son, <hi>as a full, perfect, sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for the sins of the World</hi>; as our Church expresseth it; and in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the sufferings of his Son, is pleased to offer pardon of sin upon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:101601:131"/>
repentance, and eternal life upon a holy obedience to his will. Thus much for the things we are to consider concerning <hi>the contradiction of sinners which Christ endured against himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing now remains, but the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that ought to have upon us, lest we be weary and faint in our minds. For which end I shall suggest two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The vast disproportion between Christ's sufferings and ours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The great encouragement we have from his sufferings, to bear our own the better.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The vast Disproportion between Christ's sufferings and our own. Our lot is fallen into suffering times; and we are apt enough to complain of it. I will not say it is wholly true of us, what the <hi>Moralist</hi> saith generally of the complaints of men, <hi>Non quia dura sed quia molles patimur</hi>; that it is not the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our conditions so much as the softness of our spirits which makes us complain of them. For I must needs say, this <hi>City</hi> hath smarted by such a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and succession of judgments which few Cities in the World could parallel in so short a time. The Plague hath
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:101601:131"/>
emptied its houses, and the fire consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them; the War exhausted our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and it were well if Peace recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them. But still these are but the common calamities of humane nature, things that we ought to make account of in the World, and to grow the better by them. And it were happy for this City, if our thankfulness and obedience were but answerable to the mercies we yet enjoy: let us not make our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worse by our fears; nor our fears greater than they need to be: for no enemy can be so bad as they. Thanks be to God our condition is much better at present than it hath been; let us not make it worse by fearing it may be so. Complaints will never end till the World does; and we may imagine that will not last much longer; when the City thinks it hath trade enough, and the Country riches enough. But I will not go about to perswade you that your condition is better than it is, for I know it is to no purpose to do so; all men will believe as they feel. But suppose our condition were much worse than it is; yet what were all our sufferings compared with those of our Saviour for us? the sins that make us smart, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101601:132"/>
him much deeper; they pierced his side, which only touch our skin, we have no cause to complain of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness of that Cup which he hath drunk off the dregs of already. We lament over the ruins of a City, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived with any hopes of seeing it rise out of the dust; but Christ saw the ruins that sin caused in all mankind, he undertook the repairing them, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men into a better condition than before: And we may easily think what a difficult task he had of it; when he came to restore them who were deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their ruins, and thought themselves too good to be mended. It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our miseries, (if they be only in this life) that we know they cannot last long; but that is the great aggravation of our Saviour's sufferings, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of sinners continues against him still. Witness, the <hi>Atheism,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so properly call it, as the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism</hi> of this present Age; wherein so many profane persons act over again the part of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi>; they slight his Doctrine, despise his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, disparage his Miracles, contemn his Precepts, and undervalue his Sufferings. Men live as if it were in defiance to his
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:101601:132"/>
holy Laws; as though they feared not what God can do, so much as to need a <hi>Mediator</hi> between him and them. If e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men <hi>tread under foot the Son of God,</hi> it is when they think themselves to be above the need of him; if ever they count <hi>the blood of the Covenant an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy thing,</hi> it is not only when they do not value it as they ought, but when they exercise their profane wits upon it. <hi>Blessed Saviour!</hi> was it not enough for thee to bear the contradiction of sinners upon Earth; but thou must still suffer so much at the hands of those whom thou diedst for, that thou mightest bring them to Heaven? was it not enough for thee to be betrayed on Earth, but thou must be defied in Heaven? was it not enough for thee to stoop so low for our sakes, but that thou shouldest be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on because thou didst it? was the ignominious death upon the Cross too small a thing for thee to suffer in thy Person, unless thy Religion be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and exposed to as much shame and mockery as thy self was? Unhappy we, that live to hear of such things! but much more unhappy if any of our sins have been the occasion of them: If our unsuitable lives to the Gospel have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:101601:133"/>
the mouths of any against so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Religion. If any malice and revenge, any humour and peevishness, any pride or hypocrisie, any sensuality and voluptuousness, any injustice, or too much love of gain, have made others despise that Religion which so many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, and so few practise. If we have been in any measure guilty of this, as we love our Religion, and the honour of our Saviour, let us endeavour by the holiness and meekness of our spirits, the temperance and justice of our actions, the patience and contentedness of our minds, to recover the honour of that Religion which only can make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and our Posterity after us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What Encouragement we have from the sufferings of Christ, to bear our own the better; because we see by his example that God deals no more hardly with us, than he did with his own Son, if he lays heavy things upon us. Why should we think to escape, when his own Son underwent so much? if we meet with reproaches, and ill usage, with hard measure, and a mean conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with injuries and violence, with mockings and affronts, nay, with a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and a painful death, what cause have
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:101601:133"/>
we to complain, for did not the Son of God undergo all these things before us? If any of your Habitations have been consumed, that you have been put to your shifts where to lodge your selves, or your Families; consider, that <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 8.20.</note> 
               <hi>though the Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the Air have nests, yet the Son of Man had not whereon to lay his head.</hi> If your condition be mean and low, think of him,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Phil 2.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>who being in the form of God, took upon him the form of a servant</hi>; and <note n="(c)" place="margin">2 Cor. 8.9.</note> 
               <hi>though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that through his poverty ye might be made rich.</hi> If you are unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defamed and reproached, consider what contumelies and disgraces the Son of God underwent for you. If you are in pain and trouble, think of his Agony and bloody sweat, the nailing of his hands and feet to the Cross, to be a sacrifice for the expiation of your sins. Never think much of undergoing any thing, whereby <note n="(d)" place="margin">Rom. 8.29.</note> 
               <hi>you may be conformable to the Image of the Son of God,</hi> knowing this, <note n="(e)" place="margin">V. 17.</note> 
               <hi>that if ye suffer with him ye shall also be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified together.</hi> And you have never yet set a true estimate and value upon things, if you <note n="(f)" place="margin">V. 18.</note> 
               <hi>reckon the sufferings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life worthy to be compared with the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:101601:134"/>
glory which shall be revealed.</hi> Which <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> ought always to bear up our minds under our greatest afflictions here; and the thoughts of that, will easily bring us to the thoughts of his sufferings, who <note n="(b)" place="margin">Heb. 9.12.</note> 
               <hi>by his own blood purchased an eternal redemption for us.</hi> Therefore, <hi>consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary, and faint in your minds.</hi>

               </gap>han the <hi>Dishonour</hi> which was done to <hi>Religion</hi> by it. For if those things which were then acted among us, had been done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the most rude and barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though that had been enough to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:101601:135"/>
have made them for ever thought so; yet they might have been imputed to their ignorance in matters of <hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> but when they are committed not only by men who were called <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> but under a pretence of a mighty zeal for their <hi>Religion</hi> too, Men will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think that <hi>Religion</hi> bad, which did give encouragement to such actions, or those persons extremely wicked, who could make use of a pretence of it for things so contrary to its nature and design. And on which of these two the blame will fall, may be soon discovered, when we consider that the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, hath taken care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Rights of <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> by <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 22.21.</note>

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:101601:135"/>
               <hi>Liberties,</hi> and fought against the <hi>King</hi> for preservation of his <hi>Person.</hi> But the actions of such Men could not have been so bad as they were, unless their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences had been so great; for there can be no highter aggravation of a wicked action, than for Men to seem to be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in the doing of it. If the <hi>Devil</hi> himself were to preach sedition to the world, he would never appear otherwise than as an <hi>Angel of Light:</hi> his pretence would be Unity, when he designed the greatest Divisions; and the preservation of Authority, when he laid the seeds of Rebellion. But we might as well imagine that <hi>the God of this World</hi> (as the <hi>Devil</hi> is sometime called) should advance no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Peace and Holiness in it, as that <hi>Christianity</hi> should give the least counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to what is contrary to either of them. Yet the wickedness of Men hath been so great upon earth, as to call down Heaven it self to justifie their impieties, and when they have found themselves unable to bear the burden of them, they would fain make <hi>Religion</hi> do it.</p>
            <p>Such as these we have a description of in this short, but smart Epistle, <hi>viz</hi> Men who pretend inspirations and impulses for the greatest villainies; who believed it a

with the time of writing this Epistle, I should then have thought that this had been the Rebellion here spoken of; for all the Actors in it were destroyed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, and some of the chief of them made publick examples of Justice for the deterring of others from the like practices. But however this be, we find these persons here charged with a sin of the same nature, with the gainsaying of <hi>Corah,</hi> and a judgment of the same nature, as the consequent of the sin; <hi>for they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the gainsaying, &amp;c.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we shall consider the words,</p>

            <p n="2">2. The Judgment that was inflicted upon them for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For understanding the nature of the Faction, we must enquire into the design
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101601:138"/>
that was laid, the persons that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, the pretences that were made use of for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>design</hi> that was laid for that, and all other circumstances of the story, we must have resort to the account that is given of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. where we shall find that the bottom of the design was the sharing of the Government among themselves, which it was impossible for them to hope for, as long as <hi>Moses</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as a <hi>King in Iesurun,</hi> for so he is called, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.5. Him therefore they intend to lay aside, but this they knew to be a very difficult task, considering what wonders <hi>God</hi> had wrought by him in their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> what wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he had hitherto shewed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of them, what care for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, what integrity in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his power, what reverence the people did bear towards him, and what solemn vows and promises they had made of obedience to him. But ambitious and factious Men are never discouraged by such an appearance of difficulties; for they know they must address themselves to the people, and in the first place per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them that they manage their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest against the usurpation of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:101601:138"/>
For by that means they gain upon the peoples affections, who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cry them up presently as the true <hi>Patriots</hi> and Defenders of their <hi>Liberties</hi> against the encroachment of <hi>Princes:</hi> and when they have thus insinuated themselves into the good opinion of the people, groundless suspicions, and unreasonable fears and jealousies will pass for arguments and demonstrations. Then they who can invent the most popular lies against the Government are accounted the Men of integrity, and they who most diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spread the most infamous reports, are the Men of honesty, because they are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest from being <hi>Flatterers</hi> of the <hi>Court.</hi> The people take a strange pride, as well as pleasure, in hearing and telling all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aults of their <hi>Governours;</hi> for in doing so they flatter themselves in thinking they deserve to rule much better than those which do it. And the willingness they have to think so of themselves, makes them misconstrue all the actions of their <hi>Superiours</hi> to the worse sense, and then they find out plots in every thing, upon the people. Whatever is done for the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry maintenance of <hi>Government,</hi> is suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a design meerly to exhaust the people to make them more unable to resist.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:101601:139"/>
If good Laws be made, these are said by factious men to be only intended for snares for the good people, but others may break them and go unpunished. If Government be strict and severe, then it is cruel and tyrannical; if mild and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent, then it is remiss and negligent. If <hi>Laws</hi> be executed, then the peoples Liberties be oppressed; if not, then it were better not to make <hi>Laws,</hi> than not to see them executed. If there be Wars, the people are undone by Taxes; if there be Peace, they are undone by Plenty. If extraordinary Judgments befall them, then they lament the sins of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and of the Times, and scarce think of their own. If miscarriages hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen (as it is impossible always to prevent them) they charge the form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them, which all sorts are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to. Nay, it is seldom that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours escape with their own faults, the peoples are often laid upon them too. So here, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Moses</hi> is charged with not carrying them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> when it was their own sins which kept them thence. Yea, so partial have the people generally been against their <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> when swayed by the power of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that this hath made Government
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:101601:139"/>
very difficult and unpleasing; for what ever the actions of <hi>Princes</hi> are, they are liable to the censures of the people. Their bad actions being more publick, and their good therefore suspected of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; and the wiser Governours are, the more jealous the people are of them. For always the weakest part of mankind are the most suspicious; the less they understand things, the more designs they imagine are laid for them, and the best counsels are the soonest rejected by them. So that the wisest <hi>Government</hi> can never be secure from the jealousies of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they that will raise a Faction against it will never want a party to side with them. For when could we ever have imagined a Government more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be free from this, than that which <hi>Moses</hi> had over the people of <hi>Israel?</hi> He being an extraordinary person for all the abilities of <hi>Government;</hi> one bred up in the <hi>Egyptian Court,</hi> and in no mean degree of honour, being called the Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter; one of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the management of affairs, of great zeal for the good of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as appeared by the tenderness of his peoples interest in their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> one of great temper and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness☞

and then they doubted not but such zealous <hi>Patriots</hi> as they had shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, should come to have the greatest share in it; but this which they most aimed at, must appear least in view, and only <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> must seem to cast that upon them, which was the first true motive they had to rebel against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Liberty,</hi> and a <hi>right to Power,</hi> is inseparable from the people; <hi>liberta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis patrocinium suscipiunt,</hi> saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Corah</hi> and his company; and I believe

               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this kind of <hi>Liberty</hi> that ever were in the world. And happy had it been for us in this Nation, if <hi>Corah</hi> had never found any Disciples in it. For what a blessed <hi>Liberty</hi> was this which <hi>Corah</hi> aimed at, <hi>viz.</hi> to change one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prince, as <hi>Moses</hi> was, for 250 <hi>Tyrants,</hi> besides <hi>Corah</hi> and the Sons of <hi>Reuben?</hi> What just and equal liberty was it which <hi>Moses</hi> did deprive them of? It was only the <hi>Liberty</hi> of destroying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which all the power he had could hardly keep them from. Could there be any greater <hi>Liberty</hi> than delivering them out of the house of bondage? and was not <hi>Moses</hi> the great Instrument in effecting it? Could there be greater <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> than for their whole Nation to be preserved from all the designs of their enemies to enjoy their own <hi>Laws,</hi> and matters of <hi>Iustice</hi> to be duly administred amongst them? and had they not all these under the Government of <hi>Moses?</hi> What means then this Out-cry for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?</hi> Is it that they would have had no <hi>Government</hi> at all among them, but that every one might have done what he pleased himself? This indeed were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable <hi>Liberty,</hi> if a man could have it
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:101601:146"/>
alone: but when every one thinks that he is but one, though he be free; and every one else is as free as he, but though their <hi>freedom</hi> be equal to his, his <hi>Power</hi> is not equal to theirs; and therefore to bring things to a more just proportion, every one must part with some power for a great deal of security. If any man can imagine himself in such a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> which some improperly call a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> let him consider, whether the contentment he could take in his own liberty and power to defend himself, would ballance the fears he would have of the injury which others in the same state might be able to do him. Not that I think meer <hi>fear</hi> made men at first enter into Societies, for there is a natural inclination in mankind to it, and one of the greatest pleasures of humane life lies in the enjoyment of it. But what other considerations incline men to, fear makes reasonable, though men part with some supposed liberty for the enjoyment of it. So that the utmost liberty is destroyed by the very nature of <hi>Government,</hi> and nothing can be more unreasonable than for men to quarrel with <hi>Government</hi> for that, which they cannot enjoy and the preservation of themselves together.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:101601:146"/>
Which alone makes the desire of <hi>Power</hi> reasonable, and if the preservation of our selves in our rights and properties may be had without it, all that the want of <hi>Liberty</hi> signifies, is, that men have all the conveniences of <hi>Power</hi> without the trouble and the cares of it. And if this be not a more desirable <hi>Liberty</hi> than the other, let any rational man judge. The pretence of <hi>Liberty</hi> then in this sense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Government,</hi> is, that men are <hi>Fools</hi> in taking the best care to preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that <hi>Laws</hi> are but instruments of <hi>Slavery,</hi> and every single man is better able to defend himself, than the united strength of a people in <hi>Society</hi> is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him. And this kind of <hi>Liberty</hi> we may justly think will be desired by none but mad-men, and beasts of prey. It follows then, that what <hi>Liberty</hi> is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with all <hi>Government,</hi> must never be pleaded against one sort of it. But is there then so great a degree of <hi>Liberty</hi> in one mode of <hi>Government</hi> more than another, that it should be thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to disturb <hi>Government,</hi> meerly to alter the form of it? Would it have been so much better for the people of <hi>Israel</hi> to have been governed by the 250 men here mentioned, than by <hi>Moses?</hi>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:101601:147"/>
Would not they have required the same subjection and obedience to themselves, though their commands had been much more unreasonable than his? What secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can there be that every one of these shall not be worse in all respects than him whom they were so willing to lay aside; and if one be thought troublesome, what <hi>Liberty</hi> and ease is there when their name is <hi>Legion?</hi> So that the folly of these po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular pretences is as great as the sin in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perswaded by them.</p>
            <p>And it may be they have not thought amiss who have attributed a great part of that disturbance of the Peace of <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> under a pretence of popular <hi>Government,</hi> to an unjust admiration of those <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, who have unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably set up <hi>Liberty</hi> in opposition to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi> But some of the wisest of them have given us a truer account of these things, and have told us, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible the <hi>Roman</hi> State could have been preserved longer, unless it had submitted to an <note n="(a)" place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>the name of popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is far more plausible, but the benefits
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:101601:147"/>
of Monarchy are far greater; it being much easier to find one good than many; and though one be accounted difficult, the other is almost impossible.</hi> And as he elsewhere well observes, <hi>the flourishing of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth depends upon its poverty;</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone able to unite the minds of the <hi>Governours,</hi> who in a plentiful state, not set about with enemies, will be grasping at their own private interests, and fall naturally from thence into divisions and animosities; but <hi>the flourishing of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy lies in the riches of it,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> having the same interest, and being rich or poor together. So that we see the notion of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of power in <hi>Government,</hi> is so far from being an inseperable property of the people, that the proper notion of it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with <hi>Government,</hi> and that which lies in the <hi>enjoyments of our Rights and Properties,</hi> is so far from being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that they are more advanced by that, than by any other way of Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another principle which tends to the subverting Government under a pretence of <hi>Liberty,</hi> is, that in case of <hi>Vsurpation</hi> upon the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> they may resume the exercise of <hi>Power,</hi> and punish
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:101601:148"/>
the <hi>Supreme Magistrate</hi> himself, if he be guilty of it. Than which there can be no principle imagined more destructive to civil <hi>Societies,</hi> and repugnant to the very nature of <hi>Government.</hi> For it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys all the obligations of Oaths and Compacts; it makes the solemnest bonds of obedience signifie nothing when the people shall think fit to declare it: it makes every prosperous <hi>Rebellion</hi> just; for no doubt when the power is in the <hi>Rebels</hi> hands, they will justifie themselves, and condemn their Soveraign. (And if <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> had succeeded in their Rebellion against <hi>Moses,</hi> no doubt they would have been called the <hi>Keepers</hi> of the <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi>) It makes all Government dangerous to the persons in whom it is, considering the unavoidable infirmities of it, and the readiness of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to misconstrue the actions of their <hi>Princes,</hi> and their incapacity to judge of them; it not being fit that the reasons of all counsels of Princes should be divulged by <hi>Proclamations.</hi> So that there can be nothing wanting to make <hi>Princes</hi> misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that the people want <hi>Power</hi> to make them so. And the supposition of this principle will unavoidably keep up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant jealousie between the <hi>Prince</hi> and his
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:101601:148"/>
people: for if he knows their minds, he will think it reasonable to secure himself by all means against their <hi>Power,</hi> and endeavour to keep them as unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist as may be: whereby all mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence between a <hi>Prince</hi> and his <hi>People</hi> will be destroyed: and there can be no such way to bring in an arbitrary <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> into a <hi>Nation,</hi> as that which such Men pretend, to be the only means to keep it out. Besides, this must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engage a Nation in endless disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the forfeiture of Power into whose hands it falls: whether into the people in common, or some persons particularly chosen by the people for that purpose: for in an established <hi>Government</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their principles, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing himself is the true representative of the people; others may be chosen for some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar purposes, as proposing Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but these cannot pretend by vertue of that choice, to have the full power of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and withal, whatever they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the consent of the people is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and their power is forfeited by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting it.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, what mighty danger can there be in supposing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Princes</hi> to be so <hi>sacred,</hi> that no
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:101601:149"/>
sons of violence ought to come near to hurt them? Have not all the ancient <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires</hi> of the world flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished under the supposition of an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable power in <hi>Princes</hi>? That hath been thought by those who did not own a derivation of their power from <hi>God,</hi> but a just security to their persons, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the hazards, and the care of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they undergo? Have not the people who have been most jealous of their <hi>Liberties,</hi> been fain to have recourse to an unaccountable power, as their last refuge in case of their greatest necessities? I mean the <hi>Romans</hi> in their <hi>Dictators.</hi> And if it were thought not only reasonable, but necessary then, ought it not to be preserved inviolable, where the same <hi>Laws</hi> do give it by which Men have any right to challenge any power at all? Neither doth this <hi>give Princes the liberty to do what they list</hi>; for the <hi>Laws</hi> by which they <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi> do fence in the <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of Men; and <hi>Princes</hi> do find so great conveniency, ease and security in their <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> that the sense of that will keep them far better within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of <hi>Laws,</hi> than the <hi>Peoples</hi> holding a Rod over them, which the best <hi>Princes</hi> are like to suffer the most by, and bad will
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:101601:149"/>
but grow desperate by it. Good <hi>Princes</hi> will never need such a curb, because their oaths and promises, their love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness towards their people, the sense they have of a <hi>Power</hi> infinitely greater than theirs, to which they must give an account of all their actions, will make them govern as the <hi>Fathers</hi> of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and bad <hi>Princes</hi> will never value it, but will endeavour by all possible means to secure themselves against it. So that no inconveniency can be possibly so great on the supposition of this unaccountable <hi>Power</hi> in Soveraign <hi>Princes,</hi> taking it in the general, and meerly on the account of reason, as the unavoidable mischiefs of that <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> which places all power originally in the people, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all <hi>oaths</hi> and <hi>bonds</hi> whatsoever to obedience, gives them the liberty to resume it when they please: which will always be when that <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi> shall prevail among them, which ruled here in <hi>Corah</hi> and his company.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another pretence of this Rebellion of <hi>Corah,</hi> was, <hi>the freeing themselves from the encroachments upon their spiritual pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which were made by the usurpations of</hi> Aaron <hi>and the Priesthood.</hi> This served <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or a very popular pretence, for they

            <p>But all these pretences would not serve to make them escape the severe hand of divine <hi>justice</hi>; for in an extraordinary and remarkable manner he made them suffer the just desert of their sin, for <hi>they perished in their contradiction:</hi> which is the next thing to be considered, <hi>viz.</hi>

They had been dividing the people, and the earth to their amazement and ruine divides it self under their feet, as though it had been design'd on purpose, that in their punishment themselves might feel, and others see the mischief of their sin. Their seditious principles seemed to have infected the ground they stood upon; the earth of a sudden proves as unquiet and troublesome as they; but to rebuke their madness, it was only in obedience

            <p>This was the first formed sedition that we read of against <hi>Moses,</hi> the people had been murmuring before, but they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heads to manage them: Now all things concur to a most dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion upon the most popular pretences

may thank themselves if they suffer for it, if not in this life, yet in that to come. And that good effect this Judgment had upon that people, that although the next day 14000 suffered for murmuring at the destruction of these men, yet we do not find that any Rebellion was raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them afterwards upon these popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pretences of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> While their Judges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued (who were <hi>Kings,</hi> without the state and title of <hi>Kings</hi>) they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served with reverence, and obeyed with diligence.

dreadful judgments which we have smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so much by, that we heartily pray we may never feel them again: For then <hi>fears and jealousies</hi> began our miseries, and the <hi>curse</hi> so often denounced <hi>against Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roz,</hi> fell upon the whole Nation; When the Sons of <hi>Corah</hi> managed their own am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious designs against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> (the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi>) under the same pretences of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi> And when the pretence of <hi>Religion</hi> was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into <hi>Schisms,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> into op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the <hi>people,</hi> it pleased <hi>God</hi> out of his secret and unsearchable judgments to suffer the Sons of Violence to prevail against the Lord's <hi>Anointed</hi>; and then they would know no difference between his being conquered and guilty. They could find no way to justifie their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wickedness, but by adding more: The consciousness of their own guilt, and the fears of the punishment due to it, made them unquiet and thoughtful, as long as his life and presence did upbraid them with the one, and made them fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the other. And when they found the greatness and constancy of his mind, the firmness of his piety, the zeal he had for the true interest of the people, would not suffer him to betray his <hi>Trust</hi> for the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:101601:156"/>
saving of his life; they charge him with their own guilt, and make him suffer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had deserved to do it. And as if it had not been enough to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused the names of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> before, they resolve to make the very name of <hi>Iustice</hi> to suffer together with their <hi>King:</hi> by calling that infamous company, who condemned their <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, A High Court of Iustice,</hi> which trampled under foot the <hi>Laws</hi> both of God and men. But lest the world should imagine they had any shame left in their sins, they make the people witnesses of his <hi>Murther;</hi> and pretend the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> for doing that, which they did detest and abhor. Thus fell our <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Martyr</hi> a sacrifice to the fury of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable men; who either were so blind as not to see his worth, or rather so bad as to hate him for it.

whose malice was like to end in nothing short of their own ruine, than by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to them the evils they must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, to disswade them from that, which they intended to do? But if neither the sense of their future miseries, nor their present sins will at all abate their fury or asswage their malice, nothing is then lest for kindness to shew it self by, but by lamenting their folly, bemoaning their obstinacy, and praying God to have pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon them, who have so little upon themselves. And all these were very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in the carriage of our Blessed Saviour towards his most implacable enemies: he had taken care to instruct them by his doctrine; to convince them by his miracles, to oblige them by the first offers of the greatest mercy; but all these things had no other effect upon them, than to heighten their malice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their rage, and make them more impatient till they had destroyed him. But their stupidity made him more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of their folly, and their obstinacy stirred up his compassion towards them, insomuch that the nearer he approached to his own sufferings, the greater sense he expressed of theirs.

            <p>And that they might not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves surprized, when the dreadful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of God's anger should seize upon them, our Saviour as he drew nearer to the time of his sufferings gives them more frequent and serious warnings of the sad consequence of their incorrgible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness under all the means of cure which had been used among them. For they were so far from being amended by them, that they not only despised the remedy, but the Physicians too; (as though that were a small thing) they beat, they wound, they kill those who came to cure them: but as if it had not been enough to have done these things to servants, (to let the world see how dangerous it is to attempt the cure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible sinners) when God sent his own Son to them, expecting they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence

            <p>Which words, are the application which our Saviour makes of the foregoing parable concerning the vineyard, which it seems the Chief Priests and Pharisees, did not apprehend themselves to be concerned in, till he brought the application of it so close to them; so that then they find they had condemned themselves, when they so readily passed so severe a sentence upon those husbandmen, who had so ill requited the Lord of the Vineyard for all the care he had taken about it, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead

Our Saviour having gained this confession from them, and so made it impossible for

them to start back in charging God with injustice in punishing them; he now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it to themselves in these words, which I suppose, ought immediately to follow the 41. verse, <hi>Therefore say I unto you the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein we have,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The greatest judgment which can ever befal a people, which is <hi>the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Kingdom of God from them.</hi>

            <p>In the Judgment we consider the cause of it, <hi>therefore say I unto you,</hi> &amp;c. which is either, more general as referring to all going before, and so it makes the taking away the Kingdom of God to be the just punishment of an incorrigible people; or more particular as referring to the sin of the Jews in crucifying Christ, and so it makes the guilt of that sin to be the cause of all the miseries, which that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath undergone since that time.</p>
            <p>In the latter part we may consider the terms upon which God either gives or continues his Kingdom to a Nation, and that is, <hi>bringing forth the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:101601:160"/>We consider the former with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar respect to the state of the Jewish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therein, 1.

It was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Jews themselves for some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and temporal blessings, which those who enjoyed it had above all other people. 2. It was taken by our Saviour for a clearer manifestation of the will of God to the world, and the consequence of that in the hearts of good men; and all the spiritual blessings which do attend it. So that the taking away <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> from them must needs be the heaviest judgment which could befal a people, since it implies in it, the taking away all the greatest temporal and spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We take it in the notion the Jews themselves had of it; and in this sense we shall make it evident that <hi>the Kingdom

of God</hi> hath been taken from that people in accomplishment of this prediction of our Saviour.

            <p n="1">1. They make <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> to consist in <hi>a deliverance of them from their enemies.</hi> For this was their great quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at our Saviour that he should pretend to bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g the Kingdom of God among them, and do nothing in order to their deliverance from the <hi>Roman</hi> Power. They either were such great admirers of the Pomp and Splendor of the world, or
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:101601:161"/>
so sensible of their own burdens and the yoke that was upon them, that they could not be perswaded that God should design to send his Kingdom among them for any other end but their ease and liberty. They apprehended the Crown of Thorns which was put upon our Saviour's head was the fittest representation of the nature of his Kingdom; for they looked upon it as the meer shew of a Kingdom, but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was nothing but affliction and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this was a doctrine they thought of all others the least needful to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, who complained so much of what they underwent already. They took it for the greatest contradiction to talk of a Kingdom among them, as long as they were in subjection to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Governours. But if Jesus of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> had raised an army in defence of their liberty, and had destroyed the Romans, they would never have enquired farther concerning Prophecies, or Miracles, this had been instead of all others to them, and then they would willingly have given him that title, which was set up only in derision as the Elogium of his Cross, <hi>Iesus of Nazareth King of the Iews:</hi> But we see how justly God dealt with them soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when they crucified the Son of God

And from this time there never was a more Tragical story ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acted or written than that is of the miseries which this people underwent. For if ever there were the marks of divine vengeance seen in the ruine of a Nation, they were in that. For they were so far from hearkening to the counsel of their wisest men, that the first thing they made sure of, was the destruction of them. Wisdom was but another name for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son among them: and there needed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence to take away the lives of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but to say that they were rich and wise.

               <hi>David</hi>'s numbering the people 1500000 fighting men who ought not to be reckoned above a fourth part of the whole, and <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> not taken in; if we add to these, the many rocks, mountains and desarts in this small coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that every seven years the most fertile places must lye fallow, we may justly wonder how all this number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should prosper so much in so narrow a territory. For although we ought not to measure the rules of Eastern diet by those of our Northern Climates, and it be withall true, that the number of people add both to the riches and plenty of it, and that the fertile places of that land were so almost to a miracle, yet considering their scarcity of rain and their Sabbatical years, we must have recourse to an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate care of heaven which provided for all their necessities, and filled their stores to so great abundance that <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Kings 5.11.</note>

every one of which contained about 30 bushels.

For all the males being obliged strictly by the Law to go up three times a year to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> (we should think against all rules of Policy to leave the country naked) it seems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible that their enemies should not over-run the Country, and destroy their Wives and Children at that time.

the pompous Ceremonies, the numerous Sacrifices, the magnificent and solemn Feasts, which were to be constantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served there? how is it then possible for them to observe the Religion now which God commanded them; since he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise forbid the doing these things any where, but in the Place which himself should appoint? So that they are under an unavoidable necessity of breaking their Law; if they do them not, they break the Law which commands them to be done; if they do them, they break the Law which forbids the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in any other place but at the Temple at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> And this I am apt to think, was one of the greatest grounds among them, after the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Temple, of their setting up Traditions above the written Law; for finding it impossible to keep the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law, if they could gain to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Authority of interpreting it, they were not much concerned for the Law it self.

the second Temple,</hi> that the prediction of Christ concerning the destruction of this Temple was so exactly fulfilled, that all attempts for the rebuilding of it were vain and fruitless.

In the former, though they met with many troubles and difficulties, yet God carried them through all and prospered their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours with great success.

From which we see that in all the senses the Jews unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>stood <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> it was rema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

after Christ the true Passover was slain by them, as had passed from their first Passover after their going out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to their entrance into <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Difficulty will be far less, and the concernment not so great as to the Jews, to prove that the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> in the sense our Saviour meant it for <hi>the Power of the Gospel,</hi> was taken from them. For the event it self is a clear proof of it. In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead of that therefore I shall now prove that this taking away the Kingdom of God from them, was the effect of their sin in crucifying Christ. <hi>Therefore I say,</hi> &amp;c. To make this clear I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by these following steps.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is acknowledged by the Jews themselves that these great calamities have happened to them for some extraordinary sins. For to these they impute the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the City and Temple, their oppressions and miseries ever since, and the deferring the coming of the <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as.</hi> For some of them have confessed <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit: Sanhed. c.</hi> 11. <hi>sect.</hi> 31.</note> 
               <hi>That all the terms prefixed for the coming of the</hi> Messias <hi>are past long ago,</hi> but that God provoked by their great sins hath thus long deserred his appearance, and suffered them in the mean while to lye under such great calamities.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:101601:170"/>2. The sin ought to be looked on as so much greater by how much heavier and longer this punishment hath been, than any inflicted upon them before. For if God did in former captivities punish them for their sins, when they were brought back again into their own land after 70 years; we must conclude that this is a sin of a higher nature which hath not been expiated by 1600 years captivity and dispersion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Jews have not suffered these calamities for the same sins for which they suffered before. For then God charged them with Idolatry as the great provoking sin; and it is very observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Jews were never freer from the suspicion of this sin than under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple, and particularly near their destruction. They generally pretended a mighty zeal for their Law, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally opposed the least tendency to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; insomuch that they would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <hi>Roman</hi> Ensigns to be advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them because of the Images that were upon them; and all the History of that time tells us of the frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests they had with the <hi>Roman</hi> Governours about these things: and ever since that time they have been perfect haters of

               <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and none of the least hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their embracing Christianity hath been the infinite scandal which hath been given them by the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in that particular.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It must be some sin, which their Fathers committed and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues yet unrepented of by them to this day.

               </gap>ne this to be, but putting to death the true <hi>Messias,</hi> which they will acknowledge themselves to be a sin that deserves all the miseries they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone; and it is apparent that in all this long captivity they never have had the heart to repent of the Sin of crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ; other sins they confess and say they hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ily repent of, but why then hath not God accepted of their repentance and brought them back into their own Land; according to the promises he long since made unto their Fathers? Which is a certain argument it is some sin, as yet unrepented of by them, which continues them under all their sufferings; and what can this be but that horrid sin of putting
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:101601:171"/>
to death the Son of God, with that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful imprecation which to this day hath its force upon them, <hi>His blood be upon us and our Children?</hi> and this sin they are so far from repenting of, that they still justifie their Fathers in what they did, and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme Christ to this day in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, where they think they may do it with safety. And to all this we may add that the ensuing calamities were exactly foretold by that Christ whom they cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and if no other argument would convince them that he was at least a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, yet the punctual accomplishment of all his predictions ought to do it: as will appear by comparing <note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. 24.3.</note> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. with the series of the story. And it is observable that the very place where our Saviour foretold these things, <hi>viz. the Mount of Olives,</hi> was the first wherein the <hi>Roman</hi> Army encamped before <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> And as they had crucified the Son of God, and put the Lord of glory to open shame, mocking and deriding him in his sufferings; so when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> came to revenge his quarrel upon them, they took the captive Jews and crucified them openly in the view of the City, 500. oft-times in a day, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us, who was then in the <hi>Roman</hi> camp; and withal adds, their numbers were so great that there was no room left for the crosses to stand, or wood enough to make crosses of. And they who had bought the blood of the Son of God for Thirty pieces of silver had this sin of theirs severely punished, when such multitudes of the Jews (2000 in one one night) had their bowels ript up by the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers in hopes to have found the gold and silver there, which they were supposed to have swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. And what greater argument can we have to believe that such judgments fell upon them upon the account of their sin in crucifying Christ, than that they were so punctually foretold so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and had all things so exactly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the accomplishment of them? For when Christ spake those things the Jews thought their destruction as incredible as that he was the <hi>Messias;</hi> but what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evidence could there be to them that he was so, than that God did so severely avenge his blood upon them, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to do it for their unbelief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency to this very day.</p>
            <p>But it may be some will say, <hi>What are all these things to us, we are none of those who
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:101601:172"/>
crucified Christ or justifie the doing it; Thanks be to God, the Kingdom of God is not taken from us, but we enjoy what was taken from them?</hi> To which I answer; If we really were what we pretend to be, these things are of great consequence to be considered by us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For is it nothing to us to have so great an argument of the truth of our Religion, as the sufferings of the Jews to this day is for the sin of crucifying Christ? As often as we think of them we ought to consider the danger of infidelity, and the heavy judgments which that brings upon a people. We may take some estimate of the wrath of God against that sin, by the desolation of the Country, and the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the inhabitants of it. When you think it a small sin to despise the Son of God, to revile his doctrine, and reproach his miracles, consider then what the Jews have suffered for these sins. As long as they continue a people in the world, they are the living monuments of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God upon an incorrigible and unbelieving Nation. And it may be one of the ends of God's dispersing them almost among all nations, that as often as they see and despise them, they may have a care of those sins which have
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:101601:173"/>
made them a byword and reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, who were once a nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God and feared by men. See what it is to despise the offers of grace, to reproach and ill use the Messengers of it who have no other errand but to perswade men to accept that Grace and bring forth the fruits thereof. See what it is for men to be slaves to their own lusts, which makes them not only neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their own truest interest but that of their nation too. If that had not been the fundamental miscarriage of the Rulers of the Jewish Nation at the time of our Saviour, they would most readily have entertained him and saved their land from ruine. See what it is for a people to be high in conceit of themselves and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume upon God's favour towards them. For there never was a nation more self-opinionated as to their wisdom, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and interest with God than the Jews were when they began their war: and the confidence of this made them think it long till they had destroyed themselves. See what it is to be once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged too far in a bad cause, how hard it is though they suffer never so much for it afterwards, for them to repent of it. We might have thought the Jews
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:101601:173"/>
when they had seen the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> would have come off from their obstinacy; but how very few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison from that time to this, have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely repented of the sins of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers in the death of Christ. See how hard a matter it is to conquer the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of education, and to condemn the most unjust actions of those when we come to understanding, whom from our infancy we had in veneration. For it is in great measure because they were their Ancestors, that the Jews to this day are so hardly convin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed they could be guilty of so soul a sin as crucifying the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it nothing to us what they have suffered, who enjoy the greatest blessings we have, by their means, and upon the same terms which they did? For <hi>to them at first were committed the Oracles of God,</hi> we enjoy all the excellent and sacred records of ancient times from them, all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the men whom God raised up and inspired from time to time among them. By their means we converse with those great persons, <hi>Moses, David, Solomon</hi> and others, and understand their wisdom and piety by the writings which at this day we enjoy. By them we have
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:101601:174"/>
conveyed to us, all the particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies which relate to the <hi>Messias,</hi> which point out the Tribe, the place, the time, the very person he was to be born of. By their means we are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute their infidelity, and to confirm our own faith. Therefore we have some common concernment with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ought on that account to be sensible of their miseries. Is it nothing then to you that God hath dealt so severely with them, from whom you derive so great a part of your Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the world, after the multitudes of Martyrs and the glorious Triumphs of our Religion over all the attempts of the persecutors and betrayers of it; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the solemn Vows of our Baptism in his Name, and frequent addresses to God by him, and celebrating the memory of his death and passion. What can be more mean, and ungrateful, what can shew more folly and weakness than after all these to esteem the blood of Christ no otherwise than as of a common ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, or at least to live as if we so esteemed it: Nay, we may add to all this, after so severe an instance of God's ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance already upon the Jews; which ought to increase our care, and will therefore aggravate our sin. What the Jews did they did as open and professed enemies, what we do we do as false and perfidious friends, and let any man judge which is the greater crime, to assault an Enemy, or to betray a Friend.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Can this be nothing to us who have so many of those <hi>Symptoms</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us which were the fore-runners of their desolation? Not as though I came hither like the son of <hi>Anani</hi> in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish story, who of a sudden, four years before the war, cryed out in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:101601:175"/>
               <hi>a voice from the East, a voice from the West, a voice from the four Winds, Woe to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>Woe to the Temple, Woe to all this People</hi>; and this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued crying, saith <hi>Iosephus, for seven years and five months, till at last being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Walls of the City, he cryed, Woe to my self also, and immediately a stone came out from one of the</hi> Roman <hi>Engines and dispatched him.</hi> God forbid we should be so near a desolation as they were then; but yet our Symptoms are bad, and without our Repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment God knows what they may end in. There were these following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable forerunners of desolation in the Jewish state, I am afraid we are too much concerned in.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A strange degeneracy of all sorts of men from the vertues of their Ancestors. This <hi>Iosephus</hi> often mentions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, and that there was no sort of men free; from the highest to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, they had all degenerated not only from what they ought to be, but from what their Ancestors were. And there can be nothing which bodes worse to a people than this doth; for the decay of vertue is really the loss of strength and interest. And if this be not among us
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:101601:176"/>
at this day in one sense, it must be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or else there would never be such general complaints of it as there are. It is hard to say that there hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been an Age, wherein vice, such as the very Heathens abhorred, hath been more confident and daring than in this; wherein so many have not bare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The flaming sword, the voice in the Temple, the terrible Earthquakes, were not greater Prodigies in nature among them, than men are in Morality among us, nor sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der presages of future miseries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A general stupidity and inappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensiveness of common danger: every one had a mighty zeal for his little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and faction he was engaged in, and wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but be sensible how much they are pleased at our divisions, and they have always hay and stubble enough, not only to build with, but thereby to add fuel to our flames.

            <p n="4">4. Spiritual pride. This was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in <hi>the people</hi> of the Jews in a time when they had as little reason for it, as any people in the world. They still looked on themselves as God's cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and peculiar People, his Darlings and his delight, and thought that God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and interest in the world were mightily concerned in their preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If they should be destroyed, they could not imagine what God would do for a people to serve him; for all but themselves they looked on with a very scornful pity, and thought that God hated them because they did. They had the purity of his ordinances, in his house of prayer; and the society of the faithful among themselves: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all others they thought, served God
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:101601:177"/>
only with their own inventions, or placed their Religion in dull morality. They were the people who maintained his cause, and ventured their lives and estates for it, and therefore God was bound in faithfulness to defend them, and he must deny himself if he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them. It seems strange to us, that a people rejected by God for their horrible Hypocrisie, should claim such an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erest in him, when they were marked out for destruction by him; but such is the bewitching nature of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Pride and Hypocrisie, that it infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuates the minds of men to their ruin; and flatters them with their interest in the Promises, till God makes good his threatnings and destroys them. Never any people thought they had a richer stock of Promises to live on, than they; <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient promises</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob, full promises,</hi> of favour, protection, and deliverance from enemies; <hi>particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> made to them and to no other people in the world. Besides these, they had mighty <hi>experiences</hi> of God's kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards them, <hi>undoubted experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> not depending on the deceitful workings of fancy; but seen in very strange and wonderful deliverances; <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:101601:178"/>
experiences,</hi> throughout the whole History of their Nation: and <hi>peculiar experiences</hi> being such vouchsafements to them, which God communicated to none but his chosen people. Add to these, that they had at this time a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful zeal for the true worship of God as they thought; they regarded no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution or opposition, but thought it their glory and honour to sacrifice themselves for the cause of God and his people. And yet all this while, God was the greatest enemy they had; and all their pretences signified nothing to him who saw their unsufferable pride and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some hypocrisie through those thin vails they had drawn over them, to deceive the less observing sort of men by. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sins that ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> open and publick God preserves the Authority of his Laws by punishing of them, but these spiritual sins of pride and hypocrisie, he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vindicates his Authority over the consciences of men, but the infiniteness of his wisdom and knowledge in their discovery, and his love to Integrity and and inward holiness in the punishment of them. And therefore these sins are more especially odious to God as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon his highest and most pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar

The first tendency to the destruction of this Nation of the Jews was the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Pharisaical temper among them, which was a compound of Pride and Hypocrisie; and when the field was over-run with these tares, it was then time for God to put in his sickle and cut them down. God forbid, that our Church and the Protestant Religion in it should be in danger of destruction, for that would be a judgment beyond fire and sword and plague, and any thing we have yet smarted by; that would be the taking away <hi>the Kingdom of God from us,</hi> and setting up the <hi>Kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; that would be not only a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our own Age, but the heaviest curse next to renouncing Christianity, we could entail upon posterity.

monstrous pride and ingratitude among many who pretend to a purer worship of God than is established by Law, as though there were little or no difference between the Government of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> and the bondage of <hi>Egypt.</hi> O <hi>England, England,</hi> what will the Pride and unthankfulness of those who profess Religion bring thee to!

a strange height of spiritual pride are those arrived, who ingross all true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness to themselves? as though it were not possible among us to go to Heaven and to Church together. As though Christ had no Church for 1500 years and more, wherein not one person can be named who thought it unlawful to pray by a prescribed form. As though men could not love God and pray sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerely to him, that valued the peace and order of the Church above the heats and conceptions of their own brains. Where differences proceed meerly from ignorance and weakness, they are less dangerous to themselves or others: but where there is so much impatience of reproof, such contempt of superiours, such uncharitable censures of other men, such invincible prejudices and stiffness of humour, such scorn and reproach cast upon the publick worship among us; What can such things spring from but a root of bitterness and spiritual pride? I speak not these things to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den our differences, or increase our ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities, they are too large and too great already, nor to condemn any humble and modest dissenters from us; but I despair ever to see our divisions healed,

Mind, as the Jews generally do; or rather the Divine power manifesting it self in giving motion to the otherwise dull and unactive parts of matter; we have it fully represented to us in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles on the day of Pentecost: For that came upon them, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Act. 2.2.</note> 
               <hi>as a rushing mighty Wind,</hi> and inspired them with a new life and motion, whereby they became the most active instruments of bringing the World out of that state of confusion and darkness it lay in before, by causing the glorious light of the Gospel to shine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. And lest any part should be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make up the parallel, in the verse before the text, we read of the <hi>Waters</hi> too which the Spirit of God did move upon, and therefore called not a dark Abyss, but flowing rivers of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <note n="(b)" place="margin">V. 38.</note>

And this the Evangelist in these words, to prevent all cavils and mistakes, tells us was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's meaning; <hi>But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.</hi> And lest any should think that our Blessed Saviour purposely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to speak in strange metaphors, we shall find a very just occasion given him for using this way of expression from a custom practised among the Jews at that time.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:101601:182"/>
World it self should continue. So that in the words of the Text we have these particulars offered to our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The effusion of the Spirit under the times of the Gospel: <hi>But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The nature of that effusion repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to us by <hi>rivers of living waters flowing out of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The time that was reserved for it; which was after the glorious ascension of Christ to Heaven: <hi>For the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Iesus was not yet glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The effusion of the Spirit under the times of the Gospel; by which we mean those extraordinary gifts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which the Apostles had after the Holy Ghost is said to descend upon them. Which are therefore called <note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb. 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>signs and wonders, and divers gifts of the Holy Ghost:</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.6.11.</note> 
               <hi>and the operations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> of which we have a large enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration given us in that place.</p>
            <p>The two most remarkable which I shall insist upon and do comprehend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them most of the rest, are, <hi>the power of working Miracles,</hi> whether in Healing
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:101601:183"/>
diseases or any other way; <hi>and the gift of tongues</hi> either in speaking or interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; they who will acknowledge that the Apostles had these, will not have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to question any of the rest. And concerning these I shall endeavour to prove,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the things attributed to the Apostles concerning them, could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from any ordinary, or natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they could not be the effects of an evil, but of a holy and divine spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and therefore that there was really such <hi>a pouring out of the spirit</hi> as is here mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the things attributed to the Apostles could not arise from any meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural causes. It is not my present business to prove the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apostles did those things which were accounted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles by those who saw them or heard of them; and that on the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost they did speak with strange tongues; for these things are so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally attested by the most competent witnesses, <hi>viz.</hi> persons of the same age, whose testimony we can have no reason to suspect; and not only by those who
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:101601:183"/>
were the friends to this Religion, but the greatest enemies Jews and Heathens; and by all the utmost endeavours of Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical men, who have not set themselves to disprove the testimony, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of it, (by saying that granting them true they do not infer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of a divine spirit) that on the same grounds any person would question the truth of these things, he must que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the truth of some other things, which himself believes on the same or weaker grounds than these are. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing then the matters of fact to be true, we now enquire whether these things might proceed from any meerly natural causes, which will be the best done by examining the most plausible accounts which are pretended to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of them. And thus some have had the confidence to say, <hi>That whatever is said to be done by the power of miracles in the Apostles might be effected by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral temperament of body, or the great power of imagination; and that their speaking with strange tongues might be the effect only of a natural Enthusiasm, or some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper of brain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:101601:184"/>1. That the power of miracles might be nothing but a natural temperament or the strength of imagination.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An excellent natural temper of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they say may do strange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul things, so that such a one who hath an exact temperament may walk upon the waters, stand in the air, and quench the violence of the fire; and by a strange kind of sanative contagion may communicate healthful spirits, as persons that are infected do noisom and pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial. These are things spoken with as much case and as little reason, as any of the calumnies against Religion, which are so boldly uttered by men who dare speak any thing as to these things but reason, and do any thing but what is good.</p>
            <p>But can these men after all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence produce any one person in the World, who by the exquisiteness of his natural temper hath ever walked upon the waters, or poised himself in the air, or kept himself from being singed in the fire? If these things be natural, how comes it to pass that no other instances can be given but such as we urge for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous? We say indeed that <note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. 14.29.</note> 
               <hi>Christ walked on the Sea,</hi> but withal we say this
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:101601:184"/>
was an argument of that divine power in him, <hi>which,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Job 9.8.</note> 
               <hi>alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the Sea:</hi> We say that <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Kings 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>Elijah was carried up into Heaven by a Chariot of fire and a whirlwind;</hi> but it was only by his power, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Psal. 104.4.</note> 
               <hi>who maketh the winds his Messengers, and flames of fire his Ministers,</hi> as some render those words of the Psalmist: We say that the three Children were preserved <note n="(d)" place="margin">Dan. 5.25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>in the fiery furnace, that they had no hurt;</hi> and even <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was hereby convinced, that he was the <hi>true God,</hi> which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to preserve his servants from the force of that devouring element which was therefore so much worshipped by those Eastern people, because it destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only the men but the Gods of other nations. But is this enough to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie any reasonable men that these things were done by natural causes; because they were done at all? For that is to suppose it impossible there should be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; which is to say it is impossible there should be a God; which is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt somewhat beyond what the most impudent Atheists pretended. But in this case nothing can be reasonably ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged but <hi>common experience</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:101601:185"/>
if these were things which were usually done by other causes, there would be no reason to pretend a miraculous power: but we say it is impossible that such things should be produced by meer natural causes, and in this case there can be no confutation but by contrary expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. As we see the opinion of the Ancients concerning the uninhabitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the torrid Zone, and that there were no Antipodes, are disproved by the mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est experience to the contrary of all modern discoverers. Let such plain experience be produced, and we shall then yield the possibility of the things by some natural causes, although not by such <hi>an exact temperament of body,</hi> which is only an instance of the strong power of imagination in those who think so whatever that may have on others. Such a temperament of body as these persons imagine, considering the great inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the mixture of the earthly and aerial parts in us, being it may be as <hi>great a miracle</hi> it self, as any they would disprove by it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But supposing such a temperament of body to be possible, how comes it to be so beneficial to others, as to prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

persons? We may as well think that a great beauty may change a Black by often viewing him, or a skilful Musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an make another so by sitting near him, as one man heal another because he is healthful himself. Unless we can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it in the power of a man to send forth the best spirits of his own body and transfuse them into the body of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but by this means that which must cure another must destroy himself. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the healthfulness of a person lies much in the freedom of perspiration of all the noxious vapours to the body; by which it will appear incredible that a man should preserve his own health by sending out the worst vapors, and at the same time cure another, by sending out the best.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Supposing we should grant that a vigorous heat and a strong arm may by a violent friction discuss some tumor of a distempered body; yet what would all this signifie to the mighty cures which were wrought so easily and with a word speaking and at such great distance as were by Christ and his Apostles? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing our Saviour had the most exact natural temper that ever any person in the world had; yet what could this do
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:101601:186"/>
to the cure of a person above twenty miles distance? for so our Saviour cured the Son of a Nobleman who lay sick at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> when himself was at <note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 4.46, 53.</note> 
               <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee?</hi> So at <note n="(b)" place="margin">Matth. 8.6, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Capernaum</hi> he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Centurion's servant at his own house without going thither. Thus we find the Apostles curing, though <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                  <p>Acts 5.15.</p>

               </note> 
               <hi>they did not touch them</hi>; and that not one or two but multitudes of diseased persons. And nothing can be more absurd than to imagine that so many men should at the same time work so many miraculous cures by vertue of a temperament pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to themselves? for how come they only to happen to have this tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and none of the Jews who had all equal advantages with them for it? Why did none of the enemies of Christ do as strange things as they did? How come they never to do it before they were <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> nor in such an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner till after the day of Pentecost? Did the being Christians alter their natural temper and infuse a <hi>

                  </gap>anative</hi> vertue into them which they never had before? Or rather was not their Christianity like to have spoyled it if ever they had it before; by their frequent watchings, fastings, hunger and thirst, cold and nakedness,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:101601:186"/>
stripes and imprisonments, racks and torments? Are these the improvers of an excellent constitution? if they be, I doubt not but those who magnifie it in them, would rather want the vertue of it, than be at the pains to obtain it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But what a natural temper cannot do, they think <hi>the power of imagination</hi> may: and therefore in order to the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the power of miracles, they mightily advance that of imagination: which is the <hi>Idol</hi> of those who are as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Friends to reason in it as they are to Religion. Any thing shall be able to effect that, which they will not allow God to do: nay the most extravagant thing which belongs to humane nature shall have a greater power than the most holy and divine spirit. <hi>But do not we see,</hi> say they, <hi>strange effects of the power of imagination upon mankind?</hi> I grant we do, and in nothing more than when men set it up against the power of God: yet surely we see far greater effects of that in the world than we do of the other. The power of imagination can never be supposed to give a being to the things we see in the world? but we have the greatest reason to attribute that to a
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:101601:187"/>
divine and infinite power; and is it not far more rational that that which gave a Being to the course of nature should alter it when it pleaseth, than that which had nothing to do in the making of it? So that in general, there can be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition between the power of God and the strength of imagination as to any extraordinary effects which happen in the world. But this is not all; for there is a repugnancy in the very nature of the thing that the power of imagination should do all those miracles which were wrought by Christ or his Apostles. For either they must be wrought by the imagination of the Agent or of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient: if of the Agent, then there can be no more necessary to do the same things than to have the same strength o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> imagination which they had; What is the reason then that never since or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time were so many signs, and wonders wrought as there were then by the Apostles and Disciples of our Lord? If <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> cured the lame man by the strength of imagination; why have no persons ever since cured those whose welfare they have as heartily desired as ever they could do his? Certainly if imagination could kill mens enemies,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:101601:187"/>
there would never need <hi>Duels</hi> to destroy them, nor Authority to punish such as do it: and if it could cure Friends, there would need no Physicians to heal and recover them, and death would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, but with persons that were wholly Friendless. If they say, <hi>that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are not sufficiently perswaded of their own power, and therefore they do see lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good;</hi> let any of those who contend the most for it attempt the cure when they please of any the most common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of mankind; and if they cannot do that, let them then perswade us they can do miracles by that, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cure the tooth-ach by. But here they will say, <hi>the imagination of the Patient is necessary in order to a miracle being wrought upon him:</hi> not such I am sure as Christ and his Apostles wrought, who not only healed the lame and the blind, but <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the dead;</hi> and what power of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation do they suppose in <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he had lain four days in the Grave? and however they think of the soul they must in this case allow this power of imagination to be <hi>immortal.</hi> So that were there no other arguments but that of raising the dead that demonstrates it impossible that what Christ or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles

               </gap>e on whom they wrought their miracles.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But,</hi> say they, <hi>did not Christ and his Apostles require believing first in all persons that had miracles wrought upon them; and why should this be, but because the strength of imagination was required to it? And is it not expresly said, that Christ could not do any mighty works among his own country-men because of their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? by which it appears that the efficacy of his miracles did depend on the Faith of the Persons.</hi> To which I answer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That Christ did not always require faith in the person on whom he wrought his miracles; for then it had been impossible he should ever have raised any from the dead? which we are sure he did. And did not <note n="(a)" place="margin">Act. 10.9, 12.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> raise <hi>Eutychius</hi> from the dead? and can any think so absurdly as that faith was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from a dead man in order to his resurrection?

But they were men did as far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all such in all true vertue and real excellency as they did in that miraculous power which God had given them. If they required men to believe whom they cured, it was that they might cure both body and soul together: but sometimes they cured persons whom they saw not. as the <note n="(c)" place="margin">Acts 19.11, 12.</note>

               <hi>Ephesus</hi> cured the diseased when they were carried to them. But generally they took all opportunities to convey the Doctrine of Christianity into the minds of those, out of whose bodies they cast either Diseases or Devils. <hi>But is it not said that Christ could do no mighty works among them because of their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and the power of his disciples could not be greater than his own?</hi> To which I answer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is no-where said in the Scripture that Christ could do no miracles at all among them because of their unbelief: for in one place it is said, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mark 13.58.</note> 
               <hi>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</hi> He did miracles enough to convince them; but when he saw their obstinacy, he would not cast away any more upon them. And in that other place where it is said, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Matth. 6.5.</note> 
               <hi>that he could there do no mighty work,</hi> it is presently added, <hi>save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them.</hi> And what absurdity is there that Christ should do no extraordinary miracle among them, among whom he saw that himself and his miracles were both equally contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It is not the method of divine goodness to bestow the largest kindnesses
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:101601:189"/>
at first; those who improve the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of favour shall have more, but those who despise the first may justly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from any farther kindness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When it is said <hi>that he could not,</hi> that expression doth not imply any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility in the thing but a deliberate resolution to the contrary, so it is used Acts 4.20. <hi>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</hi> Who questions but there was a possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the thing, that they might have held their peace? but it was a thing which upon great deliberation they had resolved not to do. So <note n="(a)" place="margin">Revel. 2.2.</note> 
               <hi>thou canst not bear them which are evil</hi>; and <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Cor. 13.8.</note> 
               <hi>we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</hi> From which it appears that this can be no prejudice to the power of Christ in working miracles, but only shews his just resolution not to do it, considering the contempt wherewith he had been entertained among them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is pretended by those men who set themselves to undervalue those mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gifts which the Apostles had, <hi>that the gift of tongues might be only the effect of an Enthusiastick heat, or some distemper of their brains, as men in a high Fever are apt to speak such things and words, which
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:101601:190"/>
while they are in health they could never do.</hi> But that such unreasonable imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations do more argue a distempered brain, than any thing we assert concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these divine persons will easily appear from these considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That no violent heat whatsoever can form a new language to a man which he never knew before. If language had been natural to man, there might have been some reason for it; but that we all know to be an arbitrary thing: and as well might a blind man paint with an exact difference of colours, or one write plainly who could never read, as any person by the meer heat of his Phancy speak suddenly in a tongue which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learnt. There have been some who have said <note n="(a)" place="margin">

               <hi>that the mind of man hath naturally all kinds of languages within it self, and it wants nothing but some mighty heat to stir men up to speak in any kind of them.</hi> But we are to take notice that those things are accounted <hi>wit</hi> when spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against Religion, which would have been <hi>nonsense</hi> and <hi>contradictions</hi> if spoken for it. And certainly nothing could be more absurdly said, than for the same men to make all the imaginations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:101601:190"/>
and yet to say that the mind of man can have those things in it, which he never learnt or heard. If this supposition were true, we might invert that saying of <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Festus</hi> to St. <hi>Paul, Much learning hath made thee mad;</hi> for then <hi>madness,</hi> or that which is the next to it, <hi>a great heat of brain,</hi> would make men the most <hi>learned.</hi> If this were true, there would be a much easier way of attaining to speak in the languages of all nations than that which many take to gain a very few of them: for the heightening of Phancy either by Wine, or a degree of madness would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire men with skill in tongues to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But supposing such a thing possible, which is far from being so, yet it is very remote from our present case; for the Apostles made it manifest to all persons that they were far enough from being inspired with the vapours of wine, or touched with any Enthusiastick madness. They spake with strange tongues, but in such a manner as convinced great numbers of their hearers of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that doctrine which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by them. As St. <hi>Paul</hi>

               <hi>who mocked and said they were full of new wine.</hi> Which he doth with so great success, that the same day 3000 persons disowned their former course of life and embraced Christianity. Surely, madness was never more infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, never made men more wise and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, than this did, if the Apostl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s were acted only by that. When was there ever better and more weighty sense spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by any, than by the Apostles after the day of <hi>Pentecost?</hi> With what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son do they argue, with what strength do they discourse, with what a sedate and manly courage do they withstand the opposition of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> against them? they never fly out into any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant passion, never betray any weakness or fear: but speak the truth with boldness, and rejoyce when they
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:101601:191"/>
suffer for it. It could be no sudden heat which acted them on the day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost, for the same Spirit and power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with them afterwards: they lived and acted by vertue of it, so that their life was as great a miracle, as any that was wrought by them. Their zeal was great but regular, their devotion fervent and constant, their conversation honest and prudent, their discourses inflaming and convincing, and the whole course of their lives breathed nothing but glory to God, and good-will towards Men. If they are called to suffer for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, with what constancy do they own the truth, with what submission do they yield to their persecutors, with what meekness and patience do they bear their sufferings! If differences arise among Christians, with what care do they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, with what caution do they direct, with what gentleness do they instruct, with what tenderness do they bear with dissenters, with what earnestness do they endeavour to preserve the peace of the Christian Church! When they are to plant Churches, how ready to go about it, how diligent in attending it, how watchful to prevent all miscarriages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them! When they write Epistles
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:101601:192"/>
to those already planted, with what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority do they teach, with what Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty do they command, with what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity do they rebuke, with what pity do they chastise, with what vehemency do they exhort, and with what weighty arguments do they perswade all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things! So that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who after all these things can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Apostles were acted only by some extravagant heats, may as easily perswade themselves that men may be drunk with sobriety, and mad with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and debauched with goodness. But such are fit only to be treated in a dark room, if any can be found darker than their understandings are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But yet there may be imagined a higher sort of madness than these men are guilty of, <hi>viz.</hi> That when men are convinced that these things could not be done by meer Mechanical causes, then they attribute them to the assistance of Spirits, but not to the holy and divine, but such as are evil and impure. A mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness so great and extravagant, that we could hardly imagine that it were inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to humane nature, unless the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had told us that some had thus blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:101601:192"/>
the son of man, and either had or were in danger of blaspheming the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> too. And this is properly <hi>blaspheming the Holy Ghost,</hi> (which was not given, as our text tells us, till after Christ's ascension) when men attribute all those miraculous gifts which were poured out upon the Apostles in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Christian doctrine to the power of an unclean Spirit. For so the Evangelist St. <hi>Luke,</hi> when he mentions the <note n="(a)" place="margin">Luk. 12.10.</note> 
               <hi>blasphemy against the Holy Ghost which shall not be forgiven,</hi> immediately subjoyns, <hi>their bringing in the Apostles to the Synagogues and Magistrates and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> and adds, <hi>that the Holy Ghost,</hi> (even that which they so blasphemed in them) <hi>should teach them in that same hour what they ought to say.</hi> I deny not but the attributing the miraculous works of Christ, who had the Holy Spirit without measure, to an evil Spirit was the same kind of sin; but it received a greater aggravation a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter the resurrection of Christ from the dead, and the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous effusion of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles. For now the great confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was given to the truth of all that Christ had said before; he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times concealed his miracles and forbid
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:101601:193"/>
the publishing of them: and to such he appeared but as the son of man, of whom it is said <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.8.</note> 
               <hi>that had they known him they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory:</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> more expresly; <note n="(b)" place="margin">Act. 3.17.</note> 
               <hi>and now Brethren I wrote that through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance you did it as did also your Rulers.</hi> But now since his resurrection and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, when God by the effusion of the Holy Ghost hath given the largest and fullest Testimony to the doctrine of the Gospel; if men after all this shall go on <hi>to blaspheme the Holy Ghost,</hi> by attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all these miracles to a Diabolical power, then there is no forgiveness to be expected either in this world, or the world to come; because this argues the greatest obstinacy of mind, the highest contempt of God, and the greatest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front that can be put upon the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Holy Spirit; for it is charging the Spirit of truth to be an evil and a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit. By which we see what great weight and moment the Scripture lays upon this pouring out of the Holy Ghost on the Apostles, and what care men ought to have how they undervalue and despise it, and much more how they do reproach and blaspheme it. They might as well imagine that light and darkness may meet
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:101601:193"/>
and embrace each other, as that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Spirits should imploy their power in promoting a doctrine so contrary to their interest? For Heaven and Hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more distant, than the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Christianity is from all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of wicked Spirits. How soon was the Devil's Kingdom broken, his Temples demolished, his Oracles silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, himself baffled in his great design of deceiving mankind when Christianity prevailed in the world? Having thus far asserted the truth of the thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that there was such an effusion of the Holy Spirit, we now come to consider,</p>

by the pouring out of the spirit than these. For the fountain was opened in the Apostles, but the streams of those Rivers of living water have run down to our Age: not confined within the banks of <hi>Tiber,</hi> nor mixing with the impure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it; but preserved pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed in that sacred doctrine contained in the Holy Scripture. Within those bounds we confine our faith, and are not moved by the vain discourses of any who pretend to discover a new Fountain-head to these waters at <hi>Rome;</hi> and would make it impossible for them to come down to us through any other Channel but theirs. But supposing they had come to us through them, have they thereby gotten the sole disposal of them, that none shall tast but what and how much they please? and must we needs drink down the filth and mud of their Channel too? As long as they suffer us to do what Christ hath commanded us to do, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>that he only digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of</hi> Abraham <hi>his Father;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>the Philistins</hi> had stopped them after the death of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet that could be no hindrance to his right, but he might open them again, and call their names af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the names by which his Father had called them: So that is the substance of our Plea, we pretend to nothing but to clear the passage which they have stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up, and was left free and open for us in the time of the Apostles and Fathers; we desire not to be imposed upon by their later usurpations: we plead for no more but that the Church of God may have the same purity and integrity which it had in the primitive times, and that things may not only be called by the names by which the Fathers have called them; but that they may be such as the Fathers have left them. But otherwise let them boast never so much of the largeness of their Stream, of the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Channel, of the holiness of their Waters, of the number of their
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:101601:196"/>
Ports, and the riches of their Trading; nay and let them call their stream by the name of the <hi>Ocean</hi> too (if they please,) yet we envy them not their <hi>Admah</hi> and <hi>Pharpar</hi> and all the Rivers of <hi>Damascus,</hi> so we may sit down quietly by these li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters of <hi>Iordan.</hi> We are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the miracles which the Apostles wrought without forging or believing new ones; we are satisfied with the gift of strange tongues which they had; we know no necessity now of <hi>speaking</hi> much less of <hi>praying</hi> in an <hi>unknown tongue:</hi> we believe that Spirit infallible which inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Apostles in their holy Writings; and those we acknowledge, embrace, and I hope are willing to die for: But if any upstart Spirit pretend to sit in an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chair, we desire not to be brought under bondage to it, till we see the same miracles wrought by vertue of it, which were wrought by the Apostles to attest their infallibility.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The last thing to be spoken to, is, <hi>the season</hi> that this effusion of the Spirit was reserved for, which was after the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ascension of Christ to Heaven. This was reserved as the great <hi>Donative</hi> after his Triumph over Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; when he was ascended up on high,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:101601:196"/>
he sends down the greatest gift that ever was bestowed upon mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> this gift of his Holy Spirit. Hereby Christ discovered the greatness of his Purchase, the height of his Glory, the exercise of his Power, the assurance of his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Ascension: and the care he took of his Church and People; by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them see that he made good his last promise to them of sending them another Comforter who should be with them to assist them in all their undertakings, to direct them in their doubts, to plead their cause for them against all the vain oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itions of men. And he should not continue with them for a little time as Christ had done, but he should abide with them for ever, <hi>i. e.</hi> so as not to be taken from them as himself was, but should remain with them, as a pledge of his love, as a testimony of his truth, as an earnest of God's favour to them now, and their future inheritance in heaven; for he should comfort them by his presence, guide them by his counsel, and at last bring them to glory.</p>
            <p>Nothing now remains but that as the occasion of our rejoycing on this day doth so much exceed that of the Jews at their ceremony of <hi>pouring out the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

so our joy should as much exceed in the nature and kind of it the mirth and jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which was then used by them.

               <hi>that rock,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>was Christ,</hi> and the gifts of the Spirit are that stream of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water which flows from him, and shall not we express our thankfulness for so great and unvaluable a mercy?

Let us not then affront that good Spirit, while we pretend to bless God for him; let us not grieve him by our presumptuous sins, nor resist his motions in our hearts by our wilful continuance in them. The best way we can express our thankfulness is by yielding up our selves to be guided by him in a holy life, and then we may be sure our joy shall never end with our lives, but shall be continued with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fulness for ever more.</p>

            <p>IF we were bound to judge of things only by appearance, and to esteem all persons happy who are made the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the envy of some and the flattery of others, this text would seem to be a strange Paradox, and inconsistent with what daily happens in the world. For what complaint hath been more frequent among men almost in all Ages, than that peace and prosperity hath been the portion of the wicked, that their troubles have not been like other mens, that none
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:101601:198"/>
seem to enjoy greater pleasures in this world than they who live as if there were no other? The consideration of which hath been a matter of great offence to the weak, and of surprise to the wisest; till they have searched more deeply into the nature of these things (which the more men have done the better esteem they have always had of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) and from thence have understood that the true felicity of a man's life lies in the contentment of his own mind, which can never arise from any thing without himself, nor be enjoyed till all be well within. For when we compare the state of humane nature with that of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings inferiour to it, we shall easily find that as man was designed for a greater happiness than they are capable of; so that cannot lie in any thing which he enjoys in common with them, (such as the pleasures of our senses are) but must consist in some peculiar excellencies of his being. And as the capacity of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery is always proportionable to that of happiness; so the measure and the kind of that must be taken in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that we do the other. Where there is no sense of pleasure, there can be none of pain; where all pleasure is confined
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:101601:198"/>
to sense, the pain must be so too; but where the greatest pleasures are intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual, the greatest torments must be those of the mind. From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that nothing doth so much conduce to the proper happiness of man, as that which doth the most promote the peace and serenity of his mind: nothing can make him more miserable than that which causeth the greatest disturbance in it. If we can then make it appear that the highest honours, the greatest riches, and the softest pleasures can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver satisfie the desires, conquer the fears, nor allay the passions of an ungoverned mind, we must search beyond these things for the foundations of its peace. And if notwithstanding them there may be such a sting in the conscience of a wicked man, that may inflame his mind to so great a height of rage and fury, which the diversions of the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevent, nor all its pleasures cure: we are especially concerned to fix such motion of man's happiness, which either supposes a sound mind or else makes it so; without which all the other things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o much admired can no more contribute towards any true contentment than a magnificent Palace, or a curiously wrought
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:101601:199"/>
bed to the cure of the Gout or Stone. All which I speak, (not as though I imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any state of perfect tranquility or compleat happiness were attainable by any man in this present life: for as long as the causes are imperfect, the effect must be so too: and those Philosophers who discoursed so much of a happy state of life, did but frame <hi>Ideas</hi> in <hi>Morals</hi> as they did in <hi>Politicks,</hi> not as though it were possible for any to reach to the exactness of them, but those were to be accounted best which came the nearest to them:) but I therefore speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a happy state of life for these two reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That though none can be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, yet that some may be much more so than others are, <hi>i. e.</hi> they may enjoy far greater contentment of mind in any condition than others can do; they can bear crosses, and suffer injuries with a more equal temper; and when they meet with vicissitudes in the world they wonder no more at it, than to see that the Wind changes its quarter, or tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

wonder at; and they who do the least wonder, are the least surprised; and they who are the least surprised, are the least troubled; and those are the happiest men as this world goes, who meet with fewest troubles in it. The <hi>Italians</hi> have a shrewd Proverb, that there is less money, less wisdom, less honesty in the world than men generally make account of; I will not stand to maintain the truth of it, but the less men believe of these things, the less they are deceived, and the less they are deceived the less they are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. For no troubles are greater than those which are the most unexpected; none are so unexpected as those which come upon men who are only undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their own experience: For they undergo a great deal of trouble to gain a little wisdom, whereas a true judgment and consideration of these things before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, keeps the mind of man more steady and fixt amidst all the contingencies of humane affairs. By which we see that wisdom of it self hath a great influence upon the quiet and peace of man's mind, and the happiness of his life: But if we add to that the inseparable property of true wisdom, <hi>viz.</hi> patience and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Will of God upon the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:101601:200"/>
of his infinite Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he must be strangely blind that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discern a greater peace and serenity following these two in the minds of men, than where folly and irreligion raign. Thus far then we have gained, that Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Piety tend very much to the lessening the troubles of a man's life; and therein lies the far greatest part of the happiness of this imperfect State. For it is a vain thing to expect in so open a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as we live in here, that no cross Winds should blow upon us; but if they only shake our branches and make our leaves fall, as long as the root holds firm and the body entire, the former beauty and glory will return again. It can be no disparagement to the most skilful Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, to have his Vessel tossed upon a tempestuous Sea, but to escape with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle damage when he sees others sink down and perish, shews the great difference which wisdom gives in the success, where the dangers are equal and common. So that not only some men may meet with fewer troubles in the world than others do; but supposing they meet with the same, some are far more happy in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through them than others are. And this is the fairest sense I know can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:101601:200"/>
of those otherwise extravagant spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Philosophers of old, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Wise man being happy in the Bull of</hi> Phalaris, <hi>or under the greatest racks and torments;</hi> not as though they could be so senseless to imagine that any man could be as happy in his torments as out of them; but that taking him in the same State with another man who wants that constancy of mind which he hath, he may be said to be happy in respect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. By which we see, that although no state of life can be said to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly happy, yet some may be much nearer than others can be. Which was necessary to be premised in order to the right understanding the design of our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing discourse: which is to shew,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That some course of life to any man who considers what he doth, is utterly inconsistent with a state of Peace and Tranquility; I mean the course of Sin and Wickedness. So the Prophet assures us from the mouth of God himself in the words of the text. <hi>There is no peace, saith my God, to the Wicked.</hi> Which words are spoken on purpose by the Prophet, to shew how much the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of men doth hinder them from enjoying that peace and happiness which
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:101601:201"/>
they might have had without it; for in the foregoing words he represents God as shewing great pity to the scattered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of a broken and distressed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; though he had punished them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely for their sins, and banished them out of their native country, yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth them, <hi>that those who put their trust in him should possess the land, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain inherit his holy mountain,</hi> v. 13. and therefore speaks <hi>that the way might be cast up and prepared for their return,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impediment taken out of the way, v. 14. <hi>for the high and lofty one who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits eternity, will again dwell in his high and holy place, viz.</hi> at <hi>Hierusalem</hi>; (so the words may be understood, for the Hebrew verb is future) but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with those who were humbled for their sins, who are here called <hi>the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and contrite ones,</hi> v. 15. For <hi>God would not always contend with them,</hi> for he knew they were not able to stand before him; <hi>v.</hi> 16. and although his punishment of them was just for their sins, <hi>v.</hi> 17. yet <hi>God took notice of their repentance,</hi> and would therefore <hi>heal their breaches,</hi> and conduct them back again to their own land, and thereby give so great an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of joy and triumph, that by it he
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:101601:201"/>
is said <hi>to restore comforts to those who mourned</hi> for the calamities they lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>v.</hi> 18. yea he would grant them so much inward peace and outward prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that they should far and near joyn in their praises to God for it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is said <hi>to create the fruit of the lips peace, peace,</hi> &amp;c. But all this while they must have a care of deceiving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves though God did restore them to their own land with abundance of joy and peace, in expectation that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their former calamities and the present blessings they enjoyed would make them abhor the sins which had provoked God to punish them; yet if they should return to their wickedness again, or continue in it after so great mercies, they would soon find that their wickedness would overthrow their peace, and nothing but discontent and trouble would follow upon it, as the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of it. <hi>For like the troubled Sea that is tossed up and down</hi> with violent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous winds, fomes and rages, one wave beating against another, and the effect of all this commotion is nothing but casting upon the neighbour shore a greater burden of unprofitable mire and dirt: such would the effect of their
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:101601:202"/>
wickedness be among them, <hi>v.</hi> 20. it would make them restless and unquiet in themselves, having no one certain motion but tossed up and down with every contrary blast of wind, and producing nothing by all these various agitations but unprofitable counsels and unsuccessful designs. But lest the Prophet should be supposed to speak all this out of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and passion, he confirms what he had said from the mouth of God in these few but smart words of the Text. <hi>There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words we see are general and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, both as to the nature of the <hi>peace</hi> here mentioned, and the notion of <hi>Wickedness</hi> implyed; and therefore I shall handle them in their due extent by shewing that no one kind of true peace is consistent with any sort of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing wickedness: whether by <hi>peace</hi> we mean the <hi>peace</hi> a man hath <hi>with himself</hi> in the tranquillity of his mind; or the <hi>peace</hi> which men have in society with one another. In either of these senses it will appear true, <hi>that there is no peace to the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Taking <hi>peace,</hi> for the <hi>tranquillity of a man's mind;</hi> in order to which it is
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:101601:202"/>
necessary for a man to have some certain foundation to build his peace upon, and that he be secured from those things which will overthrow it: both which shew it impossible for a wicked man to have any true peace in his mind, because he can have no certain grounds to build it upon; and those things do accompany his wickedness, which will certainly overthrow it:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Wicked man can have no certain foundations for his peace. By which I do not mean any contracted dulness, or bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish stupidity, which if we will call <hi>peace</hi> the most insensible parts of the creation do infinitely exceed us in it, but such a composure and settlement of our minds, which ariseth from a due consideration of things; and differs as much from the former temper as a vigorous and healthful state of body doth from the dull effects of a Lethargy. And such a peace as this no wicked man can ever have but upon one of these suppositions.</p>
            <p>Either (1.) That Wickedness is but a meer name of disgrace set upon some kind of actions, but that really there is no such a thing as sin, or the differences of good and evil; or else,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Supposing there is such a thing
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:101601:203"/>
as sin, it is ridiculous to believe there ever should be such a punishment of it as men are affrighted with;</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Or Lastly, supposing there be a punishment of sin to come, it is madness to abstain from the present pleasures of sin for the fear of it. These being only the imaginable grounds a wicked man can have any peace in his mind from; I shall particularly shew the falseness and the folly of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is no such thing as Sin or Wickedness in the world, and that the differences of good and evil are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arbitrary things, and that those are names only imposed upon things by the more cunning sort of men to affright men from the doing some actions, and to encourage them to do others. But what a miserable case are those in, who can never enjoy any contentment in themselves unless all the differences of good and evil be utterly destroyed! We should conclude that man's condition desparate, who believes it impossible for him to have any ease in his mind, unless he could be transformed into the shape of a beast, or petrified into the hardness of a rock. These are things not utterly impossible, but yet they are possible in so
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:101601:203"/>
remote a degree, that it is all one to say, he can have no ease, as to say, that he expects it only upon those terms: But it is utterly inconsistent with the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of humane nature, or a being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and acting with reason, to make all things equally good or evil. For what doth reason signifie as it respects the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, but a faculty of discerning what is good and fitting to be done, from what is evil and ought to be avoided? And to what purpose is such a faculty given us, if there be no such difference in the nature of things? Might not men with equal probability argue that there is no such thing as a difference in the things about which life and sense are conversant, as in those wherein reason is imployed? With what impatience would those men be heard who should assert that there is no such thing as a difference in the qualities of meats and drinks, but that they do all equally tend to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of life, that it is pedantical and beneath a Gentleman to talk of any such thing as <hi>Poisons,</hi> that will so suddenly and certainly destroy mens lives, and that these are things which none talk of or believe besides those whose trade is either to kill or cure men? With how
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:101601:204"/>
much wit and subtilty might a man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue upon these things, that it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any man to define what the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of poison is, or in what manner it destroys the life of man, that men have conquered the malignity of it by use, and that the same things which have been poison to some, have been food and nourishment to others? But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all these plausible arguments, none of these brave spirits dare venture the experiment upon themselves: and yet these (only changing the terms) are the very same arguments used against the natural differences of good and evil; <hi>viz.</hi> the difficulty of defining or setting the exact bounds of them, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent customs or apprehensions of men in the world concerning the things which are called good and evil. If we proceed farther to the objects of sense, how ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous would those persons appear that should with a mighty confidence go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to perswade men, that the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between light and darkness, between pleasure and pain, between smells and tasts and noises are but phantastick and imaginary things? Who would ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that those are men of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent sight to whom light and darkness
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:101601:204"/>
are equal? (for others who pretend not to so much wit, are wont to call such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons blind.) Or that those have the most exquisite sense, that feel no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of pain and pleasure, (which was wont to be thought the sign of no sense at all.) And surely the persons I am now arguing against, love their palats too well, to admire those who can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern no difference of tasts; and would be well enough contented to be thought deaf if they could put no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between the pleasant sound of vocal or instrumental Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n more ridiculous than to explore and laugh at the difference that there is in the means of life and the objects of sense. Let us now proceed higher: Dare any man say there is no such thing as Reason in Man, because there appears so little of the truth of it in Men, and so muc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the counterfeit of it in Bruits? or that there is no such thing as a difference of Truth and Falshood, because they are so commonly mistaken for one another? What reason then imaginable can there be, that there should not be as wide a
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:101601:205"/>
distance in the matters of our choice, as in the objects of our sense and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing? Is it that we have natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of sense and perception, but not of choice? that, every one is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute by his constant experience, that finds a greater liberty in his choice, than in his perception. The reason of which is wholly unintelligible, unless a difference be found in the nature of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to his choice; that some have a greater excellency and commendableness in them, more agreeable to humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, more satisfactory to the minds of those who choose them, than others are. And must all this difference be destroyed, meerly because all men are not agreed, what things are good and what evil? We call goodness the beauty of the soul; and do men question whether there be such a thing as beauty at all, because there are so many different opinions in the world about it? Or is deformity ever the less real, because the several nations of the world represent it in a colour dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from their own? Those arguments then against the natural differences of good and evil must needs appear ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, which will be granted to hold in nothing else but only the thing in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:101601:205"/>
And yet in the midst of all the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines and decays of humane nature, we find such evident footsteps and impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the differences of good and evil in the minds of men, which no force could extinguish, no time could deface, no customs could alter. Let us search the records of ancient times, and enquire into the later discoveries of nations, we shall find none so barbarous and bruitish as not to allow the differences of good and evil; so far as to acknowledge, that there are some things which naturally deserve to be praised, and others which deserve to be punished. Whereas if good and evil were meerly names of things, there can be no reason assigned, why praise and honour should necessarily belong to some things, and infamy and disgrace to follow others. If the things themselves be arbitrary, the consequences of them would be so too. But is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to imagine that any man should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be punished as much for being true to his trust, as for betraying it; for honouring his Parents, as for destroying them; for giving to every one their due, as for all the arts of injustice and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? Is it possible for men to suffer as much in their esteem, for their fidelity,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:101601:206"/>
temperance, and chastity, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do for their falseness, intemperance, and lasciviousness? How comes the very name of a lie to be a matter of so much reproach and dishonour, that the giving of it is thought an injury so great as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expiated without the satisfaction of the giver's blood, if it be in it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so indifferent a thing? Nay, I dare appeal to the consciences of the most wicked persons, whether they are so well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with themselves, when they come reeking from the satisfaction o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their lusts, and sodden with the continuance of their debaucheries, as when they have been paying their devotions to God, or their duties to their Parents, or their respects to their Country or Friends? Is there not (whether they will or no) an inward shame, and secret regret and disquiet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the one, and nothing but ease and contentment the other? What should make this difference in those persons who love their vices far more than they do the other? and if it were possible for them, would bring vertue more out of countenance than sin is: yet after all their endeavours, though vice hath the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Interest, vertue hath the greater Reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence. Thus considering humane
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:101601:206"/>
nature as it is, we find indelible chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters rema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning upon it of the natural differences of good and evil; but then if we consider it with a respect to the Maker of it, that will cast a clearer light upon them, and make those characters appear more discernible. For nothing can be more absurd than to imagine a creature owing its being, and all it hath to the bounty of a Being infinite in all Perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons, and yet not to be obliged to give all honour, worship and service to it. To rip up the bowels of a Mother to whom a man owes his coming into the world; to assassinate a Prince, to whom he owes all the honours and riches he hath in it, are crimes of so black a nature, that the worst of Men can hardly be supposed to commit them, nor the worst of Devils to defend them: But to blaspheme God and to deride his service, seems to have a much greater malignity in it, in as much, as our obligations to his honour and service, are much greater than they can be to any created Being. But if there be no natural dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of good and evil, even this must be accounted an ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fferent thing, as well as the former: and what safety can there be in conversing with those men, whom
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:101601:207"/>
no bonds of Religion, Nature, or Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude can tye? Let us, if it were possible, suppose a Society of men constituted of such who make all things equally good and evil in their own nature, what a monstrous <hi>Leviathan</hi> would they make among them? no Religion, no Law, no Kindness, no Promises, no Trust, no Contracts could ever oblige them not to do any thing which they thought might be done with safety. By which it appears that these principles are so inconsistent with humane Nature, and all the bonds of Religion and Duty, that whoever owns them must suppose man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind more savage than the beasts of prey, he must renounce his Reason, destroy all Religion, and disown a Deity. For if there be a God, we must be inviolably bound to observe and obey him; and the very notion of a God implies a Being infinitely perfect; and if there be such perfections in God, they cannot but be so in their own nature, and if they be so in their own nature, they must in their degree be so in us as well as in him; so that if Goodness, Holiness and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness be absolute perfections as they are in God, they must be perfections so far as they are in us; and the contrary
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:101601:207"/>
must be imperfections; which makes the differences of good and evil so far from being arbitrary, that those things which agree to the perfections of God as well as his will must needs be good, and those which are repugnant to them must needs be evil. The result of all is, that if a wicked man can have no peace in his mind, without overthrowing the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of good and evil, he can have no peace without the greatest violence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God, to nature, and himself; and if this be the way to Peace, let his Reason judge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second foundation which a wicked man must build his peace upon is, that supposing there be such a thing as sin, yet that men have no cause to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb themselves with the fears of so great a punishment to follow after, as that which sinners are afrighted with. But what security can a sinner have against the fears of punishment when his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence condemns him for the guilt of his sins? Is it that God takes no notice at all of the actions of men, that he will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb his own eternal peace and happiness by observing all their follies? So some of old imagined, who pretended that out of meer kindness to the Deity they gave
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:101601:208"/>
him his <hi>Quietus est,</hi> and took from him as much as in them lay, the care and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world: but it was really a greater kindness to their lusts which made them do it, and makes many now-a-days so willing upon the same frivolous pretences to exclude the providence of God out of the world; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or can any man who considers what God is, think his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence inconsistent with his happiness? If we speak of such weak and imperfect Beings as the wises<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:101601:208"/>
they might indulge themselves in greater security: but to suppose his Wisdom so great that he cannot but know their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and his Power so irresistible, that it is impossible for them to stand before him when he designs to punish; to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themselves with the hopes of impunity is an extravagant piece of folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Or is it then, that though God doth take notice of their actions, he will not be so much displeased as to punish them? but this is as repugnant to the Justice and Holiness of God, as the other was to his Wisdom and Power. Will not the righteous God, who hath made Laws to govern mankind, see to the execution of them? for if he did not hate sin, why did he so strictly forbid it? if he doth hate sin, he will severely punish it. Nay hath he not been severe already in the execution of his judgments upon the world for sin? what did <hi>Adam</hi> and his posterity suffer for the first sin? what did the old world, <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> the people of the Jews suffer for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? And is not he the same God still? Is his hand shortned that he cannot strike, or doth his heart fail that he dare not punish? Surely of all nations we have no cause to think so, and of all Ages, not

Is it at last, that though God may sometimes punish men in this life for their sins, he will never do it in that to come? If he could have said it was impossible he should do it, and proved it sufficiently, there might have been some ground for his security, but that is impossible he should ever do; but to hope he will not do it when he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he will, is instead of bringing peace to his own mind to set God at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with himself.

            <p n="3">3. But after all this, is it possible to suppose, that any should think their present pleasures would countervail all the miseries of another life? which is the last imaginable foundation for a sinner's peace, while he continues in his wickedness.

And that not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the after-pain would so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the present pleasure; but because the fears of that pain to come must abate proportionably of the pleasure which might otherwise be enjoyned. Suppose a man certainly knew that upon the pleasing his palat with the most excellent wine, and gratifying his appetite with the most delicate food, he must be racked with the Stone, and tormented with the Gout as long as he should live; can we imagine such a person could have any pleasure in his mind (whatever his palat had) in the enjoyment of them while he did consider the consequent of them.

I do not now ask, what the sinner will then think of all his Atheism and Infidelity when the greatness of his misery shall convince him that it is an Almighty hand which lays it upon him; nor what pleasure he can have in the thoughts of his former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, when not one drop can be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the mitigation of his flames? nor what satisfaction those lusts have given him, the very thoughts of which pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O foolish sinners, who hath bewitched

As though the unsaying what we had done, or wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we had done otherwise since we can do it no longer, (for that is the bottom of all putting off repentance to the last) were abundant compensation to the justice of God, for the affronts of his Majesty, contempt of his Laws, abuse of his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and all the large indictments of wilful and presumptuous sins, which the whole course of our lives is charged with.

            <p n="1">1. The reflections of his Mind, which he can neither hinder nor be pleased with. No doubt if it were possible for him to deprive himself of the greatest excellency of his being, it would be the first work he would do, to break the glass which shews him his deformity.

               <hi>and the wrath of God revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men?</hi> I know that wicked men in the height of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries pretend to be above these things, and are ready to laugh at them as the effects of a strong spleen and a weak brain: but I appeal to their most sober thoughts, when the streams of wine are evaporated, and the intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evil company is removed from them, when in the deep and silent night, they revolve in their minds the actions of the foregoing day; what satisfaction they then take in all the sinful pleasures they have pursued so eagerly? but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when either their lusts have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:101601:213"/>

How mean and poor would they leave themselves if with all their honours and riches they could purchase to themselves, a reprieve from death and from the miseries which follow after it? what would they then give for the comfort of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the fruit of a holy, righteous, and sober life? with what another sense of Religion do men whose minds are awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened speak then, in comparison of what they did in the days of their mirth and jollity? Neither is this <hi>to take them at the greatest disadvantage,</hi> as some of them have been ready to say; for I suppose their minds as clear then as at any time, and so much the clearer, because freed from the impediments of such freedom of their thoughts at another time; for the same thoughts would have possessed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, only the pleasures and the hopes of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:101601:213"/>
life diverted their minds from them; but now the nearness of the things they feared, and the weight and consequence of them make them more diligently examine and impartially consider them. But that demonstrates the great misery of a sinner's State; that what cures the other greatest troubles of our life, doth the most increase his, which is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of reason and consideration, that allays the power of griefs, that easeth the mind of vain fears, that prevents many troubles and cures others, that governs other passions and keeps them in their due bounds; but this is it which of all things doth the most increase the trouble of a wicked man's mind; for the more he considers, the worse he finds his condition; and while he finds his condition so bad, he can never enjoy any peace in his mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The violence of his Passions: those a wicked man hath lost the command of, or else he could never be a wicked man; and whosoever is under the power of any unruly passion, forfeits all his peace by it. For what peace can ever be expected in such a State of violence and usurpation, where the calm govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reason is cast off as an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:101601:214"/>
burden, and every passion under the pretence of liberty sets up for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power? Nay what confusion and disorder must needs follow, where the powers of the mind, which ought to keep all in order, are themselves in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their own slaves: and none ever govern so ill as those which ought to obey. How serene and quiet is the mind of a man where the superiour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties preserve their just authority? How composed is his temper, how mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate his desires, how well governed his fears! But where once that authority is lost, how extravagant is the rage of men, how unruly their lusts, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant their fears! What peace had <hi>Xerxes</hi> in his mind, when in stead of conquering his foolish passion, he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged Mount <hi>Athos</hi> into the field, and no doubt would have run fast enough if he had seen it moving? What pleasure was it to see that mighty Monarch whip the Sea in a rage, as though the Waves had been under his discipline, and would run the faster for the fear of his rod? What harm had the hair of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if such things ever break forth into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what may we conceive the inward disturbance is, where the outward shew (which usually dissembles the inward passion,) betrayed so much rage and disorder; for where such flames break out, what combustion may we conceive within? But it is not only this kind of passion which is so great an enemy to the peace of a man's mind, but when his desires are restless, and his fears un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable; and this is the case of
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:101601:215"/>
every wicked man. His lusts inflame him and the means he uses to quench them inrage them more; his ambition grows greater as his honour doth; and there is no hopes of a cure, where the disease thrives under the remedy; his love of riches is necessary to maintain his honour and feed his lusts; and where passions so great, so many, so different, all increase by being gratified, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance and confusion follows? But supposing that vices in men may agree (as the Devils in Hell do) to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of men's souls; yet what secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can a wicked man have against the power of his fears? and we all know no passion disquiets more than that doth? And how many sorts of fears possess a sinner's mind? fears of disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For no sound reason can be given against his fears, but the strongest arguments in the world to confirm them. Nay the greatest grounds of others comforts are

the strongest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All other ways are but tricks and devices, and there are many of them in the hearts of men, but the Counsel of the Lord that shall stand against them all; and that Counsel he hath declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> by the mouth of another Prophet, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Jer. 18.9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>At what instant I shall speak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Nation and concerning a Kingdom to build and to plant it; if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then will I repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.</hi> Thus we find it was in this people of the Jews, upon their first return from captivity they shewed some zeal towards the rebuilding the Temple and setling the worship of God there; but this fit did not hold them long, they soon fell back to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> sins and disobedience to the Laws of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:101601:216"/>
God; upon this they brake out into greater schisms and factions in matters of Religion than ever were known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them before; for then the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> fell into a separation under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of greater sanctity and severity of life, and these by their shew of zeal gained a mighty interest among the people, so great that the Princes stood in awe of them: then the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> (who were most part Courtiers, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> tells us) out of opposition to the other, looked on Religion as a meer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical institution, cried out against facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and popularity, and questioned at least whether there were any Spirits or life to come. And what peace followed upon these things? very little among themselves we may be sure by the heats and animosities that were continually among them; the issue of which was, the Temple was profaned by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> rifled by <hi>Pompey;</hi> their own Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and Usurpers ruled over them; and when the Son of God himself could not reclaim them, their Temple, Nation, and Government were all involved in one common ruin. Thus we see how these words of the Prophet were fulfilled upon this people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:101601:217"/>But some have been ready to say <hi>that God's proceedings with the Iews ought not to be drawn into an example to any other nations, because his dealings with them were peculiar, and by vertue of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Covenant which God made with them, which he hath not done with any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world.</hi> This objection were of great force, if God himself had not in the words before mentioned, declared the same concerning any other Nation or Kingdom, and if the instances were not as remarkable in other people as in that of the Jews. If we search the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of former Ages, and consider the strange revolutions which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the mighty Empires and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World; we shall find no one circumstance more considerable in them than this, That the Nations which God hath made use of for a scourge to others, have been remarkable for nothing so much, as for the vertues opposite to the most prevailing vices among those who were overcome by them. Thus when the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Monarchy fell, the <hi>Persians</hi> who were the sword in God's right hand, were eminent for nothing more than their great temperance and frugality, while the <hi>Babylonians</hi> perished
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:101601:217"/>
by their luxury and effeminacy. And when the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy degenerated into the same vices, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were raised up to be the executioners of God's wrath upon them, because they were at that time freer than any other people from those softening and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vices. And when the <hi>Persian</hi> luxury had infected their Conquerours, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Discipline and Vertue of the <hi>Romans</hi> made them more successful in subduing the rema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nders of the <hi>Groecian</hi> Empire, than their courage and number could. And when the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves (after a long time of God's forbearance with them, and several respites from punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the vertue and conduct of such excellent Princes as <hi>Antoninus</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Severus</hi> in the Heathen, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> in the Christian Empire) fell into as great a degeneracy of manners as any we ever read of, then did God let loose (as it were) the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> and other barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of their several Dens, who seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be designed rather to destroy than to conquer.

<pb n="428" facs="tcp:101601:218"/>
was it their long practice and skill in military affairs? No, they were rude and unexperinced: was it their mighty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage? No, they were despised by the <hi>Romans</hi> as great Cowards, and begged for peace when it was denied them. But as <note n="(a)" place="margin">

The <hi>Goths</hi> were devout and pious, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging divine providence, making their solemn supplications to God before their victories, and returning him the praise of them afterwards; but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were fallen into that degree of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion and <hi>Atheism,</hi> that nothing was more common among them than to droll upon Religion. <note n="(b)" place="margin">

confessed themselves, and where they conquered, <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 168.</note> as he particularly speaks of the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> they purged all the stews of uncleanness, and made so great a reformation by the severity of their Laws, that even the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves were chast among them. Thus we see how those great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Empires have been broken to pieces by the weight of their impieties falling upon them.</p>
            <p>May the consideration then of these things move us in time to a reformation of our lives, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore our iniquities grow full and ripe for vengeance. We have seen many revolutions, and God knows how many more we may see; if that should be true of us, which the same Author saith of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the midst of all their changes, <hi>Sola tantum vitia perdurant,</hi> their vices remained the same still. Thanks be to God, that things have a fairer appearance at present than they have had, and never so good a time to amend as now: but if men flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themselves with present security, and their sins increase as their fears abate, the clouds which seem dispersed may soon gather again, and the face of the Heavens will change if we do not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:101601:219"/>And if it be not in our power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim others from their sins, let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to preserve the honour of our Church by amending our own, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince our enemies by living better than they. And give me leave to say, and so I conclude, that among all the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients which have been thought of for the peace of this Church and Nation, that of leaving off our sins, and leading vertuous and exemplary lives, will at last prove to be the most successful.</p>

            <p>IF ever any Religion was in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects accomplished for so noble a design as the reformation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it was the Christian, whether we consider the Authority of those who first delivered it, or the weight of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contained in it, and their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness to the most prevailing passions of humane nature. Although the world was strangely degenerated before the coming of Christ; yet not to so great a degree, but that there were some who not only saw the necessity of a cure, but
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:101601:220"/>
offered their assistance in order to it; whose attempts proved the more vain and fruitless, because they laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same distempers themselves which they offered to cure in others; or the method they prescribed was mean and trivial, doubtful and uncertain, or else too nice and subtle to do any great good upon the world. But Christianity had not only a mighty advantage by the great holiness of those who preached it; but by the clearness and evidence, the strength and efficacy of those arguments which they used to perswade men. The nature of them is such, that none who understand them can deny them to be great; their clearness such, that none that hear them can choose but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them; the manner of recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them such, as all who understood themselves could not but desire to hear them. No arguments can be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to mankind than those which work upon their reason and consideration; no motives can stir up more to the exercise of this than their own happiness and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; no happiness and misery can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be so much considered as that which is eternal. And this eternal state is that which above all other things the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:101601:220"/>
Christian Religion delivers with the greatest plainness, confirms with the strongest evidence, and enforces upon the consciences of men with the most powerful and perswasive Rhetorick. I need not go beyond my text for the proof of this, wherein we see that the Apostles design was <hi>to perswade men, i.e.</hi> to convince their judgments, to gain their affections, to reform their lives; that the argument they used for this end was no less than <hi>the terrour of the Lord,</hi> not the frowns of the World, nor the fear of Men, nor the malice of Devils; but the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Almighty, whose Majesty makes even the Devils tremble, whose Power is irresistible, and whose Wrath is insupportable. But it is not <hi>the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Lord</hi> in this world, which he here speaks of, although that be great enough to make us as miserable as we can be in this State: but <hi>the terrour of the Lord</hi> which shall appear at the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day of judgment, of which he speaks in the verse before the text. <note n="(a)" place="margin">V. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The argument the Apostle makes choice of to perswade men by, <hi>viz. the terrour of the Lord.</hi> In the Gospel we find a mixture of the highest cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and the greatest severity, the richest mercy and the strictest justice, the most glorious rewards and intollerable punishments; accordingly we find God therein described as a tender Father, and as a terrible Judge, as a God of peace,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:101601:221"/>
and as a God of vengeance, as an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting happiness and a consuming fire; and the Son of God as coming once with great humility, and again with Majesty and great glory; once, with all the infirmities of humane nature, and again with all the demonstrations of a Divine power and presence; once, as the Son of God to take away the sins of the world by his death and passion; and again, as Judge of the world with fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire to execute vengeance on all impenitent sinners. The intermixing of these in the doctrine of the Gospel was necessary in order to the benefit of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by it, that such whom the conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension of his first appearance could not oblige to leave off their sins, the terrour of his second may astonish when they foresee the account that will be taken of their ingratitude and disobedience; that such who are apt to despise the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his birth, the poverty of his life, and the shame of his death, may be filled with horrour and amazement when they consider the Majesty of his second coming in the clouds <note n="(a)" place="margin">Jud. v. 15.</note>

               <hi>But the day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the night, in which the Heavens shall pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a great noise, and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat; the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up.</hi> This day will come <hi>as a Thief in the night</hi> by way of surprise, when it is not looked for, and that makes it so much the more dreadful. A lesser cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity coming suddenly doth astonish more, than a far greater which hath been long expected; for, surprisals con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the least astonishing circumstances of the misery men fall into, what unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable horrour will possess their minds at the apprehension of it? what confusion and amazement may we imagine the soul of that man in, whom our Saviour speaks of in his parable, who being pleased with the fulness of his condition, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Luke 12.19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>said to his soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink and be merry: but God said to him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be repaired of thee; then whose shall those things be that thou hast provided?</hi> Had God only said, This night shall thy barns be burnt, and thy substance consumed to ashes, which thou hast laid up for so many years, that would have caused a strange consternation in him for the present, but he might have comforted himself with the hopes of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and getting more. But, <hi>this night shall thy soul be required of thee:</hi> O dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful words! O the tremblings of body, the anguish of mind, the pangs and convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of conscience which such a one is tormented with at the hearing of them! What sad reflections doth he presently make upon his own folly? And must all the mirth and case I promised my self for so many years, be at an end now in a
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:101601:223"/>
very few hours? Nay, must my mirth be so suddenly turned into bitter howlings, and my ease into a bed of flames? Must my soul be thus torn away from the things it loved, and go where it will hate to live and can never die? O miserable creature! to be thus deceived by my own folly, to be surprised after so many warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to betray my self into everlasting misery? Fear, horrour and despair have already taken hold on me, and are carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, where they will never leave me.</p>
            <p>These are the Agonies but of one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle person whom death snatches away in the midst of his years, his pleasures and his hopes: but such as these the greatest part of the world will fall into when that terrible day of the Lord shall come. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Luke 17.26, 27, 28, 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>For as it was in the days of</hi> Noe; <hi>so shall it be also in the day of the Son of Man; they did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that</hi> Noe <hi>entred into the Ark; and the flood came and destroyed them all: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise also as it was in the days of</hi> Lot, <hi>they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that</hi> Lot <hi>went out of</hi> Sodom, <hi>it rained fire and brimstone from Heaven and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed them all: Even thus shall it be in

               <hi>For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole Earth.</hi> If some of these expressions seem to relate to the unexpected coming of Christ to judgment upon <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> we are to consider that was not only a <hi>fore-runner,</hi> but a <hi>figure</hi> of Christ's coming to judge the World. And that may be the great reason why our Saviour mixeth his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of both these so much together as he doth: for not only the judgment upon that nation was a draught, as it were, <hi>in little</hi> of the great day, but the symptoms and fore-runners of the one were to bear a proportion with the other: among which the strange security of that people before their destruction was none of the least. And the surprise shall be so much the more astonishing when the day of the Lord shall come upon the whole World, as the terrour and consequents of that universal judgment shall exceed the overthrow of the Jewish Polity.</p>
            <p>But supposing men were aware of its approach and prepared for it; the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple and City of <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> though so frightful a spectacle to the beholders of it, was but a mean repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the terrour that shall be at
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:101601:224"/>
the conflagration of the whole World. When <hi>the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise,</hi> or with a mighty force, as some interpret it, <hi>and the Elements shall melt with fervent beat; i. e.</hi> when all the fiery bodies in the upper regions of this World, which have been kept so long in an even and regular course with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their several limits, shall then be let loose again, and by a more rapid and violent motion shall put the World into confusion and a flame together. For then the present frame of things shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and the bounds set to the more subtile and active parts of matter shall be taken away; which mixing with the more gross and earthy, shall sever them from each other, and by their whirling and agitation set them all on fire. And if <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rev. 6.13.</note> 
               <hi>the Stars falling to the Earth,</hi> were to be understood in a literal sense, none seems so probable as this, That those ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal fires shall then be scattered and dispersed throughout the Universe, so that the Earth and all the works that are therein shall be turned into one funeral Pile. Then the foundations of the Earth shall be shaken, and all the combustible matter which lies hid in the bowels of it shall break forth into prodigious
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:101601:224"/>
flames; which while it rouls up and down within, making it self a passage out, will cause an universal quaking in all parts of the Earth, and make the Sea to roar with a mighty noise, which will either by the violent heat spend it self in vapour and smoak, or be swallowed up in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low places of the deep. Neither are we to imagine that only the sulphureous matter within the Earth shall by its kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling produce so general a conflagration, (although some Philosophers of old thought that sufficient for so great an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) but as it was in the deluge of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Gen. 7.11.</note> 
               <hi>the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were opened;</hi> so shall it be in <hi>this deluge of fire,</hi> as one of the ancients calls it, not only mighty streams and rivers of Fire shall issue out of the bowels of the earth; but the cataracts above shall discharge such abundance of thunder and lightning, wherein God will rain down fire and brimstone from Heaven, that nothing shall be able to withstand the force of it. Then the <hi>Craters</hi> or breaches made in the earth by horrible earthquakes, caused by the violent erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Fire, shall be wide enough to swallow up not only Cities but whole
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:101601:225"/>
Countries too: And what shall remain of the spoils of this devouring enemy within, shall be consumed by the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less fury of the thunder and lightning above. What will then become of all the glories of the world which are now so much admired and courted by foolish men? What will then become of the most magnificent piles, the most curious structures, the most stately palaces, the most lasting monuments, the most pleasant gardens, and the most delightful countries? they shall be all buried in one common heap of ruines, when the whole face of the earth shall be like the top of mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> nothing but rubbish, and stones, and ashes, which, unskilful travellers have at a distance mistaken for Snow. What will then become of the pride and gallantry of the vain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the large possessions of the great, or the vast treasures of the rich? the more they have had of these things only, the more fuel they have made for this destroying fire, which will have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the honours, the greatness, or the riches of Men. Nay, what will then become of <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Pet. 3.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, who have scoffed at all these things, and walked after their own lusts, saying,

Where is this promise of his coming, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all things yet continue as they were from the beginning of the creation?</hi> When this great day of his wrath is come, how shall they be able to stand or escape his fury? Will they fly to the tops of the mountains? that were only to stand more ready to be destroyed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Will they hide themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains? but there they fall into the burning furnaces of the earth; and <hi>the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains may fall upon them, but can never hide them from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi> Will they go down into the deep and convey themselves to the uttermost parts of the Sea? but even there the storms and tempests of these shours of fire shall overtake them, and the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God shall pursue them to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting flames.</p>
            <p>Consider now whether so dreadful a preparation for Christ's coming to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be not one great reason why it should be called <hi>the terrour of the Lord?</hi> For can any thing be imagined more full of horror and amazement than to see the whole world in a flame about us? We may remember (and I hope we yet do so) when the flames of one City
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:101601:226"/>
filled the minds of all the beholders with astonishment and fear: but what then would it do, not only to see the earth vomit and cast forth fire every where about us, and the Sea to boyl and swell and froth like water in a seething pot, but to hear nothing but perpetual claps of thunder, and to see no light in the Heavens, but what the flashings of lightning give? Could we imagine our selves at a convenient distance to behold the eruption of a burning mountain, such as <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Vesuvius</hi> are, when the Earth about it trembles and groans, the Sea foams and rages, and the bowels of the Mountain roar through impatience of casting forth its burden, and at last gives it self ease by sending up a mixture of flames, and ashes, and smoak, and a flood of fire, spreading far and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where-ever it runs; yet even this, though it be very apt to put men in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions and fears of this great day, falls very far short of the terrour of it. Could we yet farther suppose that at the same time we could see fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone raining from Heaven on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> the earth opening to devour <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, <hi>Belshazzar</hi> trembling at the hand-writing against
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:101601:226"/>
the wall, and the Jews destroying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the fire of their Temple and City, this may somewhat higher advance our imaginations of the horror of the World's conflagration, but yet we cannot reach the greatness of it: in as much <hi>as the Heavens and the Earth which are now, are kept in store,</hi> saith the Apostle, <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Pet. 3.7.</note> 
               <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served unto fire against the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perdition of ungodly men;</hi> even those heavens whose beauty, and order, and motion, and influence we now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and that earth whose fruitful womb and richly adorned surface affords all the conveniencies of the life of man, must either be destroyed or at least pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and refined by this last and dreadful Fire. The expressions of which in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being so frequent, so particular, so plain in Writers not affecting the losty Prophetical stile, wherein fire is often used only to express the wrath of God, make it evident, that their meaning is not barely that the world shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by the anger of God, but that this destruction shall be by real fire, which adds more to the sensible ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of it, to all that shall behold it.</p>

               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:101601:227"/>2. The terrour of Christ's appearance in that day. The design of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in setting forth the coming of Christ to judgment is to represent it in such a manner to us as is most apt to strike us with awe and terrour at the apprehension of it. Now the greatest appearance of Majesty among men is, either when a mighty Prince marches triumphantly in the midst of a Royal Army, with all the splendor of a Court and the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of a Camp, having his greatest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants about him, and sending his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers before him, who with the sound of Trumpets give notice of his approach, and is every-where received with the shouts and acclamations of the people: or else, of a Prince, sitting upon his Throne of Majesty, set forth with all the Ornaments of State and Greatness, with all his Nobles and Courtiers standing about his Throne, and in his own Person calling Malefactors to account; and both these ways the appearance of Christ upon his second coming is represented to us, first <note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. 24.25.</note> 
               <hi>as coming in the clouds of Heaven, i. e.</hi> riding triumphantly (as it were upon a Chariot) on a body of light, brighter than the Son, having <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Thes. 1.7.</note>

               <hi>after whom the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the vioce of the Archangel and with the trump of God.</hi> Not as though we were to imagine any material trumpet, as some have grossly done, whose sound could reach over the whole earth; but the sound of the last trumpet seems to be the same with <note n="(c)" place="margin">John 5.25.</note> 
               <hi>the voice of the Son of God, which the dead are said to hear and live; i. e.</hi> it shall be an effectual power for raising the dead, which may be therefore called <hi>the sound of the Trumpet,</hi> because it supplies the use of one in call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all people together, and doth more lively represent to our capacities the Majesty of Christ's appearance with all the Heavenly host of Angels and Saints.

               </gap>y consider the importance of them. It is true indeed, wicked men in this world are so little apprehensive of the misery <hi>of departing from God,</hi> that they are ready to bid God depart from them, and place no mean part of their felicity in keeping themselves at a distance from him. The true reason of which is, that while they pursue their lusts, the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ughts of God are disquieting to them; as no man that robs his neighbour loves to think of the Judge while he does it, not as though his condition were securer by it, but when men are not wise enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a danger, they are so great fools to count it their wisdom not to think of it. But therein lies a great part of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of another world, that men shall not be able to cheat and abuse themselves with false notions, and shews of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The clouds they have embraced for Deities shall then vanish into smoke; all the satisfaction they ever imagined in their lusts shall be wholly gone, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the sad remembrance of them, left behind to torment them. All the Philosophy in the world will never make men understand their true happiness so
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:101601:234"/>
much, as one hours experience of another State will do: all men shall know better, but some shall be more happy and others more miserable by it. The righteous shall not only see God, but know what the seeing of God means, and that the greatest happiness we are capable of is implyed therein; and the wicked shall not only be bid to depart from him, but shall then find that the highest misery imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable is comprehended in it. It is a great instance of the weakness of our capacities here, that our discourses concerning the happiness and misery of a future life, are like those of Children about affairs of State, which they represent to themselves in a way agreeable to their own Childish fancies; thence the Poetical dreams of <hi>Elysian</hi> fields, and turning wheels, and rouling stones, and such like imaginations. Nay, the Scripture it self sets forth the joys and torments of another world in a way more suited to our fancy than our understanding; thence we read <hi>of sitting down with</hi> Abraham, Isaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, to represent the happiness of that State, and of <hi>a gnawing worm,</hi> and a <hi>devouring</hi> fire and <hi>blackness of darkness</hi> to set forth the misery of it. But as the happiness of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aven doth infinitely exceed the most
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:101601:235"/>
lofty metaphors of Scripture, so doth the misery of Hell the most dreadful represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that can be made of it. Although a worm gnawing our entrails, and a fire consuming our outward parts be very sensible and moving metaphors, yet they cannot fully express the anguish and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the soul, which must be so much greater, as it is more active and sensible, than our bodies can be. Take a man that afflicts himself under the sense of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable disgrace, or calamity befallen him; or that is oppressed with the guilt of some horrid wickedness, or sunk into the depth of despair; the Agonies and Torments of his Mind may make us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the nature of that misery, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he falls short of the degrees of it. And were this misery to be of no long continuance, yet the terror of it must needs be great; but when <hi>the worm shall never dye,</hi> and <hi>the fire shall never be quenched,</hi> when insupportable misery shall be everlasting, nothing can then be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the terrour of it: and this is as plainly contained in the sentence of wicked men, as any thing else is. But here men think they may justly <hi>plead with God and talk with him of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>; what proportion, say they, is
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:101601:235"/>
there <hi>between the sins of this short life and the eternal misery of another?</hi> which objection is not so great in it self as it appears to be by the weak answers, which have been made to it; When to assign a proportion, they have made a strange kind of infinity in sin, either from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which unavoidably makes all sins equal, or from the wish of a sinner that he might have an eternity to sin in, which is to make the justice of God's pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments to be not according to their works, but to their wishes; But we need not strain things so much beyond what they will bear to vindicate God's Justice in this matter. Is it not thought just and reasonable among men, for a man to be confined to perpetual imprisonment for a fault he was not half an hour in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting? Nay do not all the Laws of the world make death the punishment of some crimes, which may be very suddenly done? And what is death, but the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal depriving a man of all the comforts of life? And shall a thing then so constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practised and universally justified in the world, be thought unreasonale when it is applyed to God? <hi>It is true,</hi> may some say, <hi>if annihilation were all that was meant by eternal death, there could be no

            <p n="3">3. The efficacy of this argument for the perswading men to a reformation of heart and life; <hi>knowing the terrour of the Lord we perswade men.</hi> For as another Apostle reasons from the same argument, <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Pet. 3.11.</note> 
               <hi>Seeing all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness?</hi> There is
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:101601:238"/>
great variety of arguments in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion to perswade men to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but none more sensible and moving to the generality of mankind than this. Especially considering these two things;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That if this argument doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men, there is no reason to expect any other should.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the condition of such persons is desperate, who cannot by any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be perswaded to leave off their sins.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is no reason to expect any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument should perswade men if this of the terror of the Lord do it not. If an almighty power cannot awaken us, if infinite justice cannot affright us, if a judgment to come cannot make us trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and eternal misery leave no impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon us, what other arguments or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods can we imagine would reclaim us from our sins? We have been too sad an instance our selves, of the ineffectualness of other means of amendment by the mercies and judgments of this present life: have ever any people had a greater mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of both these, than we have had in the compass of a few years? If the wisest persons in the world had been to have set down beforehand the method of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a sinful nation, they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, they would have imagined, that after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during many miseries and hardships, when they were almost quite sunk under despair, if God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hould give them a sudden and unexpected deliverance, meer ingenuity and thankfulness would make them afraid to displease a God of so much kindness. But if so great a flash of joy and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity instead of that should make them grow wanton and extravagant, what course then so likely to reclaim them, as a series of smart and severe judgments one upon another, which might suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently warn yet not totally destroy. These we have had experience of, and of worse than all these, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by them. For are the Laws of God less broken, or the duties of Religion less contemned and despised after all these? What vices have been forsaken, what lusts have men been reclaimed from, nay what one sort of sin hath been less in fashion than before? Nay, have not their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as well as their aggravation, increased among us? Is our zeal for our established Religion greater? Is our faith more firm and settled, our devotion more constant, our Church less in danger of either of the
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:101601:239"/>
opposite factions than ever it was? Nay is it not rather like a neck of land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two rough and boisterous seas, which rise and swell, and by the breaches they make in upon us, threaten an inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? By all which we see what necessity there is that God should govern this world by the considerations of another; that when neither judgments nor mercies can make men better in this life; judgment without mercy should be their portion in another. O the infatuating power of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in! when neither the pity of an indulgent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor the frowns of a severe Judge can draw us from it: when neither the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter passion of the Son of God for our sins, nor his threatning to come again to take vengeance upon us for them, can make us hate and abhor them: when neither the shame nor contempt, the diseases and reproaches which follow sin in this world, nor the intolerable anguish and misery of another can make men sensible of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them so as to forsake them. Could we but represent to our minds that State wherein we must all shortly be, when the bustle and hurry, the pleasures and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, the courtships and entertainments of this world shall be quite at an end with us, and every one must give an account of
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:101601:239"/>
himself to God; what another opinion of these things should we have in our minds, with what abhorrency should we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every temptation to sin, how should we loath the sight of those who either betrayed us into sin or flattered us when we had committed it? Could men but ask themselves that reasonable question, why they will defie God by violating his known Laws, unless they be sure he either cannot or will not punish them for it? they would be more afraid of doing it than they are, for supposing both, to do it, is perfect madness: to question his power who is Almighty, or his will who hath declared it and is immutable is the height of folly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The condition of such is desperate whom no arguments can perswade to leave their sins. For there can be no breaking prison in that other State, no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaping tryal, no corrupting the Judge, no reversing the sentence, no pardon after judgment, no reprieve from punishment, no abatement or end of misery. How canst thou then hope, O impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, either to fly from or to endure that wrath of God that is coming swiftly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee to arrest thee by death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey thee to thy tormenting prison? canst
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:101601:240"/>
thou hope, that God will discharge thee before that dreadful day comes, when he hath confined thee thither in order to it? Canst thou hope that day will never come which the vindication of God's Justice, the honour of Christ, the happiness of the blessed, as well as the punishment of the wicked make so necessary that it should come? or canst thou hope to defend thy self against an all-seeing eye, a most righteous Judge and an accusing consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence when that day doth come? when all the mercies thou hast abused, the judgements thou hast slighted, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of grace thou hast resisted, the checks of conscience thou hast stifled, and the sins of all kinds thou hast committed, shall rise up in judgment to condemn thee? O that we had all the wisdom to consider of these things in time, that the terror of the Lord may perswade us to break off all our sins by a sincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IF we look into the twenty fourth verse of this Chapter we shall find our Saviour there laying down such hard conditions of mens being his Disciples, as were, to all appearance, more likely to have driven away those which he had already, than to have drawn any others after him: For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no less than the greatest readiness
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:101601:241"/>
to suffer for his sake, and that to no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a degree than the loss of what is most precious to men in this world, in their lives; which is implyed in those words; <hi>If any man will come after me let him deny himself, and take up his Cross and follow me:</hi> If our Saviour had only designed to have made himself great by the number of his followers, if he had intended a Kingdom in this world, as the Jews imagined, he would have made more easie conditions of being his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; He would have chosen another way to have attained his end, and made use of more pleasing and popular arguments to have perswaded the people to follow him. When the Eastern Impostor afterwards began to set up for a new Religion he took a method as contrary to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours as his Religion and design was: he knew the Greatness and Honour, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and the pomp of this world, were the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngs most passionately loved and admired by the generality of mankind; and therefore he fitted his Religion to the natural inclinations of men, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such means of advancing it as were most like to make men great by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them. And men are never so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be cheated by any Religion, as
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:101601:241"/>
that which complies with their present interests and gratifies their sensual incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. In this case there need not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arguments to court persons to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that which they were so strongly inclined to before; and the very name of Religion does them great service when it allows what they most desire, and makes them sin with a quiet Conscience.</p>
            <p>But that is the peculiar honour of Christianity, that as it can never be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be a design for this world, so it hath risen and spread it self by ways directly contrary to the Splendor and Greatness of it: For it overcame by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, increased by persecutions, and prevailed in the world by the patience and self-denial of its followers. He that was the first Preacher of it, was the greatest example of suffering himself; and he bids his Disciples not to think much of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Lord and Saviour though it were <hi>to take up the Cross</hi> and lay down their lives for his sake. We may easily imagine how much startled and surprized his Disciples were at such discourses as these, who being possessed with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of the temporal Kingdom of the Messias, came to him with great expectations of honour and advancement
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:101601:242"/>
by him; and no less would content some of them, than being his highest Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and Ministers of State, <hi>sitting at his right hand, and at his left hand in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> they had already in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shared the preferments and dignities of his Kingdom among themselves; and were often contending about prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, <hi>who should be the greatest among them.</hi> Insomuch, that when Christ now, the time of his suffering approaching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan more plainly to discourse to them of <hi>his own sufferings at</hi> Hierusalem, <hi>v.</hi> 21. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> either out of his natural for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness and heat, or being elevated by the good opinion which our Lord had expressed of him before, <hi>v.</hi> 17. takes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him very solemnly to rebuke him for ever thinking to submit himself to so mean a condition; <hi>Be it far from thee, Lord; this shall not be unto thee,</hi> v. 22. upon which, Jesus not only reproves <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> with great smartness and severity, as savouring more of the pomp and ease of the world, than of the nature and design of his Kingdom; <hi>v.</hi> 23. but takes this occasion to tell his Disciples, that they must no longer dream of the Glories and Splendor of this world, nor entertain themselves with vain Fancies of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:101601:242"/>
and contentments of this life; but if they would shew themselves to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Disciples they must prepare for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions and Martyrdoms, they must value their Religion above their lives; for the time was now coming on, they must part with one or the other; and if they were not prepared before-hand by self-denial and taking up the Cross, they would run great hazard of losing their souls for the love of this world: and therefore our Saviour shews,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great advantage that would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to them, if they were willing to suffer for his sake. <hi>Whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it,</hi> v. 25. <hi>i. e.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of this short and uncertain life, which would spend it self in a little time, he should have one infinitely more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and therefore no exchange could be better made, than that of laying down such a life as this for one of eternal Happiness and Glory; for so our Saviour elsewhere explains it, <hi>He that hateth his life in this world, shall keep it unto life eternal, St.</hi> Joh. 12.25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The great folly of losing this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal state of happiness for the preservation of this present life, or the enjoyment of the things of this world: which he first
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:101601:243"/>
lays down a certain truth, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>For whosoever shall save his life shall lose it,</hi> and then discovers the folly of it in the words of the text, by comparing such a mans gain and his loss together, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing he should obtain the utmost that can be hoped for in this world. <hi>For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein we may consider these three particulars;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The possibility supposed of losing the soul; though a man should gain the whole world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The hazard implied of the loss of the soul for the sake of the gain of the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The folly expressed of losing the soul, though it be for the gain of the whole world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The possibility supposed of the loss of the soul in another world; For the force of our Saviours argument depends wholly on the supposition of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the souls Being in another state; and its capacity of happiness or misery therein. For, setting that aside there can be no argument strong enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any man to part not only with
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:101601:243"/>
what he hath or hopes for in this life, but with life it self. He that is so great a Fool to be an Atheist, would yet be much more so to be a Martyr for his opinion. What is there could recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the loss of life, to a man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that there is nothing after it? But supposing there should be a life to come, as it is impossible to give any demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration to the contrary, what madness would it be, for a man to run himself into the miseries of another world with a design to prove there is none? If all that our Saviour had meant, were only to represent the folly of a person, that would lay down his life for the purchase of an estate, (for so the soul is often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the life) that would not have reached the scope and design of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. And no instances can be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of such a kind of folly, which would be as great as for a man to lose his head for a wager, or to purchase the lease of his life by destroying himself. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing this to be a Proverbial speech, yet the folly of losing a mans life for the gain of the whole world is not brought in by our Saviour meerly for it self: but as it doth much more represent the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable folly of such who for the love
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:101601:244"/>
of this world will venture the loss of all eternal life, and enduring all the misery which is consequent upon it. If that man would gain nothing by his bargain but the reputation of a Fool, that for the possession of the whole world for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, would be content to be killed in the next; how much greater folly are they guilty of, that for the sake of this world and the preservation of their lives here, expose themselves to all the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of another life, which God hath threatned or their souls can undergo? It is such a loss of the soul which is here spoken of, as is consistent with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of this present life; <hi>for whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>will save his life shall lose it</hi>; and to those words before, those of the text have a particular reference, and therefore must be understood not of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this life, but of the loss of the Soul in a future state.</p>
            <p>And this loss cannot be understood of the souls annhilation or ceasing to be, as soon as the life is gone; for that being supposed, he would be the happiest man that had the most of this world at his command and enjoyed the greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in it. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself determines, that if there were no future state, the
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:101601:244"/>
Epicureans argument would take place, <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>2.</note> 
               <hi>Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die:</hi> and he reckons those among the most miserable of all mankind who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured the loss of all that is accounted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable in this world and of their lives too, if there were not a better life to come. <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.19.</note> 
               <hi>For if in this life only we have hope in Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>we are of all men the most miserable.</hi> So that the strength of our Saviour's discourse depends upon the supposition of the immortality of the soul, and its capacity of being happy or miserable in a future state.</p>
            <p>And it is the great commendation of the Christian Religion, that the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar duties required in it are established on the same Foundations that natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, which are the belief of a Deity and the immortality of the Soul. <note n="(c)" place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> 
               <hi>For he that comes unto God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek him</hi>; which being spoken with a respect to one who for being good was translated out of this world, must refer to the rewards of a future life. And we desire no more than these common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion to make the most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> duties of Christianity appear rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to mankind. For it is upon the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:101601:245"/>
account of this future state of the soul, that it is our most just and necessary care to look after the welfare of our souls in the first place, <hi>to seek the Kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof,</hi> before the concernments of this present life, because a state that endures for ever ought to be preferred before a short and uncertain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in this world. It is this, which makes it reasonable to please God, though to the displeasing our selves and the crossing our natural inclinations; because eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and misery depends upon his favour or displeasure. It is this, which obliges men to the greatest care of their actions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their future state in another world, will be according to their lives here, for <hi>every man shall then receive according to his works.</hi> It is this, which ought to keep men from all fleshly lusts, not meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are inconvenient for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but <hi>because they war against their souls.</hi> It is this, which makes the love of this world so dangerous a thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it draws away the hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of men from things which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and fixes them upon things below. It is this, which make it necessary for us to subdue our passions, to conquer temptations, to forgive injuries, to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:101601:245"/>
under afflictions, and to lay down our lives for Religion, because <hi>there will be a reward for the righteous,</hi> and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of another state will make abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant recompence for all the difficulties of this.</p>
            <p>So that in the Gospel the doctrine of the souls immortality is not spoken of as the nice speculation of subtile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative men; nor meerly suposed as a foundation of all Religion, but it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven in the substance of it, and adds strength to all its parts. For herein we find the immortality of the soul not barely asserted, nor proved by uncertain arguments, nor depending on the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Philosophers; but delivered with the greatest authority, revealed with the clearest light, and confirmed by the strongest evidence. If any one can make known to mankind the state of souls in another world it must be God himself; if ever it was made known plainly by him it must be in the Gospel, whereby <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.10.</note> 
               <hi>life and immortality are brought to light</hi>; if ever any arguments were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to convince mankind of it, they are such as are contained therein. For it is not barely the resurrection of our Lord, which is a manifest evidence of the truth
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:101601:246"/>
of the souls subsisting a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er a real death; but the whole design of his doctrine and the Christian Religion is built upon it. So that if we suppose the immortality of the soul the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion appears more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by it; but if we suppose the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ to be true there can be no doubt left of the immortality of the soul; and whatever arguments we have to prove the truth of this doctrine by, the same do of necessity prove the certainty of the souls immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
            <p>I confess many subtile arguments have been used by those who never knew any thing of divine revelation to prove the soul to be of such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it was not capable of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the body; and some of them such as none of their Adversaries were ever able to answer. For the most common acts of sense are unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a meer Mechanical way; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the attempts of the most wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and industrious men I despair of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seeing the powers of meer matter raised to a capacity of performing the lowest acts of perception; and much more of those nobler faculties of memory,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:101601:246"/>
understanding and will. But although the arguments from hence are sufficient to justifie the belief of the souls immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to all considering men; yet the far greatest part of mankind was never so; and a matter of so great consequence as this is, ought to be proposed in the most plain, most certain, and most effectual manner.</p>
            <p>While these disputes were managed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Philosophers of old, though those who asserted the immortality of the soul had the better reason of their side; yet their Adversaries spake with greater confidence; and that always bears the greatest sway among injudicious people. And some men are always fond of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for wit by opposing common opinions though never so true and useful: especially when they serve a bad end in it, and do thereby plead for their own impieties. But it cannot be denied, that those who were in the right did likewise give too great advantage to their enemies, partly by their own diffidence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust of what they had contended for, partly from the too great niceness and subtilty of their arguments, partly from the ridiculous fopperies which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained together with that of the souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:101601:247"/>
as the transmigration of them into the bodies of Brutes and such like. But the main disadvantage of all to the world was, that the immortality of the soul was rather insisted on as a Principle of Philosophy than of Religion. Some of the best of their arguments were such as made the souls of Brutes immortal as well as those of men; and those could not be imagined to have any great force on the lives of men, which would equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold for such creatures which were not capable of rewards and punishments in another life. But therein lies the great excellency of the doctrine of the souls immortality as it is discovered in the Gospel, not only that it comes from him who best understands the nature of souls, but is delivered in such a manner as is most effectual for the reformation of mankind. For the fullest account here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in given of it is by the rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of another life; and those not Poetically described by Fictions and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; but delivered with the plainness of truth, the gravity of a Law, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of a Judge, the authority of a Law-giver, the Majesty of a Prince, and the wisdom of a Deity. Wherein the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness described is such as the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:101601:247"/>
minds think it most desirable; and the misery so great as all that consider it, must think it most intolerable. And both these are set forth with so close a respect to the actions of this life, that every one must expect in another world, according to what he doth in this.</p>
            <p>How is it then possible that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the souls being in another state, could be recommended with greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to mankind, than it is in the Gospel? and what is there can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to take off the force of this, but the proving an absolute incapacity in the soul of subsisting after death? It is true, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the state of this intimate union and conjunction between the soul and body, they do suffer mutually from each other. But if the souls suffering on the account of the body, as in diseases of the brain, be sufficient to prove there is no soul; why may not the bodies suffering on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the soul, as in violent passions of the mind, as well prove that there is no body? It is not enough then to prove that the soul doth in some things suffer from the body; (for so doth the Child in the Mothers womb from the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of its Mother, yet very capable of living when separated from her) but
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:101601:248"/>
it must be shewed that the soul is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the body to prove it uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being without it.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, I shall now shew that there is nothing unreasonable in what the Scripture delivers concerning the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal state of the Souls of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to future rewards and punishments, because there are those things now in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as distinct from their bodies, which make them capable of either of them. And those are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they are capable of pleasure and pain distinct from the body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they have power of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their own actions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the souls of men are capable of pleasure and pain distinct from the pleasure and pain of the body. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pleasure and pain may be, there must be a capacity of rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, for a reward is nothing but the heightning of pleasure, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment an increase of pain; And if there be both these in men of which no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can be given from their bodies, there must be a nobler principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which we call the Soul, which is both the cause and the subject of them.

The transport of joy which <hi>Archimedes</hi> was in at the finding out his desired <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem,</hi> was a more certain evidence of the real pleasures of the mind, than the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was of the greatness of his wit. Could we ever think that men who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood themselves would spend so much time in lines, and numbers, and figures, and examining Problems and Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which depend upon them, if they found not a great delight and satisfaction in the doing of it? But whence doth this pleasure arise? not from seeing the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, or meer drawing the lines, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating the numbers, but by deducing the just and necessary consequences of one thing from another; which would afford no more pleasure to a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his soul, than a Book of <hi>Geometry</hi> would give to a Herd of Swine. It is the Soul alone which takes pleasure in
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:101601:249"/>
the search and finding out such Truths, which can have no kind of respect to the Body; it is that, which can put the Body out of order with its own pleasures, by spending so much time in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as may exhaust the Spirits, abate the vigour of the Body and hasten its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. And while that droops and sinks under the burden, the Soul may be as vigorous and active in such a consumptive state of the Body as ever it was before; the understanding as clear, the memory as strong, the entertainments of the mind as great, as if the Body were in perfect health. It is a greater and more manly pleasure, which some Men take in searching into the nature of these things in the world than others can take in the most voluptuous enjoyment of them; the one can only satisfie a bruitish appetite, while, it may be, something within is very unquiet and troublesom; but the other brings a solid pleasure to the mind without any regret or distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance from the Body. By this we see, that setting aside the consideration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the mind of man is capable of such pleasures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eculiar to it self, of which no account could be given, if there were not a spiritual and therefore immortal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:101601:249"/>
within us, not only distinct from the body, but very far above it. But the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry capacity of Religion in mankind doth yet further evidence the truth of it. I would fain understand how men ever came to be abused with the notion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as some men are willing to think they are, if there were not some faculties in them above those of sense and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? For where we find nothing else but these, we see an utter incapacity of any such thing as Religion is; in some brute creatures we find great subtilty and strange imitations of reason; but we can find nothing like Religion among them. How should it come to be otherwise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, if imagination were the highest faculty in man; since the main principles of Religion are as remote from the power of imagination as may be? What can be thought more repugnant to all the conceptions we take in by our senses, than the conception of a Deity and the future State of Souls is? How then come the impressions of these things to sink so deep into humane nature, that all the art and violence in the world can never take them out? The strongest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions upon all other Beings are such as are suitable to their natures, how come
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:101601:250"/>
those in mankind to be such as must be supposed to be not only above but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them if an immortal soul be not granted? If men had no principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them beyond that of sense, nothing would have been more easie, than to have shaken off the notion of a Deity and all apprehension of a future State: But this hath been so far from easie, that it is a thing utterly impossible to be done: all the wit and arts, all the malice and cruelty, all the racks and torments that could yet be thought on could not alter mens perswasions of the Christian Religion, much less raze out the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Natural Religion in the world. But what imaginable account can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the joys and pleasures, which the Martyrs of old expressed under the most exquisite torments of their bodies; if their minds were not of a far nobler and diviner nature than their bodies were? Although a natural stupidity and dulness of temper may abate the sense of pain, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though an obstinate resolution may keep men from complaining of it; yet, not only to bear the Cross but to embrace it; to be not only patient but pleasant under tortures; nay, to sing with greater joy in the flames than others do when they
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:101601:250"/>
are heated with wine, doth not only shew that there is something within us capable of pleasure distinct from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but that the pleasures of it may be so great as to swallow up the pains of the body. But I need not have recourse to such great and extraordinary instances, (although sufficiently attested by such who saw and heard them) for every good man hath that inward pleasure in being and doing good, which he would not part with for all the greatest Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism in the world. And where there is, or may be so great pleasure, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if there be likewise a sense of pain proportionable to it; witness those gripes and tortures of Conscience which wicked men undergo from the reflection upon themselves; when their own evil actions fill them with horror and amazement, when the cruelties they have used to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers return with greater violence upon their own minds, when the unlawful pleasures of the body prove the greatest vexation to their souls, and the weight of their evil actions sinks them under despair and the dreadful apprehensions of future misery. These are things we need not search Histories, or cite ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors for; every man's own Conscience
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:101601:251"/>
will tell him, if he hath not lost all sense of good and evil; that as there is a real pleasure in doing good, there is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est inward pain in doing evil. Having thus shewed that the soul of man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of pleasure and pain in this present state distinct from the body, it thence follows, that it is capable of rewards and punishments, when it shall be separated from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the souls of men have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of determining their own actions; without which there could be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable account given of the rewards and punishments of another life. Were I to prove liberty in man from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Religion I know no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more plain or more convincing than that which is drawn from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of future rewards and punishments: but being now to prove a capacity of rewards and punishments from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Liberty, I must make use of other means to do it by. And what can be imagined greater evidence in Beings capable of reflecting upon themselves, than the constant sense and experience of all mankind? Not that all men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in their opinions about these things; (for even herein men shew their liberty,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:101601:251"/>
by resisting the clearest evidence to prove it) but that every man finds himself free in the determining his moral actions. And therefore he hath the same reason to believe this, which he hath of his own Being or Understanding. For what other way hath a man to know that he understands himself or any thing else, but the sense of his own mind? and those who go about to perswade men that they think themselves free when they are not, may in the next place perswade them that they think they understand when they do not. Nay, they might hope in the first place to perswade men out of their Understandings, for we are not so competent judges of the more necessary and natural acts, for men understand whether they will or no, as of the more free and voluntary; for in this case eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man can when he pleases put a tryal upon himself, and like the confuting the arguments against motion by moving, can shew the folly of all the pleas for fatal necessity by a freedom of action But if once this natural liberty be taken away, wisdom and folly as well as vice and vertue would be names invented to no purpose; no men can be said to be better or wiser than others, if their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:101601:252"/>
do not depend on their own choice and consideration, but on a hidden train of causes which it is no more in a man's power to hinder than in the earth to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the falling of rain upon it. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sense and reason may prevail upon mankind, not to fancy themselves under invisible chains and fetters, of which they can have no evidence or experience; we may thence infer the soul's capacity of rewards and punishments in another life, since happiness and misery are set before them, and it must be their own voluntary choice which brings them to either of them: When either by their own folly they run themselves upon ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting ruine, or by making use of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of divine grace they become ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of endless Joy. But since men have not only a power of gorverning themselves, but are capable of doing it by considerations as remote from the things of sense as Heaven is from Earth; it is not conceivable there should be such a power within us, if there were not an immortal soul which is the subject of it. For what is there that hath the shadow of liberty in meer matter? what is there of these inferiour creatures that can act by consideration of future things, but
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:101601:252"/>
only man? Whence comes man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider but from his reason? or to guide himself by the consideration of future and eternal things, but from an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal principle within him; which alone can make things at a distance to be as present; can represent to it self the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite pleasures and unconceivable misery of an eternal state in such a manner as to direct the course of this present life in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the obtaining of the one and avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the other. And thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the supposition here made of the loss of the soul, and its immortality im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied therein.</p>
            <p>I come to consider the hazard of losing the soul for the gain of this world. For although our Saviour puts the utmost supposable case, the better to represent the folly of losing the soul for the sake of the world; yet he doth imply the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may be as great, although a man's ambition never comes to be so extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, as to aim at the possession of the whole world. The whole world can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make amends for the loss of the soul; yet the soul may be lost for a very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable part of it; although all the wealth and treasures of the <hi>Indies</hi> can never compensate to a man the loss of his
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:101601:253"/>
life, yet that may he in as great danger of losing upon far easier terms than those are. It is not to be thought that those whom our Saviour speaks to, could ever propose such vast designs to themselves as the Empire of the whole world was; but, he tells them, if that could be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, it were far more desirable to save a soul than to gain the world, yet such is the folly of mankind to lose their souls for a very small share of this present world. For the temptations of this world are so many, so great, so pleasing to mankind, and the love of life so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and so strong, that inconsiderate men will run any hazard of their souls for the gain of one or preservation of the other. The highest instance of this kind is that which our Saviour here intends, when men will make shipwrack of faith and a good conscience to escape the danger of their lives; or with <hi>Iudas</hi> will betray their Saviour for some present gain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though very far short of that of the whole world. And if I be not much mistaken, it is upon this account, that our Saviour pronounces it so hard <note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. 19.23, 24. Mark 10.24, 25. Luke 18.24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in such difficult times of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the account of Religion as those
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:101601:253"/>
were, such men would be shrewdly tempted to venture the loss of their souls in another world rather than of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states in this. For it was the young man's unwillingness to part with his great pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions to follow Christ, which gave him occasion to utter that hard saying. It is on this account St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.10.</note> 
               <hi>the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some have coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves through with many sorrows:</hi> It was on this account, <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Tim. 4.10.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> Demas <hi>forsook</hi> Paul, <hi>having loved this present world:</hi> and that <note n="(c)" place="margin">James 4.4.</note> 
               <hi>the friendship of this world is said to be enmity with God,</hi> and that our Saviour saith, <note n="(d)" place="margin">Matt. 6.24.</note> 
               <hi>no man can serve two Masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other; else he will hold to the one and despise the other; ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not serve God and Mammon.</hi> which doth suppose that these two doth require two contrary things at the same time; for if a hundred Masters did all require the same thing, a man might, in doing that, be said to serve them all. But when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion requires that we must part with all for that, and the world requires that we must part with Religion to preserve our interest in it, then it is impossible to serve
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:101601:254"/>
God and Mammon together; for we must hold to the one and despise the other.</p>
            <p>But what then? Is there no danger of the loss of the soul for the sake of this world, but only in the case of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? then, some may say, <hi>we hope there is no fear now of mens being too rich to go to Heaven.</hi> Thanks be to God that we live in times free from such dangerous tryals as those of persecution are, and wherein men may quietly enjoy their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and the best Religion in the world together: but although there be no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of splitting upon the rocks, there may be of sinking with being overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or springing too great a leak within us, whereby we let in more than we can be able to bear. And supposing the most prosperous and easie condition men can fancy to themselves here; yet the things of this world are so great occasions of evil, so great hindrances of good, that on these accounts men always run a mighty hazard of their souls for the sake of this world. The Devil knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough where his greatest strength lay, when he reserved the <note n="(a)" place="margin">Matt. 4.8, 9.</note> temptation of the glories of this world to the last place in dealing with Christ himself; when
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:101601:254"/>
nothing else would prevail upon him, he was yet in hopes that the Greatness and Splendour of this world would bring him to his terms. And surely if the Devil had not a mighty opinion of the power of these charms of <hi>the Kingdoms and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this world,</hi> he would never have put such hard terms to them which were no less than <hi>falling down and worshipping him:</hi> which we do not find he ever durst so much as mention before till he held this bait in his hand. And although our Saviour baffled him in this his strongest temptation, yet he still finds, that far less than what he here offered, will bring men in subjection to him. How small a matter of gain will tempt some men to all the sins of lying, of fraud and injustice? who pawn their souls and put them out at interest for a very small pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent advantage, although they are sure in a very little time to lose both their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and the Principal too.</p>
            <p>How many, for the sake of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Preferments of this World, are willing to do by their Consciences as the <hi>Indian</hi> did by his Letter, lay them aside till their business be done and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear no more of them! What poor and trifling things in this World,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:101601:255"/>
do men continually venture their souls for? As though all were clear gains which they could put off so dead a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity as the Salvation of their Souls for. How apt are such to applaud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for their own skill, when meerly by a little swearing, and lying, and cheating, things which cost them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a few words, they can defeat the designs of their Enemies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass their own! But how low is the rate of Souls fallen in the esteem of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as these are! If they had not been of any greater value, they had not been worth any ordinary man's, much less, the Son of God's laying down his life for the redemption of them. Is this all the requital men make him for the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail of his Soul, the wounds of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the bitterness of his Passion, to squander away those Souls upon any tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling advantages of this world, which he shed his most precious blood for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of? Whenever men are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to sin with the hopes of gain, let them but consider how much they undervalue not only their own Souls, but the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, and all that he hath done and suffered for the sake of the Souls of men: If there had been no greater
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:101601:255"/>
worth in our Souls, silver and gold would have been a sufficient price of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for them (for if men lose their Souls for these things, it is a sign they set a higher value upon them.) But God's justice was not to be bribed, his wrath against sin was not to be appeased by the greatest riches of this World, nothing but the inestimable blood of Christ would be accepted for the purchase of Souls; and when they are so dearly bought must they be cast away upon such trifles as the riches and honours of this World are, in comparison with them?</p>
            <p>These are men who lose their Souls upon design, but there are others so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of them, that they can play and sport them away, or lose them only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the custom to do so. With whom all the reasons and arguments in the world cannot prevail to leave off their sins, if it once be accounted a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to commit them. Yea, so dangerous things are fashionable vices, that some will seem to be worse than they are, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though few continue long Hypocritical in that way) that they might not be out of the fashion, and some will be sure to follow it (if not out-do it) though to the eternal ruine of their Souls. But
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:101601:256"/>
although all damn'd persons at the great day will be confounded and ashamed, yet none will be more ridiculously miserable than such who go to Hell for fashion-sake. What a strange account would this be at the dreadful day of judgment for any to plead for themselves, that they knew that chastity, temperance, sobriety and devotion were things more pleasing to God, but it was grown a Mode to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and they had rather be damned th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n be out of the fashion? The most charitable opinion we can have of such persons now, is, that they do not think they have any Souls at all; for it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious folly for men to believe they have Souls that are immortal, and yet be so regardless of them.</p>
            <p>Yet these who are vicious out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance are not the only persons who shew so little care of their Souls, what shall we say to those who enjoying the good things of this life, scarce ever do so much as think of another? Who are very solicitous about every little mode of attire for their bodies, and think no time long enough to be spent in the grand affairs of dressing and adorning their out-sides; but from one end of the year to the other never spend one serious
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:101601:256"/>

Their utmost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances are how to pass away their days with the greatest ease and pleasure to themselves; and never consider what will become of their souls when they come to die. Alas poor immortal souls! are they become the only contemptible things men have about them? All care is l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The very shew of Religion is looked on as a burden, what then do they think of the practice of it? The Devil himself shews a greater es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eem of the souls of men, than such persons do; for he hath been always very active and industrious in seeking their ruin, but is ready enough to comply with all the inclinations of the body, or mens designs in this world; nay he makes the greatest use of these as the most powerful temptations for the ruin of their souls; by all which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that, being our greatest enemy, he aims only at the ruin of that which is
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:101601:257"/>
of greatest value and consideration, and that is the thing so much despised by wicked men, <hi>viz.</hi> the soul. These do in effect, tell the Devil he may spare his pains in tempting them; they can do his work fast enough themselves, and destroy their own souls without any help from him. And if all men were so bent upon their own ruin, the Devil would have so little to do, that he must find out some other imployment besides that of tempting to divert himself with, unless it be the greatest diversion of all to him, to see men turned Devils to themselves. But are the temptations of this world so infatuating that no reason or considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can bring men to any care of or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their souls? we have no ground to think so, since there have been and I hope still are such, who can despise the glittering vanities, the riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, the pleasures and delights of this world when they stand in competition with the eternal happiness of their souls in a better world. And that not out of a sullen humour or a morose temper, or a discontented mind; but from the most prudent weighing and ballancing the gain of this world and the loss of the soul together. <hi>For what is a man profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:101601:257"/>
if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul or what shall he give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Which is the last particular, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the folly of losing the soul, though it were for the gain of the whole world. Which will appear by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the gain and the loss with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in these Four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The gain here proposed is at the best but possible to one; but the hazard of losing the soul is certain to all. And what folly is it for men to run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon so great and certain danger, for so uncertain gain, which never any man yet attained to, or is like to do it? our Saviour knew how hard a matter it was to set any bounds to the ambitious thoughts or the covetous designs of men: every step the ambitious man takes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gives him the fairer prospect before him; it raises his thoughts, enlarges his desires, puts new projects into his mind, which like the circles of water spread still farther and farther, till his honour and he be both laid in the dust together: The covetous person is never satisfied with what he enjoys, the more he gets, still the more he hopes for; and like the grave whither he is going, is always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:101601:258"/>
and always craving: Yet neither of these can be thought so vain as to propose no less to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves than the Empire or riches of the whole world. But our Saviour allows them the utmost, that ever can be supposed as to mens designs for this world; let men be never so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious or covetous, they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire no more than all the world; though they would have all this, yet this all would never make amends for the loss of the Soul. It is a thing pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that one person might by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees bring the whole world in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, but it is possible in so remote a degree that no man in his wits can be thought to design it. How small a part of the inhabited world have the greatest Conquerours been able to subdue! and if the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian</hi> Prince was ever so vain to weep that he had no more worlds to conquer, he gave others a just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to laugh at so much Ignorance which made him think he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered this. And to put a check to such a troublesome ambition of distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the world in others, how early was he taken away in the midst of
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:101601:258"/>
his vast thoughts and designs? What a small thing would the compass of the whole earth appear to one that should behold it at the distance of the fixed stars? and the mighty Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires which have made the greatest noise in the world have taken up but an inconsiderable part of the whole earth. What are then those mean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs which men continually hazard their souls for as much as if they aimed at the whole world? For we are not to imagine that only Kings and Princes are in any hazard of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their souls for the sake of this world; for it is not the greatness of mens condition, but their immoderate love to the world which ruins and destroys their souls. And Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and ambition do not always raign in Courts and Palaces, they can stoop to the meanness of a Cottage, and ruin the souls of such as want the things of this world as well as those that enjoy them. So that no state o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> condition of men is exempt from the hazard of losing the soul for the love of this world, although but one person can be supposed at once to have the possession of the whole world.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="506" facs="tcp:101601:259"/>2. The gain of this world brings but an imaginary happiness, but the loss of the soul a most real misery. It is easie to suppose a person to have the whole world at his command and not himself; and how can that man be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py that is not at his own command? The cares of Government in a small part of the earth are so great and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, that by the consent of mankind the managers of it are invested with more than ordinary priviledges by way of recompence for them; but what are these to the solicitous thoughts, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fears, the restless imployments, the uninterrupted troubles which must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the gain of the whole world? So that after all the success of such a mans designs, he may be farther off from any true contentment than he was at the beginning of them. And in that respect mens conditions seem to be brought to a greater equality in the world, because those who enjoy the most of the world do oft-times enjoy the least of themselves; which hath made some great Emperours lay down their Crowns and Scepters to enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the retirements of a Cloyster or a Garden. All the real happiness of
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:101601:259"/>
this world lies in a contented mind, and that we plainly see doth not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens outward circumstances; for some men may be much farther from it in a higher condition in this world, than others are, or it may be themselves have been, in a far lower. But if mens happiness did ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e from any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, that must be always agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their outward condition; but we find great difference as to mens content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in equal circumstances, and many times much greater in a private State of life, than in the most publick capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. By which it appears, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever looks like happiness in this world, depends upon a mans soul, and not upon the gain of the world; nay it is only from thence that ever men are able to abuse themselves with false notions and <hi>Idea</hi>'s of happiness here. But none of those shall go into another world with them; farewel then to all imaginary happiness; to the pleasures of sin, and the cheats of a deceitful world; then nothing but the dreadful apprehensions of its own misery shall possess that soul which shall then too late discern its fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and lament it when it is past reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Then the torments of the mind
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:101601:260"/>
shall never be imputed to melancholy vapours, or a disordered fancy. There will be no drinking away sorrows, no jesting with the sting of conscience, no playing with the flames of another world. God will then no longer be mocked by wicked men, but they shall find to their own eternal horrour and confusion, that <hi>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> He neither wants power to inflict, nor justice to execute, nor vengeance to pursue, nor wrath to punish; but his power is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible, his justice inflexible, and his wrath is insupportable. Consider now O foolish sinner that hast hitherto been ready to cast away thy soul upon the pleasures of sin for a season, what a wise exchange thou wilt make of a poor ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary happiness for a most real and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable misery. What will all the gain of this world signifie in that State whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are all hastening apace? What contentment will it be to thee then to think of all those bewitching vanities, which have betrayed thy soul into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable misery? Wouldst thou be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be treated with all the ceremonies of State and Greatness for an hour or two, if thou wert sure that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:101601:260"/>
after thou must undergo the most exquisite tortures and be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acked and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to death? When men neglect their souls and cast them away upon the sinful pleasures and gains of this world, it is but such a kind of airy and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical happiness; but the miseries of a lost soul are infinitely beyond the racks and torments of the body. It hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happened that the horrour of despair hath seized upon mens minds for some notorious crimes in this life, which hath given no rest either to body or mind, but the violence of the inward pains have forced them to put an end to this miserable life; as in the case of <hi>Iudas.</hi> But if the expectation of future misery be so dreadful, what must the enduring of it be? Of all the ways of dying we can hardly imagine any more painful or full of horrour than that of sacrificing their Children to <hi>Molock</hi> was among the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and Children of <hi>Amon</hi> where the Children were put into the body of a Brass Image and a fire made under it, which by degrees with lamentable shrieks and cryings roasted them to death; yet this above all others in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is chosen as the fittest representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miseries of another world,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:101601:261"/>
and thence the very name of <hi>Gehenna</hi> is taken. But as the joys of heaven will far surpass all the pleasure which the mind of a good man hath in this life; so will the torments of Hell as much exceed the greatest miseries of this world.</p>
            <p>But in the most exquisite pains of the body there is that satisfaction still left, that death will at last put an end to them; but that is a farther discovery of the unspeakable folly of losing the soul for the sake of this world, that</p>
            <p n="3">3. The happiness of this world can last but for a little time, but the misery of the soul will have no end. Suppose a man had all the world at his command, and enjoyed as much satisfaction in it as it was possible for humane nature to have; yet the very thoughts of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and leaving all in a short time, must needs make his happiness seem much less considerable to him. And every wise man would provide most for that State wherein he is sure to continue longest. The shortness of life makes the pleasures of it less desireable, and the miseries less dreadful: but an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less State makes every thing of moment which belongs to it. Where there is variety and liberty of change, there is
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:101601:261"/>
no necessity of any long deliberation before-hand, but for that which is to continue always the same the greatest consideration is needful, because the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry continuance of some things is apt to bring weariness and satiety with it. If a man were bound for his whole life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to converse only with one person without so much as seeing any other, he would desire time and use his best judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the choice of him. If one were bound to lie in the same posture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any motion but for a month together, how would he imploy his wits before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to make it as easie and tolerable as might be? Thus solicitous and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful would men be for any thing that was to continue the same although but for a short time here: But what are those things to the endless duration of a soul in a misery, that is a perpetual destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and everlasting death; always into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and yet must always be endured. A misery that must last when time it self shall be no more, and the utmost periods we can imagine fall infinitely short of the continuance of it. O the unfathomable Abyss of Eternity! how are our imaginations lost in the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it! But what will it then be to
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:101601:262"/>
be swallowed up in an Abyss of misery and eternity together? And I do not know how such an eternal State of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery could have been represented in Scripture in words more Emphatical than it is; not only by <hi>everlasting fire,</hi> and <hi>everlasting destruction,</hi> but by <hi>a worm that never dies,</hi> and a <hi>fire that never goes out;</hi> and the very same expressions are used concerning the eternal State of the blessed and the damned; so that if there were any reason to question the one, there would be the same to question the other also.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The loss of this world may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly recompenced, but the loss of the Soul can never be. <hi>For what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi> If a man runs the hazard of losing all that is valuable or desirable in this world for the sake of his Soul, heaven and eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness will make him infinite amends for it. He will have no cause to repent of his bargain that parts with his share in this evil world for the joys and glories that are above. They who have done this in the resolution of their minds, have before-hand had so great satisfaction in it, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 5.2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>that they have gloried in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and rejoyced in hopes of the glory of God;</hi> they have upon casting up their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:101601:262"/>
found, <note n="(a)" place="margin">8.18.</note> 
               <hi>that the sufferings of this present life are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the glory that shall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> because the afflictions they meet with here are <hi>but light and momentany,</hi> but that which they expected in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for them, <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.17.</note> 
               <hi>was an exceeding and an eternal weight of Glory.</hi> O blessed change! what life can be so desirable as the parting with it is on such terms as these? It was the hopes of this glorious recompence which inspired so many Martyrs to adventure for Heaven with so much courage, patience, and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the primitive times of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church. How do they look down from Heaven and despise all the vanities of this World in comparison with what they enjoy! And if they are sensible of what is done on earth, with what pity do they behold us miserable creatures, that for the sake of the honours, pleasures, or riches of this World venture the loss of all which they enjoy and thereby of their Souls too! Which is a loss so great, that no recompence can ever be made for it, no price of redemption can ever be accepted for the delivery of it. For even the Son of God himself who laid down his life for the redemption of Souls, shall then come from
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:101601:263"/>
heaven with flaming fire to take vengeance on all those who so much despise the blood he hath shed for them, the warnings he hath given to them, the Spirit he hath promised them, the reward he is ready to bestow upon them, as in spight of all to cast away those precious and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls which he hath so dearly bought with his own blood.</p>
            <p>Methinks the consideration of these things might serve to awaken our securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to cure our stupidity, to check our immoderate love of this world, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our desires of a better. Wherein can we shew our selves men more than by having the greatest regard to that which makes us men? which is our souls. Wherein can we shew our selves Christians better, than by abstaining from all those hurtful lusts which war against our souls, and doing those things which tend to make them happy? We are all walking upon the shore of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and for all that we know the next tide may sweep us away; shall we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sport and play or gather cockle-shells and lay them in heaps like Children, till we are snatched away past all recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? It is no such easie matter to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the losing our souls as secure sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:101601:263"/>
are apt to imagine. It was certainly to very little purpose that we are bid <note n="(a)" place="margin">Phil. 2.12.</note> 
               <hi>to work out our Salvation</hi> if lying still would do it; or <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> 
               <hi>to give all diligence about it,</hi> if none would serve the turn: <note n="(c)" place="margin">Matth. 7.14.</note> 
               <hi>or to strive to enter in at the straight gate,</hi> if it were so wide to receive all sinners. No: <note n="(d)" place="margin">Luke 13.24.</note> 
               <hi>Many shall seek to enter in and shall not be able;</hi> what then shall become of those that run as far from it as they can? Those, I mean, whom no intreaties of God himself, no kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Son, no not the laying down his life for their souls, no checks or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of their own consciences can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from doing those things which do without a speedy and sincere repentance exclude men from the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. O that men could at last be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to understand themselves and set a just value upon their immortal souls! How would they then despise the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, conquer the temptations, and break through the difficulties of this present world, and by that means fit their souls for the eternal enjoyment of that blessed State of souls which God the Father hath promised, his Son hath purchased, and the Holy Ghost hath confirmed.
