            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>When that mine did eyes see his face,</l>
                  <l>and that mine eares had heard his voyce,</l>
                  <l>His Love I fréely did embrace,</l>

                  <l>Had hée performed what was due,</l>
                  <l>then had I found true hearts content:</l>
                  <l>But hee, regardlesse of his vow,</l>
                  <l>which he did make to me before,</l>
                  <l>Hath thus in sorrow left me now,</l>
                  <l>my former follies to deplore.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Would I had never séene those eyes,</l>

                  <l>Did my poore heart with love surprize,</l>
                  <l>the power of love so me enchants.</l>
                  <l>I have no power to leave his love,</l>
                  <l>though with sterne hate he me pursue.</l>
                  <l>To him I will most constant prove,</l>
                  <l>though he be faithlesse and untrue.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I put my finger unto the bush,</l>
                  <l>thinking the sweetest Rose to find,</l>
                  <l>I prickt my finger to the bone,</l>
                  <l>and yet I left the Rose behind:</l>
                  <l>If Roses be such prickling flowers,</l>
                  <l>they must be gathered when tha're gréen,</l>
                  <l>But she that loves an unkind Love,</l>
                  <l>alas, she rowes against the streame,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Oh, would he but conceive aright,</l>
                  <l>the griefe that I for him sustaine,</l>
                  <l>He could not chuse but change his spight</l>
                  <l>to faithfull love, and leave disdaine.</l>
                  <l>I love to have him still in place,</l>
                  <l>his too long absence makes me mourne,</l>
                  <l>Yet he disdaines to sée my face,</l>
                  <l>and holds my company in scorne.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>It grieves my heart full sore to thinke,</l>
                  <l>that he whom I so dearely love,</l>
                  <l>Should thus refuse with me to drinke,</l>
                  <l>yet can my passion ne're remove:</l>
                  <l>Though he, I know, could wish my death,</l>
                  <l>so great is his inveterate hate,</l>
                  <l>Yet I could sooner lose my breath,</l>
                  <l>than see him wrong'd in name or state.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Ill haphad I to come in place,</l>
                  <l>where first I saw his tempting looke,</l>
                  <l>As soone as I beheld his face,</l>
                  <l>I <hi>Cupids</hi> prisoner straight was tooke:</l>
                  <l>And never since that fatall houre</l>
                  <l>I have enioyed one minutes rest,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then was I strucke with <hi>Cupids</hi> Dart,</l>
                  <l>then was my fancie captivated,</l>
                  <l>Then did I vow that still my heart</l>
                  <l>should rest with him though me he hated:</l>
                  <l>Then did he make a shew of love,</l>
                  <l>which did much more my heart enflame,</l>

                  <l>Great torments are prepar'd in Hell</l>
                  <l>for them that thus will sweare and lye.</l>
                  <l>Oh hadst thou never made a show</l>
                  <l>of love, thou hadst excus'd thy blame:</l>
                  <l>But thy false heart full well doth know</l>
                  <l>what oaths thy periur'd tongue did frame.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That obstacle that hinders me</l>
                  <l>is that which I suspect full sore:</l>
                  <l>His fruit growes on some other trée,</l>
                  <l>and he's seduced by some whore:</l>
                  <l>Or else he hath some other Lasse,</l>
                  <l>perhaps like me, a harmlesse Maid,</l>
                  <l>Whom he may bring to such a passe,</l>

                  <l>who never gave thee any cause:</l>
                  <l>Yet I am still resolv'd in mind,</l>
                  <l>never to breake God <hi>Cupids</hi> Lawes.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And if I never be thy wife,</l>
                  <l>(which is the thing I iustly claime)</l>
                  <l>I vow to live a single life,</l>
                  <l>and never thinke of Lovers game.</l>
                  <l>But why speake I of life, when death</l>
                  <l>doth every minute claime his due?</l>
                  <l>I cannot long retaine my breath,</l>
                  <l>having a Lover so untrue.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Let all true Lovers iudge aright,</l>
                  <l>in what a case poore soule am I:</l>
                  <l>Come gentle death, and worke thy spight,</l>
                  <l>for now I am prepar'd to dye:</l>
                  <l>O Heaven forgive my Love his wrong,</l>
                  <l>done unto me a Maiden pure,</l>
                  <l>Who for his sake must dye erelong.</l>
                  <l>for long my life cannot endure.</l>
